# Writing Custom Instructions & Agent Skills\n\n> **⚠️ Structural rules**: Do NOT rename, move, or delete instruction/skill files without updating the preamble table in `copilot-instructions.md`. Run `npm run lint:docs` to verify all cross-references. See pitfall #11.

This skill documents the file formats and conventions for VS Code Copilot custom instructions and agent skills, so you don't need to look up external documentation.

## `.instructions.md` Files (Scoped Instructions)

### File Format

```yaml
---
name: "Display Name"              # optional, defaults to filename
description: "Short description"  # optional
applyTo: "**/*.py"               # optional glob; if omitted, manual-attach only
---

# Markdown body with instructions
```

### `applyTo` Glob Syntax

- Single pattern: `"src/services/**"`
- Multiple patterns (comma-separated in a single string): `"**/*.ts,**/*.tsx"`
- Match all files: `"**"`
- If omitted, the instructions file is not applied automatically (user must attach it manually)
- Paths are relative to the workspace root

**Supported glob patterns:**

| Pattern | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `*` | All files in the current directory |
| `**` or `**/*` | All files in all directories |
| `*.py` | All `.py` files in the current directory |
| `**/*.py` | Recursively match all `.py` files |
| `src/**/*.py` | Recursively match `.py` files in `src/` |

### Storage Location

- **Workspace-level**: `.github/instructions/<name>.instructions.md`
- **User-level**: VS Code profile folder (syncable via Settings Sync)
- **Additional folders**: Configurable via `chat.instructionsFilesLocations` setting

### Relevant Settings

| Setting | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.useInstructionFiles` | Enable `.instructions.md` files |
| `chat.includeApplyingInstructions` | Auto-apply instructions with matching `applyTo` |

### When to Use

- General coding standards and conventions
- Language or framework-specific rules
- File-pattern-specific guidelines (e.g., all test files, all Vue components)
- Always-on or glob-matched context

---

## `SKILL.md` Files (Agent Skills)

### File Format

```yaml
---
name: my-skill-name              # required, lowercase with hyphens
description: "What this skill does and WHEN Copilot should use it"  # required
license: "MIT"                   # optional
---

# Markdown body with detailed instructions, steps, examples
```

### Key Differences from Instructions

| Aspect | Custom Instructions | Agent Skills |
|--------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Scope** | Always-on or glob-matched | Loaded on-demand when relevant |
| **Complexity** | Simple markdown guidelines | Folders with SKILL.md + optional scripts/resources |
| **Use case** | General coding standards | Specialized, repeatable tasks |
| **Selection** | Automatic by `applyTo` glob | Copilot decides based on `description` field |

### Storage Locations

- **Project skills**: `.github/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
- **Personal skills**: `~/.copilot/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`

The file **must** be named `SKILL.md` exactly. Each skill lives in its own directory whose name should be lowercase with hyphens and typically match the `name` frontmatter field.

### How Copilot Uses Skills

1. Copilot reads the `description` field of each available skill
2. Based on the user's prompt, it decides which skills are relevant
3. When chosen, the full `SKILL.md` content is injected into the agent's context
4. The agent follows those instructions using any scripts/examples in the skill's directory

### Relevant Settings

| Setting | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `chat.useAgentSkills` | Enable agent skills loading |

### When to Use

- Step-by-step recipes for specific tasks (e.g., "add a new API endpoint")
- Specialized debugging workflows
- Complex multi-file scaffolding patterns
- Any task where detailed, on-demand instructions are more appropriate than always-loaded context

---

## Root `copilot-instructions.md`

The file at `.github/copilot-instructions.md` is always loaded for all chat requests in the workspace. Use it for:
- Project overview and architecture
- Critical invariants that apply everywhere
- Build/run commands and common issues

Keep it focused — move file-specific details to scoped `.instructions.md` files.

Requires `github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.useInstructionFiles` to be enabled.

---

## Debugging

- **VS Code**: Right-click the Chat view → "Diagnostics" to see all loaded instruction files
- **`applyTo` not matching?**: Check that the glob pattern matches the file you're working on (relative to workspace root)
- **Skill not loading?**: Check that the `description` field clearly describes when it should be used
