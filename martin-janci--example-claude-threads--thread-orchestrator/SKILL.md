# Thread Orchestrator Skill

This skill provides orchestration capabilities for managing multiple Claude agent threads with git worktree isolation.

## When to Use

Activate this skill when the user wants to:
- Run multiple Claude agents in parallel with isolated worktrees
- Coordinate complex workflows across multiple threads
- Manage thread lifecycle (create, start, stop, resume)
- Handle inter-thread communication via events
- Monitor and manage PR feedback loops

## Core Capabilities

### Thread Lifecycle Management
- Create threads with different modes (automatic, semi-auto, interactive, sleeping)
- Create threads with isolated git worktrees
- Start, stop, pause, and resume threads
- Query thread status and view logs
- Delete completed threads

### Git Worktree Isolation
- Each thread can have its own isolated git worktree
- Multiple threads can work on different branches simultaneously
- Automatic worktree cleanup when threads complete
- Push changes from worktree to remote

### Event-Driven Coordination
- Publish events to the blackboard
- Subscribe to events from other threads
- Send direct messages between threads
- Share artifacts between threads

### PR Shepherd Integration
- Watch PRs with isolated worktrees
- Automatic CI failure detection and fix
- Review change request handling
- Worktree-per-PR isolation

## Essential Commands

### Thread Operations

```bash
# Initialize claude-threads in project
ct init

# Create a thread
ct thread create <name> --mode <mode> --template <template>

# Create thread with isolated worktree
ct thread create <name> --mode automatic --worktree
ct thread create <name> --worktree --worktree-base develop

# List threads
ct thread list [status]

# Start/stop/resume threads
ct thread start <id>
ct thread stop <id>
ct thread resume <id>

# View thread status and logs
ct thread status <id>
ct thread logs <id>
```

### Worktree Management

```bash
# List all active worktrees
ct worktree list

# Show worktree details
ct worktree status <id>

# Cleanup orphaned worktrees
ct worktree cleanup
```

### Orchestrator Control

```bash
# Start/stop orchestrator daemon
ct orchestrator start
ct orchestrator stop
ct orchestrator status
ct orchestrator restart
```

### PR Shepherd

```bash
# Watch PR with worktree isolation
ct pr watch <pr_number>

# Check status
ct pr status [pr_number]
ct pr list

# Stop watching
ct pr stop <pr_number>

# Run as daemon
ct pr daemon
```

### Event Operations

```bash
# List recent events
ct event list

# Publish event
ct event publish <type> '<json>'
```

## Thread Modes

| Mode | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| `automatic` | Fully autonomous background tasks |
| `semi-auto` | Autonomous with user approval for critical steps |
| `interactive` | Step-by-step user confirmation |
| `sleeping` | Scheduled or event-triggered tasks |

## Workflow Patterns

### Parallel Epic Development

```bash
# Create threads with isolated worktrees
ct thread create epic-7a --mode automatic --template bmad-developer.md --worktree --context '{"epic_id": "7A"}'
ct thread create epic-8a --mode automatic --template bmad-developer.md --worktree --context '{"epic_id": "8A"}'

# Start orchestrator
ct orchestrator start

# Monitor
ct thread list running
ct worktree list
```

### PR Fix Pipeline

```bash
# Watch PR - creates isolated worktree
ct pr watch 123

# Shepherd automatically:
# - Creates worktree for PR branch
# - Spawns fix threads when CI fails
# - Pushes fixes from worktree
# - Cleans up when PR merges

ct pr status 123
```

### Coordinated Review

```bash
# Create reviewer thread that triggers on development completion
ct thread create reviewer --mode semi-auto --template reviewer.md --trigger DEVELOPMENT_COMPLETED

# Events flow: STORY_COMPLETED -> DEVELOPMENT_COMPLETED -> reviewer wakes
```

## Event Types

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `THREAD_STARTED` | Thread began execution |
| `THREAD_COMPLETED` | Thread finished |
| `THREAD_BLOCKED` | Thread encountered a blocker |
| `WORKTREE_CREATED` | Isolated worktree created |
| `WORKTREE_PUSHED` | Changes pushed from worktree |
| `WORKTREE_DELETED` | Worktree cleaned up |
| `STORY_STARTED` | Developer starting story |
| `STORY_COMPLETED` | Story implementation done |
| `DEVELOPMENT_COMPLETED` | All stories finished |
| `REVIEW_COMPLETED` | Code review done |
| `PR_CREATED` | Pull request opened |
| `CI_PASSED` / `CI_FAILED` | CI status update |
| `PR_APPROVED` | PR approved |
| `PR_MERGED` | PR merged successfully |

## Configuration

In `.claude-threads/config.yaml`:

```yaml
threads:
  max_concurrent: 5
  default_max_turns: 80

orchestrator:
  poll_interval: 1
  idle_poll_interval: 10
  idle_threshold: 30

worktrees:
  enabled: true
  max_age_days: 7
  auto_cleanup: true
  default_base_branch: main
  auto_push: true

pr_shepherd:
  max_fix_attempts: 5
  ci_poll_interval: 30
  auto_merge: false
```

## State Locations

- Database: `.claude-threads/threads.db`
- Logs: `.claude-threads/logs/`
- Config: `.claude-threads/config.yaml`
- Templates: `.claude-threads/templates/`
- Worktrees: `.claude-threads/worktrees/`

## Error Handling

If a thread becomes blocked:

```bash
# Check status
ct thread status <id>

# View logs
ct thread logs <id>

# Resume manually
ct thread resume <id>

# Or restart
ct thread stop <id> && ct thread start <id>
```

## Best Practices

1. Use worktrees for parallel development to avoid conflicts
2. Start orchestrator before creating automatic threads
3. Monitor events for workflow progress
4. Use PR Shepherd for automatic CI/review handling
5. Clean up orphaned worktrees periodically
