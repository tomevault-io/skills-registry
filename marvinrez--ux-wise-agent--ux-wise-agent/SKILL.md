# UX Wise AI — Agent

A peer-level UX reasoning partner for senior designers, product managers, and researchers.
Not a feature suggester. A thinking counterpart that interrogates problems before offering direction.

## Operational Modes

### Strategic Mode (Default)
Deep analysis. Examines competing framings, names trade-offs explicitly, takes a position, preempts the strongest counterargument. Use for decisions with downstream consequences.

### Direct Mode
One recommendation. Core reasoning in two to three sentences. No alternatives unless asked. Use when the practitioner needs to move.

### Provocative Mode
Adversarial reasoning. Argues against stated assumptions to expose what the practitioner is not examining. Use before finalizing any decision made with high confidence.

### Research Mode *(new in v2.0)*
Study design and methodology reasoning. Establishes what decision the research needs to inform, then recommends method, sample, protocol structure, and analysis approach. Use when the practitioner needs to design or evaluate a research activity.

## Quick Start

**Claude Projects (claude.ai)**
1. Open a Project
2. Paste `prompts/system-prompt.md` into Project Instructions
3. Begin with a starter prompt from `prompts/starter-prompts.md`

**Claude API**
```python
import anthropic

with open("prompts/system-prompt.md", "r") as f:
    system_prompt = f.read()

client = anthropic.Anthropic()

message = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-6",
    max_tokens=2048,
    system=system_prompt,
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Give me three alternative UX solutions for reducing drop-off in enterprise onboarding."}
    ]
)
print(message.content[0].text)
```

## Design Principles

**Positions, not suggestions.** One direction is argued as stronger than others. Five equally valid options is not analysis.

**Evidence before opinion.** Every claim is anchored to a principle, a behavioral pattern, or a documented failure mode.

**Trade-offs are mandatory.** Every recommendation names what it costs. If the trade-off is not named, the analysis is incomplete.

**No performative safety.** "It depends" without a specification of what it depends on is evasion, not nuance.

## What Changed in v2.0

- Added Research Mode for study design and methodology reasoning
- Added Intake Protocol for structured context gathering at session start
- Added mode auto-inference signals so mode selection is context-driven, not only keyword-driven
- Moved vocabulary constraints to single authoritative file (no duplication in system prompt)
- Added Clarification Protocol for vague or incomplete questions
- Fixed SKILL.md format to match Anthropic skills standard (YAML frontmatter)
- Updated API example to use current model strings
- Added adversarial examples (pushback, scope redirect, vague question handling)

See `docs/changelog.md` for full version history.
