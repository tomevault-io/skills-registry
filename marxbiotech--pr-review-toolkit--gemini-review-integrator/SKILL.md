# Gemini Review Integrator

Integrate Gemini Code Assist review suggestions into the pr-review-and-document PR comment.

## When to Use

Invoke this skill when:
- A PR has both Gemini Code Assist reviews and a pr-review-and-document comment
- Need to consolidate all review feedback into a single location
- Want to track Gemini suggestions alongside Claude's PR review

## Workflow

### Step 1: Get PR Number and Verify Prerequisites (Cache-Aware)

```bash
PR_NUMBER=$("${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/get-pr-number.sh")
```

This uses the branch-to-PR-number cache (`branch-map.json`) with 1-hour TTL, falling back to GitHub API on cache miss.

If no PR exists, inform the user and stop.

Verify pr-review-and-document comment exists:

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/find-review-comment.sh "$PR_NUMBER"
```

If no review comment exists, inform the user to run `pr-review-and-document` skill first.

### Step 2: Fetch Gemini Code Assist Comments

Fetch all PR review comments (inline code comments):

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/fetch-gemini-comments.sh "$PR_NUMBER"
```

The script returns JSON with Gemini suggestions, including:
- `id`: Comment ID for deduplication
- `priority`: high, medium, or low
- `is_security`: Whether it's a security issue
- `is_outdated`: Whether the comment is outdated (code changed)
- `file`: File path
- `line`: Line number (null if file-level)
- `body`: Full comment body
- `suggestion`: Extracted code suggestion (if any)

### Step 3: Filter and Deduplicate

Apply filters to Gemini suggestions:

1. **Exclude outdated comments**: Skip comments where `is_outdated: true`
2. **Check existing integration**: Parse pr-review-and-document comment metadata for `gemini_integrated_ids`
3. **Skip already integrated**: Exclude comments whose IDs are in `gemini_integrated_ids`

### Step 4: Categorize Suggestions

Map Gemini priorities to pr-review-and-document categories:

| Gemini Priority | PR Review Category |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| `high` + `is_security` | 🔴 Critical Issues |
| `high` | 🟡 Important Issues |
| `medium` + `is_security` | 🟡 Important Issues |
| `medium` | 💡 Suggestions |
| `low` | 💡 Suggestions |

### Step 5: Format Integrated Suggestions

For each new Gemini suggestion, format as:

```markdown
<details>
<summary><b>N. ⚠️ [Gemini] Issue Title</b></summary>

**Source:** Gemini Code Assist
**File:** `path/to/file.ts:line`

**Problem:** Description from Gemini comment.

**Suggested Fix:**
```suggestion
code here
```

</details>
```

Key formatting rules:
- Prefix title with `[Gemini]` to identify source
- Use `⚠️` status indicator (pending review)
- Include `**Source:** Gemini Code Assist` line
- Preserve Gemini's suggestion code block if present

### Step 6: Update PR Review Comment

1. Fetch existing pr-review-and-document comment body
2. Parse metadata JSON from `<!-- pr-review-metadata ... -->` block
3. Update metadata:
   - Add `gemini_integrated_ids` array with newly integrated comment IDs
   - Increment issue counts in `issues` object
   - Update `updated_at` timestamp
4. Insert new Gemini issues into appropriate sections (Critical, Important, Suggestions)
5. Renumber existing issues to accommodate new entries

Pipe updated content to `cache-write-comment.sh` via `--stdin`:

```bash
echo "$UPDATED_CONTENT" | ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/cache-write-comment.sh --stdin "$PR_NUMBER"
```

This updates local cache and syncs to GitHub in one step, without temp files.

### Step 7: Report Integration Results

Summarize what was integrated:

```
Gemini Review Integration Complete:
- Found: X Gemini comments
- Outdated (skipped): Y
- Already integrated (skipped): Z
- Newly integrated: W
  - Critical: A
  - Important: B
  - Suggestions: C
```

## Metadata Schema Extension

The pr-review-and-document metadata is extended with:

```json
{
  "gemini_integrated_ids": [2726014213, 2726014217, ...],
  "gemini_integration_date": "2026-01-26T12:00:00Z"
}
```

This enables:
- Tracking which Gemini comments have been integrated
- Preventing duplicate integration across multiple runs
- Audit trail for integrated suggestions

## Gemini Comment Structure

Gemini Code Assist comments have these characteristics:

**Priority Indicators (in body):**
- `![high](...)` - High priority
- `![medium](...)` - Medium priority
- `![security-medium](...)` or `![security-high](...)` - Security-related

**Outdated Detection:**
- GitHub API field `position: null` indicates the code has changed
- These comments should be skipped as they may no longer apply

**Code Suggestions:**
- Enclosed in ````suggestion` blocks
- Should be preserved in integration

## Handling Multiple Gemini Review Rounds

Gemini may perform multiple review rounds on a PR. The integration handles this by:

1. **ID-based deduplication**: Each comment has a unique ID
2. **Cumulative tracking**: `gemini_integrated_ids` grows with each integration
3. **New comments only**: Only comments not in `gemini_integrated_ids` are processed

To re-integrate after Gemini runs another review:
1. Run this skill again
2. Only new comments will be added
3. Previously integrated comments remain unchanged

## Status Indicators for Gemini Issues

| Indicator | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| ⚠️ | Pending review (newly integrated from Gemini) |
| ✅ | Fixed / Resolved |
| ⏭️ | Deferred / Not applicable |
| 🔴 | Escalated to blocking |

Initial status for all Gemini integrations is `⚠️` (pending review).

## Example Integration

**Before (pr-review-and-document comment):**
```markdown
### 🟡 Important Issues

<details>
<summary><b>1. ✅ Some Claude-found issue</b></summary>
...
</details>
```

**After integration:**
```markdown
### 🟡 Important Issues

<details>
<summary><b>1. ✅ Some Claude-found issue</b></summary>
...
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>2. ⚠️ [Gemini] Suppress stderr hides errors</b></summary>

**Source:** Gemini Code Assist
**File:** `.claude/skills/pr-review-and-document/scripts/find-review-comment.sh:19`

**Problem:** Suppressing stderr with `2>/dev/null` can hide important underlying errors.

**Suggested Fix:**
```suggestion
  PR_NUMBER=$(gh pr view --json number -q '.number' || echo "")
```

</details>
```

## Validation Checklist
