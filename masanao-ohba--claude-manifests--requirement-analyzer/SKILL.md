# Generic Requirement Analyzer

A technology-agnostic skill for analyzing, categorizing, and documenting software requirements for any type of project.

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. Requirement Decomposition

Break down requirements into universal categories:

```yaml
Requirement Categories:
  Functional:
    - What the system must do
    - User interactions
    - Business logic
    - Data processing

  Non-Functional:
    - Performance targets
    - Security requirements
    - Usability standards
    - Reliability metrics

  Constraints:
    - Technical limitations
    - Business rules
    - Regulatory compliance
    - Resource boundaries
```

### 2. Requirement Analysis Framework

**Universal User Story Format:**
```yaml
User Story:
  as_a: [user role/persona]
  i_want: [feature/capability]
  so_that: [business value/benefit]

Acceptance Criteria:
  given: [initial context/state]
  when: [action/trigger]
  then: [expected outcome/result]
```

**Requirement Specification Template:**
```yaml
Requirement:
  id: REQ-[number]
  title: [brief description]
  type: functional|non-functional|constraint
  priority: must|should|could|wont
  description: [detailed description]
  rationale: [why this is needed]
  source: [stakeholder/document]
  acceptance_criteria:
    - [measurable criterion 1]
    - [measurable criterion 2]
  dependencies:
    - [related requirement ids]
  risks:
    - [potential risks]
  assumptions:
    - [underlying assumptions]
```

### 3. Priority Frameworks

**MoSCoW Method:**
```yaml
Must Have:
  - Critical for launch
  - System fails without it
  - Legal/regulatory requirement

Should Have:
  - Important but not vital
  - Workaround exists
  - High value for users

Could Have:
  - Desirable but not necessary
  - Nice to have
  - Can be postponed

Won't Have (this time):
  - Out of scope
  - Future consideration
  - Explicitly excluded
```

**Kano Model:**
```yaml
Basic Needs:
  - Expected by users
  - Causes dissatisfaction if missing

Performance Needs:
  - More is better
  - Linear satisfaction

Excitement Needs:
  - Delighters
  - Unexpected features
  - Competitive advantage
```

### 4. Requirement Quality Criteria

**SMART Requirements:**
```yaml
Specific:
  - Clear and unambiguous
  - Well-defined scope

  - Quantifiable success criteria
  - Testable conditions

Achievable:
  - Technically feasible

## Best Practices

1. **Stakeholder Engagement**: Involve all stakeholders early
2. **Clear Communication**: Use unambiguous language
3. **Measurable Criteria**: Define quantifiable success metrics
4. **Iterative Refinement**: Requirements evolve, plan for changes
5. **Traceability**: Maintain links from requirements to implementation
6. **Risk-Based Focus**: Prioritize based on risk and value
7. **Documentation**: Keep requirements current and accessible

## Universal Application

This skill can be applied to:
- Web applications
- Mobile applications
- Desktop software
- Embedded systems
- APIs and services
- Cloud platforms
- IoT solutions
- Enterprise systems
- Machine learning projects
- Any software development project

The skill adapts to project needs through configuration rather than modification, ensuring reusability across different technology stacks and domains.
