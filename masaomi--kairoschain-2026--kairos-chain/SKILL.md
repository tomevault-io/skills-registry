# KairosChain - Self-Amendment MCP Server Framework

KairosChain provides a layered skill architecture (L0/L1/L2) where skills can evolve, promote, and audit themselves with blockchain-backed auditability.

## Architecture

### Three-Layer System
- **L0 (Constitution/Law)**: Immutable safety rules and meta-governance. Changes require human approval and full blockchain recording.
- **L1 (Knowledge)**: Project knowledge in Anthropic skills format. Changes recorded with hash references.
- **L2 (Context)**: Temporary session context. Free modification, no blockchain recording.

### Core Capabilities

#### Knowledge Management
- `knowledge_list` / `knowledge_get` - Browse and read L1 knowledge skills
- `knowledge_update` - Create, update, or delete L1 knowledge with blockchain recording
- `context_save` - Save temporary L2 context for session work

#### Skill Evolution
- `skills_evolve` - Propose and apply changes to L0 skill definitions (requires human approval)
- `skills_rollback` - Version management with snapshot and rollback capabilities
- `skills_promote` - Promote knowledge between layers (L2→L1, L1→L0) with optional Persona Assembly

#### Blockchain Auditability
- `chain_status` / `chain_verify` - Check and verify blockchain integrity
- `chain_history` - View skill transitions, knowledge updates, and state commits
- `chain_record` - Record data to the blockchain
- `state_commit` - Create snapshots of all layers for auditability

#### Health & Safety
- `skills_audit` - Audit knowledge health across layers (conflicts, staleness, dangerous patterns)
- `tool_guide` - Dynamic tool discovery and workflow recommendations

#### Persona Assembly
- Multi-perspective decision support using personas (kairos, conservative, radical, pragmatic, optimistic, skeptic)
- Available in `skills_promote` and `skills_audit` with `assembly_mode: "discussion"`

## Recommended Workflows

### Knowledge Lifecycle
1. Start with `context_save` for temporary work (L2)
2. When knowledge proves valuable, use `skills_promote` to move L2→L1
3. For mature patterns, promote L1→L0 with human approval

### Health Check
1. Run `skills_audit command="check"` for overall health
2. Use `skills_audit command="dangerous"` to check for safety issues
3. Review `skills_audit command="recommend"` for promotion/archive suggestions

### Skill Evolution
1. Use `skills_dsl_list` / `skills_dsl_get` to inspect current L0 skills
2. Propose changes with `skills_evolve command="propose"`
3. Apply with human approval via `skills_evolve command="apply"`
