# Plan-First Development

Break complex projects into detailed multi-phase plans before writing any code. Prevents scope creep, refactoring waste, and missed requirements.

## When to use

- Starting any project with >1000 lines of code
- Building systems with multiple interacting components
- Performance-critical applications (HFT, real-time, embedded)
- Projects where requirements are complex but knowable upfront
- When multiple developers need coordination

## When NOT to use

- Exploratory prototypes where requirements are unknown
- Trivial scripts (<100 lines)
- Already well-understood patterns (CRUD apps)
- Research projects where discovery is the goal

## Instructions

### Step 1: Define Project Scope

Create a project overview document with:

```markdown
# [Project Name] - Implementation Plan

## Overview
[2-3 sentence description]

## Core Constraints
- ❌ [What we CANNOT use/do]
- ✅ [What we MUST use/do]

## Success Criteria
- [ ] [Measurable outcome 1]
- [ ] [Measurable outcome 2]
- [ ] [Performance target, if applicable]
```

### Step 2: Break Into Phases

Divide project into 5-10 sequential phases. Each phase should:
- Build on previous phases (dependencies clear)
- Have concrete deliverable (working code + tests)
- Take 1-4 hours to complete
- Be independently testable

**Template:**
```markdown
### Phase N: [Component Name]

**Objective**: [What are we building?]

**Files to create:**
- `path/to/file1.ext` - [Purpose]
- `path/to/file2.ext` - [Purpose]

**Key implementation details:**
- [Technical decision 1 with rationale]
- [Technical decision 2 with rationale]

**Dependencies:**
- Requires Phase [X] to be complete
- Provides [Y] for Phase [Z]

**Testing strategy:**
- Unit tests: [What to test]
- Integration tests: [If applicable]
- Performance validation: [Targets]

**Success criteria:**
- [ ] [Specific measurable outcome]
- [ ] [Tests passing]
- [ ] [Performance target met]
```

### Step 3: Specify Data Structures

For each major type/struct/class:

```markdown
**[StructName]** (`src/module.rs`):
```[language]
struct/class definition with comments
```

**Key implementation details:**
- Size: [X] bytes (if fixed)
- Alignment: [Y] bytes
- Memory: [Stack/Heap]
- Special properties: [Copy, Send, Sync, etc.]

**Compile-time assertions:**
```[language]
// Size verification
// Alignment verification
```
```

### Step 4: Define Critical Paths

Identify hot paths (performance-critical code):

```markdown
## Critical Performance Paths

**Path 1: [Operation Name]**
- Entry point: `function_name()`
- Steps:
  1. [Operation 1] - Target: <X ns/µs/ms
  2. [Operation 2] - Target: <Y ns/µs/ms
- Total target: <Z ns/µs/ms
- Memory access pattern: [Sequential/Random/...]
- Constraints: [No heap allocation, No locks, etc.]
```

### Step 5: Create Verification Checklist

End plan with measurable validation:

```markdown
## Verification Checklist

### Correctness
- [ ] All unit tests passing (target: X tests)
- [ ] Property tests verify invariants
- [ ] Concurrency tests pass (if applicable)

### Performance
- [ ] Operation A: <X ns/µs (measured)
- [ ] Operation B: <Y ns/µs (measured)
- [ ] Throughput: >Z ops/sec (sustained)

### Code Quality
- [ ] No heap allocations on hot path (verified with profiler)
- [ ] Zero unsafe warnings
- [ ] Documentation complete

### Platform Support
- [ ] Builds on [Platform 1]
- [ ] Tests pass on [Platform 2]
```

### Step 6: Get Approval & Execute

1. **Review plan** - Share with team/stakeholders
2. **Refine** - Adjust based on feedback
3. **Lock & Execute** - No major scope changes during implementation
4. **Validate per phase** - Check success criteria after each phase

## Examples

### Example 1: Planning a Lock-Free Queue

**Good plan structure:**
```markdown
## Phase 1: Core Types
- `src/types.rs` - Element wrapper (32 bytes, repr(C))
- Compile-time size assertions
- Zero-copy serialization
- Tests: size, alignment, serialization round-trip

## Phase 2: SPSC Ring Buffer
- `src/ring.rs` - Single-producer, single-consumer queue
- Cache-line padded atomics (64 bytes)
- Power-of-two size for fast modulo
- Release/Acquire memory ordering
- Tests: push/pop, wrap-around, FIFO order, concurrent access (Loom)
- Target: <50ns per push+pop

## Phase 3: Benchmarking
- `benches/ring_bench.rs` - Criterion benchmarks
- Measure P50, P99, P99.9 latency
- Validate <50ns target met
```

**Why this works:**
- Phase 1 validates data layout before building on it
- Phase 2 completes core algorithm with tests
- Phase 3 verifies performance before adding features

### Example 2: Planning a REST API

```markdown
## Phase 1: Database Schema
- migrations/001_users.sql
- migrations/002_posts.sql
- Seed data for testing
- Tests: schema validation, constraints

## Phase 2: Repository Layer
- src/repositories/user.rs
- src/repositories/post.rs
- CRUD operations
- Tests: all operations, error cases

## Phase 3: Service Layer
- src/services/auth.rs (JWT)
- src/services/posts.rs (business logic)
- Tests: authorization, validation

## Phase 4: HTTP Handlers
- src/handlers/auth.rs
- src/handlers/posts.rs
- Tests: integration tests, E2E

## Phase 5: Performance & Security
- Benchmarks: target <10ms P99
- Security audit: SQL injection, XSS, CSRF
- Load test: 1000 req/sec sustained
```

## Best Practices

### ✅ Do

- **Write plan in markdown** - Easy to read, version control, share
- **Include "why" not just "what"** - Document rationale for decisions
- **Set measurable targets** - "Fast" → "<50ns P99 latency"
- **Phase dependencies clear** - Use arrows/diagrams
- **Test strategy per phase** - Don't leave testing to end
- **Review before coding** - 30 min planning saves hours debugging

### ❌ Don't

- **Don't plan implementation details** - Plan structure, not every function
- **Don't skip performance targets** - You'll optimize wrong things later
- **Don't make phases too large** - Max 4 hours each
- **Don't change plan mid-execution** - Finish phase, then reassess
- **Don't skip validation checklist** - How will you know you're done?

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: "I'll figure it out as I go"
**Problem:** Leads to refactoring entire codebase when you discover architectural mismatch

**Solution:** Spend 10-15% of project time on planning upfront

### Pitfall 2: Too much detail
**Problem:** Planning every function becomes maintenance burden

**Solution:** Plan modules/components, not individual functions

### Pitfall 3: Ignoring dependencies
**Problem:** Build Phase 5 before Phase 2, realize Phase 2 API doesn't work

**Solution:** Draw dependency graph, execute in topological order

### Pitfall 4: No performance targets
**Problem:** Build entire system, discover it's 10x too slow, no idea where bottleneck is

**Solution:** Set targets per phase, measure immediately

## Integration with Development Tools

### With GitHub Projects
- Create one issue per phase
- Label: `phase-1`, `phase-2`, etc.
- Each issue has checklist from success criteria

### With Git
```bash
# Branch per phase
git checkout -b phase-1-core-types
# ... implement & test ...
git checkout main
git merge phase-1-core-types

git checkout -b phase-2-ring-buffer
# ... etc
```

### With CI/CD
- Run tests after each phase merge
- Benchmark comparisons in PR comments
- Block merge if phase success criteria not met

## Measuring Success

### Indicators plan worked:
- ✅ Few/no major refactorings during implementation
- ✅ All tests written concurrently with code
- ✅ Performance targets met in final product
- ✅ Schedule variance <20% (planned vs actual time)
- ✅ Team members understand architecture

### Indicators plan failed:
- ❌ Constant "back to the drawing board" moments
- ❌ Tests written as afterthought
- ❌ Performance surprises at end
- ❌ Schedule blown (2x+ planned time)
- ❌ Confusion about component responsibilities
