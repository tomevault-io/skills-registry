# Midnight Deploy Guide

> **Source of truth**: `midnightntwrk/example-counter`

---

## Quick Overview — 3 Target Networks

| Network | Description | Start command (from `counter-cli/`) |
|---------|-------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Preprod** | Public testnet ✅ recommended | `npm run preprod-ps` |
| **Preview** | Public preview testnet | `npm run preview-ps` |
| **Standalone** | Fully local (Docker) | `npm run standalone` |

---

## Prerequisites

```bash
# Node.js v22.15+
node --version

# Docker with docker compose (for proof server / standalone)
docker compose version

# Compact toolchain
compact compile --version   # should be 0.30.0
```

### Install Compact toolchain (first time)

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf \
  https://github.com/midnightntwrk/compact/releases/latest/download/compact-installer.sh | sh
source $HOME/.local/bin/env
compact update 0.30.0
```

---

## Step 1: Build the Contract

```bash
cd contract
npm run compact    # Compile Compact → managed/ (ZK circuits + WASM)
npm run build      # TypeScript build → dist/
npm run test       # Verify tests pass
cd ..
```

Expected compact output:
```
Compiling 1 circuits:
  circuit "increment" (k=10, rows=29)
```

> First run downloads zero-knowledge parameters (~500MB, one-time only).

---

## Step 2: Run on Preprod (Recommended)

### Option A — auto-start proof server (simplest)

```bash
cd counter-cli
npm run preprod-ps
```

This pulls the proof server Docker image (`midnightntwrk/proof-server:8.0.3`), starts it, then launches the CLI.

### Option B — manual proof server

Terminal 1:
```bash
cd counter-cli
docker compose -f proof-server.yml up
# Wait for: INFO actix_server::server: starting service: "actix-web-service-0.0.0.0:6300"
```

Terminal 2:
```bash
cd counter-cli
npm run preprod
```

---

## Step 3: Create / Restore Wallet

The CLI uses a **headless wallet** (not a browser wallet like Lace).

```
[1] Create a new wallet   ← generates a 64-char hex seed
[2] Restore from seed     ← enter previously saved seed
```

**Save the seed** — it cannot be recovered if lost.

Your unshielded address is displayed:
```
  Unshielded Address (send tNight here):
  mn_addr_preprod1...
```

---

## Step 4: Get tNight from Faucet

Visit: `https://faucet.preprod.midnight.network/`

1. Paste your unshielded address (`mn_addr_preprod1...`)
2. Request tNight tokens
3. The CLI detects incoming funds automatically

> For Preview: `https://faucet.preview.midnight.network/`

---

## Step 5: Wait for DUST Generation

After receiving tNight, the CLI automatically:
1. Registers your NIGHT UTXOs for dust generation
2. Waits for DUST to appear

**DUST** is the non-transferable fee token required for all Midnight transactions.
It is generated over time from registered NIGHT UTXOs.

```
  ✓ Registering 1 NIGHT UTXO(s) for dust generation
  ✓ Waiting for dust tokens to generate
  ✓ Configuring providers
```

Once DUST is available, the contract menu appears:
```
  [1] Deploy a new counter contract
  [2] Join an existing counter contract
  [3] Monitor DUST balance
  [4] Exit
```

---

## Step 6: Deploy or Join

### Deploy new contract

Choose `[1]`. After proving + balancing + submission:
```
  ✓ Deploying counter contract
  Contract deployed at: <contract-address>
```

**Save the contract address** to rejoin in future sessions.

### Join existing contract

Choose `[2]`, enter the saved contract address.

---

## Step 7: Interact

```
  [1] Increment counter      ← submits a real tx
  [2] Display current value  ← reads from blockchain
  [3] Exit
```

---

## Standalone (Full Local Stack)

Runs the entire Midnight stack locally via Docker Compose.

```bash
cd counter-cli
npm run standalone
```

Docker images used (`standalone.yml`):
| Service | Image |
|---------|-------|
| Proof Server | `midnightntwrk/proof-server:8.0.3` |
| Indexer | `midnightntwrk/indexer-standalone:4.0.0` |
| Node | `midnightntwrk/midnight-node:0.22.3` |

Endpoints (standalone):
- Node: `http://127.0.0.1:9944`
- Indexer: `http://127.0.0.1:8088/api/v3/graphql`
- Proof Server: `http://127.0.0.1:6300`
- NetworkId: `undeployed`

---

## Network Endpoints Reference

```typescript
// Preprod
{ networkId: 'preprod',
  indexer: 'https://indexer.preprod.midnight.network/api/v3/graphql',
  indexerWS: 'wss://indexer.preprod.midnight.network/api/v3/graphql/ws',
  node: 'https://rpc.preprod.midnight.network',
  proofServer: 'http://127.0.0.1:6300' }

// Preview
{ networkId: 'preview',
  indexer: 'https://indexer.preview.midnight.network/api/v3/graphql',
  indexerWS: 'wss://indexer.preview.midnight.network/api/v3/graphql/ws',
  node: 'https://rpc.preview.midnight.network',
  proofServer: 'http://127.0.0.1:6300' }

// Standalone
{ networkId: 'undeployed',
  indexer: 'http://127.0.0.1:8088/api/v3/graphql',
  indexerWS: 'ws://127.0.0.1:8088/api/v3/graphql/ws',
  node: 'http://127.0.0.1:9944',
  proofServer: 'http://127.0.0.1:6300' }
```

---

## DUST Monitor

While waiting for DUST, choose `[3]` to monitor:

```
[10:20:03 PM] DUST: 471,219,000,000,000 (1 coins, 0 pending) | NIGHT: 1 UTXOs, 1 registered | ✓ ready to deploy
```

Status meanings:
- `accruing...` — DUST is generating
- `waiting for generation...` — UTXOs registered, DUST not yet arrived
- `no NIGHT registered` — need to fund wallet first
- `⚠ locked by pending tx` — restart the app to release locked coins

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| `compact: command not found` | `source $HOME/.local/bin/env` |
| `connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:6300` | Start proof server: `docker compose -f proof-server.yml up` |
| Proof server hangs on Mac ARM | Docker Desktop → Settings → General → Virtual Machine Options → Docker VMM |
| `Failed to clone intent` | Known wallet SDK bug — already worked around in example-counter |
| DUST balance 0 after failed deploy | Restart the app to release locked DUST coins |
| Wallet shows 0 balance after faucet | Wait for sync; check you sent to the unshielded address |
| `Could not find a working container runtime` | Start Docker Desktop |
| Tests fail with `Cannot find module` | Build first: `cd contract && npm run compact && npm run build` |

---

## Deploy Checklist

- [ ] Contract compiled: `cd contract && npm run compact && npm run build`
- [ ] Tests passing: `cd contract && npm run test`
- [ ] Docker running (for proof server)
- [ ] Proof server started (or use `*-ps` npm script)
- [ ] Wallet funded with tNight from faucet
- [ ] DUST generated (> 0)
- [ ] Contract address saved
