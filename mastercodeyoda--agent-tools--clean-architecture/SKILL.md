# Clean Architecture

A language-agnostic guide for implementing Clean Architecture principles with strict layer boundaries, vertical slicing,
and dependency inversion.

## When to Use This Skill

Activate this skill when:

- Starting a new Clean Architecture project
- Implementing features with clear layer separation
- Creating domain entities, value objects, or aggregates
- Building application layer use cases
- Designing repository patterns and gateways
- Validating layer boundaries and dependencies
- Learning or teaching Clean Architecture patterns
- Reviewing code for architectural compliance

## Quick Decision Tree

**"Where does this code belong?"**

Ask yourself these questions in order:

1. **Is it a business rule or core concept?**
    - YES → **Domain Layer**
    - Pure business logic, no external dependencies
    - Examples: Order, Customer, Money, OrderStatus
    - See: `references/layer-patterns.md#domain`

2. **Does it orchestrate business operations?**
    - YES → **Application Layer**
    - Coordinates domain objects, defines workflows
    - Examples: CreateOrderUseCase, ProcessPaymentUseCase
    - See: `references/layer-patterns.md#application`

3. **Does it connect to external systems?**
    - YES → **Infrastructure Layer**
    - Databases, APIs, file systems, email services
    - Examples: SqlOrderRepository, EmailGateway
    - See: `references/layer-patterns.md#infrastructure`

4. **Is it a user interface or entry point?**
    - YES → **Frameworks Layer**
    - HTTP endpoints, CLI commands, GUI, message handlers
    - Examples: OrderController, CreateOrderCommand
    - See: `references/layer-patterns.md#frameworks`

5. **Should I use separate packages/crates for layers?**
    - Team >3 developers OR project >6 months OR strict compliance needed → **Yes, use separate packages**
    - Prototype or small team → **Single package with module separation is fine**
    - See: `references/polyglot-projects.md#three-packagecrate-architecture`

## Core Architectural Rules

### The Dependency Rule (MANDATORY)

**Dependencies ALWAYS flow inward:**

```
[Frameworks] → [Infrastructure] → [Application] → [Domain]
  (outer)         (concrete)       (orchestration)   (pure)
```

**This means:**

- Domain knows nothing about outer layers
- Application knows only about Domain
- Infrastructure knows about Application and Domain
- Frameworks knows about all inner layers

**Never violate this rule.** Inner layers cannot import from, reference, or know about outer layers.

### Compile-Time Enforcement

For projects requiring strict compliance, **separate packages/crates** enforce layer boundaries at compile time:

- **Rust**: Separate crates (`project-domain`, `project-application`, `project-infrastructure`)
- **TypeScript**: Separate packages (`@project/domain`, `@project/application`)

The compiler itself prevents architecture violations - domain crate literally cannot import infrastructure. See `references/polyglot-projects.md` for multi-package patterns.

### Service Abstractions Placement

Service abstractions (repository interfaces, gateway protocols) belong in the **application layer**, colocated with use cases - not in a separate "ports" layer:

```
application/
└── workspace/
    ├── services.ts       # WorkspaceRepository interface + errors
    ├── initialize.ts     # InitializeWorkspaceUseCase
    └── create.ts         # CreateWorkspaceUseCase
```

This keeps abstractions close to their consumers and avoids the "ports vs adapters" naming confusion.

### Implementation Strategy: Vertical Slicing + Layer Sanctity

We combine two orthogonal principles:

**1. Vertical Slicing (WHEN to build)**

- Build ONE user story at a time, end-to-end
- Complete all layers for that story before moving on
- Priority-driven: P1 (MVP) → P2 → P3

**2. Layer Sanctity (HOW to build)**

- Maintain strict architectural boundaries
- Dependencies always flow inward
- Each layer has specific responsibilities

See: `references/vertical-slicing.md` for detailed workflow.

### Example: Building "Create Task" Feature

```
Story: As a user, I want to create a task

Implementation Order (Vertical):
1. Domain: Task entity with validation
2. Application: CreateTaskUseCase with Request/Response
3. Infrastructure: TaskRepository implementation
4. Framework: POST /tasks endpoint
5. Tests: All layers
✓ CHECKPOINT: Feature works end-to-end

Dependencies (Horizontal):
Domain ← Application ← Infrastructure ← Framework
(No reverse arrows allowed!)
```

## Core Concepts

### Entities vs Value Objects

**Entities:**

- Have unique identity (ID)
- Mutable state over time
- Equality by ID
- Example: Order, Customer, Product

**Value Objects:**

- No identity
- Immutable
- Equality by all attributes
- Example: Money, Address, DateRange

See: `references/core-concepts.md#entities-value-objects`

### Encapsulation Principles

1. **Default to private** - All attributes private unless justified
2. **Expose behavior, not state** - Methods over getters
3. **Controlled access** - Use properties when needed
4. **Protect invariants** - Never allow invalid state

See: `references/core-concepts.md#encapsulation`

### Use Cases and Application Services

Each use case should:

- Have single responsibility
- Define clear Request/Response models
- Orchestrate domain objects
- Be framework-agnostic
- Return domain-agnostic responses

Pattern:

```
UseCase + Request + Response = Single File
```

See: `references/layer-patterns.md#application-patterns`

## Language-Specific Implementation

Choose your implementation language for specific patterns, tools, and examples:

- **Python**: `languages/python/guide.md`
    - Type hints, dataclasses, protocols
    - Tools: mypy, ruff, pytest

- **TypeScript**: `languages/typescript/guide.md`
    - Branded types, Result pattern, domain events
    - Recommended: NestJS (backend), Next.js App Router (full-stack)
    - ORM: Prisma (default), Drizzle (alternative)
    - Tools: ESLint, Jest, Zod

- **C#**: `languages/csharp/guide.md`
    - Interfaces, dependency injection
    - Tools: .NET CLI, xUnit

- **Rust**: `languages/rust/guide.md`
    - Traits, ownership, Result pattern
    - Recommended: Axum (API), Tauri v2 (Desktop)
    - Tauri v2: Capabilities/ACL, tauri-specta bindings, events
    - Database: SQLx (default), Diesel (alternative)
    - Tools: Clippy, rustfmt, cargo-nextest, insta

- **Other Languages**: See `languages/README.md` for adding support

## Example Implementation: Task Manager

A complete, evolving example showing Clean Architecture patterns:

- Start: `example-task-manager/README.md`
- Domain patterns: `example-task-manager/domain.md`
- Application patterns: `example-task-manager/application.md`
- Infrastructure: `example-task-manager/infrastructure.md`
- Frameworks: `example-task-manager/frameworks.md`

The example starts simple (CRUD) and documents how to evolve it to handle:

- Authentication and authorization
- Complex business rules
- Event-driven patterns
- Performance optimization

## Validation and Quality Checks

### Architectural Validation

Check your implementation with language-specific validators:

**Python:**

```bash
python .claude/skills/clean-architecture/languages/python/validators/validate_imports.py
python .claude/skills/clean-architecture/languages/python/validators/validate_structure.py
```

**TypeScript:** Use compile-time enforcement via multi-package architecture (separate `domain/`, `application/`, `infrastructure/` packages with strict `tsconfig.json` project references) or ESLint with `eslint-plugin-boundaries` for single-package projects.

### Manual Review Checklist

Before committing code:

- [ ] Dependencies flow inward only
- [ ] Domain has no external dependencies
- [ ] Use cases are framework-agnostic
- [ ] Repositories return domain entities
- [ ] Controllers/endpoints are thin
- [ ] Business logic is in domain
- [ ] Tests mirror source structure

See: `templates/architecture-review.md`

## Templates and Workflows

### Quick Start Templates

    - Add application use case
    - Implement infrastructure
    - Create framework entry point
    - Write tests for each layer

3. **Validate architecture**
    - Run language-specific validators
    - Review dependency directions
    - Check encapsulation

4. **Checkpoint**
    - Feature works end-to-end
    - Tests pass
    - Architecture intact

See: `references/vertical-slicing.md`

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### Pitfall 1: Framework Logic in Domain

**Problem**: HTTP concerns, database logic in entities
**Solution**: Keep domain pure, move I/O to outer layers

### Pitfall 2: Anemic Domain Model

**Problem**: Entities with only getters/setters
**Solution**: Move behavior into entities, protect invariants

### Pitfall 3: Use Case Doing Too Much

**Problem**: Business logic in application layer
**Solution**: Push logic down to domain, orchestrate in application

### Pitfall 4: Skipping Layers

**Problem**: Controller directly accessing repository
**Solution**: Always go through use cases

### Pitfall 5: Shared Mutable State

**Problem**: Entities exposing collections directly
**Solution**: Return copies, use immutable value objects

See: `references/common-mistakes.md` for more anti-patterns.

## Testing Strategies

### Test Pyramid Approach

```
     /\      E2E Tests (Few)
    /  \     - Complete workflows
   /    \    - Happy paths only
  /------\   Integration Tests (Some)
 /        \  - Use cases with real repositories
/          \ - Infrastructure with databases
/------------\ Unit Tests (Many)
               - Domain logic isolation
               - Pure functions
               - No external dependencies
```

### Layer-Specific Testing

- **Domain**: Pure unit tests, no mocks needed — business logic is isolated by design
- **Application**: Test use case orchestration — see @test-strategy for mocking boundary guidance
- **Infrastructure**: Integration tests with real resources (test containers, test databases)
- **Frameworks**: E2E tests for critical paths

### Layer Boundary Enforcement by Language

Enforcement mechanisms vary by language. Audit agents should adjust expectations accordingly:

| Language | Primary Enforcement | Mechanism |
|----------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Rust** | Compile-time | Separate crates per layer — compiler prevents illegal imports |
| **TypeScript** | Lint-time | `eslint-plugin-boundaries` for single-package; multi-package workspace for strict enforcement |
| **C#** | Project-time | Separate `.csproj` per layer — build system enforces dependency direction |
| **Python** | Convention + review | Import discipline, `import-linter` optional — code review is primary enforcement |

For projects without compile-time enforcement, audit agents should flag layer violations more aggressively since there's no tooling safety net.

For testing methodology (strategy selection, assertion design, mocking philosophy), @test-strategy is authoritative. For *which* layer gets *which* test type, the Layer-Specific Testing section above applies — test-strategy owns *how* to test within each layer.

## When NOT to Use Clean Architecture

Be pragmatic. Skip Clean Architecture for:

- Simple CRUD apps with no business logic
- Prototypes and throwaway code
- Scripts and utilities
- Projects with <3 developers
- Short-lived projects (<3 months)

Use Clean Architecture when:

- Complex business rules exist
- Multiple teams collaborate
- Long-term maintenance expected
- Technology might change
- Testability is critical

## Getting Help

### Quick Troubleshooting

**"Where does X go?"** → Use decision tree above
**"Can A depend on B?"** → Check dependency rule
**"How to test X?"** → See testing strategies
**"Is this overengineered?"** → Check "When NOT to use"

- **test-strategy**: Testing strategy selection by architectural layer
- **workflow-guide**: Vertical slicing and implementation ordering

## Summary

Clean Architecture enables:

- **Independence**: Change frameworks without touching business logic
- **Testability**: Test each layer in isolation
- **Maintainability**: Clear boundaries reduce complexity
- **Flexibility**: Adapt to changing requirements

Remember:

- Dependencies flow inward
- Build vertically, maintain horizontally
- Start simple, evolve as needed
- Be pragmatic, not dogmatic

Start with the decision tree, follow the patterns, and validate continuously.
