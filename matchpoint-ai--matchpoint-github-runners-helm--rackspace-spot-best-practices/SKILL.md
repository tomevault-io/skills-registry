# Rackspace Spot Best Practices for ARC Runners

## Overview

This guide covers best practices for running GitHub Actions ARC (Actions Runner Controller) runners on Rackspace Spot Kubernetes. Rackspace Spot is a managed Kubernetes platform that leverages spot pricing through a unique auction-based marketplace.

## What is Rackspace Spot?

Rackspace Spot is the world's only open market auction for cloud servers, delivered as turnkey, fully managed Kubernetes clusters.

### Key Differentiators from AWS/GCP/Azure Spot

| Feature | Rackspace Spot | AWS EC2 Spot | Other Cloud Spot |
|---------|----------------|--------------|------------------|
| Pricing Model | True market auction | AWS-controlled floor price | Provider-controlled |
| Cost Savings | Up to 90%+ | 50-90% | 50-90% |
| Control Plane | Free (included) | $72/month (EKS) | $70-150/month |
| Interruption Notice | Managed transparently | 2 minutes | 2-30 seconds (varies) |
| Management | Fully managed K8s | Self-managed | Self-managed or managed |
| Lock-in | Multi-cloud capable | AWS-specific | Cloud-specific |
| Min Cluster Cost | $0.72/month | Much higher | Much higher |

### Rackspace Spot Architecture

```
GitHub Actions
      ↓
ARC (Actions Runner Controller)
      ↓
Kubernetes Cluster (Rackspace Spot)
      ↓
Spot Instance Pool (Auction-based)
      ↓
Rackspace Global Datacenters
```

**Key Features:**
- Cluster-API based Kubernetes control plane (deployed and managed)
- Auto-scaling node pools
- Terraform provider for IaC
- Persistent storage with transparent migration
- Built-in storage classes (SSD, SATA)
- Calico CNI with network policies
- Built-in load balancers

## Cost Optimization

### Understanding Rackspace Spot Pricing

**Market-Driven Auction:**
- Bid on compute capacity based on real-time supply and demand
- Visibility into market prices and capacity levels
- Even if you overbid, you only pay the market price
- Prices slide with the market automatically

**ROI Examples:**

| Configuration | Rackspace Spot Cost | AWS EKS Equivalent | Savings |
|---------------|---------------------|-------------------|---------|
| Control Plane | $0 (included) | $72/month | 100% |
| 2 t3.medium runners (24/7) | ~$15-30/month | ~$100-150/month | 75-85% |
| 5 t3.large runners (24/7) | ~$50-80/month | ~$300-400/month | 75-85% |
| Full ARC setup (2 min + scale to 20) | ~$150-300/month | ~$800-1200/month | 75-80% |

### Bidding Strategy for CI/CD Runners

**Best Practice Bidding:**

1. **Analyze Historical Capacity:**
   - View market prices in Rackspace Spot console
   - Check available capacity at different price points
   - Set bids based on predictable patterns

2. **Set Safe Bid Thresholds:**
   ```
   Conservative: Set bid at 50% of on-demand equivalent
   Balanced: Set bid at 70% of on-demand equivalent
   Aggressive: Set bid at 90% of on-demand equivalent
   ```

3. **Ensure Capacity Availability:**
   - Bid higher than floor to guarantee capacity
   - Even with high bids, you pay market price
   - For critical CI/CD, bid conservatively to avoid interruption

### Cost Optimization for ARC Runners

**minRunners Configuration:**

| Strategy | minRunners | Cost Impact | Use Case |
|----------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Zero Idle Cost | 0 | $0 when idle, 2-5 min cold start | Low-traffic repos, dev |
| Fast Start | 2 | ~$15-30/month, <10 sec start | Production, active repos |
| Enterprise | 5 | ~$50-80/month, instant | High-volume CI/CD |

**Recommendation for ARC on Rackspace Spot:**
- **minRunners: 2** provides best balance of cost and performance
- Cold start penalty eliminated (120-300 sec → 5-10 sec)
- Developer time saved >> marginal runner cost
- Rackspace Spot pricing makes this affordable

**Cost Comparison Example:**

```
AWS EKS with minRunners: 2
- Control plane: $72/month
- 2 t3.medium spot: ~$30-50/month
- Total: ~$100-120/month

Rackspace Spot with minRunners: 2
- Control plane: $0/month (included)
- 2 equivalent runners: ~$15-30/month
- Total: ~$15-30/month

Savings: 75-85%
```

## Handling Spot Instance Preemption

### Understanding Preemption on Rackspace Spot

**Key Differences:**

Unlike AWS/GCP/Azure where spot instances can be terminated with 2 minutes notice:
- Rackspace Spot manages preemption transparently
- Persistent storage migrates automatically during spot server recycling
- Built for stateful applications, not just batch processing
- Focus is on availability rather than interruption warnings

**User Testimonials:**
> "Running Airflow in Spot with fault-tolerant Kubernetes components means preemption wasn't a concern" - OpsMx case study

### ARC-Specific Preemption Considerations

**The Challenge:**

GitHub Actions jobs don't fit typical Kubernetes workload patterns:
- Cannot be safely terminated mid-job
- Job is lost if pod terminated before completion
- Each job needs dedicated resources (concurrency: 1)
- ARC autoscaler constantly scales runners up/down

**Best Practices for ARC on Spot:**

#### 1. Use Pod Disruption Budgets (PDBs)

```yaml
# pdb.yaml
apiVersion: policy/v1
kind: PodDisruptionBudget
metadata:
  name: arc-runner-pdb
  namespace: arc-beta-runners-new
spec:
  minAvailable: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app.kubernetes.io/component: runner
```

**Note:** PDBs protect against voluntary evictions (drains, upgrades) but NOT spot interruptions. However, Rackspace Spot's transparent migration may handle this better than traditional spot providers.

#### 2. Configure Do-Not-Disrupt Annotations (Karpenter)

If using Karpenter for node provisioning:

```yaml
# runner-template.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: runner
  annotations:
    karpenter.sh/do-not-disrupt: "true"
spec:
  # runner spec
```

**When this helps:**
- Prevents Karpenter from consolidating/evicting active runners
- Protects runners during cluster optimization
- Does NOT prevent cloud-level spot interruption

#### 3. Configure Tolerations for Spot Nodes

```yaml
# arc-runner-values.yaml
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      tolerations:
        - key: "spot"
          operator: "Equal"
          value: "true"
          effect: "NoSchedule"
      affinity:
        nodeAffinity:
          preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
            - weight: 100
              preference:
                matchExpressions:
                  - key: "capacity-type"
                    operator: In
                    values:
                      - spot
```

**Benefits:**
- Runners explicitly tolerate spot nodes
- Can prefer spot over on-demand for cost savings
- Can require spot for guaranteed spot pricing

#### 4. Set Graceful Shutdown Timeouts

```yaml
# arc-runner-values.yaml
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 300  # 5 minutes
      containers:
        - name: runner
          env:
            - name: RUNNER_GRACEFUL_STOP_TIMEOUT
              value: "300"
```

**Limitations:**
- AWS spot: Only 2 minutes warning
- GCP spot: Only 30 seconds before force termination
- Rackspace Spot: Transparent migration may make this less critical

#### 5. Diversify Node Pools

**Strategy: Mix of instance types**

```yaml
# Multiple instance types for availability
nodeSelector:
  node.kubernetes.io/instance-type: "t3.medium,t3a.medium,t2.medium"
```

**Benefits:**
- Reduces likelihood of capacity exhaustion
- If one instance type unavailable, others can scale
- Increases overall availability
- Lower interruption rate

### Rackspace Spot Advantages for ARC

**Why Rackspace Spot is Better for CI/CD:**

1. **Transparent Migration:**
   - Persistent storage migrates even if spot server recycled
   - Less disruptive than AWS 2-minute termination
   - Better for stateful workloads like CI/CD runners

2. **Managed Kubernetes:**
   - Control plane managed for you
   - Auto-healing built-in
   - Less operational overhead

3. **Auction Model:**
   - More predictable capacity
   - Can view availability before bidding
   - Less sudden interruptions

4. **Cost Efficiency:**
   - Free control plane saves $72/month minimum
   - True auction pricing (not artificial floor)
   - Can run persistent workloads affordably

## Resilience Strategies

### 1. Mixed On-Demand/Spot Strategy

**When to Use:**
- Critical production workloads
- Jobs that cannot tolerate interruption
- Compliance/regulatory requirements

**Implementation:**

```yaml
# Create separate runner scale sets
---
# Spot runners (most jobs)
apiVersion: actions.summerwind.dev/v1alpha1
kind: RunnerDeployment
metadata:
  name: spot-runners
spec:
  replicas: 2-20
  template:
    spec:
      nodeSelector:
        capacity-type: spot
      labels:
        - "self-hosted"
        - "linux"
        - "spot"

---
# On-demand runners (critical jobs)
apiVersion: actions.summerwind.dev/v1alpha1
kind: RunnerDeployment
metadata:
  name: ondemand-runners
spec:
  replicas: 0-5
  template:
    spec:
      nodeSelector:
        capacity-type: on-demand
      labels:
        - "self-hosted"
        - "linux"
        - "on-demand"
```

**Workflow Usage:**

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy-production.yml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: [self-hosted, linux, spot]  # Cost-effective

  deploy-production:
    runs-on: [self-hosted, linux, on-demand]  # Reliable
```

### 2. Topology Spread Constraints

**Spread pods across failure domains:**

```yaml
spec:
  topologySpreadConstraints:
    - maxSkew: 1
      topologyKey: topology.kubernetes.io/zone
      whenUnsatisfiable: ScheduleAnyway
      labelSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app.kubernetes.io/component: runner
```

**Benefits:**
- Prevents all runners in single availability zone
- If one zone loses capacity, others continue
- Increases overall availability

### 3. Namespace Isolation

**Best Practice: Separate namespaces for isolation**

```
arc-systems                 → ARC controllers
arc-beta-runners-new        → Org-level runners
arc-frontend-runners        → Frontend-specific
arc-api-runners             → API-specific
```

**Benefits:**
- Resource quotas per namespace
- Network policies for security
- Blast radius containment
- Independent scaling

### 4. Resource Quotas and Limits

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: runner-quota
  namespace: arc-beta-runners-new
spec:
  hard:
    requests.cpu: "40"
    requests.memory: "80Gi"
    pods: "25"
```

**Prevents:**
- Runaway scaling
- Resource exhaustion
- Cost overruns

## Monitoring and Observability

### Key Metrics for Spot Runners

**1. Runner Availability:**
```bash
# Check available runners
kubectl get pods -n arc-beta-runners-new -l app.kubernetes.io/component=runner

# Check scaling events
kubectl get events -n arc-beta-runners-new --sort-by='.lastTimestamp' | grep -i scale
```

**2. Spot Interruptions:**
```bash
# Track pod evictions/terminations
kubectl get events -A --field-selector reason=Evicted

# Check node status
kubectl get nodes -o wide | grep -i spot
```

**3. Job Queue Times:**
```bash
# GitHub Actions queue times
gh run list --repo Matchpoint-AI/project-beta-api --status queued --json createdAt,name

# Calculate average queue time
gh run list --json createdAt,startedAt,conclusion --jq '.[] | select(.conclusion != null) | (.startedAt | fromdateiso8601) - (.createdAt | fromdateiso8601)'
```

**4. Cost Tracking:**
```bash
# Via Rackspace Spot console
# - View real-time billing
# - Track instance hours
# - Compare bid vs actual prices paid
```

### Alert Thresholds

| Metric | Normal | Warning | Critical | Action |
|--------|--------|---------|----------|--------|
| Avg Queue Time | <30s | 30-120s | >120s | Check minRunners, scaling |
| Available Runners | 2+ | 1 | 0 | Scale up, check capacity |
| Pod Restart Rate | <1/day | 1-5/day | >5/day | Investigate interruptions |
| Failed Jobs % | <2% | 2-5% | >5% | Check resource limits, OOM |
| Spot Interruptions | 0-2/week | 2-5/week | >5/week | Review bid strategy, diversify |

## Configuration Best Practices

### Helm Values Structure

```yaml
# examples/beta-runners-values.yaml
githubConfigUrl: "https://github.com/Matchpoint-AI"
githubConfigSecret: arc-runner-token

minRunners: 2              # Keep 2 pre-warmed (RECOMMENDED for Rackspace Spot)
maxRunners: 20             # Scale to 20 for parallel jobs

runnerGroup: "default"

template:
  spec:
    containers:
      - name: runner
        image: summerwind/actions-runner:latest
        resources:
          limits:
            cpu: "2"
            memory: "4Gi"
          requests:
            cpu: "1"
            memory: "2Gi"

    # Spot tolerations
    tolerations:
      - key: "spot"
        operator: "Equal"
        value: "true"
        effect: "NoSchedule"

    # Node affinity for spot
    affinity:
      nodeAffinity:
        preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
          - weight: 100
            preference:
              matchExpressions:
                - key: "capacity-type"
                  operator: In
                  values:
                    - spot

    # Graceful shutdown
    terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 300
```

### Terraform Configuration

```hcl
# terraform/main.tf
module "cloudspace" {
  source = "./modules/cloudspace"

  name              = "matchpoint-runners-prod"
  region            = "us-east-1"
  kubernetes_version = "1.28"

  # Spot configuration
  node_pools = {
    spot_runners = {
      instance_type  = "t3.medium"
      capacity_type  = "spot"
      min_size       = 2
      max_size       = 20
      spot_max_price = "0.05"  # Bid price
    }
  }
}

# Get kubeconfig from spot provider
data "spot_kubeconfig" "runners" {
  cloudspace_id = module.cloudspace.cloudspace_id
}

output "kubeconfig_raw" {
  value     = data.spot_kubeconfig.runners.raw
  sensitive = true
}
```

**Getting Kubeconfig:**

```bash
# Always get fresh kubeconfig from terraform
export TF_HTTP_PASSWORD="<github-token>"
cd matchpoint-github-runners-helm/terraform
terraform init
terraform output -raw kubeconfig_raw > /tmp/runners-kubeconfig.yaml
export KUBECONFIG=/tmp/runners-kubeconfig.yaml
kubectl get pods -A
```

## Critical Configuration Issues

### ArgoCD releaseName vs runnerScaleSetName Mismatch (P0)

**Issue #112 Root Cause (Dec 12, 2025)**

When ArgoCD `releaseName` doesn't match `runnerScaleSetName` in values files, runners register with **empty labels**, causing all CI jobs to queue indefinitely.

**Symptoms:**
```json
{"labels":[],"name":"arc-beta-runners-xxxxx","os":"unknown","status":"offline"}
```

**Root Cause:**
- ArgoCD tracks Helm resources under `releaseName`
- ARC creates AutoscalingRunnerSet with `runnerScaleSetName`
- When mismatched, resource tracking breaks → broken registration → empty labels

**CRITICAL: These MUST match:**
```yaml
# argocd/apps-live/arc-runners.yaml
helm:
  releaseName: arc-beta-runners  # MUST match runnerScaleSetName!

# examples/runners-values.yaml
gha-runner-scale-set:
  runnerScaleSetName: "arc-beta-runners"  # MUST match releaseName!
```

**CI Validation Added:**
- `scripts/validate-release-names.sh` - Validates alignment
- `.github/workflows/validate.yaml` - Runs on PRs to prevent recurrence

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check runner labels
gh api /orgs/Matchpoint-AI/actions/runners --jq '.runners[] | {name, labels: [.labels[].name], os}'

# Run validation script
cd matchpoint-github-runners-helm
./scripts/validate-release-names.sh
```

**Fix:**
1. Align `releaseName` in ArgoCD Application with `runnerScaleSetName` in values
2. Update `ignoreDifferences` secret name (format: `{releaseName}-gha-rs-github-secret`)
3. Merge and wait for ArgoCD sync
4. Runners will re-register with proper labels

## Troubleshooting Spot-Specific Issues

### Issue: High Spot Interruption Rate

**Symptoms:**
- Frequent pod restarts
- Jobs failing mid-execution
- "Node not found" errors

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check pod restart counts
kubectl get pods -n arc-beta-runners-new -o json | jq '.items[] | {name: .metadata.name, restarts: .status.containerStatuses[0].restartCount}'

# Check node events
kubectl get events -A --field-selector involvedObject.kind=Node | grep -i "spot"
```

**Solutions:**
1. Increase spot bid price (more headroom)
2. Diversify instance types
3. Add on-demand pool for critical jobs
4. Review capacity availability in Rackspace console

### Issue: Spot Capacity Unavailable

**Symptoms:**
- Pods stuck in "Pending" state
- "Insufficient spot capacity" events
- Jobs queued but not starting

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check pending pods
kubectl get pods -n arc-beta-runners-new -o wide | grep Pending

# Check node status
kubectl describe node <node-name>
```

**Solutions:**
1. Increase spot bid in Rackspace console
2. Add multiple instance types to node pool
3. Temporarily use on-demand capacity
4. Check Rackspace Spot marketplace for capacity

### Issue: Transparent Migration Failing

**Symptoms:**
- Runner job fails during execution
- Storage not accessible
- Pod crash loops

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check persistent volumes
kubectl get pv,pvc -A

# Check pod events
kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n arc-beta-runners-new
```

**Solutions:**
1. Verify storage class configuration
2. Check volume mount paths
3. Ensure PV reclaim policy is "Retain"
4. Contact Rackspace support (managed service)

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Isolate Runner Namespaces

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: arc-beta-runners-new
  labels:
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce: restricted
```

### 2. Network Policies

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: runner-network-policy
  namespace: arc-beta-runners-new
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app.kubernetes.io/component: runner
  policyTypes:
    - Egress
  egress:
    - to:
        - namespaceSelector: {}
      ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 443  # HTTPS only
```

### 3. Service Account Permissions

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: arc-runner
  namespace: arc-beta-runners-new
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: arc-runner
  namespace: arc-beta-runners-new
rules:
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["pods"]
    verbs: ["get", "list"]  # Minimal permissions
```

### 4. Secrets Management

```bash
# Use GitHub secrets for ARC token
kubectl create secret generic arc-runner-token \
  --from-literal=github_token=$GITHUB_TOKEN \
  -n arc-beta-runners-new

# Seal secrets for GitOps
kubeseal --format=yaml < secret.yaml > sealed-secret.yaml
```

## Migration Guide: AWS EKS → Rackspace Spot

### Pre-Migration Checklist

- [ ] Document current EKS configuration (node groups, instance types, scaling)
- [ ] Export ARC runner configurations (Helm values)
- [ ] Identify all GitHub repositories using self-hosted runners
- [ ] Calculate current costs (EKS control plane + spot instances)
- [ ] Determine downtime tolerance for migration

### Migration Steps

1. **Set up Rackspace Spot Cloudspace:**
   ```bash
   cd matchpoint-github-runners-helm/terraform
   terraform init
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   ```

2. **Deploy ARC to Rackspace Spot:**
   ```bash
   # Get kubeconfig
   terraform output -raw kubeconfig_raw > /tmp/rs-kubeconfig.yaml
   export KUBECONFIG=/tmp/rs-kubeconfig.yaml

   # Deploy ARC controllers
   helm install arc-controller oci://ghcr.io/actions/actions-runner-controller-charts/gha-runner-scale-set-controller \
     -n arc-systems --create-namespace

   # Deploy runner scale sets
   helm install arc-beta-runners ./charts/github-actions-runners \
     -n arc-beta-runners-new --create-namespace \
     -f examples/beta-runners-values.yaml
   ```

3. **Parallel Testing Period:**
   - Run both EKS and Rackspace Spot in parallel
   - Route 10% of jobs to new runners (using labels)
   - Monitor for 1-2 weeks
   - Verify cost savings and reliability

4. **Gradual Migration:**
   - Week 1: 25% of repos to Rackspace Spot
   - Week 2: 50% of repos
   - Week 3: 75% of repos
   - Week 4: 100%, decomission EKS

5. **Cost Validation:**
   ```
   Before (EKS):
   - Control plane: $72/month
   - Spot instances: ~$200/month
   - Total: ~$272/month

   After (Rackspace Spot):
   - Control plane: $0/month
   - Spot instances: ~$50/month
   - Total: ~$50/month

   Savings: ~$220/month (81%)
   ```

## Kubeconfig Token Expiration (CRITICAL - Dec 13, 2025 Discovery)

### The Problem

Rackspace Spot kubeconfig JWT tokens expire after **3 days**. This causes:
- kubectl commands to fail with auth errors
- Misleading "no such host" DNS errors (actually token expiration)
- Agents unable to access cluster for diagnostics

### Verify Token Expiration

```bash
# Decode JWT to check when token expires
TOKEN=$(grep "token:" kubeconfig.yaml | head -1 | awk '{print $2}')
echo $TOKEN | cut -d. -f2 | base64 -d 2>/dev/null | python3 -c "
import json, sys
from datetime import datetime
payload = json.load(sys.stdin)
exp = datetime.fromtimestamp(payload['exp'])
print(f'Token expires: {exp}')
print(f'Expired: {datetime.now() > exp}')
"
```

### Solution: Scheduled Terraform Refresh

A GitHub Actions workflow (`refresh-kubeconfig.yml`) runs every 2 days to refresh the terraform state before the 3-day token expiration.

**How it works:**
1. Workflow runs `terraform refresh` with RACKSPACE_SPOT_API_TOKEN
2. Terraform's `data.spot_kubeconfig` fetches fresh token from Rackspace API
3. Fresh token stored in terraform state (tfstate.dev)
4. Users can get fresh kubeconfig via `terraform output`

**Reference:** Issue #135, PR #137

### Getting Fresh Kubeconfig

**Option A: From Terraform State (RECOMMENDED)**

The state is auto-refreshed every 2 days:

```bash
# Get GitHub token from gh CLI config
export TF_HTTP_PASSWORD=$(cat ~/.config/gh/hosts.yml | grep oauth_token | awk '{print $2}')

cd matchpoint-github-runners-helm/terraform
terraform init -input=false
terraform output -raw kubeconfig_raw > /tmp/kubeconfig.yaml
export KUBECONFIG=/tmp/kubeconfig.yaml
kubectl get nodes
```

**Option B: Manual Refresh (if token expired)**

If the scheduled workflow hasn't run recently:

```bash
# Requires RACKSPACE_SPOT_API_TOKEN
cd matchpoint-github-runners-helm/terraform
terraform refresh -var="rackspace_spot_token=$RACKSPACE_SPOT_API_TOKEN"
terraform output -raw kubeconfig_raw > /tmp/kubeconfig.yaml
```

**Option C: OIDC Context (interactive)**

The kubeconfig includes an OIDC context that auto-refreshes via browser login:

```bash
kubectl --kubeconfig=kubeconfig.yaml --context=matchpoint-ai-matchpoint-runners-oidc get pods
```

Requires: `kubectl oidc-login` plugin (`kubectl krew install oidc-login`)
