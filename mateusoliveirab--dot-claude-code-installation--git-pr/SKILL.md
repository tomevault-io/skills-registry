# Git PR

Prepares comprehensive PR content for manual creation. I prefer to open PRs manually because it's the moment I review and ensure everything is correct.

## Usage

```
/git-pr [target-branch]
```

Default target: `main`

## Why Manual PR Creation?

Opening PRs manually allows me to:
- Review all changes one final time before submitting
- Verify the PR title and description are accurate
- Check that only intended changes are included
- Ensure quality before sharing with the team

## Workflow

1. **Analyze branch**:
   ```bash
   scripts/pr-helper.sh analyze [target-branch]
   ```

2. **Generate PR content**:
   ```bash
   scripts/pr-helper.sh generate [target-branch]
   ```
   Creates complete PR description in the format below

3. **Review output**:
   - Read the generated title and description
   - Verify all sections are accurate

4. **Open PR manually**:
   - Go to GitHub/GitLab web interface
   - Use the generated title and description
   - Submit the PR

## PR Format

### Title
```
<type>: Brief description
```

Examples:
- `feat: add user authentication`
- `fix: resolve memory leak in parser`
- `docs: update installation guide`

### Description Template

```markdown
