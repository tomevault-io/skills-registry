# Diagnostic Meta-Analysis

This skill teaches meta-analysis of diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) studies, enabling synthesis of sensitivity, specificity, and other accuracy measures across multiple studies evaluating the same diagnostic test.

## Overview

Diagnostic meta-analysis differs fundamentally from intervention meta-analysis because it deals with paired accuracy measures (sensitivity and specificity) that are inherently correlated and subject to threshold effects. Specialized methods like bivariate models and SROC curves are essential.

## When to Use This Skill

Activate this skill when users:
- Want to pool diagnostic accuracy studies
- Ask about sensitivity, specificity, or likelihood ratios
- Need to create SROC (Summary ROC) curves
- Mention QUADAS-2 or diagnostic test quality
- Have 2x2 tables from diagnostic studies
- Ask about threshold effects or bivariate models

## Core Concepts to Teach

### 1. Diagnostic Accuracy Measures

**The 2x2 Table:**
```
                    Disease Status
                    +           -
Test Result  +     TP          FP      → PPV = TP/(TP+FP)
             -     FN          TN      → NPV = TN/(FN+TN)
                   ↓           ↓
              Sens=TP/(TP+FN)  Spec=TN/(FP+TN)
```

**Key Measures:**

| Measure | Formula | Interpretation |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| **Sensitivity** | TP/(TP+FN) | Probability of positive test given disease |
| **Specificity** | TN/(FP+TN) | Probability of negative test given no disease |
| **PPV** | TP/(TP+FP) | Probability of disease given positive test |
| **NPV** | TN/(FN+TN) | Probability of no disease given negative test |
| **LR+** | Sens/(1-Spec) | How much positive test increases disease odds |
| **LR-** | (1-Sens)/Spec | How much negative test decreases disease odds |
| **DOR** | (TP×TN)/(FP×FN) | Overall discriminative ability |

**Socratic Questions:**
- "Why can't we simply average sensitivities across studies?"
- "What happens to sensitivity when you lower the test threshold?"
- "Why might PPV vary dramatically across settings with the same test?"

### 2. The Threshold Effect

**Critical Concept:** Sensitivity and specificity are inversely related through the diagnostic threshold.

**Visualization:**
```
Sensitivity
    1.0 ┃●
        ┃ ●
        ┃  ●
        ┃   ●●
        ┃     ●●
        ┃       ●●●
    0.0 ┗━━━━━━━━━━━━━
        0.0         1.0
           1 - Specificity

Each ● = one study
Curve = SROC (Summary ROC)
```

**Why It Matters:**
- Different studies may use different thresholds
- Pooling sens/spec separately ignores this correlation
- Need methods that account for threshold variation

### 3. SROC Curves

**What is SROC?**
- Summary Receiver Operating Characteristic curve
- Shows trade-off between sensitivity and specificity
- Each study is a point; curve summarizes relationship

**Key SROC Elements:**
- **Summary point:** Best estimate of sens/spec
- **Confidence region:** Uncertainty around summary point
- **Prediction region:** Where future studies might fall
- **AUC:** Area under SROC curve (overall accuracy)

**Interpretation of AUC:**
| AUC | Interpretation |
|-----|----------------|
| 0.9-1.0 | Excellent |
| 0.8-0.9 | Good |
| 0.7-0.8 | Fair |
| 0.6-0.7 | Poor |
| 0.5-0.6 | Fail |

### 4. Statistical Models

**Bivariate Model (Reitsma et al. 2005):**
- Models logit(sens) and logit(spec) jointly
- Accounts for correlation between measures
- Estimates between-study heterogeneity for each
- Produces summary sensitivity and specificity

**HSROC Model (Rutter & Gatsonis 2001):**
- Hierarchical Summary ROC
- Models threshold and accuracy parameters
- Equivalent to bivariate under certain conditions
- Better for exploring threshold effects

**When to Use Each:**

| Situation | Recommended Model |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Summary sens/spec needed | Bivariate |
| Comparing tests at same threshold | Bivariate |
| Exploring threshold variation | HSROC |
| Few studies (<4) | Consider simpler methods |

### 5. Implementation in R

**Using mada package:**
```r
library(mada)

# Prepare data (2x2 table counts)
data <- data.frame(
  study = c("Study1", "Study2", "Study3", "Study4", "Study5"),
  TP = c(45, 52, 38, 61, 44),
  FP = c(8, 12, 5, 15, 9),
  FN = c(5, 8, 7, 9, 6),
  TN = c(92, 78, 100, 65, 91)
)

# Bivariate model
fit <- reitsma(data)
summary(fit)

# Summary operating point
summary(fit)$coefficients

# SROC plot
plot(fit, sroclwd = 2,
     main = "SROC Curve for Diagnostic Test X")
points(fpr(data), sens(data), pch = 19)

# Add confidence and prediction regions
plot(fit, sroclwd = 2, predict = TRUE)
```

**Forest Plots for Sens/Spec:**
```r
# Paired forest plot
forest(fit, type = "sens", main = "Sensitivity")
forest(fit, type = "spec", main = "Specificity")

# Or use madad for separate plots
madad(data)
```

**Using metafor for DTA:**
```r
library(metafor)

# Calculate logit sens and spec
data$yi_sens <- log(data$TP / data$FN)  # logit sensitivity
data$yi_spec <- log(data$TN / data$FP)  # logit specificity

# Variance (approximate)
data$vi_sens <- 1/data$TP + 1/data$FN
data$vi_spec <- 1/data$TN + 1/data$FP

# Bivariate model using rma.mv
# (More complex setup required - see metafor documentation)
```

### 6. Assessing Quality with QUADAS-2

**QUADAS-2 Domains:**

| Domain | Risk of Bias | Applicability |
|--------|--------------|---------------|
| Patient Selection | ✓ | ✓ |
| Index Test | ✓ | ✓ |
| Reference Standard | ✓ | ✓ |
| Flow and Timing | ✓ | - |

**Key Signaling Questions:**

**Patient Selection:**
- Was a consecutive or random sample enrolled?
- Was a case-control design avoided?
- Did the study avoid inappropriate exclusions?

**Index Test:**
- Were results interpreted without knowledge of reference?
- Was threshold pre-specified?

**Reference Standard:**
- Is the reference standard likely to correctly classify?
- Were results interpreted without knowledge of index test?

**Flow and Timing:**
- Was there appropriate interval between tests?
- Did all patients receive the same reference standard?
- Were all patients included in analysis?

### 7. Handling Heterogeneity

**Sources of Heterogeneity in DTA:**
1. Threshold variation (expected)
2. Population differences (disease spectrum)
3. Test execution differences
4. Reference standard variation
5. Study quality differences

**Investigating Heterogeneity:**
```r
# Meta-regression in bivariate model
fit_cov <- reitsma(data, 
                   formula = cbind(tsens, tfpr) ~ covariate)
summary(fit_cov)

# Compare models
anova(fit, fit_cov)
```

**Visual Assessment:**
```r
# ROC space plot - look for clustering
ROCellipse(data, pch = 19)

# If studies cluster in different regions,
# investigate sources of heterogeneity
```

### 8. Reporting DTA Meta-Analysis

**Essential Elements (PRISMA-DTA):**
1. Summary sensitivity and specificity with 95% CI
2. SROC curve with confidence/prediction regions
3. Heterogeneity assessment (visual and statistical)
4. QUADAS-2 quality assessment results
5. Subgroup/sensitivity analyses if applicable

**Example Results Section:**
> "The bivariate meta-analysis of 12 studies (N=2,450 patients) yielded a summary sensitivity of 0.85 (95% CI: 0.79-0.90) and specificity of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.87-0.95). The positive likelihood ratio was 10.6 (95% CI: 6.8-16.5) and negative likelihood ratio was 0.16 (95% CI: 0.11-0.24). The area under the SROC curve was 0.94, indicating excellent overall accuracy. Substantial heterogeneity was observed for sensitivity (I²=78%) but not specificity (I²=32%). QUADAS-2 assessment identified high risk of bias in patient selection for 4 studies due to case-control design."

## Assessment Questions

1. **Basic:** "Why can't we simply pool sensitivities using standard meta-analysis methods?"
   - Correct: Sensitivity and specificity are correlated; threshold effects create dependence

2. **Intermediate:** "What does the prediction region on an SROC curve represent?"
   - Correct: The region where we expect 95% of future studies to fall, accounting for heterogeneity

3. **Advanced:** "A diagnostic MA shows high sensitivity (0.95) but moderate specificity (0.70). How would you advise using this test clinically?"
   - Guide: Good for ruling out (high NPV when negative); positive results need confirmation; consider two-stage testing

## Common Misconceptions

1. **"Higher AUC always means better test"**
   - Reality: Clinical utility depends on where on the curve you operate; context matters

2. **"We should only include studies with the same threshold"**
   - Reality: Bivariate/HSROC models handle threshold variation; excluding studies loses information

3. **"Sensitivity and specificity are fixed properties of a test"**
   - Reality: They vary with threshold, population, and disease spectrum

## Example Dialogue

**User:** "I have 8 studies evaluating a rapid antigen test for COVID-19. How do I combine the results?"

**Response Framework:**
1. Acknowledge DTA-specific methods needed
2. Ask about data format (2x2 tables available?)
3. Discuss bivariate model approach
4. Guide through SROC curve creation
5. Emphasize QUADAS-2 quality assessment
6. Discuss clinical interpretation of results
