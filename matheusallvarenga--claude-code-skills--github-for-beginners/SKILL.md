# GitHub for Beginners - Complete Learning Skill

## Purpose

This skill transforms GitHub novices into self-sufficient users by providing clear explanations, practical commands, and solutions to common problems. It covers everything from foundational concepts through advanced workflows, evolving with the user's skill level.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:

- **Teaching Concepts**: Explaining Git, GitHub, branches, commits, PRs, or other core concepts
- **Guiding Workflows**: Helping users execute practical tasks (creating PRs, merging branches, etc.)
- **Debugging Problems**: Troubleshooting merge conflicts, undoing changes, or other errors
- **Answering Questions**: Clarifying what something means or why it works that way
- **Best Practices**: Advising on conventional workflows and standards

## How to Use This Skill

All procedural knowledge is organized in reference files for easy lookup and context management:

### Core References

**`references/git-basics.md`** - Foundational concepts and mental models
- Understanding Git vs GitHub distinction
- Key concepts: repositories, commits, branches, remotes
- Mental models and analogies for abstract ideas
- Philosophy and why these patterns exist

**`references/commands-reference.md`** - Complete command dictionary
- Organized by workflow and frequency of use
- Every command includes: what it does, common variations, when to use it
- Covers setup, daily work, branching, merging, undoing changes
- Examples for each command

**`references/workflows.md`** - Step-by-step procedures for common tasks
- Complete workflows for: making your first commit, creating a PR, merging code, etc.
- Multi-step processes broken down with explanations
- Integration with Claude Code workflow (since the user has this setup)
- Collaboration patterns and team workflows

**`references/troubleshooting.md`** - Common problems and solutions
- Organized by problem category (merge conflicts, undo operations, permission issues, etc.)
- Diagnostic questions to identify the problem
- Step-by-step solutions with explanations
- Prevention tips for future

**`references/claude-code-integration.md`** - GitHub + Claude Code
- How Claude Code works with GitHub (the user's current setup)
- Using @claude in issues and PRs
- Workflow for collaborative development with Claude Code
- Best practices for the GitHub App integration

### Using These References

When responding to a user question:

1. **Assess the question** - Determine which reference(s) contain relevant information
2. **Load references** - Read the appropriate sections from the reference files
3. **Apply knowledge** - Use the structured information to answer clearly
4. **Provide examples** - Give practical examples from commands-reference when relevant
5. **Connect concepts** - Link back to foundational understanding from git-basics

## Progressive Learning Path

The skill is designed for progression:

### Level 1: Novice (Current)
- Understanding core concepts
- Making first commit
- Creating branches
- Opening first PR
- Basic troubleshooting

### Level 2: Intermediate (Next)
- Advanced merge strategies
- Rebasing workflows
- Stashing and cleaning
- Complex troubleshooting
- Collaborating with teams

### Level 3: Advanced (Future)
- Advanced git workflows (gitflow, trunk-based)
- Performance optimization
- Custom git hooks
- Repository maintenance
- Mentoring others

## Key Principles

**Clarity Over Completeness**: Explain concepts clearly rather than covering every edge case upfront.

**Practical First**: Lead with practical examples and real commands before diving into theory.

**Progressive Disclosure**: Build knowledge layer by layer, not overwhelming with information.

**Student-Centered**: Acknowledge the user's current level and guide them appropriately.

**References as Sources of Truth**: Maintain detailed information in references for future expansion and reference.
