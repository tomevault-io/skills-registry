name: reviewing-code
description: Performs comprehensive code review covering quality, security, design, performance, technical debt, and intent alignment. Loads language-specific guardrails for Kotlin (.kt/.kts) and TypeScript/React (.ts/.tsx) when those files are touched. Use after implementing features or bug fixes, before commits, or when reviewing diffs. Use when this capability is needed.

Conduct comprehensive code reviews evaluating:

1. **Code Quality & Maintainability**
   - Readability and clarity of implementation
   - Adherence to language-specific idioms and conventions
   - Proper naming conventions and code organization
   - Method names that encode the lookup key and source (e.g., `findByTitle`, `existsByEmail`) rather than vague verbs (`get`, `process`, `check`)
   - Documentation quality and completeness
   - Inline WHY comments on non-obvious branches: feature-flag paths, migration/double-write states, recovery paths, intentional redundancy
   - Test coverage and test quality
   - Code duplication and opportunities for abstraction
   - Stale identifiers, comments, and JSDoc that no longer match the code's behavior after refactoring

2. **Security Vulnerabilities**
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - Authentication and authorization flaws
   - Injection vulnerabilities (SQL, XSS, command injection, etc.)
   - Cryptographic weaknesses
   - Sensitive data exposure
   - Insecure dependencies or outdated libraries
   - Race conditions and concurrency issues
   - Resource exhaustion and DoS vectors

3. **Design Patterns & Architecture**
   - Appropriate use of design patterns
   - SOLID principles adherence
   - Separation of concerns
   - Dependency management and coupling
   - Scalability considerations
   - Error handling and resilience patterns
   - Invariant enforcement at construction (constructor/factory/builder) rather than scattered defensive checks across call sites

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Algorithmic complexity analysis
   - Memory usage and potential leaks
   - Database query optimization
   - Caching opportunities
   - Network efficiency
   - Resource management (connections, file handles, etc.)

5. **Technical Debt Assessment**
   - Identification of shortcuts or workarounds
   - Code smells and anti-patterns
   - Outdated approaches or deprecated APIs
   - Missing error handling or edge cases
   - Silent fallbacks (`?: default`, catch-to-null, return-empty-on-error) that mask out-of-spec data — every fallback value needs a specific justification, not "better than crashing"
   - Scalability bottlenecks
   - Newly-added code with no caller in this change or existing codebase (YAGNI)
   - Code that becomes unreferenced within this PR but is not removed in the same PR
   - Commented-out code left in the diff
   - Shared-module utilities with only one import site (keep inline until a second caller exists)
   - Dead defensive code left over from a prior approach (conditions that can no longer occur)

6. **Intent Alignment**
   - Mismatches between PR description claims and the actual diff (missing implementations or unmentioned changes)
   - API openness that contradicts stated intent (e.g., overridable methods when the goal is unification)
   - Changes outside the PR's stated scope (request split or description update)

## Review Methodology

For each code review, you will:

1. **Initial Assessment**: Quickly scan the code to understand its purpose, scope, and context. Identify the primary language, framework, and architectural patterns in use. If the diff touches a language with a reference file under `references/` (see Language-Specific Expertise below), read that file before proceeding.

2. **Systematic Analysis**: Review the code methodically:
   - Start with high-level architecture and design decisions
   - Examine security-critical sections with extra scrutiny
   - Analyze performance-sensitive operations
   - Check error handling and edge cases
   - Verify test coverage for critical paths

3. **Prioritized Findings**: Categorize issues by severity:
   - **CRITICAL**: Security vulnerabilities, data loss risks, production-breaking bugs
   - **HIGH**: Performance issues, significant design flaws, major maintainability concerns
   - **MEDIUM**: Code quality issues, minor design improvements, technical debt
   - **LOW**: Style inconsistencies, documentation gaps, optional optimizations

4. **Constructive Feedback**: For each issue:
   - Clearly explain what the problem is and why it matters
   - Provide specific, actionable recommendations
   - Include code examples when helpful
   - Reference relevant documentation, standards, or best practices
   - Suggest alternative approaches when appropriate

5. **Positive Recognition**: Acknowledge well-implemented solutions, clever optimizations, or good practices. This reinforces quality patterns.

## Output Format

Structure your review as follows:

```
## Code Review Summary

**Overall Assessment**: [Brief 2-3 sentence summary of code quality and readiness]

**Severity Breakdown**:
- Critical: [count]
- High: [count]
- Medium: [count]
- Low: [count]

---

## Critical Issues

[List critical issues with detailed explanations and fixes]

## High Priority Issues

[List high priority issues with recommendations]

## Medium Priority Issues

[List medium priority issues with suggestions]

## Low Priority Issues

[List low priority issues and optional improvements]

## Positive Observations

[Highlight well-implemented aspects]

## Recommendations

[Provide strategic recommendations for improvement]
```

## Language-Specific Expertise

Adapt your review to the specific language's idioms, standard library, frameworks, security model, performance characteristics, and testing practices.

For languages with a reference file under `references/`, read the corresponding file and apply its guardrails **in addition to** the generic criteria above. These references capture recurring, project-specific review feedback that is not derivable from generic best practices.

- Kotlin (`.kt` / `.kts`) → read [references/kotlin.md](references/kotlin.md)
- TypeScript / React (`.ts` / `.tsx`) → read [references/frontend.md](references/frontend.md)

If the diff touches multiple languages, load every applicable reference. If no reference exists for the language, rely on general idioms.

## Quality Standards

- **Be thorough but focused**: Don't nitpick trivial style issues unless they impact readability
- **Be specific**: Vague feedback like "improve this" is unhelpful. Explain exactly what and how
- **Be educational**: Help developers understand the reasoning behind recommendations
- **Be pragmatic**: Balance ideal solutions with practical constraints
- **Be consistent**: Apply the same standards across similar code patterns

## Edge Cases & Escalation

- If code context is insufficient for proper review, request additional information about requirements, constraints, or system architecture
- If you identify potential security vulnerabilities, clearly flag them as CRITICAL and recommend immediate remediation
- If code appears to be generated or copied without understanding, suggest verification and testing
- If architectural decisions seem questionable, ask about the reasoning and constraints that led to them

## Self-Verification

Before completing your review:
1. Have you checked for common security vulnerabilities relevant to this language/framework?
2. Have you considered performance implications of key operations?
3. Have you verified error handling for failure scenarios?
4. Are your recommendations specific and actionable?
5. Have you acknowledged any well-implemented aspects?

Your goal is to elevate code quality while fostering developer growth. Every review should leave the codebase more secure, performant, and maintainable than before.
