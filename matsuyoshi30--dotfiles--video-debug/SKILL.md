# Video Debug Skill

Extract frames from screen recordings and analyze UI behavior chronologically to assist with debugging.

## Prerequisites

- `ffmpeg` must be installed (used for frame extraction)
- Video file must be one of the following formats: MP4, MOV, WebM, AVI, MKV

## Workflow

### 1. Retrieve Video Information

First, check the video metadata using `ffprobe`:

```bash
ffprobe -v quiet -print_format json -show_format -show_streams "<video_file_path>"
```

Information to check:
- Video duration
- Resolution (width x height)
- Frame rate (r_frame_rate)

### 2. Frame Extraction

Extract frames using `scripts/extract_frames.sh`:

```bash
bash <this_skill_directory>/scripts/extract_frames.sh <video_file_path> <output_directory> [fps]
```

**Frame extraction strategy:**

| Video Duration | Recommended fps | Expected Frames | Use Case |
|---------------|----------------|-----------------|----------|
| ~5 sec or less | 2 | ~10 | Short interactions |
| 5–30 sec | 1 | ~30 | Typical operation flows |
| 30 sec–2 min | 0.5 | ~60 | Longer operation sequences |
| Over 2 min | 0.25 | Variable | Extended recordings |

**Important:** Too many frames make analysis difficult. Keep it to around **60 frames maximum**.
For longer videos, lower the fps or ask the user which time range the issue occurs in
and narrow the range using `-ss` and `-t`.

### 3. Frame Analysis

Analyze the extracted frames **in chronological order**. Check from the following perspectives:

#### Tracking UI State Changes
- Timing and order of screen transitions
- Changes before and after button/link clicks
- Form input content and its reflection
- Modal/dialog show/hide behavior
- Loading state transitions

#### Bug Symptom Patterns
- **Layout breakage**: Overlapping elements, overflow, unnatural whitespace
- **Flickering**: Rapid display changes across consecutive frames
- **Unresponsive operations**: Expected changes not occurring after clicks
- **Error displays**: Error messages, red borders, warning icons
- **Blank screens**: Empty areas where content should be displayed
- **Infinite loading**: Spinner displayed for an extended period
- **Z-index issues**: Elements hidden behind other elements
- **Responsive breakage**: Inappropriate layout for the screen size

#### Performance Issue Indicators
- Number of frames between action and response (≈ delay time)
- Groups of frames where the same state persists (possible freeze)

### 4. Analysis Report Output

Summarize results in the following format:

```
## Video Analysis Report

### Overview
- Video: <filename>
- Duration: <seconds>
- Resolution: <width>x<height>
- Extracted frames: <count>

### Operation Flow Summary
1. [0:00 - frame_001] Initial screen displayed
2. [0:02 - frame_005] Button clicked
3. ...

### Detected Issues
#### Issue 1: <Issue summary>
- **Timing**: frame_XXX (approx. X:XX)
- **Symptom**: <What exactly is happening>
- **Affected area**: <Which part of the UI is affected>
- **Estimated cause**: <Possible cause in the code>
- **Suggested fix**: <Specific fix approach>
```

### 5. Cross-referencing with Source Code

If the user also provides source code:

1. Identify the component displayed in the problematic frame
2. Review the source of the relevant component
3. Investigate state management, event handlers, and rendering logic
4. Propose specific code fixes

## Analysis Techniques for Specific Scenarios

### Debugging Animations/Transitions
Extract at a high fps (4–5) and track changes between frames in detail.

### Detailed Analysis of a Specific Segment
```bash
# Extract at high fps for 5 seconds starting at the 3-second mark
ffmpeg -ss 3 -t 5 -i input.mp4 -vf "fps=4" output/frame_%04d.png
```

### Comparison with Screenshots
If the user has a screenshot of "how it should look",
place it side by side with the relevant frame and analyze the differences.

## Notes

- Extract all frame images in PNG format (JPEG degrades UI details)
- Use sequential numbering in frame filenames to preserve chronological order
- Always review multiple frames holistically during analysis; do not judge from a single frame
- If the user provides a description (e.g., "this part looks wrong"), focus analysis on that area
- Be aware that sensitive information (e.g., passwords) may be visible in the video
