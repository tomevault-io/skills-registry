# Technical Stack Selection

Make technology decisions for every capability your product needs — starting with what you already have, then evaluating what fits, then deciding what to build.

Position in workflow: v0.5 Risk Discovery Interview → **v0.5 Technical Stack Selection** → v0.6 Architecture Design

## Workflow Overview

1. **Discover Existing Assets** → Read SOT or interview user for current tech stack
2. **Categorize Layers** → Reuse / Extend / New / Replace for each capability
3. **Evaluate Vendor Fit** → Check preferred vendor catalog for New/Replace layers
4. **Evaluate Alternatives** → Research non-vendor options where vendor has gaps
5. **Check Product Family** → Shared infrastructure, component reuse, cross-product UX
6. **Create TECH- Entries** → Write entries using standard or reuse template
7. **Map to Risks** → Cross-reference every TECH- entry with RISK- constraints

## Decision Categories

| Category | Definition | When to Choose |
|----------|------------|----------------|
| **Reuse** | Existing asset covers this need as-is | Sibling product or prior work already solves this |
| **Extend** | Existing asset needs augmentation | Asset exists but needs new capabilities for this product |
| **Replace** | Existing asset doesn't fit, needs new solution | Current tool/service is wrong for this product's requirements |
| **Build** | Create custom solution | Core differentiator, no good alternatives, full control needed |
| **Buy** | Use paid service or managed product | Commodity capability, proven solutions exist, not a differentiator |
| **Integrate** | Connect to external platform or API | Ecosystem play, user expects it, data lives elsewhere |
| **Research** | Need POC before deciding | High uncertainty, multiple viable options, significant commitment |

**Evaluation order:** Reuse → Vendor-fit → Non-vendor alternatives → Build custom. Default to Buy for everything that isn't a core differentiator.

## Decision Framework

| Factor | Favors Reuse/Extend | Favors Buy (Vendor) | Favors Buy (Non-Vendor) | Favors Build |
|--------|---------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|--------------|
| **Existing asset** | Already deployed and working | Vendor has a product | Non-vendor product fits better | Nothing fits |
| **Differentiation** | Not relevant | Commodity capability | Commodity capability | Core to value prop |
| **Vendor alignment** | Already committed | Vendor product fits | Vendor has gap or poor fit | No vendor option |
| **Compliance** | Already compliant | Vendor product is compliant | Non-vendor has compliance cert | Must control compliance |
| **Team expertise** | Team already operates it | Managed service, less expertise needed | Team knows this tool | Team has deep knowledge |
| **Cost** | Sunk cost, incremental only | Reasonable vendor pricing | Better price/fit ratio | Long-term cost lower |

**Strong Reuse signals:**
- "We already run this for [sibling product]"
- "The team already operates and understands this"
- "Switching would cost more than keeping"

**Strong Build signals:**
- "This is why users choose us over competitors"
- "No existing solution fits our specific need"
- "We need to change this weekly based on learning"

**Strong Buy signals:**
- "Every product needs this"
- "Multiple proven solutions exist"
- "We'd just be recreating what vendors already built"

### Example Vendor Catalog (IBM Default)

Load `references/ibm-products.md` for the full catalog. Brief overview:

| Layer | Vendor Product | Fit Notes |
|-------|---------------|-----------|
| AI/ML | watsonx.ai | Foundation models, RAG, fine-tuning |
| AI Governance | watsonx.governance | Model monitoring, audit trails |
| Kubernetes | IBM Cloud Kubernetes (IKS) | HIPAA-ready, HITRUST certified |
| Database | IBM Cloud Databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, Elasticsearch) | HIPAA-ready, managed |
| Secrets | IBM Cloud Secrets Manager | Single-tenant Vault, HIPAA-ready |
| Messaging | IBM MQ, IBM Event Streams (Kafka) | Enterprise-grade, HIPAA-ready |
| Rules | IBM ODM | Decision management, rule execution |

When evaluating vendor products, check compliance certifications (HIPAA, SOC2, FedRAMP) against RISK- constraints before proceeding.

---

## Step 1: Discover Existing Assets

**Adaptive approach:** Check SOT first, then fill gaps with user interview.

**If TECH- entries exist in `SoT.TECHNICAL_DECISIONS.md`:**
Read existing entries. Present a summary to the user: "I found these existing technology decisions: [list]. Are these still current? Any changes since these were documented?"

**If SOT is empty (first time running this skill):**
Interview the user with these discovery questions:

1. "Does an existing product family exist with established technology choices?"
   - If YES → Load `references/brownfield.md` for asset discovery workflow
   - If NO → Proceed to Step 2 with all layers marked as "New"

2. "What is the current tech stack?" (ask per area)
   - Frontend framework and hosting
   - Backend language/framework
   - Authentication system
   - Database(s)
   - Cloud provider and infrastructure
   - CI/CD pipeline
   - Observability/monitoring tools

3. "Are there vendor constraints (e.g., IBM-first, AWS-only, Azure-only)?"
   - If YES → Load the relevant vendor reference (e.g., `references/ibm-products.md`)
   - If NO → Proceed with open evaluation

4. "Is this a regulated industry (healthcare, finance, government)?"
   - If YES → Note compliance requirements as constraints on all technology choices

### Discovery Output

Create a summary table:

| Capability Area | Existing Asset | Status |
|----------------|---------------|--------|
| [derived from FEA-/RISK-] | [what exists or "None"] | [Reuse / Extend / New / Replace] |

---

## Step 2: Categorize Layers

For each capability required by FEA- and RISK- entries, categorize:

| Category | Criteria | Action |
|----------|----------|--------|
| **Reuse** | Existing asset covers the need as-is | Create lightweight TECH- entry (use `assets/tech-reuse.md`) |
| **Extend** | Existing asset needs augmentation | Create TECH- entry documenting what changes are needed |
| **New** | No existing asset, greenfield decision | Proceed to Steps 3-4 for full evaluation |
| **Replace** | Existing asset is wrong for this product | Proceed to Steps 3-4; document what's being replaced and why |

**Derive capability areas from upstream IDs, not a fixed list.** Read FEA- entries and ask: "What technical capability does this feature require?" Read RISK- entries and ask: "Does this risk constrain or require a specific technology?"

Do not walk a generic layer checklist. Every capability area should trace to at least one FEA- or RISK- entry.

---

## Step 3: Evaluate Vendor Fit

For each "New" or "Replace" layer from Step 2:

1. Check if the preferred vendor has a product for this capability
2. Evaluate fit, compliance status, and cost
3. If vendor product fits → create TECH- entry with Category: Buy
4. If vendor product has poor fit or gaps → proceed to Step 4

**Evaluation criteria for vendor products:**

| Criterion | Questions |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Fit** | Does the vendor product solve our specific need? Feature gaps? |
| **Compliance** | Does it meet our regulatory requirements (from RISK- entries)? |
| **Cost** | What's the pricing? Cost at current scale AND 10x scale? |
| **Maturity** | Production-ready? Documentation quality? Active development? |
| **Integration** | How hard to integrate? Does it work with our existing stack? |

Use `assets/evaluation-scorecard.md` for structured comparison when multiple options exist.

---

## Step 4: Evaluate Alternatives

For layers where the vendor has gaps or poor fit:

1. Research 2-3 non-vendor alternatives
2. Score against the same criteria from Step 3
3. If a clear winner exists → create TECH- entry with decision
4. If high uncertainty → create TECH- entry with Category: Research, including evaluation criteria and deadline

**For Research items, define:**
- What must be learned before deciding
- How to evaluate (specific metrics, benchmarks, POC scope)
- Decision deadline (tied to a WAVE or milestone)

---

## Step 5: Check Product Family

**Only if sibling products were discovered in Step 1.** Skip for solo/greenfield products.

Lightweight checklist:

- [ ] **Shared infrastructure?** Will this product share clusters, databases, or services with siblings?
- [ ] **Component reuse?** Can UI components, API patterns, or operational tooling be shared?
- [ ] **Cross-product UX?** Should customers using multiple products have SSO or unified experience?
- [ ] **Shared vs. separate instances?** For each reused service, should it be the same deployment (separate namespace/realm) or a dedicated instance?

Document answers in relevant TECH- entries under "Product Family Notes."

---

## Step 6: Create TECH- Entries

For each technology decision, create a TECH- entry using the appropriate template:

- **Reuse/Extend:** Use `assets/tech-reuse.md` (lighter template)
- **Replace/Build/Buy/Integrate/Research:** Use `assets/tech.md` (standard template)

**Mandatory fields for every TECH- entry:**
- Features Served (FEA-XXX references)
- Risk Constraints (RISK-XXX references)
- Rationale (why this choice, not just what)
- Cost (at current AND 10x scale for Buy decisions)

**All TECH- entries are written to `SoT.TECHNICAL_DECISIONS.md`.** The skill produces entries; the SoT stores them.

See `references/examples.md` for 3 filled examples (Reuse, Buy, Research).

---

## Step 7: Map to Risks

Cross-reference every TECH- entry with RISK- constraints:

1. For each RISK- entry, verify at least one TECH- entry addresses it
2. For each TECH- entry, verify it doesn't introduce new unmitigated risks
3. Document the mapping in a summary table:

| Risk | Score | Technology Response |
|------|-------|-------------------|
| RISK-XXX | [score] | TECH-XXX addresses this by [how] |

If a RISK- entry has no corresponding TECH- response, flag it as an unmitigated risk requiring attention before proceeding to v0.6.

---

## Quality Gates

Before proceeding to v0.6 Architecture Design:

- [ ] All capability areas addressed (or explicitly N/A with rationale)
- [ ] Every TECH- entry cross-references FEA- and RISK- IDs it serves
- [ ] Build decisions justified as core differentiators
- [ ] Buy decisions have cost estimates at current AND 10x scale
- [ ] Research items have clear evaluation criteria and deadlines
- [ ] RISK- constraints from v0.5 Risk Discovery reflected in choices
- [ ] No vendor lock-in without explicit acknowledgment
- [ ] All TECH- entries written to SoT.TECHNICAL_DECISIONS.md
- [ ] Existing assets cataloged before new evaluations (brownfield check)

---

## Anti-Patterns

| Pattern | Signal | Fix |
|---------|--------|-----|
| Resume-driven dev | "Let's use [hot new tech]" | Choose boring technology for non-differentiators |
| Evaluate everything | Scoring auth when Keycloak already works | Categorize Reuse/Extend/New/Replace first |
| Greenfield assumption | "Pick a frontend framework" when React exists | Discover existing assets before evaluating |
| Build everything | No Buy/Integrate decisions | Challenge: is this really a differentiator? |
| Buy everything | No Build decisions | Some things must be custom for your moat |
| Analysis paralysis | Research everything | Time-box research; decide with 70% confidence |
| Ignoring constraints | Tech choice conflicts with RISK- | Review RISK- entries before finalizing |
| Cost blindness | No cost estimates on Buy decisions | Every TECH- needs cost at current + 10x scale |
| Premature optimization | "We need Kubernetes for scale" | Design for 10x current needs, not 1000x |
| Orphan TECH- entry | TECH-003 references no FEA- or RISK- | Mandatory cross-reference in template |
| SoT contamination | Decision rationale essays in SoT template | Methodology in skill; structure in SoT |

## Downstream Connections

| Consumer | What It Uses | Example |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| **v0.6 Architecture Design** | TECH- selections define the system | TECH-001 → ARC-001 frontend architecture |
| **v0.6 Technical Specification** | TECH- informs API design | TECH-003 → API-XXX data model constraints |
| **v0.7 Build Execution** | TECH- Research items become spikes | TECH-005 (Research) → EPIC task |
| **Hiring/Resourcing** | TECH- Build items define skills needed | TECH-010 (custom ML) → need ML engineer |

## Handoff

TECH- entries are complete when all quality gates pass.
Next stage: **v0.6 Architecture Design** (APOLLO ownership).
APOLLO should be able to start architecture work using only TECH- entries + upstream SoT files — no re-research needed.
