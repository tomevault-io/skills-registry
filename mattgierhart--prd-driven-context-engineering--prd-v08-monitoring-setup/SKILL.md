# Monitoring Setup

Position in workflow: v0.8 Runbook Creation → **v0.8 Monitoring Setup** → v0.9 GTM Strategy

## Consumes

This skill requires prior work from v0.8 Runbook Creation and earlier stages:

- **RUN-\* runbook entries** (from v0.8 Runbook Creation) — Incident response runbooks define alerting scenarios; critical alerts must link to RUN- procedures
- **DEP-\* deployment entries** (from v0.8 Release Planning) — DEP- rollback thresholds and post-deploy validation steps inform MON- alert conditions and SLO targets
- **API-\* endpoint contracts** (from v0.6 Technical Specification) — Define baseline latency, throughput, and error rates for application-layer metrics
- **KPI-\* metrics** (from v0.3 Outcome Definition and v0.9 Launch Metrics) — Business metrics (signups, conversions, retention) inform dashboard design and business layer monitoring
- **ARC-\* architecture decisions** (from v0.6 Architecture Design) — System structure determines which components to monitor (monolith has different metrics than distributed services)
- **TECH-\* technology stack** (from v0.5 Technical Stack Selection) — Technology choices (database, cloud provider, APM tools) determine available metrics and monitoring tools

This skill assumes DEP- and RUN- entries are complete with thresholds, rollback conditions, and incident procedures defined.

## Produces

This skill creates/updates:

- **MON-\* entries** (monitoring specifications, metric/alert/dashboard/SLO types) — Concrete monitoring rules with thresholds, alert conditions, dashboards, SLO definitions, linked to RUN- procedures
- **Alert routing configuration** — Mapping of MON- alerts to notification channels and teams; links alerts to RUN- incident procedures
- **Observability baseline** — Metrics gathered from staging/production, establishing normal operating ranges for alert thresholds

All MON- entries are **operational monitoring specifications**, not confidence-based. They are:
- **Measurable** (every metric has a source, unit, and aggregation method)
- **Actionable** (every alert has a RUN- procedure; no orphaned alerts)
- **Thresholded** (critical/warning severity with specific numeric conditions)
- **Dashboarded** (MON- dashboard entries provide visibility to operators and stakeholders)
- **SLO-backed** (SLO entries tie monitoring to product commitments)

## Core Concept: Monitoring as Early Warning

> Monitoring is not about collecting data—it is about **detecting problems before users do**. Every metric should answer: "Is this working? If not, what's broken?"

## Monitoring Layers

| Layer | What to Measure | Why It Matters |
|-------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Infrastructure** | CPU, memory, disk, network | System health foundation |
| **Application** | Latency, errors, throughput | User-facing performance |
| **Business** | Signups, conversions, revenue | Product health |
| **User Experience** | Page load, interaction time | Real user impact |

## Execution

1. **Define SLOs (Service Level Objectives)**
   - What uptime do we promise?
   - What latency is acceptable?
   - What error rate is tolerable?

2. **Identify key metrics per layer**
   - Infrastructure: Resource utilization
   - Application: RED metrics (Rate, Errors, Duration)
   - Business: KPI- from v0.3 and v0.9
   - User: Core Web Vitals, journey completion

3. **Set alert thresholds**
   - Warning: Investigate soon
   - Critical: Act immediately
   - Base on SLOs and historical data

4. **Map alerts to runbooks**
   - Every critical alert → RUN- procedure
   - No alert without action path

5. **Design dashboards**
   - Overview: System health at a glance
   - Deep-dive: Per-service details
   - Business: KPI tracking

6. **Create MON- entries** with full traceability

## The RED Method (Application Monitoring)

For each service, measure:

| Metric | What It Measures | Alert Threshold |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Rate** | Requests per second | Anomaly detection |
| **Errors** | Failed requests / total | >1% warning, >5% critical |
| **Duration** | Request latency (p95, p99) | >500ms warning, >2s critical |

## The USE Method (Infrastructure Monitoring)

For each resource (CPU, memory, disk, network):

| Metric | What It Measures | Alert Threshold |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Utilization** | % of capacity used | >80% warning, >95% critical |
| **Saturation** | Queue depth, waiting | >0 for critical resources |
| **Errors** | Error count/rate | Any errors = investigate |

## SLO Framework

| Tier | Availability | Latency (p95) | Use For |
|------|--------------|---------------|---------|
| **Tier 1** | 99.99% (52 min/yr) | <100ms | Payment, auth |
| **Tier 2** | 99.9% (8.7 hr/yr) | <500ms | Core features |
| **Tier 3** | 99% (3.6 days/yr) | <2s | Background jobs |

## Alert Severity Matrix

| Severity | User Impact | Response Time | Notification |
|----------|-------------|---------------|--------------|
| **Critical** | Service unusable | <5 min | PagerDuty (wake up) |
| **Warning** | Degraded experience | <30 min | Slack (business hours) |
| **Info** | No immediate impact | Next day | Dashboard/log |

## Dashboard Design Principles

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Answer questions** | Each panel answers "Is X working?" |
| **Hierarchy** | Overview → Service → Component |
| **Context** | Show thresholds, comparisons |
| **Actionable** | Link to runbooks from alerts |
| **Fast** | Quick load, auto-refresh |

## Anti-Patterns

| Pattern | Signal | Fix |
|---------|--------|-----|
| **Alert fatigue** | Too many alerts, team ignores | Tune thresholds, remove noise |
| **No runbook link** | Alert fires, no one knows what to do | Every alert → RUN- |
| **Vanity metrics** | "1 million requests!" without context | Focus on user-impacting metrics |
| **Missing baselines** | No historical comparison | Establish baselines before launch |
| **Over-monitoring** | 500 metrics, can't find signal | Focus on RED/USE fundamentals |
| **Under-monitoring** | "We'll add monitoring later" | Monitoring ships with code |

## Quality Gates

Before proceeding to v0.9 GTM Strategy:

- [ ] SLOs defined for critical services (MON- SLO type)
- [ ] RED metrics configured for application layer
- [ ] USE metrics configured for infrastructure layer
- [ ] Critical alerts linked to RUN- procedures
- [ ] Overview dashboard created for on-call
- [ ] Alert notification channels configured
- [ ] Baseline metrics established from staging

## Downstream Connections

| Consumer | What It Uses | Example |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| **On-Call Team** | MON- alerts trigger response | MON-003 → page engineer |
| **v0.9 Launch Metrics** | MON- provides baseline data | MON-001 baseline → KPI-010 target |
| **Post-Mortems** | MON- data for incident analysis | "MON-005 showed spike at 14:32" |
| **Capacity Planning** | MON- trends inform scaling | USE metrics → infrastructure planning |
| **DEP- Rollback** | MON- thresholds trigger rollback | MON-002 breach → DEP-003 rollback |
