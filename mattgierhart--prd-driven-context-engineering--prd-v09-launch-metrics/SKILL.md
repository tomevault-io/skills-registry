# Launch Metrics

Position in workflow: v0.9 GTM Strategy → **v0.9 Launch Metrics** → v0.9 Feedback Loop Setup

## Consumes

This skill requires prior work from v0.3-v0.9:

- **KPI-\* outcome entries from v0.3** (from v0.3 Outcome Definition) — Baseline KPI- entries define success metrics for the product; launch-specific KPI- entries are calibrated variants
- **GTM-\* campaign specifications** (from v0.9 GTM Strategy) — GTM channels inform launch-specific KPI- tracking (e.g., Product Hunt channel → KPI for PH-originated signups); timeline defines metric collection windows (Day 1, Day 7, Day 30, Day 90)
- **BR-\* product type** (from v0.2 Product Type Classification) — Product type (Clone/Unbundle/Undercut/Slice/Innovation) determines metric targets and benchmarks (Fast Follow = higher activation expected, lower retention)
- **CFD-\* market benchmarks** (from v0.1-v0.2 research) — Competitive analysis and market data inform realistic KPI- targets (e.g., "developer tools average 30-50% activation")
- **DEP-\* deployment infrastructure** (from v0.8 Release Planning) — Deployment baselines from staging inform KPI- thresholds (e.g., error rate baseline → activation threshold)
- **MON-\* monitoring setup** (from v0.8 Monitoring Setup) — Infrastructure metrics (latency, error rate) inform KPI- dashboards and alert conditions during launch

This skill assumes GTM- entries are complete and tracking infrastructure is configured.

## Produces

This skill creates/updates:

- **KPI-\* launch-specific entries** (launch metrics with targets and thresholds) — Funnel metrics (Reach → Acquisition → Activation → Retention → Revenue → Referral) with Day 1/7/30/90 targets, action thresholds (Red/Yellow/Green), and channel attribution
- **Launch dashboard specification** — Visual layout and refresh rate for real-time launch monitoring; links KPI- to MON- infrastructure
- **Metric tracking schema** — Event definitions and tracking setup for conversion funnel

All KPI- entries for launch are **measurement specifications**, not confidence-based. They are:
- **Actionable** (Red/Yellow/Green thresholds trigger specific responses)
- **Calibrated** (targets account for product type and market benchmarks from CFD-)
- **Traceable** (each KPI- links to GTM- channels and v0.3 baseline KPI-XX)
- **Measurable** (specific event tracking, data sources, calculation formulas)
- **Time-bound** (explicit timeframes: Day 1, Week 1, Month 1)

Example KPI- entries:
```markdown
KPI-101: Website Visitors (Launch Week)
Tier: Tier 3 (Leading)
Category: Reach
Stage: Launch (v0.9)
Owner: Growth Team

Definition: Unique visitors to marketing website from all GTM- channels
Unit: count
Source: Google Analytics 4 / Plausible

Tracking:
  Event: signup_completed { source, campaign_id, user_segment }
  Dashboard: Launch Dashboard > Acquisition panel
  Alert: Conversion rate <5%

Action Thresholds:
  Red: <100 Day 1 (messaging/channel mismatch — escalate GTM)

Product Type Calibration: Fast Follow = critical (users can easily switch back to competitors) — retention signal validates PMF

Tracking:
  Event: session_start { user_id, cohort_day }
  Dashboard: Launch Dashboard > Retention panel
  Alert: Day 7 retention <15% (fundamental problem)

Action Thresholds:
  Red: <15% (product-market fit issue — consider pivot in features, messaging)

## Core Concept: Metrics as North Star

> Launch metrics are not vanity numbers—they are **decision criteria**. Each metric should answer: "Is this working? Should we double down or pivot?" If a metric doesn't inform action, don't track it.

## Metric Layers for Launch

| Layer | What to Measure | Timeframe |
|-------|-----------------|-----------|
| **Reach** | How many saw us | Day 0-7 |
| **Acquisition** | How many signed up | Day 0-30 |
| **Activation** | How many got value | Day 1-14 |
| **Retention** | How many came back | Week 2-4 |
| **Revenue** | How many paid | Week 2-8 |
| **Referral** | How many shared | Week 3+ |

## Execution

1. **Review v0.3 Outcome Definition KPIs**
   - What KPI- entries exist from v0.3?
   - Which are most relevant for launch?
   - What launch-specific metrics are needed?

2. **Define launch-specific metrics**
   - Channel performance (per GTM-)
   - Funnel progression
   - Activation milestones
   - Early retention signals

3. **Set targets per timeframe**
   - Day 1, Day 7, Day 30, Day 90
   - Tie to product type expectations (from v0.2 BR-)

4. **Configure tracking infrastructure**
   - Analytics platforms
   - Event schemas
   - Dashboard setup

5. **Create visibility**
   - Daily launch dashboard
   - Weekly metrics review
   - Automated alerts for thresholds

6. **Create/Update KPI- entries** for launch

## The Launch Funnel

Track conversion at each stage:

```
REACH → ACQUISITION → ACTIVATION → RETENTION → REVENUE → REFERRAL
 100%      10%           50%          25%        20%       10%
```

| Stage | Key Metric | Benchmark |
|-------|------------|-----------|
| Reach → Acquisition | Signup Rate | 5-15% |
| Acquisition → Activation | Activation Rate | 30-60% |
| Activation → Retention | D7 Retention | 20-40% |
| Retention → Revenue | Conversion Rate | 2-10% |
| Revenue → Referral | NPS / Referral Rate | 10-30% |

## Product Type Calibration

Expectations vary by product type (from v0.2 BR-):

| Product Type | Acquisition | Activation | Retention | Revenue |
|--------------|-------------|------------|-----------|---------|
| **Fast Follow** | High (known category) | High (familiar UX) | Medium (easy to switch) | Quick |
| **Slice** | Medium (niche) | High (focused value) | High (workflow fit) | Medium |
| **Innovation** | Low (education needed) | Low (learning curve) | High (if activated) | Slow |

## Tracking Infrastructure Checklist

| Component | Purpose | Tool Examples |
|-----------|---------|---------------|
| **Product Analytics** | User behavior | Mixpanel, Amplitude, PostHog |
| **Web Analytics** | Traffic, sources | GA4, Plausible, Fathom |
| **Event Tracking** | Specific actions | Segment, custom events |
| **Error Tracking** | Failures, issues | Sentry, LogRocket |
| **Session Recording** | User experience | Hotjar, FullStory |
| **A/B Testing** | Experiments | LaunchDarkly, Statsig |

## Event Schema for Launch

Define standard events for launch tracking:

```
# Acquisition Events
signup_started: { source, campaign, referrer }
signup_completed: { source, campaign, user_id }
signup_abandoned: { step, source, reason }

# Activation Events
onboarding_started: { user_id }
onboarding_step_completed: { user_id, step }
first_value_achieved: { user_id, action, time_to_value }

# Engagement Events
feature_used: { user_id, feature, context }
session_start: { user_id, day_number }
session_end: { user_id, duration }

# Conversion Events
upgrade_started: { user_id, plan }
payment_completed: { user_id, plan, amount }
```

## Launch Dashboard Layout

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

```

## Anti-Patterns

| Pattern | Signal | Fix |
|---------|--------|-----|
| **Vanity metrics only** | Tracking visitors but not activation | Focus on funnel progression |
| **No targets** | "We got 1000 signups!" (is that good?) | Set explicit targets per timeframe |
| **Lagging only** | Only tracking revenue | Add leading indicators (activation) |
| **No action thresholds** | Metrics exist but no response plan | Define red/yellow/green zones |
| **Over-instrumentation** | 200 events, can't find signal | Focus on 10-15 key events |
| **No attribution** | Don't know which channel works | Track source for all signups |

## Quality Gates

Before proceeding to Feedback Loop Setup:

- [ ] Launch funnel metrics defined (Reach → Referral)
- [ ] Targets set for Day 1, Day 7, Day 30
- [ ] Tracking infrastructure configured
- [ ] Launch dashboard created and accessible
- [ ] Action thresholds defined for critical metrics
- [ ] KPI- entries link to GTM- channels
- [ ] Product type calibration applied to targets

## Downstream Connections

| Consumer | What It Uses | Example |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| **Feedback Loop Setup** | KPI- thresholds trigger feedback collection | KPI-103 <30% → investigate with CFD- |
| **Daily Standup** | KPI- dashboard for launch status | "Activation at 42%, on track" |
| **Pivot Decisions** | KPI- data informs strategy | KPI-104 <15% → fundamental problem |
| **Investor Updates** | KPI- for launch performance | "Day 30: 5000 signups, 45% activated" |
| **v1.0 Planning** | KPI- baselines for growth targets | KPI-102 baseline → 10% MoM growth |
