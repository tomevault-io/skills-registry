# Documentation Skill

## Purpose

Generate documentation artifacts from implemented code. Create durable external context that survives beyond the current session.

## When to Use

### Mandatory (Always Run)

Documentation is mandatory for all spec-based workflows (oneoff-spec and orchestrator). Run after security review, before commit.

### What to Document (scope varies by change)

- **Public API additions**: Full API docs (endpoints, methods, interfaces)
- **User-facing features**: User-oriented docs for features end users interact with
- **Substantial changes**: Architecture docs for multi-file implementations, new services
- **Complex logic**: Explanatory docs for non-obvious algorithms or workflows
- **Configuration options**: Document new environment variables or settings
- **Bug fixes / minor changes**: Lightweight docs (update existing docs if behavior changed, or a brief changelog entry)

### Skip (docs step still runs but produces minimal output)

- Documentation-only changes (already documented)
- Trivial single-line fixes within oneoff-vibe (docs not dispatched for oneoff-vibe)

## Documentation Types

### API Documentation

For public endpoints and methods:

```markdown
## methodName

Brief description of what it does.

### Parameters

| Name   | Type   | Required | Description                  |
| ------ | ------ | -------- | ---------------------------- |
| param1 | string | Yes      | What this parameter controls |

### Returns

`ReturnType` - Description of return value

### Errors

| Error             | When                 |
| ----------------- | -------------------- |
| InvalidInputError | When param1 is empty |

### Example

\`\`\`typescript
const result = await service.methodName('value');
\`\`\`
```

### User Guides

For user-facing features:

```markdown
## Feature Name

What this feature does and why you'd use it.

### Getting Started

Step-by-step instructions for basic usage.

### Configuration

Available options and what they control.

### Examples

Common use cases with code/UI examples.

### Troubleshooting

Common issues and how to resolve them.
```

### Architecture Documentation

For complex systems:

```markdown
## Component Name

### Purpose

Why this component exists and what problem it solves.

### Design Decisions

Key decisions and their rationale.

### Data Flow

How data moves through the component.

### Dependencies

What this component depends on and why.
```

## Documentation Process

### Step 1: Identify Scope

```bash
# Check what was implemented from spec group
cat .claude/specs/groups/<spec-group-id>/manifest.json
cat .claude/specs/groups/<spec-group-id>/spec.md

# List atomic specs for implementation details
ls .claude/specs/groups/<spec-group-id>/atomic/

# Read atomic specs for Implementation Evidence (exact files/lines changed)
cat .claude/specs/groups/<spec-group-id>/atomic/as-001-*.md

# Find modified files from Implementation Evidence
# Or use git diff
git diff --name-only main..HEAD

# Identify public interfaces
grep -r "export" src/ --include="*.ts" | grep -E "(class|interface|function|const)"
```

Determine documentation needs:

- Public APIs → API docs (always)
- User-facing features → User guides (always)
- Internal architecture → Architecture docs (if complex)
- Configuration → Configuration docs (always)

### Step 2: Read Implementation (Not Spec)

**Critical**: Document what the code DOES, not what the spec SAYS.

```bash
# Read actual implementation
cat src/services/feature.ts

# Check for edge cases in tests
cat src/services/__tests__/feature.test.ts

# Look for error handling
grep -A5 "catch\|throw\|Error" src/services/feature.ts
```

### Step 3: Generate Documentation

Follow documentation standards:

#### DO:

- Use present tense ("Returns" not "Will return")
- Include working code examples
- Document error conditions
- Link to related documentation
- Keep examples minimal but complete

#### DON'T:

- Copy spec language verbatim
- Document internal implementation details in user docs
- Assume reader knows the codebase
- Leave placeholder text ("TODO", "TBD")
- Over-document obvious things

### Step 4: Place Documentation

```
docs/
├── api/                 # API reference
│   └── services/
│       └── auth.md
├── guides/              # User guides
│   └── authentication.md
├── architecture/        # Internal architecture
│   └── auth-system.md
└── README.md            # Project overview
```

For inline documentation:

- JSDoc for public APIs
- README.md in package roots
- CHANGELOG.md for version history

### Step 5: Generate Diagrams

Run the diagram generator to ensure all Mermaid diagrams are fresh:

```bash
node .claude/scripts/docs-generate.mjs
```

This produces `.mmd` files in `.claude/docs/structured/generated/` for all available YAML sources (architecture, flows, ERD, state, security, deployment, C4 component). Missing sources are skipped silently.

### Step 5.5: Phase 2 PRD Report Enrichment (AC-6.5)

When spec authoring is complete for a linked PRD, trigger Phase 2 enrichment of the PRD Report:

1. **Check for linked PRD**: Look for `prd` reference in `manifest.json`
2. **If PRD exists and Phase 1 report was generated**:
   - Dispatch documenter agent for Phase 2 assembly
   - Documenter reads Phase 1 report, generates fresh diagrams, and enriches with:
     - ERD diagrams from `data-models.yaml`
     - Detailed sequence diagrams from spec flow definitions
     - Contract overview table from wire protocol contracts
   - Phase 2 retains all Phase 1 content
   - Partial enrichment is acceptable: skip diagrams whose spec artifacts are unavailable, log reasons
3. **If no PRD linked**: Skip Phase 2 (no action)
4. **Output**: Enriched PRD Report at `.claude/prds/<prd-id>/report.md` using template at `.claude/templates/prd-report.template.md`

### Step 6: Validate

```bash
# Check code examples compile (if applicable)
npx tsc --noEmit docs/examples/*.ts

# Ensure consistent formatting
npx prettier --check docs/**/*.md
```

### Step 7: Update Manifest

Update `manifest.json` with documentation status:

```json
{
  "convergence": {
    "docs_generated": true
  },
  "decision_log": [
    {
      "timestamp": "<ISO timestamp>",
      "actor": "agent",
      "action": "docs_generated",
      "details": "API docs + user guide created, 3 examples verified"
    }
  ]
}
```

Add documentation log to spec group:

```markdown
## Documentation Log

- 2026-01-08: Documentation complete
  - API docs: docs/api/services/auth.md
  - User guide: docs/guides/authentication.md
  - Atomic specs documented: as-001, as-002, as-003
  - Examples verified: 3 code samples tested
```

## Documentation Standards

### Required Documentation Categories

Assess which categories apply to the project, then generate documentation for each applicable category.

| Category                         | When Required               | Contents                                                                 |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **High-Level Overview**          | All projects                | Project purpose, quick start, workspace listing                          |
| **System Architecture**          | Multi-component projects    | Data flow diagrams, service boundaries, component relationships          |
| **API Documentation - Public**   | Projects with public APIs   | Endpoints, authentication, request/response examples, error codes        |
| **API Documentation - Internal** | Projects with internal APIs | Internal endpoints, service-to-service contracts                         |
| **Operations Guide**             | Production systems          | Deployment procedures, monitoring, troubleshooting, emergency procedures |
| **Frontend Documentation**       | UI projects                 | Component overview, state management, routing, key patterns              |
| **Setup/Installation**           | All projects                | Environment setup, dependencies, local development                       |
| **Contributing Guide**           | Shared/open projects        | Branch strategy, PR process, code review expectations                    |

**Conditional Requirements**:

- **Frontend docs depth**: For backend-heavy projects, frontend docs can be lighter. For frontend-heavy or balanced projects, frontend docs should match backend docs depth.
- **"If applicable" rule**: A category is required only if the project has that component (e.g., no API docs needed if no API exists)

### Documentation Patterns

Follow these established patterns based on documentation type:

**README Structure**:

- Quick Start
- Scripts/Commands
- Environment/Configuration
- Project Structure (if complex)
- Troubleshooting

**API Documentation Pattern**:

- Table of contents
- Security/Authentication section
- Environment variables table
- Endpoints grouped by resource
- Request/response examples for each endpoint
- WebSocket documentation if applicable
- Error handling reference

**Operations Guide Pattern**:

- Quick reference table at top
- Step-by-step procedures
- Troubleshooting section with common issues
- Emergency procedures
- Configuration reference

**Documentation Index Pattern**:

- Serve as table of contents with categorized links
- Include terminology glossary for project-specific terms
- Cross-link related documents with "See Also" sections

### Formatting Conventions

- H1 for title only, H2 for major sections
- Tables for structured data (env vars, endpoints, commands)
- Code blocks with language specifiers
- No emojis in documentation
- "See Also" sections for cross-references

### Code Examples Must Work

Every code example must:

1. Be syntactically correct
2. Use real types/imports from the codebase
3. Demonstrate the happy path
4. Be copy-paste runnable (with minimal setup)

**Bad**:

```typescript
const result = doThing(params); // params undefined
```

**Good**:

```typescript
import { AuthService } from '@/services/auth';

const authService = new AuthService();
const result = await authService.logout();
// result: { success: true }
```

### Document Behavior, Not Implementation

**Bad** (leaks implementation):

```markdown
The logout method clears the localStorage key 'auth_token'
and sets the BehaviorSubject to false.
```

**Good** (describes behavior):

```markdown
The logout method ends the current session and redirects
to the login page. Any cached credentials are cleared.
```

### Match Audience to Doc Type

| Doc Type      | Audience           | Tone                   | Detail Level |
| ------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------- | ------------ |
| API Reference | Developers         | Technical, precise     | High         |
| User Guide    | End users          | Friendly, task-focused | Medium       |
| Architecture  | Future maintainers | Explanatory            | High         |

## Output Format

```markdown
## Documentation Complete

**Spec Group**: .claude/specs/groups/<spec-group-id>/

**Atomic Specs Documented**:

- as-001: Logout Button UI
- as-002: Token Clearing
- as-003: Post-Logout Redirect

**Artifacts Created**:

- docs/api/services/auth.md (API reference)
- docs/guides/authentication.md (user guide)

**Coverage**:

- Public methods documented: 5/5
- Examples included: 3
- Error conditions documented: 4

**Validation**:

- Code examples: verified
- Links: verified
- Formatting: consistent

**Manifest Updated**: convergence.docs_generated: true
```

## Integration with Other Skills

**Before docs**:

- `/security` review passed

**After docs**:

- Ready for commit/merge

Documentation is typically the final step before commit for substantial changes.

## Structured Documentation Nudge (AC-10.1, AC-10.2)

After generating documentation artifacts, check whether the implementation touched modules defined in the project's structured documentation system.

### How to Check

1. **Read architecture.yaml**: If `.claude/docs/structured/architecture.yaml` exists, read it to get the list of modules and their `path` globs.
2. **Identify touched files**: Use `git diff --name-only` or the spec's Implementation Evidence to get the list of files modified in this session.
3. **Match files to modules**: For each modified file, check if it falls within any module's `path` glob pattern.
4. **Check for doc updates**: For each matched module, check if `architecture.yaml` or any relevant flow files (in `.claude/docs/structured/flows/`) were also modified in this session.
5. **Emit nudge if needed**: If implementation files within a module's scope were modified but the structured docs were NOT updated, emit a nudge message.

### Nudge Format

When structured docs may need updating, include this in your output:

```markdown
### Structured Documentation Review

The following modules had implementation changes but no corresponding structured doc updates:

- **module-name**: Files matching `path/glob/**` were modified
  - Consider: Update architecture.yaml description or responsibilities
  - Consider: Add/update flow steps if behavior changed
  - Consider: Add new glossary terms if new concepts introduced

Run `node .claude/scripts/docs-validate.mjs` to check for cross-reference issues.
```

### When to Skip

- If `.claude/docs/structured/architecture.yaml` does not exist (structured docs not adopted)
- If no implementation files match any module's path glob
- If the structured docs were already updated in this session

## Constraints

### Read Implementation, Not Just Spec

The spec says what SHOULD happen. The code says what DOES happen. Document reality.

### No Code Changes

You generate documentation only. If you find:

- Undocumented public APIs → Document them
- Bugs in implementation → Note in report, don't fix
- Missing error handling → Document current behavior, note gap

### Consistency Over Creativity

Match existing documentation style in the project. Follow established patterns.

## Examples

### Example 1: API Documentation

**Input**: New logout endpoint implementation

**Output**:

```markdown
# AuthService.logout()

Terminates the current user session and clears authentication state.

## Signature

\`\`\`typescript
async logout(): Promise<void>
\`\`\`

## Behavior

1. Calls server to invalidate session
2. Clears local authentication token
3. Updates auth state to unauthenticated
4. Triggers redirect to login page

## Errors

| Error          | Cause                  |
| -------------- | ---------------------- |
| `NetworkError` | Cannot reach server    |
| `LogoutError`  | Server rejected logout |

## Example

\`\`\`typescript
import { authService } from '@/services/auth';

try {
await authService.logout();
// User is now logged out, redirect handled automatically
} catch (error) {
if (error instanceof NetworkError) {
showToast('Check your connection and try again');
}
}
\`\`\`
```

### Example 2: User Guide

**Input**: New dashboard feature

**Output**:

```markdown
# Using the Dashboard

The dashboard provides an overview of your daily tasks and priorities.

## Getting Started

1. Log in to your account
2. Click "Dashboard" in the navigation menu
3. Your daily briefing appears automatically

## Features

### Daily Briefing

Shows your priorities for today, including:

- Urgent emails requiring response
- Upcoming calendar events
- Tasks due today

### Quick Actions

- **Snooze**: Postpone an item to later
- **Complete**: Mark a task as done
- **Delegate**: Assign to someone else

## Customization

Access Settings → Dashboard to configure:

- Briefing time (default: 9:00 AM)
- Priority thresholds
- Notification preferences
```

### Example 3: Architecture Doc

**Input**: New notification service

**Output**:

```markdown
# Notification Service Architecture

## Purpose

Centralizes all user notifications across channels (email, SMS, push).

## Design Decisions

**Why a separate service?**

- Decouples notification logic from business logic
- Enables channel-agnostic notification requests
- Supports future channels without core changes

**Why queue-based?**

- Handles burst traffic gracefully
- Enables retry logic for failed deliveries
- Provides delivery tracking

## Data Flow

\`\`\`
Business Logic → NotificationService.send()
↓
Queue (Redis)
↓
Channel Adapters (Email, SMS, Push)
↓
Delivery Status → Database
\`\`\`

## Dependencies

- **Redis**: Message queue
- **Telnyx**: SMS delivery
- **SendGrid**: Email delivery
- **Firebase**: Push notifications
