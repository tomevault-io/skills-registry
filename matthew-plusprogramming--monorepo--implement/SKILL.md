# Implementation Skill

## Required Context

Before beginning work, read these files for project-specific guidelines:

- `.claude/memory-bank/best-practices/subagent-design.md`

## Pre-Flight Challenge

Before beginning work, address these operational feasibility questions:

1. Are all required environment variables configured for this feature?
2. Are external dependencies (APIs, services, databases) available and accessible?
3. Are infrastructure prerequisites (build tools, runtimes, packages) in place?
4. Is the execution environment ready (correct Node version, disk space, permissions)?

If any question cannot be answered from available context, surface it as a finding -- do not skip.

## Purpose

Execute implementation from approved atomic specs with full traceability to requirements.

**Key Input**: Atomic specs from `.claude/specs/groups/<spec-group-id>/atomic/`

## Usage

```
/implement <spec-group-id>                    # Implement all atomic specs in order
/implement <spec-group-id> <atomic-spec-id>   # Implement specific atomic spec
/implement <spec-group-id> --parallel         # Dispatch parallel implementers per atomic spec
```

## Prerequisites

Before using this skill, verify:

1. **Spec group exists** at `.claude/specs/groups/<spec-group-id>/`
2. **review_state** is `APPROVED` in manifest.json
3. **Atomic specs exist** in `atomic/` directory
4. **Enforcement passed** (orchestrator workflows only): When `atomic_specs` exists in manifest, verify `atomic_specs.enforcement_status: "passing"`. For oneoff-spec workflows (no atomic specs), enforcement is not required — skip this check.
5. **Open questions** are resolved or explicitly deferred

If prerequisites not met → STOP and resolve before implementing.

## Implementation Process

### Step 0: Load Session Context

Check for existing session state to enable resuming mid-implementation:

```bash
# Check session checkpoint
cat .claude/context/session.json | jq '.phase_checkpoint'
```

If `atomic_specs_pending` has values, use those as the implementation queue instead of starting fresh. This enables cross-session recovery if implementation was interrupted.

```json
{
  "phase_checkpoint": {
    "phase": "implementing",
    "atomic_specs_pending": ["as-003", "as-004"],
    "atomic_specs_complete": ["as-001", "as-002"],
    "last_completed": "as-002"
  }
}
```

If no checkpoint exists or `phase` is not `implementing`, proceed with full atomic spec list from Step 2.

### Step 1: Load and Verify Spec Group

```
Read: .claude/specs/groups/<spec-group-id>/manifest.json
Read: .claude/specs/groups/<spec-group-id>/requirements.md
Read: .claude/specs/groups/<spec-group-id>/spec.md
List: .claude/specs/groups/<spec-group-id>/atomic/*.md
```

Verify in manifest.json:

- `review_state` is `APPROVED`
- If `atomic_specs` exists in manifest (orchestrator workflow): `atomic_specs.enforcement_status` is `passing`
- If `atomic_specs` is absent (oneoff-spec workflow): skip enforcement check
- No blocking open questions

### Step 2: List Atomic Specs

```
.claude/specs/groups/<spec-group-id>/atomic/
├── as-001-logout-button-ui.md
├── as-002-token-clearing.md
├── as-003-post-logout-redirect.md
└── as-004-error-handling.md
```

Each atomic spec is independently implementable. Execute in order (as-001, as-002, etc.).

### Step 3: Understand the Codebase

Before making changes, study existing patterns:

- File structure and naming conventions
- Error handling patterns
- Testing approaches

### Step 4: Execute Atomic Specs in Order

For each atomic spec:

#### 4a. Mark Atomic Spec as In Progress

Update atomic spec frontmatter:

```yaml
status: implementing
```

Update manifest.json:

```json
{
  "work_state": "IMPLEMENTING"
}
```

Update session checkpoint to track implementation phase:

```bash
# Update session checkpoint
node .claude/scripts/session-checkpoint.mjs transition-phase implementing
```

#### 4b. Read Atomic Spec

From the atomic spec file, extract:

- Description (single behavior to implement)
- Acceptance criteria
- Test strategy
- Deployment notes

#### 4c. Implement the Atomic Spec

Follow spec requirements exactly:

- Use existing patterns from codebase
- Maintain naming conventions
- Include error handling as specified
- Add comments linking to AC numbers

#### 4d. Run Relevant Tests

```bash
npm test -- <related-test>
```

#### 4e. Fill Implementation Evidence

Update the atomic spec's Implementation Evidence section:

```markdown
## Implementation Evidence

| File                         | Line | Description                  |
| ---------------------------- | ---- | ---------------------------- |
| src/services/auth-service.ts | 67   | logout() method clears token |
| src/components/UserMenu.tsx  | 42   | Logout button component      |
```

#### 4f. Mark Atomic Spec Complete

Update atomic spec frontmatter:

```yaml
status: implemented
```

Add to atomic spec Decision Log:

```markdown
## Decision Log

- `2026-01-14T10:30:00Z`: Created from spec.md decomposition
- `2026-01-14T14:30:00Z`: Implementation complete - auth-service.ts:67
```

#### 4g. Update Session Checkpoint

After each atomic spec completion, update session state for cross-session recovery:

```bash
# Mark atomic spec complete in session
node .claude/scripts/session-checkpoint.mjs complete-atomic-spec <atomic_spec_id>
```

This ensures that if the session ends unexpectedly, the next session can resume from the correct atomic spec.

### Step 5: Handle Spec Deviations

If you discover during implementation:

#### Scenario A: Missing Requirement

Spec doesn't cover a necessary case.

**Action**:

1. STOP implementation
2. Document in spec's Open Questions:

```markdown
## Open Questions

- Q3: How should logout behave if user has unsaved changes? (Status: blocking)
  - Discovered during implementation
  - Need user decision before proceeding
```

3. Ask user for guidance
4. Update spec with decision
5. Resume implementation

#### Scenario B: Invalid Assumption

Spec assumes something that's not true in the codebase.

**Action**:

1. STOP implementation
2. Document in spec's Decision & Work Log:

```markdown
- 2026-01-02: **Issue** - Spec assumes AuthService.logout() exists, but it doesn't
- **Proposed amendment**: Add AuthService.logout() method to task list
- **Status**: Awaiting approval
```

3. Propose spec amendment
4. Get user approval
5. Update spec
6. Resume implementation

#### Scenario C: Better Approach Discovered

Found a more efficient or clearer way to achieve the requirement.

**Action**:

1. Evaluate: Does this change the **behavior** or just the **implementation**?
2. If behavior unchanged → Proceed (implementation detail)
3. If behavior changes → Propose spec amendment with rationale
4. Get approval before deviating

**Never silently deviate from the spec.**

### Step 6: Validate Implementation

After all atomic specs complete:

```bash
# Run full test suite
npm test

# Check for lint errors
npm run lint

# Build if applicable
npm run build
```

Ensure:

- All tests passing
- No lint errors
- Build succeeds
- No console errors introduced

### Step 7: Update Manifest

Update manifest.json with implementation complete:

```json
{
  "work_state": "VERIFYING",
  "convergence": {
    "all_acs_implemented": true
  },
  "decision_log": [
    // ... existing entries ...
    {
      "timestamp": "<ISO timestamp>",
      "actor": "agent",
      "action": "implementation_complete",
      "details": "All 4 atomic specs implemented, tests passing"
    }
  ],
  "session_ref": {
    "session_id": "<current-session-uuid>",
    "last_checkpoint": "<ISO-timestamp>",
    "last_atomic_spec": "<last-completed-as-id>",
    "checkpoint_phase": "implementing",
    "checkpoint_state": "clean"
  }
}
```

Transition to verifying phase for cross-session tracking:

```bash
# Transition to verifying phase
node .claude/scripts/session-checkpoint.mjs transition-phase verifying
```

**Commit preparation**: Stage your spec group's `manifest.json` alongside implementation files in the commit. The manifest tracks convergence state and must always travel with the implementation it describes.

### Step 8: Report Completion

```markdown
## Implementation Complete ✅

**Spec Group**: <spec-group-id>
**Atomic Specs**: 4/4 complete

**Evidence**:

- as-001: src/components/UserMenu.tsx:42
- as-002: src/services/auth-service.ts:67
- as-003: src/router/auth-router.ts:23
- as-004: src/services/auth-service.ts:78

**Tests**: All passing
**Build**: Successful

**Next Steps**:

1. Run `/test <spec-group-id>` to ensure test coverage (if not done in parallel)
2. Run `/unify <spec-group-id>` to validate convergence
```

## Parallel Execution with Test Writer (and E2E Test Writer)

For larger tasks, implementation, test writing, and E2E test writing can run in parallel.

### When to Parallelize

- Multiple independent tasks in task list
- Clear acceptance criteria for each task
- Low coupling between tasks

### 2-Way vs 3-Way Parallel Dispatch

```
Spec Approved + Challenges Pass
        |
   [Spec has e2e_skip: true?]
        |                    |
       YES                  NO (default)
        |                    |
  2-way parallel      3-way parallel
  - implementer       - implementer
  - test-writer       - test-writer
                      - e2e-test-writer
```

The `e2e-test-writer` is dispatched by default for all spec-based workflows. Specs can opt out by setting `e2e_skip: true` with a valid `e2e_skip_rationale` (one of: `pure-refactor`, `test-infra`, `type-only`, `docs-only`) in the spec frontmatter.

The e2e-test-writer receives only the spec and contracts -- never implementation file paths (Practice 2.4).

### How to Parallelize

Use Task tool to dispatch subagents:

```javascript
// Dispatch implementer subagent
Task({
  description: 'Implement logout functionality',
  prompt: `Implement tasks 1-3 from TaskSpec at .claude/specs/groups/sg-logout-button/spec.md

  Focus on:
  - Adding logout button component
  - Implementing AuthService.logout() method
  - Adding error handling

  Do NOT implement tests - test-writer will handle that.

  Follow spec requirements exactly. Escalate if spec gaps discovered.`,
  subagent_type: 'implementer',
});

// Dispatch test-writer subagent in parallel
Task({
  description: 'Write tests for logout functionality',
  prompt: `Write tests for acceptance criteria AC1.1-AC2.3 from TaskSpec at .claude/specs/groups/sg-logout-button/spec.md

  Map each AC to specific test cases.
  Follow AAA pattern.
  Tests will initially fail until implementation complete.`,
  subagent_type: 'test-writer',
});

// Dispatch e2e-test-writer in parallel (default, skip only when e2e_skip: true)
Task({
  description: 'Generate E2E tests for logout functionality',
  prompt: `Generate E2E tests for cross-boundary ACs from spec at .claude/specs/groups/sg-logout-button/spec.md

  Use only spec contracts and acceptance criteria as input.
  Do NOT read implementation files.
  Write tests to tests/e2e/sg-logout-button/.`,
  subagent_type: 'e2e-test-writer',
});
```

Main agent retains integration responsibility:

- Collect outputs from all subagents (2 or 3)
- Ensure tests pass with implementation
- Run unifier to validate alignment (including E2E coverage at Step 9)

## Spec Conformance Rules

### DO:

- Follow spec requirements exactly
- Use existing codebase patterns
- Ask user when spec is unclear
- Update spec when discovering gaps
- Log evidence of completion
- Run tests after each task

### DON'T:

- Add features not in spec
- Deviate from specified behavior
- Assume unstated requirements
- Skip error handling specified in spec
- Make breaking changes not mentioned in spec
- Silently fix spec errors - propose amendments instead

## Integration with Other Skills

After implementation:

- Use `/unify` to validate spec-impl-test alignment

**After unify passes, the review chain is**:

1. `/code-review` - Code quality review (always)
2. `/security` - Security review (always)
3. Completion verification - Post-completion gates via `completion-verifier` agent (always, oneoff-vibe exempt)
4. `/browser-test` - UI validation (if UI changes)
5. `/docs` - Documentation generation (if public API)

## Error Handling

### Build Failures

```bash
npm run build
# Error: ...
```

**Action**:

1. Read error message carefully
2. Check if spec anticipated this (Security section, Edge Cases)
3. If spec covers it → Implement as specified
4. If spec doesn't cover it → Add to Open Questions, get guidance

### Test Failures

```bash
npm test
# FAIL: expected X, got Y
```

**Action**:

1. Determine if test or implementation is wrong
2. If test is wrong → Fix test to match spec
3. If implementation is wrong → Fix implementation to match spec
4. If spec is wrong → Propose spec amendment

### Merge Conflicts

If working in parallel with other workstreams:

```bash
git pull origin main
# CONFLICT: ...
```

**Action**:

1. Check MasterSpec contract registry
2. Verify your implementation matches contract interface
3. Resolve conflict favoring contract definition
4. If contract is ambiguous → Escalate to orchestrator

## Examples

### Example 1: Simple Task Execution

**Spec**: TaskSpec for logout button (AC1.1: Clear token)

**Implementation**:

```typescript
// src/services/auth.service.ts

async logout(): Promise<void> {
  try {
    // Call API to invalidate session
    await this.api.post('/auth/logout');

    // Clear local token (AC1.1)
    localStorage.removeItem('auth_token');

    // Update auth state
    this.authState.next({ isAuthenticated: false });
  } catch (error) {
    // AC2.1: Display error on failure
    throw new Error('Logout failed. Please try again.');
  }
}
```

**Evidence**:

- Task marked complete in spec
- Tests passing: `auth-service.test.ts` (2 tests)
- AC1.1 verified: Token cleared from localStorage

### Example 2: Discovering Spec Gap

**During implementation**, discovered:

- Spec says "redirect to login page"
- But doesn't specify: Should we preserve the return URL for after re-login?

**Action**:

```markdown
## Open Questions

- Q4: Should we preserve return URL for post-login redirect? (Status: blocking)
  - Discovered during implementation of redirect logic
  - Options:
    - A: Redirect to /login (simple, spec as written)
    - B: Redirect to /login?returnUrl=<current> (better UX)
  - **Recommendation**: Option B for better UX
  - Awaiting user decision
```

**Result**: User chooses Option B → Update spec → Implement with return URL preservation

### Example 3: Parallel Implementation

**Scenario**: MasterSpec with 3 workstreams

**Main agent**:

```javascript
// Dispatch implementers for each workstream
const ws1 = Task({
  description: 'Implement WebSocket Server (ws-1)',
  prompt: 'Implement workstream ws-1 from master spec...',
  subagent_type: 'implementer',
});

const ws2 = Task({
  description: 'Implement Frontend Client (ws-2)',
  prompt: 'Implement workstream ws-2 from master spec...',
  subagent_type: 'implementer',
});

const ws3 = Task({
  description: 'Implement Notification Service (ws-3)',
  prompt: 'Implement workstream ws-3 from master spec...',
  subagent_type: 'implementer',
});

// Wait for all to complete
// Then run unifier for cross-workstream validation
```

**Result**: Parallel execution with main agent handling integration and contract validation
