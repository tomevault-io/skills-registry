# Spec Author Skill

## Required Context

Before beginning work, read these files for project-specific guidelines:

- `.claude/memory-bank/best-practices/subagent-design.md`

## Pre-Flight Challenge

Before beginning work, address these operational feasibility questions:

1. Are the requirements operationally feasible given the current environment?
2. Do requirements assume infrastructure (services, databases, APIs) that may not exist?
3. Are there implicit execution dependencies not captured in the requirements?

If any question cannot be answered from available context, surface it as a finding -- do not skip.

## Purpose

Create specifications that serve as the authoritative contract for implementation. Specs document requirements, design decisions, task breakdowns, and test plans.

**Key Output**: Creates `spec.md` in a spec group, reading from `requirements.md`.

## Usage

```
/spec <spec-group-id>           # Create spec.md from requirements.md in spec group
/spec refine <spec-group-id>    # Refine existing spec based on feedback
```

## Prerequisites

Before running `/spec`:

1. Spec group must exist at `.claude/specs/groups/<spec-group-id>/`
2. `requirements.md` must exist (from `/prd` or `/prd sync`)
3. `manifest.json` must exist with valid metadata

## Output Location

All specs are written to the spec group directory:

```
.claude/specs/groups/<spec-group-id>/
├── manifest.json      # Updated by /spec
├── requirements.md    # Input (from /prd or /prd sync)
└── spec.md           # Output (created by /spec)
```

## Spec Tiers

The complexity of the spec is determined by the requirements, but **all specs output to `spec.md`** in the spec group.

### TaskSpec (Light) - For Small to Medium Tasks

Use for:

- Single feature or enhancement
- 2-5 files impacted
- Clear scope, single workstream
- Estimated 30 min - 4 hours

**Sections**:

- Context & Goal
- Requirements Summary (references requirements.md)
- Acceptance Criteria
- Design Notes (optional)
- Task List
- Test Plan
- Decision & Work Log

### WorkstreamSpec (Full) - For Complex Single-Workstream Tasks

Use for:

- Complex feature requiring detailed design
- Multiple components or layers involved
- Needs sequence diagrams and interface definitions
- Estimated 4-8 hours
- Part of a larger effort but can be worked independently

**Sections**:

- Context
- Goals / Non-goals
- Requirements Summary (references requirements.md)
- Core Flows
- Sequence Diagrams (Mermaid)
- Edge Cases
- Interfaces & Data Model
- Security
- Additional Considerations
- Task List
- Testing
- Open Questions
- Workstream Reflection
- Decision & Work Log

### MasterSpec (Multi-workstream) - For Large Projects

Use for:

- 5+ workstreams needed
- Multiple parallel efforts
- Complex dependencies and contracts
- Requires orchestration and integration

**Approach**: Use `/orchestrate` skill which creates separate spec groups per workstream.

## Process: Spec Creation in Spec Group

### Step 1: Validate Spec Group

```
Read: .claude/specs/groups/<spec-group-id>/manifest.json
Read: .claude/specs/groups/<spec-group-id>/requirements.md
```

Verify:

- Spec group exists
- `requirements.md` has REQ-XXX requirements
- `manifest.json` has valid metadata

### Step 2: Read Requirements

From `requirements.md`, extract:

- Problem statement
- Goals and non-goals
- REQ-XXX requirements in EARS format
- Constraints and assumptions
- Open questions

### Step 3: Fill Context & Goal

From `requirements.md`:

- Summarize the problem and motivation
- State the clear goal and success criteria

### Step 4: Reference Requirements

**Do NOT duplicate requirements** — reference `requirements.md`:

```markdown
## Requirements Summary

See `requirements.md` for full EARS-format requirements.

| ID      | Title                 | Priority  |
| ------- | --------------------- | --------- |
| REQ-001 | User-initiated logout | Must Have |
| REQ-002 | Token clearing        | Must Have |
| REQ-003 | Post-logout redirect  | Must Have |
| REQ-004 | Error handling        | Must Have |
```

### Step 5: Define Acceptance Criteria

Map requirements to testable acceptance criteria:

```markdown
## Acceptance Criteria

- AC1.1: Logout button clears authentication token
- AC1.2: User is redirected to login page after logout
- AC1.3: Confirmation message is displayed
- AC2.1: Network error shows error message
- AC2.2: User remains logged in on error
- AC2.3: Retry button appears on error
```

### Step 5: Add Design Notes

If non-trivial, document approach:

- Architecture decisions
- Key algorithms or data structures
- Sequence diagrams for primary flows

```markdown
## Design Notes

The logout flow will:

1. Call `/api/auth/logout` endpoint
2. Clear local storage token on success
3. Update auth context state
4. Router will redirect based on auth state change

Sequence diagram:

\`\`\`mermaid
sequenceDiagram
autonumber
participant User
participant UI
participant AuthService
participant API
User->>UI: Click logout
UI->>AuthService: logout()
AuthService->>API: POST /api/auth/logout
API-->>AuthService: 200 OK
AuthService->>AuthService: clearToken()
AuthService-->>UI: Success
UI->>UI: Redirect to /login
UI-->>User: Show confirmation
\`\`\`
```

### Step 6: Generate Task List

Break down requirements into concrete tasks:

```markdown
## Task List

- [ ] Add logout button to UserMenu component
- [ ] Implement AuthService.logout() method
- [ ] Create /api/auth/logout endpoint
- [ ] Add error handling for network failures
- [ ] Update router to redirect on auth state change
- [ ] Add confirmation message toast
```

### Step 7: Map Test Plan

Map each acceptance criterion to test cases:

```markdown
## Test Plan

- AC1.1 → `__tests__/auth-service.test.ts`: "should clear token on logout"
- AC1.2 → `__tests__/auth-router.test.ts`: "should redirect to /login after logout"
- AC1.3 → `__tests__/user-menu.test.ts`: "should show confirmation message"
- AC2.1 → `__tests__/auth-service.test.ts`: "should show error on network failure"
- AC2.2 → `__tests__/auth-service.test.ts`: "should keep user logged in on error"
- AC2.3 → `__tests__/user-menu.test.ts`: "should show retry button on error"
```

### Step 8: Record Initial Decision

Add to Decision & Work Log:

```markdown
## Decision & Work Log

- 2026-01-14: Spec created from requirements.md
- 2026-01-14: Decision - Use toast for confirmation (consistent with existing patterns)
```

### Step 8b: Set E2E Testing Opt-Out (if applicable)

If the spec covers work that does not benefit from end-to-end testing, add opt-out fields to the YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
e2e_skip: true
e2e_skip_rationale: pure-refactor
```

**Valid `e2e_skip_rationale` values** (strict enum):

| Value           | Use When                                    |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `pure-refactor` | No new behavior to test end-to-end          |
| `test-infra`    | Changes to test infrastructure itself       |
| `type-only`     | Type-level changes with no runtime behavior |
| `docs-only`     | Documentation-only changes                  |

**Rules**:

- `e2e_skip` must be a boolean (`true` or `false`), not a string
- When `e2e_skip: true`, `e2e_skip_rationale` is required
- When `e2e_skip` is absent or `false`, e2e-test-writer is dispatched by default
- If the reason for skipping does not fit one of the four categories, use a gate override instead

### Step 9: Write spec.md

Save to spec group:

```
.claude/specs/groups/<spec-group-id>/spec.md
```

### Step 10: Update manifest.json

Update the spec group manifest:

```json
{
  "convergence": {
    "spec_complete": true
  },
  "decision_log": [
    // ... existing entries ...
    {
      "timestamp": "<ISO timestamp>",
      "actor": "agent",
      "action": "spec_authored",
      "details": "spec.md created with X ACs, Y tasks"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 11: Report Completion

```markdown
## Spec Created ✅

**Spec Group**: <spec-group-id>
**Location**: .claude/specs/groups/<spec-group-id>/spec.md

**Summary**:

- X acceptance criteria mapped to requirements
- Y tasks identified
- Z open questions

**Next Steps**:

1. Review spec: `.claude/specs/groups/<spec-group-id>/spec.md`

**For oneoff-spec workflow:**

2. (Optional) Run `/investigate <spec-group-id>` if cross-spec dependencies exist
3. User approves → `review_state: APPROVED`
4. Run `/implement <spec-group-id>` + `/test <spec-group-id>` (parallel)

**For orchestrator workflow:**

2. Run `/atomize <spec-group-id>` to decompose into atomic specs
3. Run `/enforce <spec-group-id>` to validate atomicity
4. User approves → `review_state: APPROVED`
5. Run `/implement <spec-group-id>` + `/test <spec-group-id>` (parallel)
```

## Process: Complex Specs (WorkstreamSpec-level detail)

For complex features requiring sequence diagrams and interface definitions:

### Additional Sections Required

Follow the template structure:

1. **Context**: Background and motivation
2. **Goals / Non-goals**: Explicit boundaries
3. **Requirements**: Atomic, testable requirements (EARS format)
4. **Core Flows**: Primary user flows and system behaviors
5. **Sequence Diagram(s)**: At least one Mermaid diagram
6. **Edge Cases**: Failure scenarios and unusual conditions
7. **Interfaces & Data Model**: Contracts, APIs, data structures
8. **Security**: Security considerations and requirements
9. **Additional Considerations**: Best practices, docs, memory bank updates
10. **Task List**: Discrete tasks with dependencies
11. **Testing**: Testing strategy and coverage
12. **Open Questions**: Unresolved questions with status
13. **Workstream Reflection**: (Fill during/after implementation)
14. **Decision & Work Log**: Decisions and approvals

### Step 3: Define Contracts

If this workstream creates interfaces used by others:

```yaml
contracts:
  - id: contract-auth-service
    type: API
    path: src/services/auth.service.ts
    version: 1.0
```

Add to contract registry in MasterSpec (if applicable).

### Step 4: Identify Dependencies

List other workstreams this depends on:

```yaml
dependencies:
  - ws-database-schema
  - ws-api-gateway
```

## Process: MasterSpec Coordination

For large multi-workstream efforts, coordinate parallel spec authoring.

### Step 1: Create ProblemBrief

Start with high-level brief:

```bash
cp .claude/templates/master-spec.template.md .claude/specs/groups/<spec-group-id>/spec.md
```

Fill Problem Brief section from /prd discovery.

### Step 2: Identify Workstreams

Decompose into parallel workstreams:

- Each workstream should be independently executable
- Minimize cross-workstream coupling
- Identify clear contracts/interfaces between workstreams

Example workstream breakdown:

```markdown
## Workstream Overview

| ID   | Title                | Owner         | Estimated Effort |
| ---- | -------------------- | ------------- | ---------------- |
| ws-1 | WebSocket Server     | spec-author-1 | 6-8h             |
| ws-2 | Frontend Client      | spec-author-2 | 4-6h             |
| ws-3 | Notification Service | spec-author-3 | 6-8h             |
```

### Step 3: Dispatch Spec-Author Subagents

Use Task tool to create workstream specs in parallel:

```javascript
// Dispatch subagent for ws-1
Task({
  description: 'Author WebSocket Server workstream spec',
  prompt: `Create a WorkstreamSpec for the WebSocket Server workstream.

Context from ProblemBrief:
<paste relevant context>

Your scope:
- WebSocket server infrastructure
- Authentication middleware
- Message routing

Contracts you provide:
- contract-websocket-api: Client connection API

Dependencies:
- ws-3 (Notification Service provides messages)

Follow the WorkstreamSpec template at .claude/templates/workstream-spec.template.md`,
  subagent_type: 'spec-author',
});
```

Dispatch one subagent per workstream.

### Step 4: Collect and Review

Review completed workstream specs:

- Check for missing sections
- Verify contracts are registered
- Confirm dependencies are valid (no cycles)

### Step 5: Merge into MasterSpec

Update MasterSpec with:

- Links to workstream specs
- Contract registry (consolidated)
- Dependency graph
- Gates & acceptance criteria

```markdown
## Contract Registry

| Contract ID               | Type | Owner Workstream | Path                          | Version |
| ------------------------- | ---- | ---------------- | ----------------------------- | ------- |
| contract-websocket-api    | API  | ws-1             | src/websocket/server.ts       | 1.0     |
| contract-notification-api | API  | ws-3             | src/services/notifications.ts | 1.0     |

## Cross-Workstream Dependencies

```

### Step 5.5: Determine Worktree Allocation

Analyze dependency graph and workstream coupling to allocate worktrees:

**Allocation Analysis**:

1. **Identify independent workstreams**:
   - No shared files
   - No tight coupling
   - Can execute fully in parallel
   - → Assign separate worktrees

2. **Identify tightly coupled workstreams**:
   - Implementation + tests for same feature
   - Sequential modifications to same files
   - One workstream's output is immediate input to another
   - → Share worktree

3. **Consider dependency ordering**:
   - Workstreams with no dependencies can start immediately
   - Dependent workstreams blocked until prerequisites merge
   - Document merge order in allocation strategy

**Example Allocation**:

```markdown
# Analyzing 4 workstreams

ws-1: Backend API (no dependencies, independent) → worktree-1
ws-2: Frontend UI (depends on ws-1, independent from ws-3) → worktree-2
ws-3: Database schema (no dependencies, independent) → worktree-3
ws-4: Integration tests (tests ws-1, tight coupling) → worktree-1 (shared with ws-1)

**Rationale**:

- ws-1 and ws-4 share worktree: ws-4 tests ws-1 implementation (tight coupling)
- ws-2 separate: Independent frontend work, no file conflicts with backend
- ws-3 separate: Independent database work, can run in parallel

**Merge Order**:

1. ws-1 (no dependencies) + ws-4 (tests ws-1) → Merge together from worktree-1
2. ws-2 (depends on ws-1) → Blocked until ws-1 merges
3. ws-3 (no dependencies) → Can merge anytime (parallel with ws-1)
```

**Document in MasterSpec**:
Add worktree allocation strategy to MasterSpec:

```markdown
## Worktree Allocation Strategy

**Strategy**: ws-1 and ws-4 share worktree (tight coupling), ws-2 and ws-3 isolated (independent)

| Worktree ID | Branch                       | Workstreams | Rationale                      |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------ |
| worktree-1  | feature/ws-1-backend-api     | ws-1, ws-4  | ws-4 tests ws-1 implementation |
| worktree-2  | feature/ws-2-frontend-ui     | ws-2        | Independent frontend work      |
| worktree-3  | feature/ws-3-database-schema | ws-3        | Independent database work      |

**Merge Order**:

1. ws-1+ws-4 (no dependencies)
2. ws-3 (no dependencies) - can merge in parallel with ws-1
3. ws-2 (depends on ws-1) - blocked until ws-1 merges
```

Update Workstream Overview table with Worktree column.

### Step 6: Validate Gates

Check spec-complete gates:

- [ ] All workstream specs approved
- [ ] Contract registry complete and validated
- [ ] No unresolved cross-workstream conflicts
- [ ] Dependency graph is acyclic
- [ ] All critical open questions resolved or deferred

## Spec is Contract Principle

**Critical constraint**: Spec is the authoritative source of truth.

- Implementation must conform to spec
- Tests must verify spec requirements
- Any deviation requires spec amendment first
- Spec updates require user approval

If during implementation you discover:

- Missing requirements → Add to spec Open Questions, get approval
- Invalid assumptions → Update spec, note in Decision Log
- Better approaches → Propose spec amendment before implementing

**Never deviate silently from the spec.**

## Spec Approval Process

Before implementation begins:

1. **Present spec summary** to user
2. **Highlight key decisions** and assumptions
3. **Call out open questions** that need resolution
4. **Request approval** to proceed
5. **Record approval** in Decision & Work Log with date

Example approval request:

```markdown
## Spec Ready for Approval

I've created a TaskSpec for adding the logout button.

**Key decisions**:

- Using toast for confirmation (consistent with existing patterns)
- Network errors keep user logged in and allow retry

**Open questions**:

- Should we add keyboard shortcut (Cmd+L) for logout? (Low priority, can defer)

**Task list**: 6 tasks, estimated 2-3 hours

May I proceed with implementation?
```

## Integration with Spec Group Workflow

After spec creation:

```
/prd → requirements.md
  ↓
/spec → spec.md (YOU ARE HERE)
  ↓
  ├── [oneoff-spec workflow]
  │     ↓
  │   (optional) /investigate
  │     ↓
  │   User approves → review_state: APPROVED
  │     ↓
  │   /implement + /test (parallel)
  │
  └── [orchestrator workflow]
        ↓
      /atomize → atomic/*.md
        ↓
      /enforce → validation
        ↓
      User approves → review_state: APPROVED
        ↓
      /implement + /test (parallel, per atomic spec)
  ↓
/unify → convergence validation
  ↓
/code-review + /security
  ↓
Merge
```

### State After /spec Completes

```json
{
  "review_state": "DRAFT", // Still needs user review
  "work_state": "PLAN_READY", // Ready for approval (oneoff-spec) or atomization (orchestrator)
  "convergence": {
    "spec_complete": true // Spec authored
  }
}
```

### Handoff After /spec

After `/spec` creates `spec.md`:

**For oneoff-spec workflow:**

1. User reviews spec
2. (Optional) Run `/investigate <spec-group-id>` if cross-spec dependencies exist
3. User approves → `review_state: APPROVED`
4. Implementation begins with `/implement` + `/test`

**For orchestrator workflow:**

1. User reviews spec
2. Run `/atomize <spec-group-id>` to decompose into atomic specs
3. Run `/enforce <spec-group-id>` to validate atomicity
4. User approves → `review_state: APPROVED`
5. Implementation begins

## Examples
