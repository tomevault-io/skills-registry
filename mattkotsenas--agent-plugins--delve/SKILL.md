# Delve — Interactive Diff Review

Walk a reviewer through a diff one cohesive chunk at a time. Collect comments as structured TODOs that a downstream
agent can act on.

---

## Phase 1: Choose Diff Baseline

**Always prompt the user to choose.** Suggest a default based on session history, but never auto-select.

Present these options:

- **Merge base** — changes since the branch diverged from the merge target
  *(default if this is the first diff action in the session)*
- **Last session** — changes since the previous delve session
  *(default if a prior delve session exists)*
- **Last change** — uncommitted changes if any exist, otherwise the last commit
- **Custom ref** — user provides a base and/or head ref

After the user chooses, store the baseline in session state (see Phase 6).

### Resolving the baseline to git refs

| Choice       | base ref                                     | head ref     |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------|
| Merge base   | `git merge-base HEAD <target-branch>`        | `HEAD`       |
| Last session | stored ref from previous session             | `HEAD`       |
| Last change  | `HEAD` (if uncommitted) or `HEAD~1`          | working tree or `HEAD` |
| Custom ref   | user-provided                                | user-provided or `HEAD` |

If the target branch is unknown, ask the user. Common defaults: `main`, `master`, or the repo's default branch.

---

## Phase 2: Acquire the Diff

1. Run `git diff --stat <base> <head>` to get the file-level summary.
2. For each changed file, run `git diff <base> <head> -- <file>` to get the full unified diff.
3. Parse each file diff into **atomic hunks**. A hunk is one contiguous block of changes (one `@@` section in unified
  diff format).
4. For every hunk, record metadata:
   - **file path**
   - **change type**: added / modified / deleted / renamed
   - **enclosing symbol**: the function, method, or class the hunk sits inside (read the `@@` context line and
     surrounding code to determine this)
   - **symbols referenced**: any functions, types, or variables that appear in the changed lines

Process files one at a time to keep context usage bounded. Store hunk metadata as you go rather than holding every diff
in context simultaneously.

---

## Phase 3: Plan the Chunk Order

Group and order hunks into **chunks** — each chunk is a set of related hunks that the reviewer will see together on one
screen.

### 3.1 Constraints (co-optimize all four)

> [!NOTE]
> The **screen-fit target** is ~40 lines of diff per chunk. This value is
> referenced throughout this skill.

1. **Screen fit** — a chunk should fit comfortably on one screen (within the screen-fit target). If a single hunk
  exceeds this, it becomes its own chunk.
2. **High cohesion** — group hunks that belong to the same logical change: same function, same module, same feature.
3. **Utility function placement**:
   - Show utility functions **first** if understanding them is required to comprehend later chunks.
   - Show utility functions **last** if they are self-evident or rarely called.
4. **Call flow** — prefer showing function implementations before their call sites. The reader should understand *what*
  a function does before seeing *where* it's used.

### 3.2 Heuristic: Build a Symbol Graph

1. From the hunk metadata, build a graph:
   - Nodes = symbols (functions, classes, methods) that were changed or referenced in changed lines.
   - Edges = call/reference relationships (implementation → call site).
2. Score each potential chunk grouping by:
   - **Cohesion**: how many hunks in the chunk share the same symbol or module.
   - **Dependency direction**: does the chunk show implementations before uses?
   - **Screen fit**: is the total diff size within the screen-fit target?
   - **Utility likelihood**: is this a standalone helper? (heuristic: small function, many callers, few dependencies)
3. Greedily assemble chunks that maximize the combined score.

### 3.3 Output: the Diff Plan

Store the ordered list of chunks with their hunk assignments. This is the **Diff Plan** - the sequence the reviewer will
walk through.

### 3.4 Generate and Validate Chunk Files

Before showing the Diff Plan to the user, verify that each planned chunk fits within the screen-fit target and then
generate the final chunk files. This step is mandatory - do not skip it.

1. **Measure line counts before writing files.** For each planned chunk, check how many lines its diff would produce
  WITHOUT writing to a file:
   - **Unix:** `git diff <base> <head> -- <file1> [<file2>...] | wc -l`
   - **Windows:** `git diff <base> <head> -- <file1> [<file2>...] | Measure-Object -Line`

2. **Re-plan any chunk that exceeds 40 lines:**
   - If it contains hunks from **multiple files**: split into one chunk per file and re-measure.
   - If it contains **multiple hunks from one file**: split into one chunk per hunk and re-measure.
   - If a **single hunk** still exceeds 40 lines: keep it as one chunk. It will be displayed with `view_range`
    pagination in Phase 4.

3. **Write all chunk files in one pass** once every chunk is validated. Use sequential numbering and output redirection
  (no diff content in stdout):
   ```
   git diff <base> <head> -- <file1> [<file2>...] > <session-dir>/delve-chunk-01.diff
   git diff <base> <head> -- <file3> > <session-dir>/delve-chunk-02.diff
   ```
   Where `<session-dir>` is the session workspace directory.

4. **Show the user** the validated Diff Plan:
   - Number of chunks
   - Files covered
   - Estimated review time (rough: ~1 min per 30 lines of diff)

---

## Phase 4: Review Loop

Walk through the Diff Plan one chunk at a time. All chunk diff files were pre-generated in Phase 3.4 - no shell commands
are needed during the review loop.

### For each chunk:

1. **Display the chunk** using `show_file`:
   - If the chunk file is **≤ 40 lines**:
     ```
     show_file(path: "<session-dir>/delve-chunk-NN.diff")
     ```
   - If the chunk file is **> 40 lines** (a single oversized hunk from
     Phase 3.4 step 3):
     ```
     show_file(path: "<session-dir>/delve-chunk-NN.diff", view_range: [1, 40])
     ```
     Tell the user the chunk continues beyond what is shown. If they ask to see more, show the next 40-line window with
     an updated `view_range`.

2. **Prompt the user** with a structured form using `ask_user`:
   ```json
   {
     "message": "Chunk N/M: <file path(s)> — <symbol(s)>",
     "requestedSchema": {
       "properties": {
         "comment": {
           "type": "string",
           "title": "Comment (optional)",
           "description": "Leave feedback on this chunk. Each submission = 1 TODO."
         },
         "action": {
           "type": "string",
           "title": "Action",
           "enum": ["Next", "Comment & stay", "Previous", "Done"],
           "enumNames": ["Next →", "💬 Comment & stay", "← Previous", "Done ✓"],
           "default": "Next"
         }
       },
       "required": ["action"]
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Process the response:**
   - If `comment` is provided: create a TODO (Phase 5).
   - If `action` = **"Next"**: advance to the next chunk (with or without a comment). After leaving one or more
    comments, flip the default to "Next".
   - If `action` = **"Comment & stay"**: capture the TODO and re-display the same chunk's form for another comment.
   - If `action` = **"Previous"**: go back one chunk. On the first chunk, tell the user they are at the start.
   - If `action` = **"Done"**: skip to Phase 7.
   - If the user **declines** the form (cancels without submitting): treat as "Next" with no comment.

4. **"Next" on the last chunk** triggers completion (Phase 7).

---

## Phase 5: Capture TODOs

Every comment the reviewer leaves becomes a TODO for a downstream agent.

### TODO structure

Each TODO must include:

| Field              | Description                                                |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **comment**        | The reviewer's comment, verbatim.                          |
| **file_path**      | File(s) the chunk covers.                                  |
| **symbol**         | Enclosing function/class/method name(s).                   |
| **excerpt**        | A short (3–5 line) excerpt of the relevant changed code.   |
| **content_anchor** | A content-based anchor: the first non-blank changed line   |
|                    | in the hunk. NOT a line number (those drift on rebase).    |

### Where to store TODOs (tiered — use the first available option)

1. **TodoWrite / built-in todo tool** — if the session has a todo or task creation tool, write each TODO there.
2. **External task tracker** — if a tool like Trekker is available, create issues/tasks there.
3. **Session file fallback** — write TODOs as a JSON array to a file in the session workspace (e.g., `delve-todos.json`).
4. **Context fallback** — if none of the above are available, output the TODO list directly in the conversation for the
  user to copy.

---

## Phase 6: Session State

Persist the following across the session so the review can be resumed or referenced later.

| Key                | Value                                            |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `delve_baseline`   | The chosen baseline (type + resolved refs)       |
| `delve_head_ref`   | The HEAD ref at review start (for "last session")|
| `delve_plan`       | The ordered list of chunks with hunk assignments |
| `delve_position`   | Current chunk index                              |
| `delve_completed`  | Set of chunk indices the user has visited        |
| `delve_todos`      | List of TODOs with context anchors               |

### Storage strategy (tiered — use the first available option)

1. **SQL tool** — if available, create a `delve_state` table:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS delve_state (
     key   TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
     value TEXT
   );
   ```
   Store each key/value pair as a row. Values are JSON-encoded.

2. **Session file fallback** — write state as a single JSON file in the session workspace (e.g., `delve-state.json`).

At the **start of a new delve session**, check for existing state:
- If `delve_head_ref` exists from a prior session, offer it as the "Last session" baseline option.
- If `delve_plan` exists and the baseline hasn't changed, offer to resume the previous review from `delve_position`.

---

## Phase 7: Completion

When the user advances past the last chunk:

1. **Summarize the review:**
   - Total chunks reviewed
   - Number of TODOs captured
   - Files covered

2. **If TODOs exist**, offer to:
   - List all TODOs with their context anchors
   - Revisit a specific TODO's chunk
   - Hand off the TODO list to an implementation agent

3. **Update session state:**
   - Store the current HEAD as `delve_head_ref` so the next session can offer "changes since last session" as a baseline.

---

## Quick Reference

```
/delve
  1. Choose baseline  →  merge base / last session / last change / custom
  2. Acquire diff     →  git diff per file, parse into hunks
  3. Plan chunks      →  group by cohesion, order by call flow
     Validate chunks  →  generate .diff files, enforce ≤ 40 lines, split if needed
  4. Review loop      →  show_file chunk → ask_user (action + comment) → repeat
  5. Capture TODOs    →  structured TODOs with content anchors
  6. Complete         →  summary + TODO handoff
```
