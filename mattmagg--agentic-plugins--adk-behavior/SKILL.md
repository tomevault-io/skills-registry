# ADK Behavior & Memory

Guide for customizing agent behavior through callbacks, state, artifacts, events, memory, and grounding. Enables interception of execution, state persistence (session and long-term), human-in-the-loop workflows, and knowledge grounding.

## When to Use

- Intercepting LLM calls or tool executions
- Persisting data across conversation turns (session state)
- Persisting memories across conversations (MemoryService)
- Implementing human approval workflows
- Handling file uploads and artifacts
- Customizing event flow control
- Grounding responses in knowledge bases (RAG)
- Building agents that learn user preferences
- Connecting to Vertex AI Search datastores

## When NOT to Use

- Creating agents from scratch → Use `@adk-core` instead
- Adding tools → Use `@adk-tools` instead
- Multi-agent orchestration → Use `@adk-multi-agent` instead

## Key Concepts

### Behavior Customization

**Callbacks** intercept lifecycle events: `before_model_callback`, `after_model_callback`, `before_tool_callback`, `after_tool_callback`. Return content to override default behavior.

**Session State** persists data across conversation turns via `ctx.state`. Access with `get()` and update with dictionary assignment.

**Plugins** bundle reusable callbacks. Create custom plugins for logging, security, or monitoring.

**Artifacts** handle binary data and file uploads. Store files via artifact service for multi-turn access.

**EventActions** control flow: skip steps, escalate to parent, terminate session.

**Human-in-the-Loop** requires confirmation before sensitive actions by returning confirmation prompts from callbacks.

### Memory & Grounding

**Session State** persists within a conversation but is lost when session ends. Use `ctx.state` for temporary data.

**MemoryService** provides long-term memory across sessions. Agents can remember facts, preferences, and context over time.

**Grounding (RAG)** connects agents to external knowledge bases. Use Vertex AI Search or custom vector stores to retrieve relevant context before responding.

**Knowledge Attribution** enables agents to cite sources when grounding responses, improving transparency and trust.
