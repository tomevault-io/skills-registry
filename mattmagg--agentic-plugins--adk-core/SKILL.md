# ADK Core

Comprehensive guide for initializing Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) projects and creating agents. Covers project setup, authentication, agent configuration, and model selection.

## When to Use

**Project Setup:**
- Starting a new ADK project from scratch
- Setting up authentication (API key or Vertex AI)
- Understanding ADK project structure
- Choosing between Python and YAML configuration
- Running agents locally for development

**Agent Creation:**
- Creating a new ADK agent from scratch
- Configuring agent parameters (model, name, instruction, description)
- Using non-Gemini models (Claude, OpenAI via LiteLLM)
- Building custom agents without LLM reasoning

## When NOT to Use

- Adding tools to agents → Use `@adk-tools` instead
- Multi-agent orchestration → Use `@adk-multi-agent` instead
- Callbacks and state management → Use `@adk-behavior` instead
- Deploying to production → Use `@adk-deployment` instead
- Memory and knowledge management → Use `@adk-memory` instead

## Key Concepts

### Project Initialization

**Installation**: `pip install google-adk` in Python 3.10+ virtual environment. Verify with `adk --version`.

**Project Creation**: `adk create <name>` scaffolds a new agent project with `agent.py`, `__init__.py`, and `.env`.

**Authentication Options**: Google AI Studio (GOOGLE_API_KEY) for prototyping, Vertex AI (GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT) for production.

**Running Agents**: `adk run` for CLI, `adk web` for development UI, `adk api_server` for HTTP API.

**YAML Configuration**: Declarative agent definition without Python code. Quick prototyping for simple agents.

**Project Structure**: `agent.py` exports `root_agent`. ADK CLI discovers and runs the exported agent.

### Agent Types

**LlmAgent** is the standard agent type for AI reasoning, conversation, and tool use. Requires `model` and `name` parameters. Use `instruction` for system prompts and `description` for routing in multi-agent systems.

**BaseAgent** is for custom non-LLM logic. Extend it and implement `run_async()` to yield responses. Use when you need deterministic behavior or external API orchestration.

**Model Selection**: Default to `gemini-3-flash-preview`. Use LiteLLM prefix for other providers (e.g., `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4`).
