# ADK Orchestration

Guide for building multi-agent systems with delegation, orchestration, inter-agent communication, and real-time streaming capabilities. Enables specialized agents to collaborate on complex tasks with modern communication patterns.

## When to Use

### Multi-Agent Systems
- Routing requests to specialized sub-agents
- Building agent pipelines (sequential execution)
- Running agents concurrently (parallel execution)
- Creating hierarchical agent teams
- Cross-system agent communication (A2A)

### Streaming & Real-Time
- Streaming text responses as they generate
- Real-time chat with user interrupts
- Voice agent interactions (Live API)
- Video processing and multimodal streaming
- WebSocket bidirectional communication

## When NOT to Use

- Single agent with tools → Use `@adk-agents` and `@adk-tools` instead
- Callbacks and state → Use `@adk-behavior` instead
- Agent deployment → Use `@adk-deployment` instead

## Key Concepts

### Multi-Agent Patterns

**Delegation** routes requests to sub-agents based on their descriptions. The parent agent decides which child handles each request.

**SequentialAgent** executes sub-agents in order (A → B → C). Each agent receives the previous agent's output.

**ParallelAgent** runs sub-agents concurrently. Results are aggregated when all complete.

**LoopAgent** repeats execution until a condition is met. Useful for iterative refinement.

**Hierarchy** nests agent teams for complex organizations. Parent agents coordinate child teams.

**A2A Protocol** enables cross-system agent communication. Agents can call agents in other deployments.

### Streaming Patterns

**SSE (Server-Sent Events)** streams text responses incrementally. Client receives partial responses as they generate.

**Bidirectional Streaming** enables real-time two-way communication. Users can interrupt agent responses mid-stream.

**Live API** powers voice and video agents. Use `gemini-3-flash-live` model for real-time audio/video processing.

**Runner Types**: `Runner` for basic execution, `BidiStreamingRunner` for bidirectional, `LiveAPIRunner` for voice/video.
