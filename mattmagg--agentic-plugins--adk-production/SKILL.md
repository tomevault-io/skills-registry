# ADK Production

Complete guide for deploying, securing, testing, and monitoring ADK agents in production. Covers deployment platforms, security guardrails, authentication, testing frameworks, tracing, and observability.

## When to Use

**Deployment:**
- Deploying agents to production
- Choosing between hosting options (Agent Engine, Cloud Run, GKE)
- Configuring auto-scaling
- Setting up CI/CD for agents
- Integrating with Vertex AI services

**Security:**
- Validating or filtering user input
- Filtering agent responses before delivery
- Implementing OAuth or API key authentication
- Creating reusable security plugins
- Blocking unsafe topics or content

**Quality & Testing:**
- Creating test suites for agents
- Evaluating agent responses against criteria
- Debugging execution with tracing
- Setting up production monitoring
- Automated testing with synthetic users

## When NOT to Use

- Local development → Use `@adk-getting-started` instead
- Agent creation → Use `@adk-agents` instead
- Tool integration → Use `@adk-tools` instead
- General callbacks → Use `@adk-behavior` instead
- Multi-agent systems → Use `@adk-multi-agent` instead

## Key Concepts

### Deployment

**Agent Engine** is the recommended managed deployment. Auto-scales, integrates with Vertex AI services, no infrastructure management.

**Cloud Run** offers container control with serverless scaling. Build custom Docker images for more control over the runtime.

**GKE (Kubernetes)** provides enterprise-scale deployment. Full control over infrastructure, networking, and scaling policies.

**Deployment CLI**: `adk deploy` handles Agent Engine deployment. For Cloud Run/GKE, containerize with `adk api_server`.

**Environment Configuration**: Use environment variables for credentials. Never commit secrets to source control.

### Security

**Input Guardrails** validate user input before processing. Use `before_model_callback` to block or modify unsafe requests.

**Output Guardrails** filter agent responses before returning to users. Use `after_model_callback` to redact PII, profanity, or sensitive data.

**Authentication** secures tool access. Configure OAuth credentials for Google APIs or custom authentication for third-party services.

**Security Plugins** bundle reusable security callbacks. Create plugins for logging, rate limiting, or content moderation.

**Credential Management** uses environment variables and secure storage. Never hardcode secrets in agent code.

### Quality & Testing

**Evaluations (Evals)** test agent behavior against expected outputs. Define test cases with inputs and expected results, measure pass rates.

**Tracing** captures execution flow for debugging. Cloud Trace integration shows LLM calls, tool executions, and timing.

**Logging** provides structured event capture. Use LoggingPlugin for consistent log formatting and levels.

**Observability** integrates with third-party platforms (AgentOps, LangSmith) for production monitoring and analytics.

**User Simulation** automates testing with synthetic conversations. Generate diverse test scenarios without manual testing.
