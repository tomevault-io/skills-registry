# Laravel 12 Development Skill

This skill provides comprehensive guidance for developing high-quality Laravel 12 applications using modern best practices, proper architecture patterns, and Laravel's streamlined structure.

## Purpose

Provide expert-level Laravel 12 development guidance covering:
- Modern Laravel 12 streamlined architecture and file structure
- Eloquent ORM patterns with proper type hints and relationships
- Authentication and authorization using current best practices
- Form validation with Form Request classes
- Queue and job management for background processing
- Database migrations, models, and API development
- Testing patterns and conventions
- Configuration and environment management

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- Creating or working with Laravel 12 applications
- Building models, controllers, migrations, or any Laravel components
- Implementing authentication or authorization
- Creating APIs with Eloquent resources
- Writing database queries or working with relationships
- Setting up queues and background jobs
- Writing form validation
- Configuring Laravel applications
- Following Laravel best practices and conventions
- Ensuring proper Laravel 12 structure compliance

## Core Principles

### 1. Use Artisan Commands

Always create files using `php artisan make:` commands with appropriate options:

```bash
# Models with migrations, factories, seeders
php artisan make:model Post -mfs

# Form Requests for validation
php artisan make:request StorePostRequest

# Controllers
php artisan make:controller PostController --resource

# Jobs
php artisan make:job ProcessPodcast

# Generic PHP classes
php artisan make:class Services/PaymentService
```

**Important**: Pass `--no-interaction` when running commands programmatically.

### 2. Follow Laravel 12 Streamlined Structure

Laravel 12 uses a simplified structure:
- **No `app/Http/Middleware/`** directory - register middleware in `bootstrap/app.php`
- **No `app/Console/Kernel.php`** - use `bootstrap/app.php` or `routes/console.php`
- **Commands auto-register** from `app/Console/Commands/`
- Central configuration in `bootstrap/app.php` for middleware, routing, exceptions

Read `references/structure.md` for complete details on Laravel 12 architecture.

### 3. Authentication: Always Use $request->user()

**CRITICAL**: Always retrieve authenticated user via `$request->user()`, never use `auth()->user()` or `Auth::user()`:

```php
// ✅ CORRECT
public function index(Request $request): Response
{
    $user = $request->user();
    // ...
}

// ❌ WRONG
public function index(): Response
{
    $user = auth()->user();  // Don't do this
}
```

Read `references/authentication.md` for complete authentication and authorization guidance.

### 4. Database: Eloquent Over DB Facade

Prefer Eloquent models and relationships over raw queries:

```php
// ✅ PREFER
$users = User::query()->where('active', true)->get();

// ❌ AVOID
$users = DB::table('users')->where('active', true)->get();
```

**Prevent N+1 queries** by eager loading relationships:

```php
// ✅ GOOD - Prevents N+1
$posts = Post::with('user', 'comments')->get();

// ❌ BAD - Causes N+1
$posts = Post::all();
foreach ($posts as $post) {
    echo $post->user->name; // New query each iteration
}
```

Read `references/database.md` for Eloquent patterns, relationships, migrations, and query optimization.

### 5. Validation: Always Use Form Requests

Never use inline validation. Always create Form Request classes:

```bash
php artisan make:request StorePostRequest
```

Form Requests should include:
- Validation rules (check project conventions for array vs string format)
- Custom error messages
- Authorization logic when needed

```php
public function rules(): array
{
    return [
        'title' => ['required', 'string', 'max:255'],
        'body' => ['required', 'string'],
    ];
}
```

Read `references/validation.md` for complete validation patterns and examples.

### 6. Configuration: Never Use env() Outside Config Files

```php
// ❌ WRONG
$apiKey = env('API_KEY');

// ✅ CORRECT
$apiKey = config('services.api.key');
```

Environment variables should only be accessed in `config/*.php` files, then accessed via `config()` helper throughout the application.

### 7. Background Processing: Use Queues

Use queued jobs with `ShouldQueue` interface for time-consuming operations:

```bash
php artisan make:job ProcessPodcast
```

```php
class ProcessPodcast implements ShouldQueue
{
    use Dispatchable, InteractsWithQueue, Queueable, SerializesModels;
    
    public int $tries = 3;
    public int $timeout = 120;
    
    public function __construct(public Podcast $podcast) {}
    
    public function handle(): void
    {
        $this->podcast->process();
    }
}
```

Read `references/queues.md` for queue patterns, job chains, batches, and worker management.

## Working with Models

### Model Creation

When creating models, use appropriate flags:

```bash
# Model with migration, factory, seeder
php artisan make:model Post -mfs

# Model with migration, factory, seeder, policy, controller
php artisan make:model Post -mfsc --policy
```

### Model Conventions

1. **Use return type hints** on relationships:
```php
public function posts(): HasMany
{
    return $this->hasMany(Post::class);
}
```

2. **Use `casts()` method** for type casting:
```php
protected function casts(): array
{
    return [
        'published_at' => 'datetime',
        'is_featured' => 'boolean',
        'metadata' => 'array',
    ];
}
```

3. **Use constructor property promotion**:
```php
public function __construct(
    public string $name,
    public int $age,
) {}
```

## Working with Controllers

1. **Type-hint Request** in controller methods
2. **Use resource controllers** for CRUD operations
3. **Return proper response types** with type hints
4. **Use Form Requests** for validation
5. **Keep controllers thin** - move business logic to services/actions

```php
public function store(StorePostRequest $request): RedirectResponse
{
    $post = Post::create($request->validated());
    
    return redirect()->route('posts.show', $post);
}
```

## API Development

Use Eloquent API Resources for consistent API responses:

```bash
php artisan make:resource PostResource
```

```php
class PostResource extends JsonResource
{
    public function toArray($request): array
    {
        return [
            'id' => $this->id,
            'title' => $this->title,
            'author' => new UserResource($this->whenLoaded('user')),
        ];
    }
}
```

## Migrations

**CRITICAL**: When modifying columns, include ALL previous attributes or they will be lost:

```php
// ❌ WRONG - Loses 'nullable' attribute
$table->string('email')->unique()->change();

// ✅ CORRECT - Preserves all attributes
$table->string('email')->nullable()->unique()->change();
```

## Reference Files

This skill includes detailed reference files for specific topics:

- **`references/structure.md`** - Laravel 12 file structure, Artisan commands, configuration
- **`references/authentication.md`** - Authentication, authorization, policies, gates
- **`references/database.md`** - Eloquent, relationships, migrations, queries, API resources
- **`references/validation.md`** - Form Requests, validation rules, custom messages
- **`references/queues.md`** - Jobs, queues, workers, chains, batches

Read the appropriate reference file(s) when working on related tasks to ensure following best practices.

## PHP Conventions

1. **Always use curly braces** for control structures, even single-line
2. **Use explicit return type declarations** for all methods
3. **Use PHP 8+ constructor property promotion**
4. **Use type hints** for method parameters
5. **Prefer PHPDoc blocks** over inline comments

```php
protected function isAccessible(User $user, ?string $path = null): bool
{
    // Implementation
}
```

## Best Practices Summary

2. ✅ Follow Laravel 12 streamlined structure
3. ✅ Always use `$request->user()` for authentication
4. ✅ Prefer Eloquent over DB facade
5. ✅ Always create Form Request classes for validation
6. ✅ Never use `env()` outside config files
7. ✅ Use queues for time-consuming operations
8. ✅ Add return type hints on relationships

11. ✅ Use named routes with `route()` helper
12. ✅ Use API Resources for APIs
13. ✅ Keep controllers thin
14. ✅ Write descriptive, type-safe code

## Common Tasks Workflow

### Creating a New Resource

1. Create model with migrations and factory: `php artisan make:model Post -mf`
2. Create Form Requests: `php artisan make:request StorePostRequest`
3. Create controller: `php artisan make:controller PostController --resource`
4. Create API resource (if needed): `php artisan make:resource PostResource`
5. Define routes in appropriate routes file with named routes
6. Write tests for all functionality

### Adding Authentication to Routes

1. Use middleware in route definition or `bootstrap/app.php`
2. Access user via `$request->user()`
3. Use policies for authorization
4. Return appropriate responses for unauthorized access

This skill ensures Laravel applications follow modern best practices, maintain clean architecture, and leverage Laravel 12's streamlined structure effectively.
