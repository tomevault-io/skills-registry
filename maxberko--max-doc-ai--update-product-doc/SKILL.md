# Update Product Documentation

Create or update comprehensive product documentation for features.

## Purpose

Generate professional, user-focused documentation that explains features clearly and includes visual aids (screenshots). Documentation is written in markdown and later synced to the Pylon knowledge base.

## Input

The user will provide:

1. **Feature name**: e.g., "Dashboards", "Workflow Automation"
2. **Category**: Documentation category (features, integrations, getting-started)
3. **CloudFront URLs**: Screenshot URLs from Pylon CDN (optional if updating existing)
4. **Optional context**: Specific aspects to cover, target audience

## Process

### Step 1: Research Feature Implementation

Use the Task tool with `subagent_type=Explore` to understand the feature:

**What to find:**

1. **Core Functionality:**
   - What does this feature do?
   - What problem does it solve?
   - Who is it for?

2. **User Flows:**
   - How do users access it?
   - What are the main workflows?
   - What actions can users take?

3. **Configuration:**
   - Are there settings or options?
   - What can be customized?
   - What are the defaults?

4. **Permissions & Access:**
   - Who can use this?
   - Are there role-based restrictions?
   - Any prerequisites?

5. **Integration Points:**
   - Does it connect to other features?
   - External integrations?
   - Data sources?

**Example:**
```
Task: Explore

Research the [Feature Name] feature implementation.

Please find:
1. Route/page components
2. Main functionality and user flows
3. Configuration options and settings
4. Database schema if relevant
5. Key capabilities and use cases

Focus on user-facing aspects, not internal implementation details.
```

### Step 2: Determine Documentation Structure

Based on your research, plan the documentation structure:

**Standard Structure:**

```markdown
# [Feature Name]

## Overview
- Brief introduction (2-3 sentences)
- Key benefits
- Who should use this
- Link to product (if applicable)

## Key Capabilities
- Capability 1: Description
- Capability 2: Description
- Capability 3: Description

## How It Works
- Step-by-step explanation
- Include screenshots at relevant points
- User perspective (not technical implementation)

## Configuration
- How to set it up
- Available options
- Best practices

## Use Cases
- Real-world scenarios
- Examples of how to use effectively

## FAQ
- Common questions
- Troubleshooting tips (basic only)

## Need Help?
- Support contact information
```

**Note:** Adjust structure based on feature type. Some sections may not be applicable.

### Step 3: Write Documentation

Write clear, user-focused documentation:

**Writing Guidelines:**

1. **Start with H2, not H1**: Pylon displays the title separately, so begin with ## Overview

2. **User-focused language:**
   - ✅ "You can customize your dashboard by..."
   - ❌ "The dashboard component implements..."

3. **Clear and concise:**
   - Short paragraphs (2-4 sentences)
   - Bullet points for lists
   - Active voice

4. **Embed screenshots:**
   ```markdown
   ![Dashboard overview](https://cloudfront.url/dashboard-overview.png)

   The main dashboard shows real-time metrics...
   ```

5. **Include console/app URLs** (if applicable):
   ```markdown
   Access dashboards at: `https://app.yourproduct.com/dashboards`
   ```

6. **No H1 heading:** Start directly with H2 sections

**Example Documentation:**

```markdown
## Overview

[Feature Name] helps teams [solve problem] by [key benefit]. With [Feature Name], you can [main capabilities in one sentence].

Access [Feature Name] at: `https://app.yourproduct.com/[feature-path]`

## Key Capabilities

### Step 4: Save Documentation File

Save the documentation to the correct location:

**File path:**
```
output/features/YYYY-MM-DD_[feature-slug]/[feature-slug].md
```

**Examples:**
- `output/features/2025-12-22_dashboards/dashboards.md`
- `output/features/2025-12-22_slack-integration/slack-integration.md`
- `output/features/2025-12-22_quickstart/quickstart.md`

**Filename convention:**
- Use kebab-case
- Descriptive but concise
- Match the feature name
- Organized by date for easy tracking

### Step 5: Verify Documentation

Check your documentation:

✅ **Structure:**
- Starts with H2 (not H1)
- Logical flow
- All sections present

✅ **Content:**
- Clear and user-focused
- No technical jargon
- Accurate information
- Complete coverage

✅ **Screenshots:**
- Embedded at appropriate points
- Using CloudFront URLs
- Alt text provided
- Relevant to surrounding content

✅ **Formatting:**
- Valid markdown
- Consistent style
- No broken links
- Proper code blocks

### Step 6: Document Results

Provide a summary:

```markdown
## Documentation Created: [Feature Name]

**File:** `output/features/YYYY-MM-DD_[feature-slug]/[feature-slug].md`
**Category:** [category]
**Word count:** ~[X] words
**Screenshots:** [X] embedded

### Structure:
- Overview
- Key Capabilities ([X] listed)
- How It Works ([X] workflows documented)

- Use Cases ([X] scenarios)
- FAQ ([X] questions)
- Support contact

### Screenshots Used:
1. [feature]-overview.png - [CloudFront URL]
2. [feature]-detail.png - [CloudFront URL]
[... list all ...]

### Next Steps:
1. Review documentation for accuracy
2. Sync to Pylon knowledge base using sync-docs skill
3. Include Pylon article URL in announcements
```

## Documentation Patterns by Category

### Features

Focus on:
- What the feature does
- How to use it
- Configuration options
- Common workflows

Length: 150-250 lines

### Integrations

Focus on:
- What service integrates with
- Setup process
- Authentication/authorization
- Available actions
- Troubleshooting

Length: 150-200 lines

### Getting Started

Focus on:
- Onboarding flow
- First-time setup
- Basic concepts
- Quick wins

Length: 100-150 lines

## Content Guidelines

### What to Include

✅ User benefits and value
✅ Step-by-step instructions
✅ Visual aids (screenshots)
✅ Configuration options
✅ Real-world examples
✅ Common questions

### What to Avoid

❌ Implementation details
❌ Code snippets (unless API docs)
❌ Internal terminology
❌ Assumptions about technical knowledge
❌ Marketing fluff
❌ Outdated information

## Troubleshooting

**Issue:** Can't find feature implementation in codebase

**Solution:**
- Search for related terms
- Check route definitions
- Look in frontend and backend
- Ask user for more context if genuinely unclear

**Issue:** Unclear what screenshots to use

**Solution:**
- Use overview screenshot in "Overview" section
- Use workflow screenshots in "How It Works"
- Use configuration screenshots in "Configuration"
- Place screenshots where they add context, not randomly

**Issue:** Feature too complex to document fully

**Solution:**
- Focus on main workflows (80% use cases)
- Link to advanced topics
- Keep it digestible
- Can create multiple docs for complex features

## Integration with Release Workflow

This skill is typically invoked as step 3 in the release workflow:

1. Capture screenshots (capture-screenshots skill)
2. Upload to Pylon CDN (sync-docs skill)
3. ✅ **Create documentation** ← You are here
4. Sync to Pylon (sync-docs skill)
5. Create announcements (create-changelog skill)

The CloudFront URLs from step 2 should be provided to this skill for embedding screenshots.
