# Audio Transcriber

Speech recognition using WhisperX with multi-language support and word-level timestamp alignment.

## Prerequisites

Requires Python 3.12 (uv manages this automatically).

## Usage

When the user wants to transcribe audio/video: $ARGUMENTS

## Instructions

### Step 1: Get input file

If the user has not provided an input file path, ask them to provide one.

Supported formats:
- Audio: MP3, WAV, FLAC, M4A, OGG, etc.
- Video: MP4, MKV, MOV, AVI, etc. (audio is extracted automatically)

Verify the file exists:

```bash
ls -la "$INPUT_FILE"
```

### Step 2: Ask user for configuration

**Warning: You MUST use AskUserQuestion to collect user preferences. Do not skip this step.**

Use AskUserQuestion to collect the following:

1. **Model size**: Choose the recognition model
   - Options:
     - "base - Balanced speed and accuracy (Recommended)"
     - "tiny - Fastest, lower accuracy"
     - "small - Faster, moderate accuracy"
     - "medium - Slower, higher accuracy"
     - "large-v2 - Slowest, highest accuracy"

2. **Language**: What language is the audio?
   - Options:
     - "Auto-detect (Recommended)"
     - "Chinese (zh)"
     - "English (en)"
     - "Japanese (ja)"
     - "Other"

3. **Word-level alignment**: Do you need word-level timestamps?
   - Options:
     - "Yes - Precise timing for each word (Recommended)"
     - "No - Sentence-level timing only (faster)"

4. **Output format**: What format to output?
   - Options:
     - "TXT - Plain text with timestamps (Recommended)"
     - "SRT - Subtitle format"
     - "VTT - Web subtitle format"
     - "JSON - Structured data (with word-level info)"

5. **Output path**: Where to save?
   - Default: same directory as input file, named `<original_name>.txt` (or matching format)

### Step 3: Run transcription script

Use the `transcribe.py` script in the skill directory:

```bash
uv run /path/to/skills/audio-transcribe/transcribe.py "INPUT_FILE" [OPTIONS]
```

Parameters:
- `--model`, `-m`: Model size (tiny/base/small/medium/large-v2)
- `--language`, `-l`: Language code (en/zh/ja/...), auto-detect if not specified
- `--no-align`: Skip word-level alignment
- `--no-vad`: Disable VAD filtering (use if transcription has time jumps or missing segments)
- `--output`, `-o`: Output file path
- `--format`, `-f`: Output format (srt/vtt/txt/json)

Examples:

```bash
# Basic transcription (auto-detect language)
uv run skills/audio-transcribe/transcribe.py "video.mp4" -o "video.txt"

# Chinese transcription, output SRT subtitles
uv run skills/audio-transcribe/transcribe.py "audio.mp3" -l zh -f srt -o "subtitles.srt"

# Fast transcription, skip word alignment
uv run skills/audio-transcribe/transcribe.py "audio.wav" --no-align -o "transcript.txt"

# Use a larger model, output JSON (with word-level timestamps)
uv run skills/audio-transcribe/transcribe.py "speech.mp3" -m medium -f json -o "result.json"

# Disable VAD filtering (fix time jumps / missing segments)
uv run skills/audio-transcribe/transcribe.py "audio.mp3" --no-vad -o "transcript.txt"
```

### Step 4: Present results

After transcription completes:

1. Show the full output file path
2. Display a preview of the transcription content
3. Report total duration and segment count

### Output format reference

#### TXT format
```
[00:00:00.000 - 00:00:03.500] This is the first sentence
[00:00:03.500 - 00:00:07.200] This is the second sentence
```

#### SRT format
```
1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
This is the first sentence

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:07,200
This is the second sentence
```

#### JSON format (with word-level)
```json
[
  {
    "start": 0.0,
    "end": 3.5,
    "text": "This is the first sentence",
    "words": [
      {"word": "This", "start": 0.0, "end": 0.5, "score": 0.95},
      ...
    ]
  }
]
```

### Troubleshooting

**Slow on first run**:
- WhisperX needs to download model files; first run will be slower
- Subsequent runs use the cached model

**Out of memory**:
- Use a smaller model (tiny or base)
- Ensure the system has enough memory

**Low recognition accuracy**:
- Try a larger model (medium or large-v2)
- Explicitly specify the language instead of auto-detect
