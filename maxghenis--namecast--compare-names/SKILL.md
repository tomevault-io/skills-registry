## Comparison Tips

**When scores are close (within 5 points):**
- Weight criteria based on user's priorities
- Ask what matters most: availability, brand fit, or memorability
- Consider the specific use case (B2B vs B2C, tech vs traditional)

**When one name clearly wins:**
- Still highlight what the other names do well
- Note if runner-up might work for a sub-brand or product line
- Confirm the winner addresses user's stated requirements

**Handling ties:**
- Recommend additional research (focus groups, A/B testing)
- Suggest checking with target customers
- Consider which name has better long-term potential

## Example

User: "Compare 'Luminary', 'Brightpath', and 'Eduvance' for an education technology company focused on corporate training"

Then provide full comparison using the framework, noting that:
- Corporate training suggests professional/serious tone
- B2B context means domain availability critical
- "Eduvance" clearly signals education
- "Luminary" has broader appeal but less specific
- "Brightpath" is descriptive but potentially generic
