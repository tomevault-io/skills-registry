# Brand Name Oracle Skill

Forecast brand name success comprehensively across multiple dimensions. This skill provides a structured approach to brand name prophecy.

## When to Use

- User asks to forecast a potential brand/company/product name's success
- User wants to check if a name is "good" or "available"
- User is deciding between name options
- User wants oracle insight on a name they're considering

## Forecasting Framework

For each brand name, forecast across these dimensions:

### 1. Domain Availability (Check these TLDs)
- .com (most important)
- .io (tech startups)
- .co (alternative)
- .ai (AI companies)
- .app (applications)

**How to check:** Run `whois {name}.com` etc. via Bash tool to check actual availability.

### 2. Social Handle Availability
- Twitter/X (@name)
- Instagram (@name)
- LinkedIn (company/name)
- TikTok (@name)
- GitHub (if tech company)

**How to check:** Use WebFetch to check if handles exist or are available.

### 3. Trademark Risk Assessment
- Search USPTO TESS database via WebSearch
- Check for similar marks in the same class
- Assess likelihood of confusion

**Risk levels:**
- **Low:** No similar marks found
- **Medium:** Similar marks exist but different industry
- **High:** Similar marks in same industry

### 4. Pronunciation Analysis

Score 1-10 based on:
- Number of syllables (fewer = better, 1-2 is ideal)
- Phonetic clarity (no ambiguous sounds)
- Spelling predictability (can people spell it from hearing it?)
- International pronounceability

### 5. International Check

Check for problematic meanings in:
- Spanish
- French
- German
- Mandarin
- Japanese
- Portuguese
- Arabic

**Red flags:** Profanity, negative connotations, embarrassing meanings

### 6. Similar Companies Check

Search for existing companies with similar names to identify confusion risk:

**Check for:**
- Phonetically similar names (sound alike when spoken)
- Visually similar names (look alike when written)
- Names with similar prefixes/suffixes
- Names in the same or adjacent industries

**How to check:** Use WebSearch to find companies with similar names. Consider:
- Direct competitors with similar names
- Well-known brands that could cause confusion
- Companies that might have trademark claims

**Risk levels:**
- **Low:** No similar companies found, or only in unrelated industries
- **Medium:** Similar names exist in adjacent industries
- **High:** Very similar names in same industry, or conflicts with well-known brands

### 7. AI Perception Analysis (Persona-Based)

**IMPORTANT:** Use the Task tool to spawn 5 persona subagents in parallel. Each persona evaluates the brand name from their perspective.

Launch these 5 agents simultaneously using the Task tool:

```
Persona 1: Sarah, 28, Software Engineer
- Tech-savvy millennial at a startup
- Values innovation and authenticity

Persona 2: Robert, 55, Small Business Owner
- Runs a local accounting firm
- Conservative, values trust and reliability

Persona 3: Maya, 34, Marketing Director
- Works at Fortune 500 company
- Expert in branding, very critical

Persona 4: James, 42, Investor
- VC partner evaluating startups
- Focuses on market positioning

Persona 5: Lisa, 22, College Student
- Gen Z, heavy social media user
- Cares about authenticity and social impact
```

For each persona, the agent should answer:
1. "What does '{name}' make you think of?"
2. "What industry would you guess this company is in?"
3. "Would you trust a company with this name?" (yes/no)
4. "Is this name memorable to you?" (yes/no)
5. Brief overall impression (2-3 sentences)

**Agent prompt template:**
```
You are {Name}, a {age}-year-old {occupation}. {background}

Evaluate the brand name "{BRAND_NAME}" from your perspective.

Answer briefly:
1. What does this name make you think of?
2. What industry would you guess?
3. Would you trust this company? (yes/no + why)
4. Is it memorable? (yes/no + why)
5. Overall impression (2-3 sentences)
```

After all 5 agents complete, synthesize their responses:
- Aggregate common themes in what the name evokes
- List industries mentioned
- Calculate trust rate (X/5 would trust)
- Calculate memorability rate (X/5 find it memorable)
- Note any divergent opinions

## Output Format
