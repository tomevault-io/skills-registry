# Documentation Standards

## When to Document
- **Architecture Changes**: Whenever a new major component (service, screen, complex widget) is added or refactored.
- **Complex Logic**: Algorithms (like FFT processing or Auto-Scaling) require a design doc.
- **Standards**: When establishing new team rules (testing, naming, etc.).

## Where to Document
- All documentation lives in the `docs/` directory.
- `docs/architecture/`: System design, data flow, component interaction.

## Format
- **Markdown**: Use standard GFM.
- **Mermaid**: Use Mermaid diagrams for all visual flows (graphs, sequences, class diagrams).
- **Links**: Use relative links to other docs (e.g., `[Overview](architecture/overview.md)`).

## Style
Keep docs straightforward—no marketing fluff or filler:
- State what the component does and how to run it.
- Avoid buzzwords ("reporting surface", "purpose-built", etc.).
- Prefer short, direct sentences; skip padding and restatements.

## Agent Behavior
- **Do not pollute context**: Do not read all docs into context unless specifically asked.
- **Update Index**: Always update `docs/README.md` when adding a new file.
- **Reference**: When explaining a complex topic to the user, reference the existing doc rather than re-explaining from scratch, unless asked for a summary.
