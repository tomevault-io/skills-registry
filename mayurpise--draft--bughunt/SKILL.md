# Bug Hunt

You are conducting an exhaustive bug hunt on this Git repository, enhanced by Draft context when available.

## Primary Deliverable

**The bug report is the primary deliverable.** Every verified bug MUST appear in the final report regardless of whether a regression test can be written. Regression tests are a supplementary output — helpful when possible, but never a filter for bug inclusion.

## Relationship to Built-in Bug Hunt Agents

Some AI tools (e.g., Claude Code) provide a built-in `bughunt` agent that auto-discovers project structure and runs parallel sweeps. `/draft:bughunt` is **complementary, not competing**:

| | `/draft:bughunt` | Built-in bughunt agent |
|---|---|---|
| **Approach** | Context-driven methodology with 14 analysis dimensions and verification protocol | Auto-discovery with parallel sweep subagents |
| **Draft context** | Uses architecture, tech-stack, product, guardrails for false-positive elimination | No Draft context awareness |
| **Output** | Severity-ranked report with evidence | Inline fixes + regression tests |
| **Modifies code** | No (report + regression tests only) | Yes (finds AND fixes) |

**When to use which:** Use `/draft:bughunt` when you need context-aware analysis with structured evidence and false-positive elimination. Use the built-in agent when you want fast parallel sweeps with auto-fix capability. For maximum coverage, run both — `/draft:bughunt` catches context-specific bugs the built-in misses, and vice versa.

## Red Flags - STOP if you're:

- Hunting for bugs without reading Draft context first (architecture.md, tech-stack.md, product.md)
- Reporting a finding without reproducing or tracing the code path
- Fixing production code instead of reporting bugs (bughunt reports bugs and writes regression tests — it doesn't fix source code)
- Assuming a pattern is buggy without checking if it's used successfully elsewhere
- Skipping the verification protocol (every bug needs evidence)
- Making up file locations or line numbers without reading the actual code
- Reporting framework-handled concerns as bugs without checking the docs
- **Skipping bugs because you can't write a test for them** — mark as N/A and still report

**Verify before you report. Evidence over assumptions.**

## Pre-Check

### 0. Capture Git Context

Before starting analysis, capture the current git state:

```bash
git branch --show-current    # Current branch name
git rev-parse --short HEAD   # Current commit hash
```

Store this for the report header. All bugs found are relative to this specific branch/commit.

### 1. Load Draft Context (if available)

Read and follow the base procedure in `core/shared/draft-context-loading.md`.

**Bug-hunt-specific context application:**
- Flag violations of intended architecture as bugs (coupling, boundary violations)
- Apply framework-specific checks from tech-stack (React anti-patterns, Node gotchas, etc.)
- Catch bugs that violate product requirements or user flows
- Prioritize areas relevant to active tracks
- **Leverage Critical Invariants** — Check for invariant violations across data safety, security, concurrency, ordering, idempotency categories
- **Leverage Concurrency Model** — Use thread/async model info for race condition and deadlock analysis
- **Leverage Error Handling** — Use failure modes and retry policies for reliability bug detection
- **Leverage Data State Machines** — Check for invalid state transitions, missing guard clauses, states with no exit path
- **Leverage Storage Topology** — Identify data loss risks at each tier (cache eviction without writeback, event log gaps, missing archive)
- **Leverage Consistency Boundaries** — Find bugs at eventual consistency seams (stale reads, lost events, missing reconciliation)
- **Leverage Failure Recovery Matrix** — Verify idempotency claims, check for partial failure states without recovery paths

### 2. Confirm Scope

When invoked programmatically by `/draft:review` with `with-bughunt`, skip scope confirmation and inherit the scope from the calling command.

Otherwise, ask user to confirm scope:
- **Entire repo** - Full codebase analysis
- **Specific paths** - Target directories or files
- **Track-level** (specify `<track-id>`) - Focus on files relevant to a specific track

### 3. Load Track Context (if track-level)

If running for a specific track, also load:
- [ ] `draft/tracks/<id>/spec.md` - Requirements, acceptance criteria, edge cases
- [ ] `draft/tracks/<id>/plan.md` - Implementation tasks, phases, dependencies

Use track context to:
- Verify implemented features match spec requirements
- Check edge cases listed in spec are handled
- Identify bugs in areas touched by the track's plan
- Focus analysis on files modified/created by the track

If no Draft context exists, proceed with code-only analysis.

## Dimension Applicability Check

Before analyzing all 14 dimensions, determine which apply to this codebase:

- **Skip explicitly** rather than forcing analysis of N/A dimensions
- **Mark skipped dimensions** with reason in report summary

**Examples of skipping:**
- "N/A - no backend code" (skip dimensions 2, 8, 10 for frontend-only repo)
- "N/A - no UI components" (skip dimensions 5, 9, 14 for CLI tool)
- "N/A - no database" (skip dimension 2 for in-memory app)
- "N/A - no external integrations" (skip dimension 8)
- "N/A - no external dependencies" (skip dimension 12 for zero-dependency project)
- "N/A - no user-facing strings" (skip dimension 14 for libraries/APIs)

## Analysis Dimensions

Analyze systematically across all applicable dimensions. Skip N/A dimensions explicitly (see Dimension Applicability Check above).

### 1. Correctness
- Logical errors, invalid assumptions, edge cases
- Incorrect state transitions, stale or inconsistent UI state
- Error handling gaps, silent failures
- Off-by-one errors, boundary conditions

### 2. Reliability & Resilience
- Crash paths, unhandled exceptions
- Reload/refresh behavior, retry logic
- UI behavior on partial backend failure
- Broken recovery after errors, navigation

### 3. Security
- XSS, injection vectors, unsafe rendering
- Client-side trust assumptions
- Secrets, tokens, auth data exposure
- CSRF, insecure deserialization
- Path traversal, command injection
- **Taint tracking (end-to-end data flow analysis):**
  - Identify all entry points: HTTP params, form data, file uploads, env vars, CLI args, message queue payloads, webhook bodies
  - Trace user input to dangerous sinks: SQL queries, shell exec, eval, innerHTML, file path construction, URL construction, deserialization, template rendering
  - For each sink, verify sanitization/validation exists on every path from source to sink
  - Flag paths where unsanitized input reaches a sink without passing through a validator, encoder, or sanitizer
  - Reference: OWASP Top 10, Meta Infer taint analysis methodology

### 4. Performance (Backend + UI)
- Inefficient algorithms and data fetching
- Blocking work on main/UI thread
- Excessive re-renders, unnecessary state updates
- Unbounded memory growth (listeners, caches, stores)

### 5. UI Responsiveness & Perceived Performance
- Long tasks blocking input
- Jank during scrolling, typing, resizing
- Layout thrashing, forced reflows
- Expensive animations or transitions
- Poor loading states, flicker, content shifts

### 6. Concurrency & Ordering
- Race conditions between async calls
- Stale responses overwriting newer state
- Incorrect cancellation or debouncing
- Event ordering assumptions
- Deadlocks, livelocks

### 7. State Management
- Source-of-truth violations
- Derived state bugs (computed from stale data)
- Global state misuse
- Memory leaks from subscriptions or observers
- Inconsistent state across components

### 8. API & Contracts
- UI assumptions not guaranteed by backend
- Schema drift, weak typing, missing validation
- Backward compatibility risks
- Undocumented API behavior dependencies

### 9. Accessibility & UX Correctness
- Keyboard navigation gaps
- Focus management bugs
- ARIA misuse or absence
- Broken tab order or unreadable states
- UI behavior that contradicts user intent
- Color contrast, screen reader compatibility

### 10. Configuration & Build
- Fragile environment assumptions
- Build-time vs runtime config leaks
- Dev-only code shipping to prod
- Missing environment variable validation
- CI gaps affecting builds or tests

### 11. Tests
- Missing coverage for critical flows
- Snapshot misuse (testing implementation, not behavior)
- Tests that assert implementation instead of behavior
- Mismatch between test and real user interaction
- Flaky tests, timing dependencies
- **Property-based testing gaps:** pure/mathematical functions without invariant-based tests (e.g., `encode(decode(x)) == x`, sorting idempotency, associativity)
- **Test isolation violations:** shared mutable state between test cases (global variables, singletons, class-level state modified in tests without reset)
- **Test double misuse:** mocks that leak state across tests, over-mocking (>3 mocks per test suggests testing wiring not behavior), stubs that diverge from real implementation behavior
- **Assertion density:** tests with zero or weak assertions (`assertTrue(true)`, `expect(result).toBeDefined()` only, empty catch blocks in test code, `assert result is not None` as sole check)
- **Flaky test patterns:** time-dependent assertions (sleep, Date.now, timestamps), port/file system assumptions, test ordering dependencies, non-deterministic data (random seeds, UUIDs without control)

### 12. Dependency & Supply Chain Security
- **Known CVEs:** Check dependencies against known vulnerability databases (reference tools: Snyk, Trivy, OWASP Dependency-Check, `npm audit`, `pip-audit`, `cargo audit`, `go vuln`)
- **Unpinned dependency versions:** Lockfile freshness, use of version ranges (`^`, `~`, `*`, `>=`) without lockfile enforcement, missing lockfile entirely
- **Deprecated packages:** Dependencies with known deprecation notices, archived repositories, or no maintenance activity
- **License conflicts:** GPL dependencies in MIT/Apache projects, AGPL in proprietary code, incompatible license combinations in the dependency tree
- **Typosquatting risk:** Packages with names similar to popular ones (e.g., `lodahs` vs `lodash`, `reqeusts` vs `requests`), recently published packages with few downloads
- **Transitive dependency depth:** Deeply nested dependency chains (>5 levels) increase supply chain attack surface; flag packages that pull in disproportionate transitive trees
- Reference: Google OSS-Fuzz, Microsoft SDL, OpenSSF Scorecard

### 13. Algorithmic Complexity
- **Quadratic or worse loops:** O(n^2) or worse nested loops over collections (nested `.filter()` inside `.map()`, repeated linear scans, cartesian joins in application code)
- **Regex catastrophic backtracking:** Nested quantifiers (`(a+)+`, `(a|a)*`), unbounded repetition with overlapping alternatives — flag any regex applied to user-controlled input
- **Unbounded recursion:** Recursive functions without depth limits, missing base cases, or base cases that depend on external/mutable state
- **Cache invalidation storms:** Cache miss triggering expensive recomputation that itself invalidates caches, thundering herd on cache expiry without jitter/locking
- **Hot path inefficiency:** Sorting/searching in hot paths without appropriate data structures (linear scan where hash map suffices, repeated sorting of same collection, string concatenation in loops)

### 14. Internationalization & Localization
- **Hardcoded user-facing strings:** Strings displayed to users embedded directly in source code rather than externalized to resource files/i18n frameworks
- **Locale-sensitive operations without locale parameter:** String comparison (`<`, `>`, `localeCompare` without locale), date formatting (`toLocaleDateString` without explicit locale), number formatting, sorting (alphabetical sort that assumes ASCII ordering)
- **RTL layout issues:** Hardcoded LTR assumptions in UI code (absolute `left`/`right` positioning, directional margin/padding, text alignment assumptions)
- **Unicode handling bugs:** String length vs byte length confusion, missing normalization (NFC/NFD), emoji handling (multi-codepoint sequences split incorrectly, `string.length` vs grapheme count), surrogate pair handling in substring operations

## Bug Verification Protocol

**CRITICAL: No bug is valid without verification.** Before declaring any finding as a bug, complete ALL applicable verification steps:

### Verification Checklist (for each potential bug)

1. **Code Path Verification**
   - [ ] Read the actual code at the suspected location
   - [ ] Trace the data flow from input to the bug location
   - [ ] Check if there are guards, validators, or error handlers upstream
   - [ ] Verify the code path is actually reachable in production

2. **Context Cross-Reference**
   - [ ] Check `.ai-context.md` (or `architecture.md`) — Is this behavior intentional by design?
   - [ ] Check `tech-stack.md` — Does the framework handle this case?
   - [ ] Check `tech-stack.md` `## Accepted Patterns` — Is this pattern explicitly documented as intentional?
   - [ ] Check `product.md` — Is this actually a requirement violation?
   - [ ] Check existing tests — Is this behavior already tested and expected?

3. **Framework/Library Verification**
   - [ ] Read official docs for the specific method/pattern in question
   - [ ] Quote relevant doc section proving this is/isn't handled
   - [ ] Check framework version in tech-stack.md (behavior may vary by version)
   - [ ] Look for middleware, interceptors, or global handlers that may address the issue

**Example Framework Documentation Quote:**
"React automatically escapes JSX content to prevent XSS (React Docs: Main Concepts > JSX). However, `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` bypasses this protection. Framework version: React 18.2.0 (from tech-stack.md)."

4. **Codebase Pattern Check**
   - [ ] Search for similar patterns elsewhere in codebase
   - [ ] If pattern is used consistently, verify it's actually buggy (not just unfamiliar)
   - [ ] Check if there's a project-specific utility/wrapper that handles the concern

5. **False Positive Elimination**
   - [ ] Is this dead code that's never executed?
   - [ ] Is this test/mock/stub code not in production?
   - [ ] Is this intentionally disabled (feature flag, config)?
   - [ ] Is there a comment explaining why this appears unsafe but is actually safe?

6. **Pattern Prevalence Check (before reporting)**
   - [ ] Run Grep to find all occurrences of the pattern
   - [ ] If found >5x:
     - Randomly sample 3 instances
     - Verify they exhibit the same suspected bug
     - If they work correctly, investigate: what's different about THIS instance?
   - [ ] If no difference found and other instances work: DO NOT REPORT
   - [ ] If all instances have the bug: Report with pattern count in "Impact"

**Example Pattern Prevalence Check:**
```
1. Grep: `rg 'dangerouslySetInnerHTML' src/` → found 12 occurrences
2. Sampled 3: src/Blog.tsx:45, src/About.tsx:12, src/FAQ.tsx:30
3. All 3 sanitize input via `DOMPurify.sanitize()` before rendering
4. THIS instance (src/Comment.tsx:88) passes raw user input without sanitization
5. Decision: REPORT — this instance lacks the sanitization all others have
```

### Confidence Levels

Only report bugs with HIGH or CONFIRMED confidence:

| Level | Criteria | Action |
|-------|----------|--------|
| **CONFIRMED** | Verified through code trace, no mitigating factors found | Report as bug |
| **HIGH** | Strong evidence, checked context, no obvious mitigation | Report as bug |
| **MEDIUM** | Suspicious but couldn't verify all factors | Ask user to confirm before reporting |
| **LOW** | Possible issue but likely handled elsewhere | Do NOT report |

**Example confirmation prompt for MEDIUM Confidence:**
"I found a potential race condition in `src/handler.ts:45` where async state updates may overwrite each other. However, I couldn't verify if there's a locking mechanism elsewhere. Should I report this as a bug?"

### Evidence Requirements

Each reported bug MUST include:
- **Code Evidence:** The actual problematic code snippet
- **Trace:** How data reaches this point (caller chain or data flow)
- **Verification Done:** Which checks from the checklist were completed
- **Why Not a False Positive:** Explicit statement of why this isn't handled elsewhere

## Analysis Rules

- **Do not execute code** - Reason from source only
- **Do not assume frameworks "handle it"** - Verify explicitly by checking docs/code
- **Do not assume code is buggy** - Verify it's actually reachable and unguarded
- **Trace data flow completely** - From input source to bug location
- **Cross-reference ALL Draft context** - Check architecture, tech-stack, product, tests
- **Check for existing mitigations** - Middleware, wrappers, utilities, global handlers
- **Search for patterns** - If used elsewhere without issues, investigate why

## Optional: Runtime Verification (if test suite exists)

For suspected bugs that can be tested, write a minimal failing test to confirm:

1. **Write minimal test** — Target the specific bug, not the entire feature
2. **Run test** — Execute and observe failure
3. **Confirm bug** — If test fails as predicted, confidence level increases to CONFIRMED
4. **Only report if**: Test fails OR CONFIRMED confidence from code trace

**Example:**
```javascript
// Suspected bug: off-by-one in pagination
test('should handle last page boundary', () => {
  const items = Array(100).fill('item');
  const result = paginate(items, { page: 10, perPage: 10 });
  expect(result.items.length).toBe(10); // Currently returns 9
});
```

If test fails, upgrade confidence to CONFIRMED and include test in bug report.

## Regression Test Generation

For each verified bug, generate a regression test in the **project's native test framework** that would expose the bug as a failing test. **Before writing any new test**, first discover the project's language/framework and whether existing tests already cover (or partially cover) the bug scenario.

### Step 1: Detect Language & Test Framework

Identify the project's language(s) and test framework by examining the codebase:

| Signal | Language | Test Framework | Build/Run Command |
|--------|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| `BUILD`/`WORKSPACE`/`MODULE.bazel` + `.cpp`/`.cc`/`.h` | C/C++ | GTest | `bazel build` / `bazel test` |
| `CMakeLists.txt` + `.cpp`/`.cc` | C/C++ | GTest | `cmake --build` / `ctest` |
| `go.mod` or `go.sum` | Go | `testing` (stdlib) | `go test` |
| `pytest.ini`/`pyproject.toml`/`setup.py`/`conftest.py` | Python | pytest | `pytest` |
| `requirements.txt` + `unittest` imports | Python | unittest | `python -m pytest` |
| `package.json` + Jest config | JavaScript/TypeScript | Jest | `npx jest` / `npm test` |
| `package.json` + Vitest config | JavaScript/TypeScript | Vitest | `npx vitest` |
| `package.json` + Mocha config | JavaScript/TypeScript | Mocha | `npx mocha` |
| `Cargo.toml` | Rust | built-in `#[test]` | `cargo test` |
| `pom.xml` | Java | JUnit | `mvn test` |
| `build.gradle`/`build.gradle.kts` | Java/Kotlin | JUnit | `gradle test` |

**Resolution order:**
1. Check `draft/tech-stack.md` first — it may explicitly state the test framework
2. Look for existing test files and match their import/framework patterns
3. Fall back to build system signals above

If the project is **polyglot** (multiple languages), detect per-component and generate tests in the matching language for each bug.

**If no test framework is detected:** Mark all bugs with `Regression Test Status: N/A — no test framework detected` and proceed with bug reporting. **Do not skip bugs because tests cannot be written.** The regression test section is supplementary — the primary deliverable is the bug report.

Record the detected configuration:
```
Language: [detected | none]
Test Framework: [detected | none]
Build System: [detected | none]
Test Command: [detected | N/A]
```

### Step 2: Existing Test Discovery (REQUIRED per bug, skip if no test framework)

For each verified bug, search the codebase for existing tests before generating new ones:

1. **Locate test files for the buggy module** using language-appropriate patterns:

   | Language | Search Patterns |
   |----------|----------------|
   | C/C++ | `*_test.cpp`, `*_test.cc`, `test_*.cpp`; patterns: `TEST(`, `TEST_F(`, `TEST_P(` |
   | Go | `*_test.go` in same package; patterns: `func Test`, `func Benchmark` |
   | Python | `test_*.py`, `*_test.py` in `tests/`; patterns: `def test_`, `class Test` |
   | JS/TS | `*.test.ts`, `*.spec.ts`, `__tests__/*.ts`; patterns: `describe(`, `it(`, `test(` |
   | Rust | `#[cfg(test)]` in same file, or `tests/*.rs`; patterns: `#[test]`, `fn test_` |
   | Java | `*Test.java`, `*Tests.java` in `src/test/`; patterns: `@Test`, `@ParameterizedTest` |

2. **Analyze existing test coverage**
   - Read each related test file found
   - Check if any test exercises the **exact code path** that triggers the bug
   - Check if any test covers the **same function/method** but misses the specific edge case
   - Check if a test exists but has a **wrong assertion** (asserts buggy behavior as correct)

3. **Classify the coverage status** — one of:

   | Status | Meaning | Action |
   |--------|---------|--------|
   | **COVERED** | Existing test already catches this bug (test fails on buggy code) | Report the existing test — no new test needed |
   | **PARTIAL** | Test exists for the function but misses this specific scenario | Add the missing case to the existing test file |
   | **WRONG_ASSERTION** | Test exists but asserts the buggy behavior as correct | Fix the assertion in the existing test |
   | **NO_COVERAGE** | No test exists for this code path | Generate a new test |
   | **N/A** | Bug is in non-testable code (config, markdown, LLM workflow) | Write `N/A — [reason]` |

4. **Document discovery results** in the bug report's Regression Test field

**Example Existing Test Discovery:**
```
1. Bug location: src/parser.cpp:145 — off-by-one in tokenize()
2. Grep: `rg 'tokenize' tests/` → found tests/parser_test.cpp
3. Read tests/parser_test.cpp:
   - TEST(Parser, TokenizeSimpleInput) — tests basic input ✓
   - TEST(Parser, TokenizeEmptyString) — tests empty string ✓
   - No test for boundary input length (the bug trigger)
4. Status: PARTIAL — parser_test.cpp covers tokenize() but misses boundary case
5. Action: Add new TEST case to existing tests/parser_test.cpp
```

### Step 3: Generate or Modify Test Cases

Based on discovery results, generate tests in the project's native framework:

#### When status is COVERED
```
**Regression Test:**
**Status:** COVERED — existing test already catches this bug
**Existing Test:** `tests/parser_test.cpp:45` — `TEST(Parser, TokenizeBoundary)`
No new test needed.
```

#### When status is PARTIAL — add to existing test file
#### When status is WRONG_ASSERTION — fix assertion in existing test
#### When status is NO_COVERAGE — generate new test

### Test Case Requirements (all languages)

Each new test MUST:

1. **Target exactly one bug** — One test per finding, named after the bug
2. **Use descriptive test names** — Language-idiomatic naming (see templates below)
3. **Include the bug setup** — Reproduce the preconditions that trigger the bug
4. **Assert the expected (correct) behavior** — The test should FAIL against the current buggy code
5. **Comment the expected vs actual** — Explain what the test expects and what currently happens
6. **Be self-contained** — Include necessary imports, minimal fixtures, no external dependencies beyond the test framework and project modules
7. **Specify target file** — State whether this goes in an existing test file or a new one

### Language-Specific Test Templates

#### C/C++ (GTest)

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>
// #include "relevant/project/header.h"

// Bug: [SEVERITY] Category: Brief Title
// Location: path/to/file.cpp:line
// This test FAILS against current code, PASSES after fix

TEST(BugCategory, BriefBugTitle) {
    // Setup
    // Act
    // Assert
    EXPECT_EQ(actual, expected) << "Description of what should happen";
}
```

#### Python (pytest)

```python
# Bug: [SEVERITY] Category: Brief Title
# Location: path/to/file.py:line
# This test FAILS against current code, PASSES after fix

import pytest
from module.under.test import function_under_test


def test_brief_bug_title():
    """[Category] Brief description of the bug scenario."""
    # Setup
    # Act
    result = function_under_test(input)
    # Assert
    assert result == expected, "Description of what should happen"
```

#### Go (testing)

```go
package package_name

import (
    "testing"
    // project imports
)

// Bug: [SEVERITY] Category: Brief Title
// Location: path/to/file.go:line
// This test FAILS against current code, PASSES after fix

func TestBriefBugTitle(t *testing.T) {
    // Setup
    // Act
    got := FunctionUnderTest(input)
    // Assert
    if got != expected {
        t.Errorf("FunctionUnderTest() = %v, want %v", got, expected)
    }
}
```

#### JavaScript/TypeScript (Jest/Vitest)

```typescript
// Bug: [SEVERITY] Category: Brief Title
// Location: path/to/file.ts:line
// This test FAILS against current code, PASSES after fix

import { functionUnderTest } from './module-under-test';

describe('BugCategory', () => {
  it('should brief bug title', () => {
    // Setup
    // Act
    const result = functionUnderTest(input);
    // Assert
    expect(result).toBe(expected);
  });
});
```

#### Rust (#[test])

```rust
// Bug: [SEVERITY] Category: Brief Title
// Location: path/to/file.rs:line
// This test FAILS against current code, PASSES after fix

#[cfg(test)]
mod bug_regression_tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_brief_bug_title() {
        // Setup
        // Act
        let result = function_under_test(input);
        // Assert
        assert_eq!(result, expected, "Description of what should happen");
    }
}
```

#### Java (JUnit 5)

```java
// Bug: [SEVERITY] Category: Brief Title
// Location: path/to/File.java:line
// This test FAILS against current code, PASSES after fix

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

class BugCategoryTest {
    @Test
    void briefBugTitle() {
        // Setup
        // Act
        var result = classUnderTest.methodUnderTest(input);
        // Assert
        assertEquals(expected, result, "Description of what should happen");
    }
}
```

### Consolidated Test File

After all bugs are documented, collect all test cases into a single consolidated section in the report (see Report Generation). Group by discovery status so the reader knows which tests are new vs modifications to existing tests.

### Step 4: Test Infrastructure Discovery

Before writing any test files, discover the project's test infrastructure and conventions:

1. **Detect Build System & Test Runner**

   | Language | Build System Signals | Test Runner |
   |----------|---------------------|-------------|
   | C/C++ | `WORKSPACE`/`MODULE.bazel` → Bazel; `CMakeLists.txt` → CMake | `bazel test` / `ctest` |
   | Go | `go.mod` (always present) | `go test ./...` |
   | Python | `pyproject.toml` / `setup.cfg` / `tox.ini` / bare | `pytest` (prefer) / `python -m unittest` |
   | JS/TS | `package.json` → check `scripts.test` and devDeps | `npx jest` / `npx vitest` / `npm test` |
   | Rust | `Cargo.toml` (always present) | `cargo test` |
   | Java | `pom.xml` → Maven; `build.gradle` → Gradle | `mvn test` / `gradle test` |

   If no recognized build system is found, inform user and keep report-only test output:
   `"No recognized build/test system detected. Regression tests are included in the report only."`

2. **Map Source Files to Test Locations**
   For each buggy source file, determine where its tests live (or should live):

   | Language | Common Conventions |
   |----------|--------------------|
   | C/C++ (Bazel) | Co-located `foo_test.cpp` or separate `tests/` tree; check `cc_test` in BUILD |
   | Go | Same directory: `foo.go` → `foo_test.go` (always co-located) |
   | Python | `src/auth/handler.py` → `tests/auth/test_handler.py` or `tests/test_auth_handler.py` |
   | JS/TS | `src/auth/handler.ts` → `src/auth/handler.test.ts` or `__tests__/handler.test.ts` |
   | Rust | In-file `#[cfg(test)]` module, or `tests/` directory for integration tests |
   | Java | `src/main/java/com/...` → `src/test/java/com/...` (Maven convention) |

   - If tests exist: record the directory, naming convention, and any build config
   - If no tests exist: adopt the project's dominant convention
   - If no convention exists: default to a `tests/` directory mirroring the source tree

3. **Identify Test Dependencies** (language-specific)

   | Language | What to Find |
   |----------|-------------|
   | C/C++ (Bazel) | GTest dep label: `@com_google_googletest//:gtest_main`; source `cc_library` targets |
   | Go | No extra deps needed (`testing` is stdlib) |
   | Python | Check if `pytest` is in `requirements*.txt` / `pyproject.toml`; add if missing |
   | JS/TS | Check if test framework is in `devDependencies`; identify import style |
   | Rust | No extra deps for unit tests; `dev-dependencies` for integration test crates |
   | Java | JUnit version in `pom.xml` / `build.gradle` dependencies |

### Step 5: Write Test Files (only for testable bugs)

**Skip this step entirely if no test framework was detected in Step 1.**

For bugs with status NO_COVERAGE, PARTIAL, or WRONG_ASSERTION, write the actual test files. Bugs with COVERED or N/A status do not need action here — they are still included in the final report:

#### NO_COVERAGE — Create new test file

1. **Create directory** if it doesn't exist:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p <test_directory>/
   ```

2. **Write the test file** using the language-appropriate template:

   | Language | Example Target File |
   |----------|-------------------|
   | C/C++ | `tests/auth/login_handler_test.cpp` |
   | Go | `auth/login_handler_test.go` (same package) |
   | Python | `tests/auth/test_login_handler.py` |
   | JS/TS | `src/auth/login_handler.test.ts` or `__tests__/auth/login_handler.test.ts` |
   | Rust | `tests/login_handler_test.rs` or `#[cfg(test)]` in source |
   | Java | `src/test/java/com/example/auth/LoginHandlerTest.java` |

3. **Create or update build config** (if required by the build system):

   **C/C++ (Bazel)** — add `cc_test` to BUILD:
   ```python
   cc_test(
       name = "<source_filename>_test",
       srcs = ["<source_filename>_test.cpp"],
       deps = [
           "//src/<component>:<library_target>",
           "@com_google_googletest//:gtest_main",
       ],
   )
   ```

   **Java (Maven)** — no build config change needed (convention-based discovery)
   **Java (Gradle)** — no build config change needed
   **Go** — no build config change needed (`go test` discovers `_test.go` automatically)
   **Python** — no build config change needed (`pytest` discovers `test_*.py` automatically)
   **JS/TS** — no build config change needed (Jest/Vitest discover `*.test.*` automatically)
   **Rust** — no build config change needed (`cargo test` discovers `#[test]` automatically)

4. If multiple bugs affect different files in the same component, create one test file per source file (not one per bug). Group related bug tests into the same file.

#### PARTIAL — Add test case to existing file

1. Read the existing test file
2. Append the new test at the idiomatic location:
   - **C/C++:** Before closing namespace brace
   - **Go:** End of file (same package)
   - **Python:** End of file or within existing test class
   - **JS/TS:** Inside the relevant `describe()` block, or at end of file
   - **Rust:** Inside existing `#[cfg(test)]` module
   - **Java:** Inside existing test class, before closing brace
3. No build config changes needed

#### WRONG_ASSERTION — Fix assertion in existing file

1. Read the existing test file
2. Locate the wrong assertion
3. Replace with the corrected assertion
4. No build config changes needed

**Constraints:**
- **Never modify production source code** — only test files and their build configs
- Each test file must be valid for the project's test runner
- Use the project's actual import paths, module names, and namespace conventions
- Match existing test style (fixtures, helpers, naming conventions)

### Step 6: Build & Syntax Validation

After writing all test files, validate them using the project's native toolchain.

1. **Validate each new/modified test** using the language-appropriate command:

   | Language | Validation Command | What It Checks |
   |----------|-------------------|----------------|
   | C/C++ (Bazel) | `bazel build //tests/<component>:<target>_test` | Compilation + linking |
   | C/C++ (CMake) | `cmake --build <build_dir> --target <target>_test` | Compilation + linking |
   | Go | `go vet ./path/to/package/...` | Syntax + type checking (no execution) |
   | Python | `python -m py_compile tests/path/test_file.py` | Syntax validation |
   | JS/TS | `npx tsc --noEmit tests/path/file.test.ts` (TS) or `node --check tests/path/file.test.js` (JS) | Type check / syntax |
   | Rust | `cargo check --tests` | Type check + borrow check (no execution) |
   | Java (Maven) | `mvn test-compile` | Compilation only |
   | Java (Gradle) | `gradle testClasses` | Compilation only |

2. **Handle validation results:**

   | Result | Action |
   |--------|--------|
   | **Succeeds** | Mark as `BUILD_OK` in report |
   | **Fails — import/include error** | Fix the import path, retry (up to 2 retries) |
   | **Fails — missing dep** | Add the dependency, retry (up to 2 retries) |
   | **Fails — type/API mismatch** | Fix the test to match actual API signatures, retry (up to 2 retries) |
   | **Persistent failure (3 attempts)** | Mark as `BUILD_FAILED` with the error message in report. Delete the broken test file and note in the report: "Test file removed due to persistent build failure." |

3. **Do NOT run the tests.** The tests are designed to **FAIL** against the current buggy code — that's the point. Validation checks only syntax, types, and linking. Running them would produce expected failures that aren't useful here.

   **Exception for Go:** `go vet` is preferred over `go build` for test files because Go compiles tests as part of `go test` only. `go vet` catches type errors and common issues without executing.

4. **Validation summary** — Record results for the report:
   ```
   BUILD_OK:     3 targets
   BUILD_FAILED: 1 target (tests/config/test_loader.py — ImportError: no module named 'config.loader')
   SKIPPED:      1 target (N/A — race condition not reliably testable)
   ```

## Fix Suggestion Generation

For each bug with CONFIRMED or HIGH confidence, generate a minimal suggested fix alongside the bug report. Fix suggestions are advisory — they are never auto-applied.

### Fix Generation Rules

1. **Minimal change principle:** The fix must be the smallest code change that addresses the root cause. Do not refactor surrounding code, add features, or improve style.
2. **Before/after format:** Include the exact current code (BEFORE) and the suggested fix (AFTER) as code snippets with file path and line numbers.
3. **Root cause targeting:** The fix must address the root cause identified in the bug's data flow trace, not a symptom. If the root cause is in a different location than the symptom, fix at the root.
4. **Mark as SUGGESTED:** Every fix must be clearly marked as `SUGGESTED (REVIEW REQUIRED)` — never imply auto-application.
5. **One fix per bug:** Each bug gets exactly one suggested fix. If multiple fix strategies exist, choose the most conservative one and note alternatives.
6. **Preserve behavior:** The fix must not change behavior beyond correcting the identified bug. No side-effect improvements.
7. **Skip when inappropriate:** Mark fix as `N/A` for bugs where the fix requires architectural changes, significant refactoring, or domain knowledge beyond what the code provides.

## Output Format

For each verified bug:

```markdown
### [SEVERITY] Category: Brief Title

**Location:** `path/to/file.ts:123`
**Confidence:** [CONFIRMED | HIGH | MEDIUM]

**Code Evidence:**
```[language]
// The actual problematic code
```

**Data Flow Trace:**
[How data reaches this point: caller → caller → this function]

**Issue:** [Precise technical description of what is wrong]

**Impact:** [User-visible effect or system failure mode]

**Verification Done:**
- [x] Traced code path from [entry point]
- [x] Checked architecture.md — not intentional
- [x] Verified framework doesn't handle this
- [x] No upstream guards found in [files checked]

**Why Not a False Positive:**
[Explicit statement: "No sanitization exists because X", "Framework Y doesn't escape Z in this context", etc.]

**Fix:** [Minimal code change or mitigation]

**Suggested Fix (REVIEW REQUIRED):**
```[language]
// BEFORE (current buggy code):
[exact code snippet from the codebase]

// AFTER (suggested fix):
[minimal change that addresses root cause]
```
_This fix is SUGGESTED only — human review required before applying. Reference: Meta SapFix methodology._

**Regression Test:**
**Status:** [COVERED | PARTIAL | WRONG_ASSERTION | NO_COVERAGE | N/A]
**Existing Test:** [`path/to/test_file:line` — test name | None found]
[Action: existing test reference, proposed modification, or new test case]
```[language]
// New or modified test case (omit if COVERED or N/A)
```
```

**Example — COVERED (no new test needed):**
```markdown
**Regression Test:**
**Status:** COVERED — existing test already catches this bug
**Existing Test:** `tests/validator_test.cpp:89` — `TEST(Validator, RejectsScriptTags)`
No new test needed. Existing test fails when XSS sanitization is removed.
```

**Example — PARTIAL (C++ / GTest):**
```markdown
**Regression Test:**
**Status:** PARTIAL — tests exist for processInput() but miss unsanitized HTML path
**Existing Test File:** `tests/input_test.cpp`
**Modification:** Add to existing file:
```cpp
TEST(InputSanitization, RejectsMaliciousScript) {
  std::string malicious = "<script>alert('xss')</script>";
  std::string result = processInput(malicious);
  EXPECT_EQ(result.find("<script>"), std::string::npos)
      << "Input should be sanitized to remove script tags";
}
```
```

**Example — NO_COVERAGE (Python / pytest):**
```markdown
**Regression Test:**
**Status:** NO_COVERAGE — no tests found for process_input()
**Target File:** `tests/test_input_processor.py` (new file)
```python
import pytest
from input.processor import process_input

def test_rejects_malicious_script():
    """Input should be sanitized to remove script tags."""
    malicious = "<script>alert('xss')</script>"
    result = process_input(malicious)
    assert "<script>" not in result, "XSS script tag should be stripped"
# Expected: FAILS against current code (passes XSS through), PASSES after fix
```
```

**Example — NO_COVERAGE (Go / testing):**
```markdown
**Regression Test:**
**Status:** NO_COVERAGE — no tests found for ProcessInput()
**Target File:** `input/processor_test.go` (new file)
```go
package input

import (
    "strings"
    "testing"
)

func TestProcessInputRejectsMaliciousScript(t *testing.T) {
    malicious := "<script>alert('xss')</script>"
    result := ProcessInput(malicious)
    if strings.Contains(result, "<script>") {
        t.Error("XSS script tag should be stripped from input")
    }
}
// Expected: FAILS against current code (passes XSS through), PASSES after fix
```
```

**Example — N/A (not testable, but still report the bug):**
```markdown
**Regression Test:**
**Status:** N/A — environment config, no executable code path
**Reason:** Bug is in `config/production.yaml` which sets incorrect timeout value. Config files are not unit-testable; fix requires changing the YAML value directly.
```

Severity levels:
- **Critical** - Data loss, security vulnerability, crashes in production, incorrect behavior affecting users
- **Important** - Significant performance issues, edge case bugs, minor UX issues
- **Minor** - Code quality concerns, maintainability issues, minor inconsistencies, cleanup opportunities

## Report Generation

Generate report at:
- **Project-level:** `draft/bughunt-report-<timestamp>.md` (where `<timestamp>` is generated via `date +%Y-%m-%dT%H%M`, e.g., `2026-03-15T1430`)
- **Track-level:** `draft/tracks/<track-id>/bughunt-report-<timestamp>.md` (if analyzing specific track)

After writing the timestamped report, create a symlink pointing to it:
```bash
# Project-level
ln -sf bughunt-report-<timestamp>.md draft/bughunt-report-latest.md

# Track-level
ln -sf bughunt-report-<timestamp>.md draft/tracks/<track-id>/bughunt-report-latest.md
```

Previous timestamped reports are preserved. The `-latest.md` symlink always points to the most recent report.

**MANDATORY: Include YAML frontmatter with git metadata.** Follow the procedure in `core/shared/git-report-metadata.md` to gather git info and generate the frontmatter. Use `generated_by: "draft:bughunt"`.

Report structure:

```markdown
[YAML frontmatter — see core/shared/git-report-metadata.md]

## Final Instructions

**CRITICAL: All verified bugs appear in the main report body.** The Regression Test Suite section organizes test artifacts, but every bug — regardless of whether a test can be written — MUST be documented in the severity sections (Critical/Important/Minor Issues) above. Bugs with `N/A` regression test status are still valid bugs that need reporting.

**CRITICAL: Regression tests are supplementary, not a filter.** If no test framework is detected, or if a bug cannot have a test written (config, docs, LLM workflows), mark it as `N/A` and **still include the bug in the report**. Never skip a verified bug because you cannot write a test for it.

- **No unverified bugs** — Every finding must pass the verification protocol
- **Evidence required** — Include code snippets and trace for every bug
- **Explicit false positive elimination** — State why each bug isn't handled elsewhere
- Analyze all applicable dimensions — skip N/A dimensions explicitly with reason (see Dimension Applicability Check)
- Assume the reader is a senior engineer who will verify your findings
- If Draft context is available, explicitly note which architectural violations or product requirement bugs were found
- Be precise about file locations and line numbers
- Include git branch and commit in report header
- **Write regression tests when possible** — If a test framework is detected, write test files using the project's native framework (Steps 4-6). If no framework exists, skip Steps 2-6 and mark all bugs as `N/A` for regression tests
- **Never modify production code** — Only create/modify test files and their build configs
- **Validate before reporting** — If tests were written, validate syntax/compilation before finalizing; include validation status in the report
- **Respect project conventions** — Match existing test directory structure, naming patterns, import conventions, and framework idioms
- **Use native frameworks** — pytest for Python, `go test` for Go, GTest for C++, Jest/Vitest for JS/TS, `cargo test` for Rust, JUnit for Java — never force a foreign test framework
- **Learn from findings** — After report generation, execute the pattern learning phase from `core/shared/pattern-learning.md` to update `draft/guardrails.md` with newly discovered conventions and anti-patterns

## Cross-Skill Dispatch

- **Auto-invoked by:** `/draft:review` (with `--full` or `with-bughunt` flag)
- **Suggests at completion:**
  - If critical bugs found: "Run `/draft:debug` to investigate critical bugs with structured debugging"
  - If regression suspected: use `git bisect` to find the exact commit that introduced this bug
- If systemic patterns found: "Consider running `/draft:learn` to capture these patterns into guardrails"
- **Feeds into:** `/draft:jira-preview` (bughunt report enriches Jira export)
- **Jira sync:** If ticket linked, attach bughunt report and post comment: "[draft] bughunt-complete: Found {n} issues ({critical} critical, {important} important)" via `core/shared/jira-sync.md`

### Test Writing Guardrail

When generating regression tests during bughunt, follow the standard guardrail:
- Always ask the developer before writing regression tests for bugs found
- Format: "Want me to write regression tests for bugs #{list}? [Y/n]"
- If declined: mark as "Tests: developer-handled" in the report
- This guardrail does NOT apply to the regression test suite section which documents test recommendations (not actual test files)
