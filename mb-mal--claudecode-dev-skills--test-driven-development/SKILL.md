# Test-Driven Development

Generate code that passes provided tests, or create tests first then implement.

## Workflow

### When user provides tests

1. **Analyze tests**: Understand expected inputs, outputs, and edge cases
2. **Identify requirements**: Extract implicit requirements from test assertions
3. **Implement solution**: Write minimal code that passes all tests
4. **Verify**: Run tests to confirm implementation
5. **Refactor**: Improve code while keeping tests green

### When user describes behavior

1. **Clarify requirements**: Ask for specific input/output examples
2. **Write tests first**: Create tests covering happy path and edge cases
3. **Present tests**: Show tests to user for confirmation
4. **Implement**: Write code that passes tests
5. **Iterate**: Add tests for additional cases as needed

## Prompting for test cases

When user provides vague requirements, ask:

- What inputs does this function accept?
- What should it return for a typical case?
- What edge cases should be handled? (empty input, null, boundaries)
- What errors should be raised and when?

## Test template

```python
import pytest

class TestCalculateDiscount:
    """Tests for discount calculation logic."""
    
    def test_no_discount_for_small_order(self):
        """Orders under threshold receive no discount."""
        assert calculate_discount(amount=500) == 0
    
    def test_5_percent_discount_over_1000(self):
        """Orders over 1000 receive 5% discount."""
        assert calculate_discount(amount=1500) == 75
    
    def test_10_percent_discount_over_5000(self):
        """Orders over 5000 receive 10% discount."""
        assert calculate_discount(amount=6000) == 600
    
    def test_zero_amount_returns_zero(self):
        """Zero order amount returns zero discount."""
        assert calculate_discount(amount=0) == 0
    
    def test_negative_amount_raises_error(self):
        """Negative amounts are invalid."""
        with pytest.raises(ValueError):
            calculate_discount(amount=-100)
```

## Implementation workflow

Given the tests above, implement step by step:

```python
def calculate_discount(amount: float) -> float:
    """Calculate order discount based on amount thresholds."""
    if amount < 0:
        raise ValueError("Amount cannot be negative")
    
    if amount >= 5000:
        return amount * 0.10
    elif amount >= 1000:
        return amount * 0.05
    else:
        return 0
```

## Running tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/ -v

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_discount.py -v

# Run with coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing
```

## Best practices

- **One assertion per test** (when practical): Makes failures clear
- **Descriptive test names**: `test_empty_cart_returns_zero_total`
- **Arrange-Act-Assert pattern**: Setup, execute, verify
- **Test edge cases**: Empty, null, boundaries, errors
- **Keep tests independent**: No shared state between tests

## Example interaction

User: "Write a function that validates email addresses"

Response:
1. First, write tests defining valid/invalid emails
2. Show tests: `test_valid_email`, `test_missing_at_symbol`, `test_empty_string`
3. Ask: "Do these test cases cover your requirements?"
4. After confirmation, implement the function
5. Run tests to verify
