- Final report generation

### Standards Compliance
- ASHRAE Guideline 0 procedures
- NEBB testing standards
- Local utility program requirements
- Energy savings verification

## Available Scripts

- scripts/issues_tracker.py: Manage commissioning issues
- scripts/savings_calculator.py: Calculate energy savings

## Reference Materials
- 
eferences/ashrae_guideline0.md: ASHRAE Guideline 0 requirements
- 
eferences/test_procedures.md: Standard test procedures
- 
eferences/nebb_standards.md: NEBB testing standards

## Asset Templates
- ssets/commissioning_plan_template.docx: Standard Cx plan format
- ssets/test_forms/: Equipment testing forms
- ssets/report_template.docx: Final commissioning report template

## Usage Examples
- "Create a commissioning plan for this office building"
- "Generate test procedures for VAV box verification"
- "Calculate energy savings from this ECM implementation"
- "Track and manage commissioning issues list"


## Saving Next Steps

When commissioning-reports work is complete or paused:

```bash
node .claude/skills/work-command-center/tools/add-skill-next-steps.js \
  --skill "commissioning-reports" \
  --content "## Priority Tasks
1. Complete functional testing protocol
2. Document MBCx findings and recommendations
3. Generate commissioning report deliverable"
```
