# EnergyPlus Assistant

Specialized assistant for EnergyPlus building energy modeling workflows with intelligent method selection based on environment and task requirements.

## Core Capabilities

1. **Pre-Simulation QA/QC** - Fast validation using direct parsing (< 5 seconds)
2. **IDF Repair** - Automated fixing of corrupt objects, field shifts, version mismatches
3. **HVAC System Analysis** - Topology discovery and visualization
4. **ECM Testing** - Parametric energy conservation measure evaluation
5. **Environment-Aware** - Adapts to Windows/macOS, Docker available/unavailable

---

## Quick Start (Always Start Here)

### Step 1: Environment Check

```bash
# Check Docker availability
docker ps > /dev/null 2>&1 && echo "✓ Docker available" || echo "✗ Docker unavailable"

# Check Python/eppy
python -c "import eppy; print('✓ eppy available')" 2>/dev/null || echo "⚠ Need: pip install eppy"

# Verify IDF file exists
test -f "$IDF_PATH" && echo "✓ File found" || echo "✗ File not found: $IDF_PATH"
```

### Step 2: Choose Method Based on Task

| Your Task | Best Method | Time | Details |
|-----------|-------------|------|---------|
| **QA/QC validation** | Direct parsing | < 5 sec | [./direct-parsing-methods.md](./direct-parsing-methods.md) |
| **Object counts** | Direct parsing | < 5 sec | [./direct-parsing-methods.md](./direct-parsing-methods.md) |
| **Fix corrupt objects** | fix-equipment-lists.py | < 5 sec | See "IDF Repair" section below |
| **Version mismatch** | fix-equipment-lists.py | < 5 sec | Auto-updates IDF version |
| **HVAC topology** | MCP (if Docker available) | 30+ sec | [./mcp-server-usage.md](./mcp-server-usage.md) |
| **Simulations** | EnergyPlus CLI | Minutes | Native EnergyPlus installation |
| **ECM testing** | MCP or scripts | Varies | [./ecm-testing-workflows.md](./ecm-testing-workflows.md) |

**Key Decision:** For QA/QC (most common), use direct parsing—no Docker required, 10x faster.

---

## Priority Workflows

### 1. Pre-Simulation QA/QC (Most Common)

**Fast Method - Direct Parsing (< 5 seconds):**

```bash
# Install once
pip install eppy

# Run analysis
python ~/.claude/skills/energyplus-assistant/scripts/qaqc-direct.py "$IDF_PATH"
```

**What it checks:**
- Building, zones, surfaces, fenestration
- Constructions and materials
- HVAC systems (air loops, plant loops, zone equipment)
- Internal loads (people, lights, equipment)
- Simulation settings (RunPeriod, SimulationControl)
- Output variables and meters

**Output:**
- Object count summary
- Validation status (PASS/FAIL)
- Critical errors and warnings
- Recommendations for next steps

**When Docker/MCP needed instead:**
- Detailed HVAC connectivity validation
- Automated output variable discovery
- Simulation test runs
- See [./mcp-server-usage.md](./mcp-server-usage.md) for MCP workflows

**Complete documentation:** [./direct-parsing-methods.md](./direct-parsing-methods.md)

---

### 2. HVAC Topology Analysis

**When to use:**
- Understanding existing HVAC before modifications
- Troubleshooting equipment connections
- Visualizing system architecture
- Validating loop configurations

**Methods available:**
1. **MCP Tools** (if Docker available) - Most comprehensive
2. **Text pattern matching** - Quick checks without Docker
3. **IDF Editor** - Visual inspection

**Full documentation:** [./mcp-server-usage.md](./mcp-server-usage.md)

---

### 3. IDF Repair and Fixing Corrupt Objects

**When to use:**
- Fatal errors from corrupt ZoneHVAC:EquipmentList objects
- Field shifting issues (data in wrong field positions)
- IDF version mismatches between file and EnergyPlus installation
- Duplicate object errors preventing simulation

**fix-equipment-lists.py** - Automated repair tool

```bash
# Fix corrupted equipment lists + update version
python ~/.claude/skills/energyplus-assistant/scripts/fix-equipment-lists.py input.idf output.idf
```

**What it does:**
1. **Detects corruption patterns:**
   - Blank object types with present names (field shift)
   - Equipment names in numeric sequence fields
   - Non-numeric values in cooling/heating sequence fields

2. **Automatically fixes:**
   - Removes ALL corrupted equipment lists (no duplicates)
   - Reconstructs with correct field structure
   - Sets proper cooling/heating sequences (1, 2, 3...)

3. **Updates IDF version:**
   - Detects current version (e.g., 24.2)
   - Updates to match installed EnergyPlus (e.g., 25.1)
   - No separate transition tool needed

**Output:**
- Analysis report of corrupted vs clean objects
- Fixed IDF file ready for simulation
- Summary of changes made

**Philosophy:** "Let tools handle syntax, let humans handle logic"
- eppy ensures syntactically correct IDF format
- You specify the logic (what fields should contain)
- Tool guarantees proper file structure

**Example error this fixes:**
```
** Severe ** processZoneEquipmentInput: ZoneHVAC:EquipmentList = "THERMAL ZONE: CARDIO 1 EQUIPMENT LIST".
**   ~~~   ** invalid zone_equipment_cooling_sequence=[2].
**   ~~~   ** equipment sequence must be > 0 and <= number of equipments in the list.
**   ~~~   ** only 1 in the list.
**  Fatal  ** GetZoneEquipmentData: Errors found in getting Zone Equipment input.
```

### 4. ECM Testing

**When to use:**
- Testing lighting upgrades
- Evaluating plug load reductions
- Infiltration reduction strategies
- Occupancy schedule changes

**Full documentation:** [./ecm-testing-workflows.md](./ecm-testing-workflows.md)

---

## Environment-Specific Guidance

### Windows Users

Docker path formats, console encoding, Git Bash considerations:
**See [./windows-setup.md](./windows-setup.md)**

Key points:
- Use forward slashes in Docker mounts: `C:/Users/...`
- Git Bash: Double slashes for workdir: `//workspace//...`
- PowerShell: Single slashes work fine
- Set UTF-8 encoding: `$env:PYTHONIOENCODING = "utf-8"`

### macOS/Linux Users

Generally straightforward:
- Docker paths use native format
- UTF-8 typically default
- Bash commands work as documented

## Troubleshooting

### "Docker not available"
→ Use direct parsing methods (faster anyway for QA/QC)

### "MCP startup slow (30+ seconds)"
→ Use direct parsing for QA/QC, reserve MCP for complex HVAC analysis

### "Unicode/encoding errors on Windows"
→ See [./windows-setup.md](./windows-setup.md) for console encoding setup

### "Path format errors in Docker"
→ See [./windows-setup.md](./windows-setup.md) for Windows path guidance

### "eppy not installed"
```bash
pip install eppy
```

## Performance Expectations

| Task | Direct Parsing | MCP Tools | Native EnergyPlus |
|------|----------------|-----------|-------------------|
| QA/QC | < 5 sec | 30+ sec startup | N/A |
| Object counts | < 5 sec | 30+ sec startup | N/A |
| HVAC topology | Basic (< 5 sec) | Detailed (30+ sec) | N/A |
| 1-day simulation | N/A | Minutes | Seconds to minutes |
| Annual simulation | N/A | Hours | Hours |

**Recommendation:** Start with fast methods, escalate to slower methods only when needed.
