# Running OpenStudio Models

This skill helps you work with OpenStudio 3.10 `.osm` models to modify building systems, apply measures, and run simulations. It focuses on practical model adjustments and validation runs using the OpenStudio CLI.

# Core Approach

1. **Model Versioning**: Always save new versions before making changes (format: `projectname_YYYY-MM-DD_vX.osm`)
2. **Incremental Changes**: Modify HVAC, zones, schedules, or constructions systematically
3. **Apply Measures**: Use existing measures from BCL or local libraries
4. **Run & Validate**: Execute simulations and verify successful completion
5. **Delegate Issues**: Hand off failures to `diagnosing-energy-models` skill
6. **Delegate Custom Measures**: Hand off measure creation to `writing-openstudio-model-measures` skill

# OpenStudio CLI Basics

**Installation Path**: `C:\openstudio-3.10.0\bin\openstudio.exe`

**Core Commands**:
- `openstudio.exe run --workflow workflow.osw` - Run complete simulation
- `openstudio.exe run --measures_only --workflow workflow.osw` - Apply measures without simulation
- `openstudio.exe measure --update /path/to/measure/` - Update measure metadata

**File Conventions**:
- No whitespace in paths: use `underscored_path/my_model.osm` not `whitespace path/my model.osm`
- Use forward slashes in OSW files even on Windows

# Step-by-Step Workflow

## 1. Version the Current Model

Before any changes, create a versioned copy:

```bash
# Get current date for filename
node -e "console.log(new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0])"

# Copy model with versioning (example for project Example-RecCenter)
cp existing_model.osm Example-RecCenter_2025-12-03_v1.osm
```

**Naming Convention**: `{projectname}_{YYYY-MM-DD}_v{X}.osm`
- `projectname`: Project identifier (e.g., Example-RecCenter, Example-Office)
- `YYYY-MM-DD`: Today's date
- `vX`: Version number for that day (v1, v2, v3, etc.)

## 2. Check for Weather File

Before running simulations, verify weather file exists:

```bash
# Check if .epw file exists in current directory
cmd /c "dir *.epw /b"
```

If no weather file found:
- **Prompt user**: "No weather file found. Please provide the `.epw` file for this project."
- **Ask for location**: User should place `.epw` in the project folder or provide path

## 3. Create or Modify OpenStudio Workflow (OSW)

Create a JSON workflow file to define the simulation:

**Basic OSW Template** (`workflow.osw`):
```json
{
  "seed_file": "Example-RecCenter_2025-12-03_v1.osm",
  "weather_file": "USA_CO_Fort_Collins.epw",
  "steps": []
}
```

**OSW with Measures**:
```json
{
  "seed_file": "Example-RecCenter_2025-12-03_v1.osm",
  "weather_file": "USA_CO_Fort_Collins.epw",
  "steps": [
    {
      "measure_dir_name": "AddMeter",
      "arguments": {
        "meter_name": "Electricity:Facility"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Use Node.js to generate OSW files programmatically:

```javascript
#!/usr/bin/env node
import { writeFile } from 'fs/promises';

const workflow = {
  seed_file: "Example-RecCenter_2025-12-03_v1.osm",
  weather_file: "USA_CO_Fort_Collins.epw",
  steps: []
};

await writeFile('workflow.osw', JSON.stringify(workflow, null, 2));
console.log("Created workflow.osw");
```

## 4. Search and Download Measures from BCL

The Building Component Library (BCL) hosts community measures.

**Search for measures**:
- Visit: https://bcl.nrel.gov/
- Search by keyword (e.g., "HVAC", "schedule", "envelope")
- Note the measure name and download URL

**Download measures manually**:
1. Download `.tar.gz` or `.zip` from BCL
2. Extract to `measures/` directory in project folder
3. Update measure metadata:

```bash
C:\openstudio-3.10.0\bin\openstudio.exe measure --update measures/measure_name/
```

**Organize measures**:
```bash
# Create measures directory
mkdir measures

# After downloading and extracting BCL measure
C:\openstudio-3.10.0\bin\openstudio.exe measure --update_all measures/
```

## 5. Apply Measures to Model

**Option A: Using OSW Workflow** (Recommended)

Add measures to the `steps` array in your OSW file:

```json
{
  "seed_file": "Example-RecCenter_2025-12-03_v1.osm",
  "weather_file": "USA_CO_Fort_Collins.epw",
  "steps": [
    {
      "measure_dir_name": "SetThermostatSchedules",
      "arguments": {
        "heating_setpoint": 20,
        "cooling_setpoint": 24
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Run with measures only (no simulation):

```bash
C:\openstudio-3.10.0\bin\openstudio.exe run --measures_only --workflow workflow.osw
```

**Option B: Compute Measure Arguments**

If you need to see what arguments a measure accepts:

```bash
C:\openstudio-3.10.0\bin\openstudio.exe measure --compute_arguments Example-RecCenter_2025-12-03_v1.osm measures/SetThermostatSchedules/
```

## 6. Run Simulation

Execute the full simulation workflow:

```bash
C:\openstudio-3.10.0\bin\openstudio.exe run --workflow workflow.osw
```

**With debugging** (if issues expected):

```bash
C:\openstudio-3.10.0\bin\openstudio.exe --verbose run --debug --workflow workflow.osw
```

**Output Files**:
- `run/` directory created with simulation results
- `run/eplusout.err` - EnergyPlus error file
- `run/eplusout.sql` - Simulation results database
- `out.osw` - Workflow output with execution log

## 7. Check Simulation Success

**Quick Check**:
```bash
# Check if error file exists and is small (successful runs have minimal errors)
cmd /c "dir run\eplusout.err"

# View last 20 lines of error file
cmd /c "type run\eplusout.err | more +20"
```

**Success Indicators**:
- `out.osw` contains `"completed_status": "Success"`
- `eplusout.err` has no severe errors
- `eplusout.sql` file exists and has data

**Failure Indicators**:
- `out.osw` shows `"completed_status": "Fail"`
- `eplusout.err` contains `** Severe **` errors
- Missing output files

## 8. Handle Simulation Failures

If simulation fails, **delegate to `diagnosing-energy-models` skill**:

**Gather context**:
```bash
# Read error file
type run\eplusout.err

# Check out.osw for step_errors
type out.osw | findstr "step_errors"

# Get model summary
C:\openstudio-3.10.0\bin\openstudio.exe --verbose run --measures_only --workflow workflow.osw
```

**Hand off to diagnostic skill**:
- Provide path to `.err` file
- Include `out.osw` step_errors
- Describe what changes were made
- Share OSW file contents

Example delegation:
> "Simulation failed with severe errors. Delegating to `diagnosing-energy-models` skill to analyze `run/eplusout.err` and diagnose the issue. Changes made: [describe HVAC/zone/schedule modifications]."

# Model Modification Patterns

## Modifying HVAC Systems

OpenStudio models use object-oriented HVAC components. Common modifications:

**Access HVAC loops programmatically** (requires Ruby or Python bindings):
- Air loops: `model.getAirLoopHVACs`
- Plant loops: `model.getPlantLoops`
- Thermal zones: `model.getThermalZones`

**Recommended approach**: Use existing measures from BCL
- "Add HVAC System" measure family
- "Replace HVAC" measures
- "Modify HVAC" measures

If custom HVAC logic needed, **delegate to `writing-openstudio-model-measures` skill**.

## Modifying Thermal Zones

**Via Measures**:
- "Set Thermal Zone Properties"
- "Assign Spaces to Thermal Zones"
- "Merge Thermal Zones"

**Manual edits**: Not recommended via CLI (use OpenStudio Application GUI or custom measure)

## Modifying Schedules

**Via Measures**:
- "Set Thermostat Schedules"
- "Modify Occupancy Schedules"
- "Add Typical Schedules"

**Arguments example**:
```json
{
  "measure_dir_name": "SetThermostatSchedules",
  "arguments": {
    "heating_setpoint_schedule": "HtgSetp 20C",
    "cooling_setpoint_schedule": "ClgSetp 24C"
  }
}
```

## Modifying Constructions

**Via Measures**:
- "Set Construction Properties"
- "Increase Insulation R-Value"
- "Replace Constructions"

**Arguments example**:
```json
{
  "measure_dir_name": "IncreaseInsulationRValueForExteriorWalls",
  "arguments": {
    "r_value": 3.5
  }
}
```

# Validation Checklist

After running simulation, verify:
- [ ] New versioned `.osm` file created
- [ ] Simulation completed without severe errors
- [ ] `eplusout.sql` file generated
- [ ] `out.osw` shows `"completed_status": "Success"`
- [ ] Results make sense for changes made

If failures occur:
- [ ] Delegate to `diagnosing-energy-models` with error context
- [ ] Include `.err` file path and recent changes

# Common Issues & Quick Fixes

## Issue: Missing Weather File

**Symptoms**: Workflow fails immediately with "weather file not found"

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check for weather files
cmd /c "dir *.epw /b"

# If missing, prompt user for .epw file path
```

**Prompt**: "No weather file found. Please provide the `.epw` file path for this project."

## Issue: Measure Not Found

**Symptoms**: `out.osw` shows measure directory not found

**Investigation**:
```bash
# Check measures directory
cmd /c "dir measures /b"

# Update measure if it exists
C:\openstudio-3.10.0\bin\openstudio.exe measure --update measures/MeasureName/
```

**Solution**:
- Download measure from BCL
- Verify measure directory name matches OSW `measure_dir_name`
- Run `--update` to regenerate metadata

## Issue: Model Translation Failure

**Symptoms**: Fails when translating OSM to IDF

**Delegate to**: `diagnosing-energy-models` skill
- Likely geometry issues (intersecting surfaces, non-planar surfaces)
- Could be orphaned objects

## Issue: EnergyPlus Simulation Severe Errors

**Symptoms**: Simulation runs but produces severe errors in `eplusout.err`

**Delegate to**: `diagnosing-energy-models` skill with:
- Path to `run/eplusout.err`
- Description of model changes
- OSW file contents

# Skill Orchestration

## Context Awareness

This skill integrates with work-command-center session tracking:

**Check Active Context:**

```bash
node .claude/skills/work-command-center/tools/session-state.js status
```

Returns: Project name, project number, duration, and deliverables context

**Log Activity Checkpoints:**

```bash
node .claude/skills/work-command-center/tools/session-state.js checkpoint \
  --activity "running-openstudio-models: Simulation completed successfully, annual EUI: 42.3 kBtu/sf"
```

**Signal Completion (called by WCC after skill returns):**

```bash
node .claude/skills/work-command-center/tools/session-state.js skill-complete \
  --skill-name "running-openstudio-models" \
  --summary "Simulation successful. EUI: 42.3 kBtu/sf. Model saved as v2.osm." \
  --outcome "success"
```

**Benefits:**

- WCC tracks time spent in this skill
- Session logs include skill work breakdown
- Context visible across skill transitions
- Deliverables auto-update from skill outcomes
