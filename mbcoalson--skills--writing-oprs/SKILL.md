# Writing OPRs Skill

This skill provides guidance and templates for creating Owner Project Requirements (OPR) documents for building commissioning projects.

## What is an OPR?

The Owner Project Requirements (OPR) is a foundational commissioning document that captures:
- The owner's project goals and objectives
- Performance expectations and success metrics
- System-specific requirements and operating criteria
- Sustainability and energy efficiency targets
- Maintenance and operations considerations

The OPR serves as the basis for the Basis of Design (BOD) and guides the entire commissioning process.

## Core Capabilities

### OPR Document Structure
- Project overview and objectives
- Owner program requirements
- Systems narrative and performance criteria
- Indoor environmental quality requirements
- Energy efficiency and sustainability goals
- Maintenance and operations requirements

### Standards Compliance
- ASHRAE Standard 202-2018: Commissioning Process for Buildings and Systems
- ASHRAE Guideline 0: The Commissioning Process
- LEED certification requirements
- Local energy code and utility requirements

### Document Development Process
1. Conduct owner interviews to understand goals and priorities
2. Review project drawings and specifications
3. Draft system-specific requirements
4. Establish measurable performance criteria
5. Coordinate with design team and stakeholders
6. Finalize and obtain owner approval

## Reference Templates

The skill includes three reference OPR examples covering different building types:

- **references/2022_OPR.md**: Commercial office renovation (generic template)
  - Complex multi-tenant office building
  - Advanced HVAC systems and controls
  - Sustainability and LEED requirements

- **references/OPR_2022_HS.md**: Educational facility (generic template)
  - K-12 school with specialized spaces
  - Occupant comfort and IAQ focus
  - Energy efficiency requirements

- **references/Example-Project-2025-OPR-fixed.md**: Community center (specific example)
  - Example project - working test case
  - Mixed-use facility with pool and multipurpose spaces
  - Xcel Energy program requirements

## Key OPR Sections

### 1. Project Overview
- Project description and scope
- Location and site context
- Facility use and occupancy
- Project team and stakeholders

### 2. Owner's Goals and Objectives
- Primary mission and purpose
- Success criteria and priorities
- Budget and schedule constraints
- Long-term operational goals

### 3. System Requirements
For each major building system:
- Functional requirements
- Performance criteria (with measurable targets)
- Operating parameters
- Integration requirements
- Maintenance considerations

### 4. Indoor Environmental Quality
- Temperature and humidity setpoints
- Ventilation and air quality requirements
- Lighting levels and controls
- Acoustic performance criteria

### 5. Energy and Sustainability
- Energy performance targets
- Renewable energy goals
- Water conservation requirements
- Sustainable materials and operations

### 6. Commissioning Scope
- Systems to be commissioned
- Testing and verification requirements
- Documentation deliverables
- Training requirements

## Usage Examples

- "Write an OPR for a new office building commissioning project"
- "Help me draft the HVAC requirements section for this OPR"
- "Review this OPR draft and suggest improvements"
- "Create an OPR based on the owner interview notes"
- "Update the energy performance requirements in this OPR"
- "What measurable criteria should I include for the lighting system?"

## Best Practices

### Measurable Criteria
Always define requirements with specific, measurable criteria:
- ❌ "The HVAC system shall maintain comfortable temperatures"
- ✅ "The HVAC system shall maintain space temperatures of 72°F ± 2°F during occupied hours"

### Owner-Focused Language
Write from the owner's perspective, not the engineer's:
- Focus on outcomes and performance, not equipment or methods
- Use clear, accessible language (avoid excessive jargon)
- Emphasize operational and maintenance considerations

### Alignment with Project Phase
- Early design: Focus on goals, objectives, and performance targets
- Later phases: More specific system requirements and acceptance criteria
- Always maintain focus on "what" not "how" (that's for the BOD)

## Progressive Disclosure

For detailed guidance on specific sections or systems, ask:
- "How do I write measurable performance criteria?"
- "What should I include in the HVAC systems narrative?"
- "How do I document energy efficiency requirements?"
- "What level of detail is appropriate for [specific system]?"


## Saving Next Steps

When writing-oprs work is complete or paused:

```bash
node .claude/skills/work-command-center/tools/add-skill-next-steps.js \
  --skill "writing-oprs" \
  --content "## Priority Tasks
1. Complete OPR Section 3 - Performance Requirements
2. Review OPR with stakeholders
3. Finalize OPR deliverable for commissioning project"
```
