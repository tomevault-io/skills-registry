# WhatsApp Flows Skill

Build conversational WhatsApp experiences with dynamic forms, conditional logic, and server integration.

## Quick Start

### What are WhatsApp Flows?

WhatsApp Flows are structured conversations that collect user input through a series of screens. Use them to:
- Collect information (forms, surveys)
- Implement conditional logic (eligibility checks, branching)
- Display dynamic data (products, prices, inventory)
- Validate user input server-side
- Complete multi-step processes

### 5 Key Concepts

1. **Screens** - Individual steps in your flow. Each has a unique ID and layout.
2. **Components** - Building blocks (TextInput, Dropdown, Footer, If, etc.)
3. **Form Data** - User input via `${form.field_name}` binding
4. **Server Data** - Dynamic data via `${data.field_name}` binding
5. **Actions** - What happens: navigate, data_exchange, complete, update_data, open_url

### Minimal Example

```json
{
  "version": "7.1",
  "screens": [
    {
      "id": "GREETING",
      "title": "Greeting",
      "layout": {
        "type": "SingleColumnLayout",
        "children": [
          {
            "type": "TextHeading",
            "text": "Welcome!"
          },
          {
            "type": "TextBody",
            "text": "Please tell us your name to proceed.",
            "markdown": true
          },
          {
            "type": "TextInput",
            "name": "name",
            "label": "What's your name?",
            "required": true
          },
          {
            "type": "Footer",
            "label": "Continue",
            "on-click-action": {
              "name": "navigate",
              "next": {
                "type": "screen",
                "name": "CONFIRMATION"
              }
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "CONFIRMATION",
      "title": "Confirmation",
      "terminal": true,
      "success": true,
      "layout": {
        "type": "SingleColumnLayout",
        "children": [
          {
            "type": "TextHeading",
            "text": "Hello ${screen.GREETING.form.name}!"
          },
          {
            "type": "Footer",
            "label": "Done",
            "on-click-action": {
              "name": "complete",
              "payload": {
                "name": "${screen.GREETING.form.name}"
              }
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Business 3.0 API Requirements:**
- Every screen MUST have a `title` property
- Action properties use `name` (not `action`) with nested structure

**When to add `data_api_version`:**
- Only include `"data_api_version": "3.0"` if your flow needs server integration (data validation, dynamic data, form submission to backend)
- If your flow is client-side only with no backend endpoints, omit this property
- See [server-integration.md](reference/server-integration.md) for details on setting up endpoints

---

## Business 3.0 API Requirements

WhatsApp Flows uses the Business 3.0 API which has specific requirements:

**Every screen MUST have:**
- `id` (required) - Unique screen identifier
- `title` (required) - Screen title for display and navigation

**Markdown formatting:**
- Only **TextBody** and **TextCaption** support markdown
- Set `"markdown": true` to enable formatting
- **TextHeading does NOT support markdown** (will cause validation error)
- Markdown is disabled by default if property omitted

**Optional server integration:**
- `data_api_version: "3.0"` - Only required if your flow calls backend endpoints
- `routing_model` - Only required with `data_api_version` for dynamic routing

**Minimal structure (no backend needed):**
```json
{
  "version": "7.1",
  "screens": [
    {
      "id": "SCREEN_ID",
      "title": "Screen Title",
      "layout": { ... }
    }
  ]
}
```

**With server integration (backend endpoints):**
```json
{
  "version": "7.1",
  "data_api_version": "3.0",
  "routing_model": { ... },
  "screens": [
    {
      "id": "SCREEN_ID",
      "title": "Screen Title",
      "layout": { ... }
    }
  ]
}
```

See **[constraints.md](reference/constraints.md)** for complete validation rules and **[server-integration.md](reference/server-integration.md)** for endpoint setup.

## Essential Constraints

| Item | Limit | Impact |
|------|-------|--------|
| Components per screen | 50 | Split into multiple screens if exceeded |
| Nesting depth (If/Switch) | 3 levels | Simplify logic or use separate screens |
| Flow JSON size | 10MB | Compress or split large flows |
| Text heading length | 80 chars | Be concise with titles (NO markdown) |
| Text body length | 4096 chars | Supports markdown v5.1+ (set `markdown: true`) |
| Dropdown options | 200 (static) | Use dynamic data for more options |
| Image max size | 300KB | Optimize images before including |
| Image count per screen | 3 | Limit media usage per screen |
| Screen title | Required | Business 3.0 API requirement |

See **[constraints.md](reference/constraints.md)** for complete reference.

---

## Common Tasks

### I need to add formatted text (bold, lists, emphasis)

1. Use **TextBody** or **TextCaption** components (not TextHeading)
2. Add `"markdown": true` property to enable formatting
3. Use markdown syntax: `**bold**`, `*italic*`, `\n` for line breaks, `• item` for lists
4. Without `markdown: true`, markdown syntax displays as plain text
5. For rich formatting with headers/tables, use **RichText** instead
6. See [components.md](reference/components.md) text components section

**Example:**
```json
{
  "type": "TextBody",
  "text": "**Important:** Please read the following carefully.\n\n• First item\n• Second item",
  "markdown": true
}
```

### I need to collect user information

1. Create a screen with TextInput, TextArea, DatePicker components
2. Add Footer with navigate action to next screen
3. On confirmation screen, use global reference `${screen.FIRST_SCREEN.form.field_name}`
4. Make sure every screen has a `title` property (Business 3.0 requirement)
5. See [components.md](reference/components.md) input section

### I need conditional branching

1. Use If component for true/false decisions
2. Use Switch component for multiple options
3. Reference form data: `${form.field_name}` or `${screen.X.form.field}`
4. Maximum 3 levels of nesting allowed
5. See [conditional-logic.md](reference/conditional-logic.md)

### I need to validate with a backend

1. Add `data_api_version: "3.0"` and `routing_model` to flow
2. Add `data_exchange` action to Footer/DatePicker/selection component
3. Server receives form data in payload
4. Server validates and responds with next screen or errors
5. See [server-integration.md](reference/server-integration.md)

### I need to display dynamic data

1. Declare data schema on screen with `__example__` values
2. Use data_exchange action to fetch from server
3. Reference with `${data.field_name}` in Dropdown, NavigationList, text
4. See [data-binding.md](reference/data-binding.md)

### I need to validate my Flow JSON

```bash
# Full validation
python scripts/validate_flow.py your-flow.json

# Component-specific validation
python scripts/validate_components.py your-flow.json
```

Validators check:
- JSON syntax
- Required properties
- Component counts
- Character limits
- Field name matching

---

## Best Practices

### Form Design
1. Keep screens focused - one question per screen is ideal
2. Use clear, concise labels
3. Provide helpful validation messages
4. Show progress through multi-step flows
5. Make required fields obvious

### Data Handling
1. Always validate on server (never trust client)
2. Use global references `${screen.X.form.field}` instead of payloads
3. Mark sensitive fields with `sensitive: true`
4. Never expose sensitive data in error messages
5. Use HTTPS for all external URLs

### Conditional Logic
1. Keep conditions simple (one or two checks)
2. Use Switch instead of nested If for many options
3. Test all branches thoroughly
4. Provide feedback for conditional content
5. Document complex logic with comments

### Performance
1. Keep JSON under 1MB when possible
2. Optimize image sizes (max 300KB)
3. Limit components per screen (max 50)
4. Use server pagination for large datasets
5. Cache dynamic data when appropriate

### Mobile Considerations
1. Design for small screens (320px width)
2. Keep text concise and readable
3. Test on actual devices
4. Use larger touch targets (buttons)
5. Minimize scrolling

## Troubleshooting

### "condition is always false"
- Check field name matches component `name` property (case-sensitive)
- Verify field exists before referencing
- Use `${form.field}` not `${form.Field}`

### "Field validation errors don't appear"
- Ensure server returns errors with matching field names
- Check response format includes `errors` object
- Verify field names match input component `name` properties

### "Dynamic data not showing"
- Check data schema includes `__example__` for all properties
- Verify server response includes the data
- Use correct binding syntax: `${data.field_name}`
- Check component supports dynamic data (Dropdown, NavigationList)

### "Navigation not working"
- Verify next_screen exists in screens array
- Check screen IDs are unique (case-sensitive)
- For data_exchange, ensure routing_model includes path
- Verify action is in correct component (Footer, EmbeddedLink, etc.)

### "JSON validation fails"
- Run `python scripts/validate_flow.py` for error details
- Check required properties present (version, screens, layout)
- Verify no undefined component types
- Check screen ID and field name rules (alphanumeric + underscore)

See **[constraints.md](reference/constraints.md)** for complete validation rules and common errors.
