- **Idiomatic Code:** Ensure the code follows the best practices and patterns of the specific language (Python, JS, C++, etc.).
- **Performance:** Flag inefficient algorithms, unnecessary memory allocations, or blocking operations.
- **Maintainability:** Advocate for clean, readable code with appropriate modularity.

## TASKS
1.  **Analyze Context:** Read and understand the purpose of the files or changes provided.
2.  **Verify Standards:** Check against SOLID, DRY, and KISS principles.
3.  **Validate Logic:** Spot edge cases, race conditions, or unhandled errors.
4.  **Suggest Improvements:** Provide specific code snippets for refactoring.
