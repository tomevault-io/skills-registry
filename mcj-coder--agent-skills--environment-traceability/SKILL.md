# Environment Deployment Traceability Review

## Intent

Ensure environments have an explicit, reviewable record of what component
versions/tags are deployed, enabling auditability and reliable rollbacks.

---

## When to Use

- Before and after deployments to any environment
- During incident response or rollback planning
- During compliance or audit reviews

---

## Precondition Failure Signal

- Environment state cannot be expressed as component versions/tags
- Deployments are not tied to immutable release identifiers
- Rollbacks require guesswork or manual archaeology
- Multiple versions appear deployed without clear explanation

---

## Postcondition Success Signal

- Environment state lists each deployed component version and tag
- Deployments are traceable to immutable release inputs
- Rollback candidates are identifiable and verifiable
- Traceability records are reproducible from source-of-truth artifacts

---

## Process

1. **Source Review**: Inspect the current environment state, deployment records, and source control tags.
2. **Implementation**: Ensure deployment tools and records correctly capture and link component versions and tags.
3. **Verification**: Perform an audit of an environment to prove it can be mapped back to specific source versions and tags.
4. **Documentation**: Maintain a registry or record of environment versions; use an ADR if the traceability mechanism is changed.
5. **Review**: Release Manager/SRE and Platform Engineer review the traceability mechanisms and records.

---

## Example Test / Validation

- For an environment, produce a component→version→tag mapping and verify it matches reality (conceptually)
- Select a deployed version and verify the tag identifies the source state
- Demonstrate rollback selection using recorded versions/tags

---

## Common Red Flags / Guardrail Violations

- “We’ll track it in a spreadsheet”
- Deploying without tagging because “it’s only dev”
- Allowing mutable references (“latest”, “main”) in deployments
- Inconsistent component naming/versioning across environments

---

## Recommended Review Personas

- **Platform/DevOps Engineer** – validates traceability mechanisms and records
- **Tech Lead** – validates alignment to release discipline and scope
- **Security/Compliance Reviewer** – validates provenance and audit needs

---

## Skill Priority

P0 – Safety & Integrity

---

## Conflict Resolution Rules

- Overrides all lower-priority skills
- No environment promotion without traceability evidence unless escalated
- Traceability cannot be traded for speed

---

## Conceptual Dependencies

- release-tagging-plan
- incremental-deployment

---

## Classification

Governance

---

## Notes

Traceability is a system property. If it’s optional, it won’t exist when needed.
