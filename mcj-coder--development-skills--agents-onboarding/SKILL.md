# Agents-Onboarding

## Overview

Create AGENTS.md at repository root to enable fresh agent context to apply all
repository standards and external skills. Fresh agents (no conversation history)
must understand how to work in the repository by reading only AGENTS.md.

**REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** `superpowers:brainstorming`
**REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** `superpowers:verification-before-completion`

## When to Use

- User integrates AI agents into repository for first time
- User asks to set up agent guidance, rules, or onboarding documentation
- Repository is missing agent-specific onboarding docs (no AGENTS.md)
- Fresh agent context needs to understand repository standards without conversation history
- Existing AGENTS.md is incomplete or outdated and needs enhancement

## Core Workflow

1. **Announce** skill and why it applies.
2. **Analyze** repository for existing standards (brownfield) or define new (greenfield).
3. **Create** AGENTS.md at repository root with required sections.
4. **Validate** fresh context test: agent with only AGENTS.md can apply standards.
5. **Commit** with evidence.

## AGENTS.md Required Sections

- **Repository Overview:** Purpose, architecture, key constraints
- **Required Skills:** External (`superpowers:*`) and custom skills with triggers
- **Development Standards:** Code style, testing, review, deployment
- **Repository Conventions:** Directory structure, naming, documentation
- **Process Guidance:** PR workflow, deployment, escalation paths
- **Context Optimization:** What agents must know, focus areas

## Red Flags - STOP

- "Agent can figure it out"
- "We'll document standards later"
- "Just need basic agent help"
- "Only one person uses agents here"

All of these mean: Apply skill, create comprehensive AGENTS.md.
