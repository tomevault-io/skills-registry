# Deployment Provenance

## Overview

**P0 Safety & Integrity** - Deployment provenance establishes immutable traceability from running
artifact back to source commit, build process, and deployment actor. Critical for audit compliance,
security incident response, and confident rollback decisions.

**REQUIRED:** superpowers:verification-before-completion

## When to Use

- Deploying to production or staging environments
- Setting up CI/CD pipelines for any deployable artifact
- Investigating production incidents requiring deployment history
- Establishing audit compliance for regulated environments
- Enabling confident rollback decisions

## Core Workflow

1. **Source Identification**: Tag or record exact commit SHA deployed
2. **Build Provenance**: Capture build number, pipeline, and build timestamp
3. **Artifact Signing**: Sign artifacts cryptographically (optional but recommended)
4. **Deployment Recording**: Log deployment timestamp, environment, and actor
5. **Artifact Labelling**: Embed provenance metadata in artifact (labels, manifests)
6. **Audit Trail**: Persist deployment records to immutable store
7. **Verification**: Validate provenance chain before and after deployment

## Provenance Record Schema

Every deployment MUST capture:

| Field              | Description                         | Example                                   |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `commit_sha`       | Full Git commit SHA                 | `a1b2c3d4e5f6...`                         |
| `branch`           | Source branch name                  | `main`, `release/1.2.0`                   |
| `build_id`         | CI/CD build identifier              | `build-12345`                             |
| `build_timestamp`  | When artifact was built (ISO 8601)  | `2025-01-15T10:30:00Z`                    |
| `deploy_timestamp` | When deployment occurred (ISO 8601) | `2025-01-15T11:00:00Z`                    |
| `environment`      | Target environment                  | `production`, `staging`                   |
| `actor`            | Who/what triggered deployment       | `ci-bot`, `jane.doe@example.com`          |
| `artifact_digest`  | SHA256 hash of deployed artifact    | `sha256:abc123...`                        |
| `pipeline_url`     | Link to CI/CD pipeline run          | `https://github.com/org/repo/actions/...` |
| `signature`        | Cryptographic signature (if signed) | `sigstore:...` or `gpg:...`               |

## Implementation Patterns

### Container Deployments

```dockerfile
LABEL org.opencontainers.image.revision="${GIT_SHA}"
LABEL org.opencontainers.image.created="${BUILD_TIMESTAMP}"
LABEL org.opencontainers.image.source="${REPO_URL}"
LABEL com.example.build-id="${BUILD_ID}"
LABEL com.example.pipeline-url="${PIPELINE_URL}"
```

### Kubernetes Deployments

```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    deployment.kubernetes.io/revision: "1"
    app.example.com/git-sha: "${GIT_SHA}"
    app.example.com/build-id: "${BUILD_ID}"
    app.example.com/deployed-by: "${ACTOR}"
    app.example.com/deployed-at: "${DEPLOY_TIMESTAMP}"
```

### Application Version Endpoints

Expose `/version` or `/health` endpoint returning provenance:

```json
{
  "version": "1.2.3",
  "commit": "a1b2c3d4",
  "build": "12345",
  "built_at": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "environment": "production"
}
```

## Audit Trail Storage

Store deployment records in an append-only audit log:

- **Git-based**: Deployment log file in ops repository
- **Database**: Append-only table with deployment events
- **External**: Audit systems (Splunk, CloudTrail, Azure Monitor)

Minimum retention: Follow organisational compliance requirements (typically 1-7 years).

## Verification Checklist

Before deployment:

- [ ] Commit SHA matches expected release
- [ ] Build provenance chain intact (commit to artifact)
- [ ] Artifact digest matches build output
- [ ] Signature valid (if signing enabled)
- [ ] Deployment actor authorised for target environment

After deployment:

- [ ] Version endpoint returns expected provenance
- [ ] Deployment event recorded in audit log
- [ ] Rollback target identified (previous deployment record)

## Red Flags - STOP

- "We deploy from local builds" - No reproducibility or audit trail
- "Version is just a timestamp" - Cannot trace to source code
- "Anyone can deploy to production" - No actor accountability
- "We don't track what's deployed" - Incident investigation impossible
- "Rollback means redeploy latest main" - May not match previous state

**All mean: Establish provenance tracking before proceeding with deployment.**

## Tooling Integration

| Platform       | Provenance Tool                              |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| GitHub Actions | Built-in attestations, Sigstore, SLSA        |
| Azure DevOps   | Pipeline artifacts, deployment gates         |
| GitLab CI      | Release evidence, container signing          |
| Jenkins        | Build metadata plugin, artifact fingerprints |
| ArgoCD         | Application annotations, sync status         |
| Kubernetes     | OCI labels, admission controllers            |
