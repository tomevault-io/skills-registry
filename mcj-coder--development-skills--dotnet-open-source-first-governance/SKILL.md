## Overview

Enforce open-source-first dependency selection with mandatory live license revalidation at
review time. Historical OSS status is insufficient; verify current licensing via web search
for every dependency selection, upgrade, or review to catch recent licensing changes.

## When to Use

- Selecting a new library or tool dependency
- Upgrading any dependency (minor or major version)
- Performing PR, architecture, security, or dependency reviews
- Evaluating alternatives for an existing proprietary or source-available component
- Auditing existing dependencies for license compliance

## Core Workflow

1. **Prefer open-source**: Default to OSS libraries over proprietary or source-available alternatives
2. **Perform live web search**: Search for current licensing status (not cached/historical data)
3. **Verify authoritative sources**: Check project homepage, LICENSE file, release notes, issue tracker
4. **Confirm exact version license**: Verify licensing for the specific version being adopted
5. **Check transitive dependencies**: Spot-check critical transitives for license changes
6. **Document verification**: Record license name, verification source(s), and verification date (UTC)
7. **Gate on missing verification**: Reject or defer proposals without complete license documentation
8. **Flag ambiguity**: Mark dependency unapproved if licensing cannot be verified confidently

## Core

### Policy (non-negotiable)

- Strongly prefer **open-source** tooling and libraries.
- Prefer established OSS libraries over bespoke scripts/frameworks.
- OSS status is **time-sensitive** and must be revalidated.

## Load: checklists

### Mandatory: live license verification (web search)

For every dependency selection/upgrade/review, perform a **live web search** to confirm:

- the component is **still open source** today,
- the **current license** (and any dual-license terms) is acceptable,
- no recent licensing change introduces:
  - source-available restrictions,
  - field-of-use or non-commercial limitations,
  - delayed-open clauses,
  - copyleft obligations conflicting with the intended distribution model.

**Historical OSS status is insufficient.**

### Authoritative sources to check (minimum)

- Project homepage / official docs
- Source repository `LICENSE` file (and recent commits)
- Release notes / official announcements
- Issue tracker discussions relating to licensing changes

### Version-specific licensing

- Verify licensing for the **exact version** being adopted.
- If pinning to an older OSS version, document:
  - rationale,
  - maintenance plan,
  - security posture and upgrade strategy.

### Transitive dependencies

- Spot-check critical transitive dependencies for license changes (especially build-time tools and generators).

## Load: enforcement

### Hard gate (required)

A dependency proposal/PR/ADR is **incomplete** without:

- License name
- Verification source(s)
- Verification date (UTC)

Default outcome if missing: **reject or defer**.

### Agent rule: automatic revalidation trigger

When encountering a new library, an upgrade, or a dependency review, the agent must:

1. perform a live web search for current licensing,
2. flag ambiguity or recent changes,
3. mark the dependency **unapproved** if licensing cannot be verified confidently.

## Red Flags - STOP

| Thought                                | Reality                                               |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| "It was open source last time"         | Licenses change; revalidate with every upgrade        |
| "The package name sounds open source"  | Verify the LICENSE file directly; names mislead       |
| "Transitive deps don't matter"         | Critical transitives need license checks too          |
| "We'll check licensing before release" | Check at PR time; late discovery is costly            |
| "Source-available is the same"         | Source-available often has restrictions; verify terms |
| "Copyleft is fine for internal tools"  | Distribution models matter; understand obligations    |
