# Organize — Claude Code Dashboard

Launch the Cross-Code Organizer (CCO) dashboard to visually manage all your customizations.

## What to do

1. Run the organizer server:

```bash
npx @mcpware/cross-code-organizer@latest $ARGUMENTS
```

2. Tell the user the dashboard is opening in their browser at `http://localhost:3847` (or the next available port).

3. If the user provides `--port <number>`, pass it through as the argument.

## What this does

Opens a drag-and-drop web dashboard showing:
- All memories, skills, MCP servers, hooks, configs, and plugins
- Shows what loads globally vs per-project (Global and Project scopes)
- Move items between scopes via drag-and-drop
- Search, filter, and preview any item
- Delete items with undo support
