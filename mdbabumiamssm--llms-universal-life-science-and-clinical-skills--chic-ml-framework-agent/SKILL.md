# CHIC ML Framework Agent

The **CHIC (Clonal Hematopoiesis Inference from Counts) ML Framework Agent** uses machine learning to identify individuals with high-risk clonal hematopoiesis from routine complete blood count (CBC) data alone. Validated on 431,531 UK Biobank participants, CHIC reduces the "number needed to sequence" from 727 to 40 individuals per case of high-risk CH, enabling population-scale CHIP screening without universal sequencing.

## When to Use This Skill

* When screening large populations for CHIP without sequencing.
* For prioritizing individuals who should undergo genetic testing.
* To identify undiagnosed CCUS/MDS from routine blood counts.
* When sequencing resources are limited but CHIP detection is needed.
* For research studies requiring CHIP prevalence estimation.

## Core Capabilities

1. **CBC-Based CHIP Prediction**: Predict CHIP presence from blood counts.

2. **High-Risk CH Identification**: Focus on clinically relevant clones.

3. **Efficient Screening**: Dramatically reduce number needed to sequence.

4. **CCUS/MDS Detection**: Flag potential undiagnosed blood cancers.

5. **Population Stratification**: Risk-stratify for targeted sequencing.

6. **Longitudinal Monitoring**: Track CBC changes suggesting CH development.

## CHIC Model Features

| CBC Parameter | Importance | CH Association |
|---------------|------------|----------------|
| Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW) | High | ↑ with CH |
| Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV) | High | ↑ macrocytosis |
| Hemoglobin | Moderate | ↓ in CCUS |
| Platelet Count | Moderate | Variable |
| White Blood Cell Count | Moderate | Often ↑ |
| Mean Platelet Volume (MPV) | Moderate | May ↑ |
| Red Blood Cell Count | Low | ↓ with anemia |

## Performance Metrics

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| AUROC | 0.75 | Good discrimination |
| Sensitivity (high threshold) | 85% | High-risk CH capture |
| NNS (standard) | 727 | Without CHIC |
| NNS (with CHIC) | 40 | 18x improvement |
| PPV (stringent cutoff) | 12% | Enriched population |

## Workflow

1. **Input**: CBC data (complete blood count panel).

2. **Feature Engineering**: Calculate derived indices.

3. **Model Inference**: Run CHIC tree-based ensemble.

4. **Risk Scoring**: Generate CHIP probability score.

5. **Stratification**: Categorize into risk groups.

6. **Recommendations**: Prioritize for sequencing.

7. **Output**: Risk scores, sequencing prioritization list.

## Example Usage

**User**: "Screen this population cohort using CHIC to identify individuals who should undergo CHIP sequencing."

| MCV >100 fL | Increased | Macrocytosis |
| Unexplained anemia | Flagged | Potential CCUS |
| Cytopenias | Very high | Likely CCUS/MDS |
| Persistent changes | Escalated | Progressive CH |

## Limitations

| Limitation | Impact | Mitigation |

2. **Acute Illness**: Exclude acutely ill patients
3. **Recent Transfusion**: Affects CBC parameters
4. **Medications**: Consider drug effects on CBC
5. **Serial Monitoring**: Longitudinal changes informative
