# Google Gemini Operations (2026)

## Workflow

1. Confirm active models and limits from official docs in `references/sources.md`.
2. Select Gemini model by context window, modality, and latency constraints.
3. Use official SDK initialization and request patterns.
4. Add schema validation for structured outputs.
5. Run a smoke test for text and one multimodal path when applicable.

## Output Requirements

- Provide chosen Gemini model and SDK path.
- Provide one compatibility note for previous integrations.
- Provide one operational guardrail (timeouts, retries, or quotas).
