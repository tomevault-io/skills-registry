# Game Flow Navigation

End-to-end walkthrough of how a jDuel game progresses through every screen. Use this when you need to test UI changes across views, automate a Playwright game session, or reason about what the player sees at each phase.

## Phase Overview

```
HomePage → (host) → Lobby → Question → Results → … → GameOver
                  ↑                        │
                  └── (repeat Q+R) ────────┘
```

The backend drives phase transitions via `ROOM_STATE` WebSocket broadcasts. The frontend's `GameView` component routes to the correct view based on `roomState.status`.

| Phase | `roomState.status` | Component | Key UI Elements |
|-------|-------------------|-----------|-----------------|
| Pre-game | `waiting` | `Lobby` | Player list, share link, Multiple Choice toggle, Start Game button |
| Active question | `playing` | `Question` | Question text, timer, multiple choice buttons OR free-text input |
| Between rounds | `results` | `Results` | Correct answer banner, scoreboard, player answers with ✓/✗ |
| Game finished | `finished` | `GameOver` | Winner card, confetti, final standings, room-closing countdown |

## Playwright Automation Walkthrough

### 1. Homepage — Host a Game
- URL: `http://localhost:3000`
- Click the **Host a Game** card to expand the form
- The name input may be pre-filled from `localStorage` (key: `playerName`)
- Fill name → click **Create Room**
- Navigates to `/game/{ROOM_CODE}` (4-char alphanumeric, e.g. `F9O1`)

### 2. Lobby
- WebSocket connects automatically on mount
- **Multiple Choice toggle** — only visible/interactive if you are the host (first player registered). Click the label or checkbox to toggle.
- Click **Start Game** to send `START_GAME` over WebSocket
- The server transitions `status` to `playing` and broadcasts `ROOM_STATE`

### 3. Question View
- Appears when `status === "playing"`
- **Multiple choice mode:** 4 option buttons rendered in a single-column grid on mobile (2-col on desktop). Each button has a letter prefix (A/B/C/D) and option text. Click any option to submit — it sends an `ANSWER` message and immediately shows a green "Answer Submitted" confirmation. No further interaction is possible until the next phase.
- **Free-text mode:** A text input + Submit button. Type answer, press Submit or Enter.
- A **circular countdown timer** runs down from 15 seconds. If time expires without an answer, the player gets 0 points for that round.
- After all players answer (or timeout), the server transitions to `results`.

### 4. Results View
- Shows for ~10 seconds before auto-advancing
- Contains: correct answer banner (green), a scoreboard (sorted by score), and a player-answers list showing each player's submission with a ✓ or ✗ indicator and points gained
- A smaller countdown timer shows "Next question in …"
- After the timer, the server either transitions back to `playing` (next question) or to `finished` (after question 10)

### 5. GameOver View
- Appears when `status === "finished"`
- Shows the champion (winner card with trophy + name + score), confetti animation, and final standings ranked list
- A "Room closing in" countdown (60 seconds) runs. When it hits zero the room is destroyed server-side and the WebSocket emits `ROOM_CLOSED`, which redirects the client back to the homepage.

## Timing Constants (from `backend/src/app/config/game.py`)

| Constant | Value | Where it matters |
|----------|-------|-----------------|
| Question time | 15s | Timer on Question view |
| Results display | 10s | Auto-advance timer on Results view |
| Room cleanup | 60s | Countdown on GameOver view |
| Total questions | 10 (default) | Progress indicator "Question X of Y" (dynamic from `roomState.totalQuestions`) |

## Key Files

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `frontend/src/features/game/GameView/GameView.tsx` | Phase router — switches component based on `roomState.status` |
| `frontend/src/features/game/Lobby/Lobby.tsx` | Pre-game lobby UI |
| `frontend/src/features/game/Question/Question.tsx` | Active question + answer submission |
| `frontend/src/features/game/Results/Results.tsx` | Round results display |
| `frontend/src/features/game/GameOver/GameOver.tsx` | Final screen with winner + standings |
| `frontend/src/contexts/GameContext.tsx` | WebSocket connection, `startGame()`, `submitAnswer()` |
| `backend/src/app/services/orchestration/orchestrator.py` | Server-side phase transitions and state broadcasts |
| `backend/src/app/config/game.py` | Timing constants |

## Mobile Notes

- All views are designed mobile-first (390px viewport). Option buttons have 56px min-height tap targets. Inputs and submit buttons are full-width on mobile. The results grid collapses to single column below 600px.
- The nav bar logo ("jDuel") has explicit left padding so it doesn't crowd the edge on small screens.
- Toggle switches in the Lobby are oversized (56×30px) for thumb-friendliness on mobile.
