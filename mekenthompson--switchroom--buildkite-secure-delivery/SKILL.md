# Buildkite Secure Delivery

Secure delivery covers the end-to-end flow of publishing artifacts with zero static credentials and proving supply chain integrity. This skill teaches OIDC-based authentication, Package Registry publishing, SLSA provenance attestation, and pipeline signing with JWKS.

## Quick Start

Build, authenticate via OIDC, and push a Docker image — no static credentials:

```yaml
steps:
  - key: "docker-publish"
    label: ":docker: Build & Push"
    commands:
      - docker build --tag packages.buildkite.com/my-org/my-registry/my-app:latest .
      - buildkite-agent oidc request-token --audience "https://packages.buildkite.com/my-org/my-registry" --lifetime 300 | docker login packages.buildkite.com/my-org/my-registry --username buildkite --password-stdin
      - docker push packages.buildkite.com/my-org/my-registry/my-app:latest
    plugins:
      - generate-provenance-attestation#v1.1.0:
          artifacts: "my-app:latest"
          attestation_name: "docker-attestation.json"
```

This single step authenticates with a short-lived OIDC token (5 minutes), pushes the image, and generates a SLSA provenance attestation. No API keys or registry passwords stored anywhere.

> For `buildkite-agent oidc request-token` flag details, see the **buildkite-agent-runtime** skill.

## OIDC Authentication

Each job calls `buildkite-agent oidc request-token` to get a short-lived JWT (default 5 minutes) from the Buildkite backend. External services validate the JWT against Buildkite's OIDC provider (`https://agent.buildkite.com`) and grant access if claims match the trust policy.

### Token Claims

The `sub` claim encodes the full context: `organization:{org}:pipeline:{slug}:ref:{ref}:commit:{sha}:step:{key}`. Key claims for trust policies: `organization_slug`, `pipeline_slug`, `build_branch`, `step_key`, `runner_environment`.

### OIDC with Buildkite Package Registry

The `--audience` must exactly match the registry URL: `https://packages.buildkite.com/{org-slug}/{registry-slug}`. The username is always `buildkite`. The OIDC token acts as the password. See Quick Start for the full pattern.

### OIDC with Cloud Providers

OIDC tokens work with AWS (via `aws-assume-role-with-web-identity` plugin or `sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity`), GCP (via Workload Identity Federation), and Azure (via federated credentials). Each provider validates the JWT against Buildkite's OIDC issuer and grants access based on claim conditions.

> For cloud provider OIDC setup including IAM trust policies, Workload Identity Pools, and Azure app registration, see `references/oidc-cloud-providers.md`.

### Scoping OIDC Policies

Always restrict trust policies to minimum scope. Scope `sub` to pipeline and branch (`organization:acme-inc:pipeline:deploy-prod:ref:refs/heads/main:*`), never to the entire org (`organization:acme-inc:*`). Use `pipeline_slug` and `build_branch` conditions. For production deployments, require `build_branch: main`.

## Package Registry

Buildkite Package Registry hosts packages across multiple ecosystems with OIDC-native authentication. Registries are scoped to an organization and accessed at `packages.buildkite.com/{org-slug}/{registry-slug}`.

### Supported Ecosystems

| Ecosystem | Auth method |
|-----------|-------------|
| Docker / OCI | `docker login` with OIDC token |
| npm | `.npmrc` with OIDC token |
| Helm (OCI) | `helm registry login` with OIDC token |
| Python, Ruby, Terraform, Debian, Alpine, RPM, Generic | `curl` with Bearer token header |

### Docker / OCI Publishing

The most common pattern -- build, authenticate via OIDC, push. Tag images with `${BUILDKITE_BUILD_NUMBER}` or git SHA for traceability. Avoid `latest` tags in production -- they are not immutable. See Quick Start for the full pipeline step.

> For npm, Helm, Python, Ruby, Terraform, and generic publishing patterns, see `references/package-publishing.md`.

## SLSA Provenance

SLSA provenance records what was built, when, by whom, and from which source. Add `generate-provenance-attestation` to build steps to create signed attestations, then use `publish-to-packages` to upload artifacts with attestations attached.

### Generating Attestations

```yaml
plugins:
  - generate-provenance-attestation#v1.1.0:
      artifacts: "my-library-*.gem"     # Glob pattern matching artifacts to attest
      attestation_name: "build-attestation.json"  # Output attestation filename
```

The attestation captures builder identity, source (repo, branch, commit), build metadata, and material digests (SHA-256).

### Publishing with Attestations

Use `publish-to-packages` with `artifacts` (glob pattern), `registry` (`{org-slug}/{registry-slug}`), and `attestations` (list of attestation files). The `generate-provenance-attestation` plugin satisfies SLSA Build Level 1. For Level 2, combine with Hosted Agents. For Level 3, add pipeline signing.

## Pipeline Signing (JWKS)

Pipeline signing ensures the steps an agent runs are exactly the steps uploaded. Uploading agents sign pipeline definitions with a private JWKS key; executing agents verify signatures with the public key before running jobs.

### Setup

Generate keys with `buildkite-agent tool keygen --alg EdDSA --key-id my-signing-key`. This creates `EdDSA-my-signing-key-private.json` (signing) and `EdDSA-my-signing-key-public.json` (verification). Store the private key securely.

Configure `buildkite-agent.cfg`:
- **Uploading agents**: set `signing-jwks-file` (private key) + `signing-jwks-key-id`
- **Executing agents**: set `verification-jwks-file` (public key)
- **Both roles**: set all three config keys

### Rollout

1. Deploy signing on uploading agents
2. Deploy verification in warn mode (`verification-failure-behavior=warn`)
3. Monitor and fix unsigned pipeline warnings in agent logs
4. Switch to block (remove `verification-failure-behavior=warn` -- default is `block`)

Steps defined in the Buildkite UI are not agent-signed. Sign them manually with `buildkite-agent tool sign --update`. For Kubernetes, mount JWKS keys as secrets and configure `signingJWKSVolume`/`verificationJWKSVolume`.

> For `buildkite-agent.cfg` configuration details, see the **buildkite-agent-infrastructure** skill.

## End-to-End Secure Publish Flow

A complete pipeline combines: (1) **Build & Attest** -- build image, generate provenance with `generate-provenance-attestation`; (2) **Publish** -- authenticate via OIDC, push image, attach attestation via `publish-to-packages` (using `depends_on`); (3) **Deploy** -- authenticate to cloud via OIDC (e.g., `aws-assume-role-with-web-identity`). See Quick Start for the single-step pattern.

> For a non-Docker example (Ruby gem secure publish flow), see `references/package-publishing.md`.

## Security Checklist

- [ ] All authentication uses OIDC tokens -- no static API keys or passwords
- [ ] OIDC `--audience` matches exact target service URL
- [ ] `--lifetime 300` (5 minutes) or less
- [ ] Trust policies scoped to `pipeline_slug` + `build_branch` + `organization_slug`
- [ ] Published artifacts include SLSA attestation
- [ ] Pipeline signing enabled with `verification-failure-behavior=block` in production
- [ ] Dynamically-retrieved secrets added to the log redactor

> For `buildkite-agent redactor add` syntax, see the **buildkite-agent-runtime** skill.
> For `secrets:` pipeline YAML syntax, see the **buildkite-pipelines** skill.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| OIDC `--audience` doesn't match registry URL exactly | Use `https://packages.buildkite.com/{org}/{registry}` with exact slugs |
| Using static API keys instead of OIDC | Replace `docker login -p $API_KEY` with the OIDC pipe pattern |
| `--lifetime` too long (e.g., 3600) | Set `--lifetime 300` (5 minutes) |
| Skipping `warn` phase during signing rollout | Deploy with `verification-failure-behavior=warn` first, then switch to `block` |
| OIDC trust policy too broad (`sub: organization:*`) | Scope to specific `pipeline_slug` and `build_branch` |
| Forgetting to sign Pipeline Settings steps | Run `buildkite-agent tool sign --update` for pipelines with UI steps |
| Unversioned plugins | Pin to exact version (`plugin#v1.2.0`) |
