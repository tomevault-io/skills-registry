# Building Skills

Build production-ready skills through a 3-phase process: Research, Draft, Refine.

## Supported Output Formats

- **Claude Code skills** (`.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`) - current standard with invocation control, subagent execution, hooks
- **AgentSkills.io skills** - portable cross-agent format following the open standard

## Input

- `$ARGUMENTS` - skill specification: natural language description, `@filepath` to a spec file, or `name: description` format
- `--format` - output format: `claude` (default), `agentskills`, or `both`
- `--depth` - research depth: `light` (2-3 sources), `normal` (5 sources, default), `deep` (8-10 sources)
- `--dry-run` - preview the execution plan without creating files

Multiple skills can be specified separated by spaces. Use comma-separated `--depth` values for per-skill depth.

## Process Overview

1. Parse input and configure
2. Phase 1: Research
3. Phase 2: Draft
4. Phase 3: Refine and validate
5. Write files and summarize

## Step 1: Parse Input and Configure

Determine what skills to build and how.

**Parse specifications**:
- If input starts with `@`, read the referenced file as the spec
- If input contains `name: description`, split on first colon
- Otherwise, generate a kebab-case name from the description

**Parse flags**:
- Extract `--format`, `--depth`, `--dry-run` from arguments
- Default format: `claude`
- Default depth: `normal`

**Dry run**: If `--dry-run`, print the execution plan (skill names, formats, depths, output paths) and stop.

**Confirm with user**: Present the plan and ask for approval before proceeding. Show:
- Skill name(s) and description(s)
- Output format(s) and location(s)
- Research depth

**Wait for explicit user confirmation before continuing.**

## Step 2: Phase 1 - Research

Launch one Task agent per skill specification, concurrently. Each agent's prompt should include the skill's purpose, the target format(s), and the research depth setting.

The research prompt should direct the agent to investigate:
- Similar existing skills and their patterns
- Domain knowledge needed for the skill's purpose
- Appropriate invocation model (who triggers it, does it need isolation?)
- Tool permissions needed (minimal and specific)
- Whether supporting files would help (progressive disclosure)
- Error handling patterns for the domain

Include the contents of [references/format-spec.md](references/format-spec.md) in each research prompt so agents understand both output formats.

Launch all research agents in a single response for concurrent execution.

Collect results before proceeding to Phase 2.

## Step 3: Phase 2 - Draft

Launch one Task agent per skill and format combination, concurrently. Each agent's prompt should include the research report from Phase 1 and the complete format specification from [references/format-spec.md](references/format-spec.md). The agent must produce all files for the skill directory.

**Critical drafting rules**:
- SKILL.md must be under 500 lines
- Description must state WHAT the skill does AND WHEN to use it
- Description must include trigger keywords for auto-discovery
- Tool permissions must be specific (`Bash(git:*)` not `Bash`)
- Supporting files referenced from SKILL.md with relative paths
- No secrets, credentials, or time-sensitive information
- Professional language (no slang in generated content)

**Invocation control decision**:
- Side-effect skills (deploy, commit, send): `disable-model-invocation: true`
- Background knowledge (conventions, patterns): `user-invocable: false`
- Isolated/heavy tasks: `context: fork` with appropriate `agent`
- Most skills: default (both user and Claude can invoke)

Launch all Task agents in a single response for concurrent execution.

Collect results before proceeding to Phase 3.

## Step 4: Phase 3 - Refine and Validate

Review each drafted skill against the quality checklist. Reference [quality-checklist.md](references/quality-checklist.md) for the complete validation criteria.

**Core validation**:
- [ ] SKILL.md under 500 lines
- [ ] Frontmatter is correct for target format
- [ ] Description covers what AND when, with trigger keywords
- [ ] Tool permissions are minimal and specific
- [ ] Invocation control matches the skill's behavior
- [ ] Supporting files are referenced from SKILL.md
- [ ] No security issues (secrets, injection, etc.)

**Format-specific validation**:

For Claude Code skills:
- [ ] `$ARGUMENTS` / `$N` used correctly if accepting input
- [ ] `!`command\` used for preprocessing only (not Claude-executed)
- [ ] `context: fork` only used with actionable task instructions
- [ ] All frontmatter fields are valid per the spec

For AgentSkills.io skills:
- [ ] `name` is present, lowercase, kebab-case, max 64 chars, no `--`, no leading/trailing `-`
- [ ] `description` is present, max 1024 chars
- [ ] `allowed-tools` is space-delimited (not comma-separated)
- [ ] Body under 5000 tokens recommended

Fix any issues found during validation.

## Step 5: Write Files and Summarize

**Create the skill directory**:

```
apps/dot-claude/skills/<skill-name>/
├── SKILL.md
├── [supporting files as needed]
```

**Write all files** using the Write tool.

**Validate the written files**:
- Read back SKILL.md and verify frontmatter parses correctly
- Confirm line count is under 500
- Verify all referenced supporting files exist

**Present summary to user**:

```
## Skill Build Summary

| Skill | Format | Location | Invocation |
|-------|--------|----------|------------|
| name  | format | path     | mode       |

### Files Created
- [list all files with paths]

### Next Steps
- Review generated skill(s)
- Test with representative inputs
- Deploy to ~/.claude/skills/ (personal) or .claude/skills/ (project)
```

## Error Handling

- **Research fails**: Continue with general best practices, note limited context
- **Draft fails**: Retry once with simplified prompt; if still fails, report and skip
- **Validation fails**: Fix issues in-place; if unfixable, report to user
- **Partial success**: Report which skills succeeded and which failed
