# Continuous Discovery Habits

## When This Skill Activates

Claude uses this skill when:
- Setting up discovery processes
- Planning weekly user research
- Creating opportunity solution trees
- Testing assumptions
- Building product trio workflows
- Prioritizing discovery activities

## Core Frameworks

### 1. Continuous Discovery Habits (Source: Teresa Torres)

**The Core Principle:**
> "At a minimum, weekly touchpoints with customers by the team building the product, where they conduct small research activities in pursuit of a desired outcome."

**The Three Pillars:**
1. **Weekly customer contact** by the product trio (PM, designer, engineer)
2. **Opportunity solution trees** to visualize discovery
3. **Assumption testing** before building

**Use when:** Establishing discovery processes or improving product decisions

---

### 2. The Product Trio

**The Team:**
- **Product Manager:** Ensures business viability
- **Designer:** Ensures usability and desirability
- **Engineer:** Ensures feasibility

**Why Together:**
> "When a designer, engineer, and PM collaborate on discovery, you get better decisions faster. Each brings a unique lens."

**How:**
- All three participate in customer interviews
- All three analyze research together
- All three generate solutions together
- All three test assumptions together

---

### 3. Opportunity Solution Trees

**The Structure:**
```
Outcome (top)
    ↓
Opportunities (customer needs/pain points)
    ↓
Solutions (possible ways to address)
    ↓
Assumptions (what needs to be true)
    ↓
Experiments (how to test)
```

**Use when:** Need to visualize the path from outcome to solution

**Example:**
```
Outcome: Increase retention to 80%
    ↓
Opportunity: Users forget to use the product
    ↓
Solution: Daily email reminder
    ↓
Assumption: Users check email daily
    ↓
Experiment: Survey 20 users about email habits
```

---

### 4. Interview Snapshot

**The One-Pager:**
After each interview, create a snapshot capturing:
- **Date & Participant:** Who and when
- **Key Insights:** 3-5 main takeaways
- **Opportunities:** Customer needs/pain points discovered
- **Quotes:** Verbatim customer language
- **Next Steps:** What to test or explore next

**Why:** Keeps learning accessible to the whole team

---

### 5. Assumption Testing

**The Progression:**
```
Story → Assumptions → Tests → Evidence
```

**Question to Ask:**
> "What needs to be true for this solution to work?"

**Test Types (by risk/cost):**
1. **One-question surveys** (lowest risk)
2. **Customer interviews** 
3. **Prototypes/mockups**
4. **Concierge tests** (manual behind-the-scenes)
5. **Wizard of Oz** (fake the feature)
6. **Live data tests** (build and measure)

**Rule:** Test highest-risk assumptions first with lowest-cost method

---

## Decision Trees

### Should I Build This Feature?

```
Do we have a clear outcome?
├─ No → Define outcome first
└─ Yes → Have we interviewed 6+ customers?
    ├─ No → Do discovery first
    └─ Yes → Have we identified opportunities?
        ├─ No → Map opportunities
        └─ Yes → Have we tested key assumptions?
            ├─ No → Test assumptions first
            └─ Yes → Build it!
```

### How Should I Test This Assumption?

```
What's the risk if we're wrong?
├─ Low risk → Build and ship (reversible)
└─ High risk → How much does testing cost?
    ├─ Low cost → Interview 5 users
    ├─ Medium cost → Prototype test
    └─ High cost → Still cheaper than building wrong thing
```

## Quick Reference

### 📅 Weekly Discovery Cadence

**Every Week Minimum:**
- [ ] 3-5 customer touchpoints (interviews, observation, etc.)
- [ ] Product trio participates together
- [ ] Create interview snapshots
- [ ] Update opportunity solution tree
- [ ] Test at least 1 assumption

**Every Month:**
- [ ] Review all evidence collected
- [ ] Update outcomes if needed
- [ ] Celebrate learning (not just building)

---

### 🎯 Discovery vs Delivery Balance

**Good Discovery Practice:**
- ✅ Discovery happens weekly (not just quarterly)
- ✅ Product trio does discovery together
- ✅ Small tests before big builds
- ✅ Evidence-based decisions
- ✅ Comfortable saying "we learned that won't work"

**Signs of Insufficient Discovery:**
- ❌ Only talking to customers after shipping
- ❌ PM does all research alone
- ❌ Building first, validating later
- ❌ Opinion-based decisions
- ❌ Fear of "wasting time" on research

---

### 🌳 Opportunity Solution Tree Checklist

**Before Creating:**
- [ ] Clear outcome defined
- [ ] Conducted 6+ customer interviews
- [ ] Identified multiple opportunities

**When Building Tree:**
- [ ] Start with ONE outcome (top)
- [ ] Map opportunities (not solutions)
- [ ] Generate multiple solutions per opportunity
- [ ] List assumptions for each solution
- [ ] Plan tests for assumptions

**Using the Tree:**
- [ ] Update weekly with new learning
- [ ] Share with stakeholders
- [ ] Use to explain why you're building what
- [ ] Reference when prioritizing work

---

### 🧪 Assumption Testing Hierarchy

**Test in This Order:**
1. **Desirability** - Do customers want this?
2. **Usability** - Can they use it?
3. **Feasibility** - Can we build it?
4. **Viability** - Should we build it?

**Use Cheapest Test First:**
```
Interview < Survey < Prototype < Concierge < Build
```

---

## Real-World Examples

### Example: Spotify's Discovery Process

**Outcome:** Increase music discovery engagement

**Opportunity:** Users don't know what to listen to
- Evidence: Interviews showed decision fatigue
- Solution considered: Algorithmic playlists
- Assumption: Users trust algorithmic recommendations
- Test: Created Discover Weekly, measured engagement
- Result: Massive success, became core feature

**Key Learning:** They tested the algorithm assumption before building fancy UX

---

### Example: Netflix's Continue Watching

**Outcome:** Reduce time to content consumption

**Opportunity:** Users forget what they were watching
- Evidence: Drop-off analysis + customer interviews
- Solution: "Continue Watching" row
- Assumption: Users want to resume (not restart)
- Test: A/B test with 5% of users
- Result: Validated, rolled to 100%

**Key Learning:** Small test before full build saved months of work

---

## Common Pitfalls

### ❌ Discovery Theater
**Problem:** Doing research but not changing decisions
**Solution:** Explicitly decide what you'll do if assumptions are wrong

### ❌ Outsourcing Discovery
**Problem:** PM does research, then "throws it over the wall"
**Solution:** Product trio interviews together

### ❌ Building Multiple Solutions at Once
**Problem:** Spreading resources too thin
**Solution:** Test assumptions first, build one at a time

### ❌ Skipping Discovery "To Move Fast"
**Problem:** Building wrong thing is slowest path
**Solution:** Small tests are faster than big rebuilds

### ❌ Only Talking to Happy Customers
**Problem:** Missing problems and churn reasons
**Solution:** Interview across the spectrum (new, power, churned users)

## Key Quotes

**Teresa Torres on Weekly Contact:**
> "If you're not talking to customers every week, you're not doing continuous discovery."

**On Product Trios:**
> "The best product decisions come from diverse perspectives. A PM, designer, and engineer will see different things in the same customer interview."

**On Opportunity Solution Trees:**
> "The tree makes your thinking visible. It shows how you got from an outcome to a solution, which builds stakeholder trust."

**On Assumption Testing:**
> "Don't ask customers what to build. Test assumptions about what will work."

**On Discovery vs Delivery:**
> "Discovery and delivery should happen continuously. Discovery doesn't end when you start building."
