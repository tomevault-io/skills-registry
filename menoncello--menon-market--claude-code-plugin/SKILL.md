## Installation Methods

### 1. Interactive Marketplace Installation

```bash
claude
/plugin
```

### 2. Direct Command Installation

```bash
# Install from marketplace
claude marketplace install plugin-name@marketplace-name

# Install from local directory
claude marketplace install ./my-plugin

# Install from Git repository
claude marketplace install https://github.com/user/plugin-repo.git

# Install specific version
claude marketplace install plugin-name@1.2.3
```

### 3. Configuration File Installation

```json
{
  "plugins": ["my-awesome-plugin@latest", "code-formatter@2.1.0", "database-tools@github:user/repo"]
}
```

## Configuration Management

### Settings File Structure

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "plugins": {
    "sources": [
      {
        "type": "marketplace",
        "name": "official",
        "url": "https://github.com/claude-official/marketplace",
        "enabled": true
      }
    ],
    "installed": [
      {
        "name": "code-formatter",
        "version": "2.1.0",
        "source": "official",
        "installedAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
        "enabled": true,
        "autoUpdate": true
      }
