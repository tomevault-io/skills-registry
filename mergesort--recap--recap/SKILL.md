# Recap Integration

Use this skill when integrating, configuring, or using the Recap library.

## What to read first

Start with these files:

- `README.md`
- `Sources/Recap/Public/RecapScreen.swift`
- `Sources/Recap/Public/View+Recap.swift`
- `Sources/Recap/Public/RecapDisplayPolicy.swift`
- `Sources/Recap/Public/RecapDisplayPolicy.Trigger.swift`
- `Demo/Demo/Assets/Releases.md`
- `Demo/Demo/DemoRecapScreen.swift`

Read additional public API files in `Sources/Recap/Public/` only if the task touches a specific type.

## Core workflow

1. Identify whether the task is about integration, release authoring, display policy, or screen customization.
2. Prefer Recap's public APIs over custom implementations.
3. Match existing Recap naming and examples from the README and demo app.
4. Keep examples and release content user-facing and concise.

## Integration rules

- Prefer `ReleasesParser(fileName:)` for bundled release markdown.
- Prefer `RecapScreen(releases:)` as the entry point for presentation.
- Prefer `RecapDisplayPolicy` and `RecapDisplayPolicy.Trigger` over hand-rolled version gating.
- Prefer `.recapScreenPaginationStyle(.automatic)` unless the user explicitly wants forced `.labeled` or `.compact`.
- When customizing behavior, use `View+Recap` modifiers instead of editing internal implementation unless the task is explicitly a library change.

## Release markdown rules

When creating or editing a Recap releases markdown file:

- Keep the newest release first.
- Follow the schema documented in `README.md`.
- Use one release section per app version.
- Use user-facing feature titles and descriptions, not commit-style summaries.
- Choose the semantic change type (`Major`, `Minor`, `Patch`) based on product impact, not commit count.
- Reuse the style and structure of `Demo/Demo/Assets/Releases.md`.

## Mac Catalyst guidance

If the task touches Mac Catalyst:

- Preserve the distinction between automatic pagination, labeled buttons, and compact buttons.
- Be careful not to regress iPhone or iPad behavior while changing Catalyst presentation.

## Avoid

- Do not invent a different release markdown format.
- Do not parse releases manually if `ReleasesParser` is sufficient.
- Do not replace `RecapDisplayPolicy` with custom version-comparison logic unless the user explicitly needs behavior outside the public API.
