# Manage Branch Skill

## Purpose

Enforce branch naming conventions and provide safe branch creation/switching operations with proper validation.

## CRITICAL POLICY

### Branch Naming Convention

**ALL branches MUST be prefixed with `mriley/`**

**Valid branch name patterns:**

- `mriley/feat/<descriptive-name>`
- `mriley/fix/<issue-description>`
- `mriley/refactor/<component-name>`
- `mriley/perf/<optimization-description>`
- `mriley/chore/<task-description>`
- `mriley/docs/<documentation-update>`
- `mriley/test/<testing-addition>`

**Examples of CORRECT names:**

- ✅ `mriley/feat/user-authentication`
- ✅ `mriley/fix/parser-null-handling`
- ✅ `mriley/refactor/api-validation`
- ✅ `mriley/perf/optimize-query-performance`

**Examples of INCORRECT names:**

- ❌ `feat/user-authentication` (missing mriley/ prefix)
- ❌ `user-authentication` (missing prefix and type)
- ❌ `fix-bug` (missing mriley/ prefix)
- ❌ `pedro/feat/something` (wrong user prefix)

## Workflow

### Operation 1: Create New Branch

#### Step 1.1: Determine Branch Type

Ask user or infer from context:

- **feat**: New feature
- **fix**: Bug fix
- **refactor**: Code restructuring
- **perf**: Performance improvement
- **chore**: Maintenance task
- **docs**: Documentation
- **test**: Test additions

#### Step 1.2: Generate Branch Name

Based on work description, generate name:

**Format:**

```
mriley/<type>/<short-descriptive-name>
```

**Naming guidelines:**

- Use kebab-case (lowercase with hyphens)
- Be descriptive but concise (2-4 words)
- Focus on WHAT, not HOW
- Avoid ticket numbers (unless no description)
- Max 50 characters total

**Examples:**

```
mriley/feat/jwt-authentication
mriley/fix/memory-leak-parser
mriley/refactor/split-monolithic-handler
mriley/perf/cache-database-queries
```

#### Step 1.3: Validate Branch Name

Check against requirements:

- ✅ Starts with `mriley/`
- ✅ Has type (feat/fix/refactor/etc)
- ✅ Has descriptive name
- ✅ Uses kebab-case
- ✅ Length ≤ 50 characters

#### Step 1.4: Check Current Git Status

```bash
git status
```

**If uncommitted changes exist:**

```
⚠️ Uncommitted changes detected

You have uncommitted changes in your working directory:
- src/api/handlers.go (modified)
- pkg/auth/validator.go (new file)

Options:
1. Commit changes first (recommended)
2. Stash changes: git stash
3. Discard changes: git restore . (DANGEROUS)

What would you like to do?
```

**STOP and wait for user decision.**

#### Step 1.5: Determine Base Branch

Check which branch to create from:

```bash
git branch --show-current
```

**Common scenarios:**

- On `main`/`master` → Create from current (typical)
- On feature branch → Ask if creating from current or from main
- On `develop` → Create from current (if using gitflow)

**If uncertain, ask user:**

```
Create branch from:
1. Current branch (main)
2. Different branch (specify)
```

#### Step 1.6: Create Branch

```bash
git checkout -b mriley/<type>/<name>
```

**Or if creating from specific base:**

```bash
git checkout -b mriley/<type>/<name> origin/main
```

#### Step 1.7: Verify Creation

```bash
git branch --show-current
```

**Report success:**

```
✅ Branch created successfully

Branch: mriley/feat/jwt-authentication
Base: main
Status: Clean working directory

You can now start working on this branch.
```

---

### Operation 2: Switch Branch

#### Step 2.1: Check Current Status

```bash
git status
```

**If uncommitted changes:**

```
⚠️ Uncommitted changes detected

Cannot switch branches with uncommitted changes.

Options:
1. Commit changes first (recommended)
2. Stash changes: git stash
3. Discard changes: git restore . (DANGEROUS)

What would you like to do?
```

**STOP and wait for user decision.**

#### Step 2.2: List Available Branches (Optional)

If user unsure which branch to switch to:

```bash
git branch -v
```

Show branches with descriptions:

```
Available branches:
* main                    a1b2c3d Last commit message
  mriley/feat/auth        d4e5f6g Add JWT validation
  mriley/fix/parser-bug   g7h8i9j Fix null pointer
```

#### Step 2.3: Switch Branch

```bash
git checkout <branch-name>
```

**Or fetch and checkout remote branch:**

```bash
git fetch origin
git checkout -b <branch-name> origin/<branch-name>
```

#### Step 2.4: Verify Switch

```bash
git branch --show-current
```

**Report success:**

```
✅ Switched to branch: mriley/feat/auth

Branch: mriley/feat/auth
Latest commit: d4e5f6g Add JWT validation
Status: Up to date with origin/mriley/feat/auth
```

---

### Operation 3: Validate Existing Branch Name

If checking/fixing existing branch that doesn't follow convention:

#### Step 3.1: Get Current Branch

```bash
git branch --show-current
```

#### Step 3.2: Validate Name

Check if matches `mriley/<type>/<name>` pattern.

**If invalid:**

```
⚠️ Branch name doesn't follow convention

Current: feat/user-authentication
Required: mriley/feat/user-authentication

This branch should be renamed to follow convention.

Options:
1. Rename current branch: git branch -m mriley/feat/user-authentication
2. Create new branch with correct name
3. Continue with current name (NOT recommended)

What would you like to do?
```

#### Step 3.3: Rename Branch (If Requested)

```bash
# Rename local branch
git branch -m mriley/<type>/<name>

# If already pushed, delete old remote and push new
git push origin --delete <old-name>
git push -u origin mriley/<type>/<name>
```

## Integration with Other Skills

This skill is invoked by:

- **`create-pr`** - When creating pull request

This skill may invoke:

- **`safe-commit`** - If user wants to commit before switching

---

## Error Handling

### Error: Branch already exists

```
❌ Branch already exists: mriley/feat/auth

Options:
1. Switch to existing branch: git checkout mriley/feat/auth
2. Use different name: mriley/feat/auth-v2
3. Delete existing branch (DANGEROUS - requires confirmation)

What would you like to do?
```

### Error: Invalid branch name

```
❌ Invalid branch name

Provided: pedro/feat/something
Issue: Must use 'mriley/' prefix, not 'pedro/'

Corrected: mriley/feat/something

Shall I use the corrected name?
```

### Error: Cannot switch (uncommitted changes)

```
❌ Cannot switch branches

Uncommitted changes in:
- src/api/handlers.go
- pkg/auth/validator.go

Please commit or stash changes first.
```

### Error: Branch doesn't exist

```
❌ Branch doesn't exist: mriley/feat/nonexistent

Available branches matching 'feat':
- mriley/feat/auth
- mriley/feat/parser

Did you mean one of these?
```

---

## Best Practices

1. **Always validate** - Check branch name follows convention
2. **Check git status** - Ensure clean state before operations
3. **Descriptive names** - Help future you understand the work
4. **Confirm with user** - When renaming or making destructive changes
5. **Report clearly** - Show before/after state
6. **Handle errors gracefully** - Provide options, not just errors

---

- `mriley/perf/add-response-caching`
- `mriley/perf/reduce-memory-allocation`

### Bad Examples (and corrections)

❌ `new-feature` → ✅ `mriley/feat/new-feature`
❌ `fix-bug-123` → ✅ `mriley/fix/authentication-timeout`
❌ `feat/auth` → ✅ `mriley/feat/auth`
❌ `mriley/UpdateCode` → ✅ `mriley/refactor/update-validation-code`
❌ `mriley/WIP` → ✅ `mriley/feat/descriptive-name-here`
