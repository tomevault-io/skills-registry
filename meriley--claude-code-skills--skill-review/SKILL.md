# Skill Review

## Purpose

Systematically audit Claude Code skills against official best practices to ensure quality, discoverability, and maintainability before release or merge.

## Review Workflow

### Step 1: Structure Validation

Check the basic structural requirements:

```bash
# Navigate to skill directory
cd ~/.claude/skills/skill-name

# Verify file structure
ls -la
# Expected:
# - Skill.md (capital S)
# - REFERENCE.md (optional, all caps)
# - TEMPLATE.md (optional, all caps)
# - scripts/ (optional, lowercase)
```

**Validation checklist:**

- [ ] Directory name matches skill name
- [ ] Directory name uses gerund form (verb + -ing)
- [ ] Directory name lowercase-with-hyphens
- [ ] Skill.md exists (capital S, not skill.md)
- [ ] Supporting files use ALL CAPS (REFERENCE.md, not reference.md)
- [ ] No deeply nested directories
- [ ] No files with underscores or wrong extensions

### Step 2: Frontmatter Audit

Validate YAML frontmatter quality:

```bash
# Extract frontmatter
head -n 10 Skill.md
```

**Validation checklist:**

- [ ] Has valid YAML frontmatter (between --- markers)
- [ ] `name` field present and matches directory name
- [ ] `name` uses gerund form (verb + -ing)
- [ ] `name` max 64 characters
- [ ] `name` lowercase-with-hyphens only
- [ ] `description` field present
- [ ] `description` in third person (not first/second)
- [ ] `description` includes specific capabilities
- [ ] `description` includes WHEN to use triggers
- [ ] `description` includes key terms for discovery
- [ ] `description` max 1024 characters
- [ ] `description` avoids vague language
- [ ] `version` field present in SemVer format (X.Y.Z)
- [ ] `dependencies` field if external packages needed

**Common frontmatter issues:**

```yaml
# ❌ BLOCKER: First person
description: I can help you process PDFs...

# ❌ BLOCKER: Second person
description: You can use this to extract text...

# ❌ CRITICAL: Too vague
description: Helps with documents.

# ❌ CRITICAL: No triggers
description: Processes PDF files efficiently.

# ✅ GOOD: Third person, specific, with triggers
description: Extract text, tables, and forms from PDF files including scanned documents. Use when working with PDFs or document extraction tasks.
```

### Step 3: Content Quality Check

Review the main skill content:

```bash
# Check file length
wc -l Skill.md
# Should be under 500 lines for optimal performance
```

**Core content validation:**

- [ ] Main file under 500 lines
- [ ] Has clear "Purpose" section
- [ ] Has "When to Use" section with specific scenarios
- [ ] Has structured workflow or quick start
- [ ] Provides 2-3 concrete examples minimum
- [ ] Uses consistent terminology throughout
- [ ] Avoids general knowledge Claude already has
- [ ] Provides ONE default approach (not too many options)
- [ ] Includes validation/verification steps
- [ ] Has troubleshooting section for common issues
- [ ] Uses progressive disclosure (details in reference files)
- [ ] Reference files are one level deep only
- [ ] No time-sensitive information
- [ ] No marketing language or vague confidence claims

**Progressive disclosure validation:**

- [ ] SKILL.md under 500 lines (target: under 300 for complex skills)
- [ ] Uses references/ directory for detailed content
- [ ] Detailed workflows extracted to references/WORKFLOW-STEPS.md
- [ ] Troubleshooting content in references/TROUBLESHOOTING.md
- [ ] Templates/examples in references/TEMPLATE-EXAMPLES.md
- [ ] Domain-specific checks in references/[DOMAIN]-CHECKS.md
- [ ] No nested references (SKILL.md → references/A.md only)
- [ ] Clear loading guidance format:
  ```markdown
  **For detailed [topic]:**
  \`\`\`
  Read `~/.claude/skills/[skill]/references/FILE.md`
  \`\`\`
  Use when: [specific scenario]
  ```
- [ ] Each reference has "Use when:" context
- [ ] Reference files are standalone (no cross-references)

**Example quality validation:**

- [ ] At least 2-3 concrete examples provided
- [ ] Examples show input AND expected output
- [ ] Code examples are complete (not pseudocode)
- [ ] Examples cover common use cases
- [ ] Examples include validation steps

### Step 4: Instruction Clarity Audit

Verify instructions are clear and actionable:

**Sequential workflows:**

- [ ] Steps numbered clearly (Step 1, Step 2, etc.)
- [ ] Each step has concrete action
- [ ] Code blocks show exact commands
- [ ] Expected outputs documented
- [ ] Validation checkpoints provided

**Example pattern:**

```markdown
### Step 1: Validate Input

\`\`\`bash

# Check file exists

test -f document.pdf || echo "File not found"
\`\`\`

### Step 2: Extract Text

\`\`\`python
import pdfplumber
with pdfplumber.open('document.pdf') as pdf:
text = pdf.pages[0].extract_text()
\`\`\`

### Step 3: Verify Output

Expected format:
\`\`\`json
{
"pages": 5,
"text": "extracted content..."
}
\`\`\`
```

**Terminology consistency:**

- [ ] Same concept uses same term throughout
- [ ] No switching between synonyms
- [ ] Terms defined before use
- [ ] Technical terms used correctly

### Step 5: Testing Verification

Validate testing and evaluation quality:

**Testing checklist:**

- [ ] Has evaluations or test cases
- [ ] At least 3 test scenarios created
- [ ] Tests cover common use cases
- [ ] Tests cover edge cases
- [ ] Tested with fresh Claude instances
- [ ] Tested across multiple models (Haiku, Sonnet, Opus)
- [ ] Real-world validation completed
- [ ] Team feedback incorporated

**Code quality (if applicable):**

- [ ] Scripts have explicit error handling
- [ ] Configuration values commented (WHY, not WHAT)
- [ ] Required packages available and version-specified
- [ ] Forward slashes in all paths (not backslashes)
- [ ] Validation for critical operations
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials or secrets

## Severity Levels

Use these severity levels to prioritize issues:

### BLOCKER (Must fix before release)

- First/second person in description
- Skill.md over 750 lines
- No description or completely vague
- No examples provided
- Missing critical frontmatter fields
- Broken/invalid YAML
- Skill name doesn't match directory
- Major structural issues

### CRITICAL (Should fix before release)

- Description missing key triggers
- Skill.md 500-750 lines (over recommended)
- Fewer than 2 examples
- Deeply nested references (>1 level)
- Inconsistent terminology
- Too many options without default
- Missing validation steps
- No testing performed

### MAJOR (Should fix soon)

- Description could be more specific
- Missing troubleshooting section
- Examples lack expected outputs
- No progressive disclosure
- Includes general knowledge Claude has
- Missing error handling in scripts
- No version number in dependencies
- Inconsistent file naming

### MINOR (Nice to have)

- Could add more examples
- Could improve comments
- Could add table of contents
- Could extract more to reference files
- Could add more test scenarios

## Anti-Pattern Detection

Watch for these common anti-patterns:

### Anti-Pattern: Too Many Options

**Problem:**

```markdown
You can use pypdf, pdfplumber, PyMuPDF, pdf2image, camelot, tabula,
or pytesseract depending on your needs. Each has pros and cons...
[200 lines comparing libraries]
```

**Solution:**

```markdown
Use pdfplumber for text and tables. For scanned PDFs, use pytesseract with pdf2image.
See REFERENCE.md for alternative libraries.
```

### Anti-Pattern: General Knowledge

**Problem:**

```markdown
## Python Basics

Python is a programming language. To install Python, visit python.org...
[100 lines of Python installation]
```

**Solution:**

```markdown
# Remove entirely - Claude already knows this
```

### Anti-Pattern: Vague Instructions

**Problem:**

```markdown
1. Do the thing
2. Check if it worked
3. Fix any issues
```

**Solution:**

```markdown
### Step 1: Extract Text

\`\`\`python
import pdfplumber
with pdfplumber.open('document.pdf') as pdf:
text = pdf.pages[0].extract_text()
\`\`\`

### Step 2: Validate Extraction

\`\`\`python
assert text is not None, "Extraction failed"
assert len(text) > 0, "Empty result"
\`\`\`
```

### Anti-Pattern: Nested References

**Problem:**

```
Skill.md → REFERENCE.md → ADVANCED.md → EXPERT.md
```

**Solution:**

```
Skill.md → REFERENCE.md
Skill.md → ADVANCED.md
Skill.md → EXPERT.md
```

### Anti-Pattern: Bloated Main File

**Problem:**

```
Skill.md: 1,247 lines
```

**Solution:**

```
Skill.md: 342 lines
REFERENCE.md: 400 lines (detailed API)
EXAMPLES.md: 300 lines (additional examples)
TEMPLATE.md: 205 lines (output templates)
```
