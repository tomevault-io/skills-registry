# People & Property Search with Whitepages

> **STOP — Read before making any API call.** enrichx402.com endpoints are **not** the same as each provider's native API. All paths use the format `https://enrichx402.com/api/{provider}/{action}`. You MUST either:
> 1. Copy exact URLs from the Quick Reference table below, OR
> 2. Run `x402.discover_api_endpoints(url="https://enrichx402.com")` to get the correct paths
>
> **Guessing paths will fail** with 405 errors (wrong path) or 404 errors (missing `/api/` prefix).

Access people and property search through x402-protected endpoints.

## Cost Considerations

At $0.44 per call, Whitepages is the most expensive endpoint in the x402 suite.

| Scenario | Cost |
|----------|------|
| Single lookup | $0.44 |
| Verify address + person | $0.88 |
| Multiple candidates | $1.32+ |

**Tips to reduce costs:**
- Provide as much info as possible for accurate first-try results
- Use free sources first (LinkedIn, company websites)
- Use apollo, clado, firecrawl, WebSearch, WebFetch, to get data that will make the queries more accurate
- Only use for essential lookups

## Limitations

- US-focused data
- Results depend on public records availability
- Some individuals may have limited information
- Recently moved individuals may show old addresses
- Unlisted/private numbers not included
