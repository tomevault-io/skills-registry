# Autonomous UI Inspection

## Scope

Use this Skill when you need a **reliable, agent-friendly view of what the UI renders**:

- **Visual**: screenshots + accessibility snapshots (Playwright via MCP)
- **Numeric**: bounding boxes, computed styles, text overflow, and connection geometry (Puppeteer)

This Skill is about **inspection and evidence collection**. It intentionally avoids styling tweaks unless the inspection workflow itself is broken.

## Inputs

- Which UI surface (server path + URL route)
- Whether the UI is SSR-only or needs client activation
- A stable selector that indicates “ready” (e.g. `.dt-node`, `[data-role="diagram-shell"]`)
- Desired viewport and whether you need a clipped screenshot

## Procedure

### A) Standardize server start/stop (mandatory)

1. Prefer server `--check` for quick validation:

- `node src/ui/server/<feature>/server.js --check`

2. If `--check` is missing or hangs, implement it using:

- `src/ui/server/utils/serverStartupCheck.js`

Canonical workflow + implementation guidance lives in:

- `docs/COMMAND_EXECUTION_GUIDE.md` → "🚨 Server Verification - CRITICAL FOR AGENTS 🚨"

Why: agents must be able to validate startup **without** long-lived processes blocking.

### B) Visual inspection (Playwright MCP)

Goal: get screenshots that an agent can “see”, plus a structural snapshot.

1. Start the UI server (one of):

- Preferred: run the feature server in a dedicated terminal (or background task)
- For Decision Tree Viewer: `node scripts/ui/start-decision-tree-for-mcp.js`

2. Navigate via MCP browser tool to the URL.

3. Capture:

- Full-page screenshot (baseline)
- Optional clipped screenshot (if a stable container selector exists)
- Accessibility snapshot for structure + quick DOM sanity

Notes:
- Use consistent viewport dimensions (example: 1600x1200) to reduce diff noise.
- If the UI is interactive, capture “before” and “after” screenshots for a single canonical interaction.

### C) Numeric inspection (Puppeteer)

Goal: compute layout facts agents can diff and enforce.

Run a dedicated Puppeteer script that:

- Starts the server on a random or fixed dev port
- Waits for a deterministic “ready” selector
- Extracts metrics:
  - `getBoundingClientRect()` for key elements
  - `scrollWidth/Height` vs `clientWidth/Height` for overflow
  - computed styles for typography + spacing

For Decision Tree Viewer:

- `node scripts/ui/inspect-decision-tree-layout.js`

Typical invariants to enforce:
- Node label text is not overflowing (`isOverflowing === false`)
- Bounding boxes are within expected ranges
- Connection endpoints exist for all connectors

### D) Escalation: single-browser scenario suites

If you need multiple interactions but want fast runs:

- Use a scenario suite runner (single browser, many scenarios) rather than N× Jest/Puppeteer startups.

### E) WebSocket / live-update verification

When a dashboard uses WebSocket for real-time updates (see `websocket-upgrade` Skill), inspection must cover more than the initial page load.

#### E.1) Verify the WebSocket connection

In browser DevTools or via Puppeteer, confirm the WS handshake succeeds:

```javascript
// Puppeteer: check WebSocket is established
const wsMessages = [];
page.on('websocket', ws => {
  ws.on('framereceived', frame => wsMessages.push(JSON.parse(frame.payload)));
});
await page.goto(url);
await page.waitForTimeout(2000);
console.log('WS messages received:', wsMessages.length);
console.log('First message type:', wsMessages[0]?.type);
// Expect: type === 'full_state'
```

#### E.2) Verify DOM updates happen without reload

After the initial page load, wait for a subsequent WebSocket message and verify the DOM changed:

```javascript
const before = await page.$eval('[data-metric="visited"]', el => el.textContent);
await page.waitForTimeout(2000);  // wait for next server tick
const after = await page.$eval('[data-metric="visited"]', el => el.textContent);
console.log('Metric changed:', before !== after);
```

#### E.3) Verify the connection status indicator

```javascript
const dotColor = await page.$eval('#ws-dot', el => getComputedStyle(el).backgroundColor);
console.log('Status dot color:', dotColor);
// Green (rgb(76, 175, 80)) = connected
// Red (rgb(244, 67, 54)) = disconnected
```

#### E.4) Test reconnect behavior

Kill the server and restart — the client should auto-reconnect:
1. Note the status dot turns red/yellow
2. Restart the server
3. Wait up to 30 seconds (exponential backoff cap)
4. Verify the dot turns green and data resumes updating

## Validation / Evidence Checklist

- Server `--check` exits with 0
- At least one screenshot captured and stored under `screenshots/` or `.playwright-mcp/`
- Numeric JSON output captured (stdout or written artifact)
- A "ready selector" exists and is documented for the UI
- *(WebSocket UIs only)* WS handshake completes and `full_state` message received
- *(WebSocket UIs only)* DOM elements update without page reload
