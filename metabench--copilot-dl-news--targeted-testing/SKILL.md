# Targeted Testing

## Scope

- Select the smallest test/check that proves the change
- Prevent slow, flaky, or irrelevant test runs
- Capture evidence in session notes

## Inputs

- Files changed
- Whether the change is UI server / CLI / DB adapter / crawler
- Existing check scripts near the code

## Procedure

0. **Require smoke test** — the cheapest possible validation. Before running any test suite, verify the module loads without errors:
   ```bash
   node -e "require('./path/to/module'); console.log('OK')"
   ```
   This catches missing imports, syntax errors, and circular dependencies in <1 second. Especially valuable after decomposing a monolith into smaller modules — smoke-test each extracted module individually.

1. Prefer a local check script first (fast, deterministic, exits cleanly).
2. Then run the smallest Jest suite by path.
3. Only then widen to broader suites if needed.
4. Record the exact commands and outcomes in `WORKING_NOTES.md`.

If you need browser semantics but don’t want full Jest E2E yet, prefer the single-browser scenario runner:

- `node tools/dev/ui-scenario-suite.js --suite=scripts/ui/scenarios/<suite>.suite.js --scenario=001 --print-logs-on-failure`

## Validation

- Official Jest invocation rule (repo policy): use `npm run test:by-path <file>`.

## Escalation / Research request

Ask for dedicated research if:

- there is no obvious “smallest check” and you need a new check harness
- the feature spans multiple systems and you need a validation ladder proposal
