<!-- SVK Version Check — runs once per session on first skill invocation -->
<svk-version-check>
**On first invocation this session**, silently perform a version check:

1. Look for `.claude/svk-meta.json` in the current project. If it doesn't exist, skip this check entirely.
2. Read the `svk_repo` path and `installed_version` from the metadata file.
3. Run: `git -C <svk_repo> fetch --tags --quiet 2>/dev/null`
4. Run: `git -C <svk_repo> tag --sort=-v:refname | head -1` to get the latest tag.
5. Compare the installed version against the latest tag (strip the leading `v`).
6. If they match, skip — the user is up to date.
7. If the latest tag is newer, show this message ONCE (never repeat in this session):

> **SVK Update Available:** v{latest} is available (you're on v{installed}).
> - **Update now:** I can pull and reinstall the changed skills in this session
> - **Update later:** Start a new chat and run `/SVK:update`

8. If the git commands fail (offline, repo moved, etc.), skip silently. Never show errors from version checking.

**Important:** Do NOT block or delay the user's actual command. Perform this check, show the notification if needed, then proceed with the command they invoked.

# SVK Setup

A guided onboarding skill that sets up your entire Solana development environment — not just SVK, but the full ecosystem of plugins, MCPs, and skills needed for productive Solana development.

> *"The first 30 minutes determine whether someone stays or bounces. Make them count."*

---

## Getting Started

SVK Setup runs as a 4-phase guided flow. The full command runs all phases in sequence; sub-commands let you re-run individual phases.

### Quick Start

```
/SVK-setup
```

This begins with a short interview about your experience and project, then recommends tools, walks through installation, and generates a reference doc. Follow the prompts.

### Full Pipeline

### Typical Workflow

For first-time users, just run `/SVK-setup` and follow the prompts. The full flow takes 10-20 minutes depending on how many tools you install.

To re-run individual phases later:
- **`/SVK-setup:interview`** — Re-do the interview (resets profile)
- **`/SVK-setup:recommend`** — Re-generate recommendations from existing profile
- **`/SVK-setup:install`** — Install additional tools
- **`/SVK-setup:reference`** — Re-generate the reference document

---

## Foundation Patterns

| Pattern | How SVK Setup Uses It |
|---------|----------------------|
| Progressive Disclosure | Tool catalog indexed by category, loaded per-category during walkthrough |
| Signal-Based Indexing | Interview answers drive which catalog entries are surfaced |

---

## Output Structure

SVK Setup writes state to `.svk/` in the project root and the reference doc to `docs/`:

```
.svk/
├── SETUP_PROFILE.json          # User profile from interview
├── SETUP_RECOMMENDATIONS.json  # Tiered tool recommendations
└── SETUP_INSTALLED.json        # What was installed/skipped

docs/
└── svk-setup-reference.md      # Personalized reference document
```

---

## User Profiles

The interview produces one of three profiles that tune all subsequent behavior:

| Profile | Git | Solana | Claude Code | Behavior |
|---------|-----|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Beginner** | None/Basic | No/Learning | New | Extra explanations, guardrails emphasized, learning resources |
| **Intermediate** | Comfortable | Learning/Shipped | Some | Standard explanations, full recommended tier |
| **Advanced** | Comfortable | Shipped | Power user | Minimal hand-holding, full catalog available, cherry-pick |

---

## Tool Tiers

| Tier | Selection Logic |
|------|----------------|
| **Essential** | Always recommended regardless of profile |
| **Recommended** | Shown based on project type and experience |
| **Optional** | Listed for awareness, not pushed |

See `resources/tool-catalog.md` for the complete registry.
