description: Use whenever any Git operation is about to run against the philharmonic-workspace repo (status, pull/fetch, add, commit, push, submodule update). All Git work in this workspace MUST go through scripts/*.sh, not raw git, because the scripts encode submodule-first ordering and the mandatory signoff rule. Trigger on intent ("commit the docs", "push my changes", "pull latest", "what's dirty?") even before the user mentions git explicitly.

# Philharmonic workspace Git workflow

This workspace is a parent Git repo containing ~23 submodules, one per
crate. Wrong ordering (parent pushed before submodule) produces a
pointer origin can't resolve; missing `-s` signoff violates the DCO
rule every repo in the family enforces; an unsigned commit breaks the
GPG/SSH-signature requirement. The `scripts/*.sh` helpers exist so
none of those mistakes are possible. Use them.

Authoritative sources (read these if anything below is unclear):
- `CLAUDE.md` → "Git workflow" bullet.
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` §2 "Submodule discipline", "Git via scripts",
  "Every commit is signed off".
- `docs/design/13-conventions.md` §"Git workflow".

## Rules (non-negotiable)

1. **Never run raw `git commit` or `git push`** in this workspace —
   parent or submodule. The scripts encode submodule-first ordering,
   signoff (`-s`), signing (`-S`), and detached-HEAD guards that
   ad-hoc commands skip.
2. **Every commit is signed off *and* signed** (`Signed-off-by:`
   trailer via `-s`, plus a GPG or SSH signature via `-S`). The
   scripts pass both flags and verify the signature with
   `git log --format=%G?` after each commit; an unsigned commit
   is rolled back with `git reset --soft HEAD~1` and the script
   aborts. Don't bypass.
3. **Submodule commits land before the parent bumps their pointer.**
   `commit-all.sh` and `push-all.sh` walk submodules first on purpose.
   Reversing the order produces an unresolvable parent pointer on
   origin.
4. **If a script doesn't cover your case, extend the script first**
   (and update `docs/design/13-conventions.md §Git workflow`) rather
   than reaching for raw git. This is the whole point of the rule.
5. **Read-only inspection is fine** with raw git for history
   browsing (`git log`, `git diff`, `git show`, `git rev-parse`,
   `git branch`, `git submodule status`). The prohibition is on
   state-changing operations (`commit`, `push`, `add` outside
   what scripts do, `reset`, `rebase`, etc.). **Exception:** do
   *not* use raw `git log -n 1` to check current HEAD state
   across the workspace — use `./scripts/heads.sh`. It walks all
   24 repos (parent + submodules) in one call with the canonical
   SHA-sig-subject format; raw `git log -n 1` would need 24
   invocations to match and drifts in format between them.
6. **Git history is append-only.** No `git commit --amend`, no
   `git rebase` (interactive or otherwise), no `git reset --hard`,
   no `git push --force` / `--force-with-lease`, no
   `git filter-branch`, no history surgery of any kind. Two
   script-enforced exceptions, both bounded to local
   not-yet-pushed commits:
   (a) the `git reset --soft HEAD~1` that `.githooks/post-commit`
       and `commit-all.sh` both perform when a just-recorded
       commit violates the signature invariant;
   (b) the `git pull --rebase` (parent) + `git submodule update
       --remote --rebase` (submodules) inside
       `scripts/pull-all.sh`, which replay local unpushed
       commits on top of the upstream tip when upstream moved.
   That's it. Mistakes otherwise ship as **new commits**
   (fix-forward) or `git revert`s; never as retroactive edits.
   See docs/design/13-conventions.md §Git workflow ("No history
   modification") for the full statement, including why the
   rebase-on-pull alternatives (`--ff-only`, default merge,
   default submodule checkout) don't work cleanly.

## The scripts

All live in `scripts/` at the workspace root. Run from anywhere —
each script `cd`s to the workspace top level itself.

**Invoke by path, not by interpreter.** Always run
`./scripts/commit-all.sh "msg"`, never `bash scripts/commit-all.sh
"msg"` or `sh scripts/commit-all.sh "msg"`. The scripts are
POSIX-sh with `#!/bin/sh` shebangs (see
docs/design/13-conventions.md §Shell scripts); prefixing `bash`
silently forces bash and makes any introduced bashism "work" on
your machine while breaking on Alpine / FreeBSD / macOS.
Honoring the shebang is the entire point of the POSIX rule — so
let the shebang do its job.

### `scripts/status.sh`
Shows working-tree state of the parent and every submodule, plus
ahead/behind vs. upstream, plus a detached-HEAD warning. Use this
before committing or pushing to sanity-check what's about to land.

### `scripts/pull-all.sh`
Fetches the parent and updates each submodule to the tip of its
tracked remote branch (`git submodule update --remote --recursive`).
Prints status at the end. **Does not** commit the bumped submodule
pointers — that's `commit-all.sh`'s job.

### `scripts/commit-all.sh [--parent-only] [message]`
The only supported way to create commits here. Walks each submodule,
commits any dirty tree with `-s`, then commits the parent (which now
includes the bumped pointers).

- Default message is `"updates"`. Pass a real one:
  `scripts/commit-all.sh "extract mechanics-config types"`.
- `--parent-only` skips the submodule walk. Use when the parent has
  its own pending work (docs, scripts, ROADMAP tweaks) that should
  land independently of whatever the submodules are doing — e.g.
  while Codex has in-progress uncommitted work in a submodule you
  don't want to commit yet.
- Refuses to commit in a submodule that's in detached HEAD with
  changes (that commit would be orphaned). If you hit this, checkout
  a branch inside the submodule and rerun.
- The message is passed via a tempfile so special characters are safe
  — no escaping gymnastics needed.

### `scripts/push-all.sh`
Pushes each submodule's current branch (`git push --follow-tags
origin <branch>`), then pushes the parent. Submodule push failures
abort before the parent is pushed, so origin never gets a parent
pointer referencing an unpushed submodule commit. Detached-HEAD
submodules are skipped with a warning (normal right after
`git submodule update`). `--follow-tags` means release tags
created by `publish-crate.sh` ship along with their branch commit.

### `scripts/test-scripts.sh`
POSIX-parse-checks every `scripts/*.sh` with `dash -n` (fallback
`sh -n`). **Mandatory after any change under `scripts/`** before
committing. GitHub CI runs the same check.

### `scripts/check-detached.sh`
Fails with a non-zero exit if any submodule is in detached HEAD,
listing the offenders. Useful pre-flight before `commit-all.sh`,
`publish-crate.sh`, or any multi-commit operation.

### `scripts/show-dirty.sh`
Prints dirty-submodule names, one per line; empty output when
nothing's dirty. Machine-readable counterpart to `status.sh`;
used internally by `pre-landing.sh`.

### `scripts/heads.sh`
Shows the current HEAD commit for the parent and every submodule,
with short SHA, `%G?` signature indicator, and subject. Use after
`commit-all.sh` / `push-all.sh` to sanity-check what landed and
to verify every commit carries a cryptographic signature (`G` =
good, `U` = good+untrusted; anything else on a pushed commit is a
problem). Canonical replacement for ad-hoc `git log -n 1` across
repos — do not invoke raw `git log -n 1` for HEAD-state queries.

### `scripts/log.sh [--history|--audit|--stats] [-n <N>|--count <N>] [<submodule-path>]`
Unified pretty-printed git-log front-end with three modes
(replaces the retired `git-log.sh` / `audit-log.sh` /
`stats-log.sh`). Default target is the parent workspace repo;
pass a submodule path relative to the workspace root (e.g.
`mechanics-core`, `philharmonic-types`) to inspect that
submodule's own history.

Modes (mutually exclusive; `--history` is the default):
- `--history` — short SHA, date, `%G?`, sign-off label, author,
  subject. Default count: 500. Use for auditing the sign-off +
  signature invariants:
  `./scripts/log.sh | grep -E '\[(N|NOT signed-off)\]'` for
  the parent; loop over submodule names (or
  `git submodule foreach 'cd $toplevel && ./scripts/log.sh
  "$name"'`) to audit the whole workspace.
- `--audit` — short SHA, ISO time, `%G?`, sign-off label,
  author, diffstat (`-<del> +<ins>`), and the `Audit-Info:`
  trailer body. Default count: 200.
- `--stats` — short SHA, ISO time (with timezone preserved),
  author, `Code-stats:` trailer body, and per-commit delta
  vs. predecessor. Default count: 200. Falls back to
  `docs/stats-cache.tsv` for parent-repo commits whose
  trailer is absent (pre-trailer-adoption history).

The sign-off label (used by `--history` and `--audit`) matches
`Signed-off-by:` trailers against the commit's author email
(`%ae`), distinguishing `[signed-off]` (author's own sign-off
present), `[unknown sign-off]` (trailers exist but none match
the author), and `[NOT signed-off]` (no trailer — DCO
violation).

Rejects paths that aren't a git-repo root, so subdirectories
and the in-tree `xtask/` member (both share the parent's
history) don't accidentally masquerade as submodules. Sources
`workspace-cd.sh`, so the positional path is always resolved
from the workspace root. Requires git ≥ 2.32.

### `scripts/check-api-breakage.sh <crate> [<baseline-version>]`
Runs `cargo semver-checks check-release -p <crate>` against a
crates.io baseline (latest non-yanked by default, or the version
you pass). Per-crate, not `--workspace`, because this workspace
is a virtual-workspace parent + submodules and the
git-clone-based baseline modes don't resolve submodule members.
Installs `cargo-semver-checks` on first use. Use before preparing
a crate release.

### `scripts/publish-crate.sh [--dry-run] <crate>`
Publishes one crate to crates.io (via `cargo publish`) and tags
the release `v<version>` inside the submodule repo. Tag is
signed, created only after a successful publish. The tag is then
pushed by the next `push-all.sh` via `--follow-tags`.

### `scripts/cargo-audit.sh [...]`
Runs `cargo audit` against the workspace `Cargo.lock`;
auto-installs `cargo-audit` via `cargo install --locked` on
first use. Run alongside `check-api-breakage.sh` when preparing
a release.

### `scripts/crate-version.sh <crate> | --all`
Prints a crate's version string parsed from its own `Cargo.toml`.
Internal helper; used by `publish-crate.sh`. Pass `--all` instead
of a crate name to list every submodule's name and version in one
aligned pass — handy when preparing a multi-crate release.

### `scripts/xtask.sh crates-io-versions -- <crate>`
Lists the published (non-yanked) versions of a crate on
crates.io by querying the sparse index directly. Complements
`crate-version.sh`: local vs. already-published state.
Implemented as a Rust bin in `xtask/` (uses `ureq` +
`serde_json` internally — no dependency on `jq` or
`web-fetch.sh`, both of which are out of baseline on stripped
GNU/Linux and macOS installs). Replaces the former
`crates-io-versions.sh`.

## Decision tree

```
Want to see state?               → scripts/status.sh
Want latest from origin?         → scripts/pull-all.sh
Have changes to commit?
  - submodules + parent together → scripts/commit-all.sh "msg"
  - parent only (docs, scripts)  → scripts/commit-all.sh --parent-only "msg"
Ready to share?                  → scripts/push-all.sh
Inspecting history?              → raw git log/diff/show is fine
Need something the scripts don't do?
                                 → extend the script, THEN use it
```

## Common failure modes

- **"I just need to amend quickly"** — no. Amend is a history
  rewrite; rule 6 forbids it unconditionally. It also invalidates
  the previous commit's signature and rewrites the `Audit-Info:`
  trailer. Make a new commit via `commit-all.sh`; history stays
  honest.
- **"I need to rebase / squash / reset before pushing"** — still no.
  The append-only rule covers unpushed commits too; Yuka reviews
  history the way it landed. Fix-forward with a new commit, or if
  the earlier commit is genuinely garbage, ask before touching it.
  The rebase inside `pull-all.sh` (exception 6b) is for
  integrating *upstream* moves, not for reorganizing your own
  history; don't repurpose it.
- **"The post-commit hook rolled back my commit"** — your working
  tree is preserved; the commit message is saved at
  `.git/UNSIGNED_COMMIT_MSG`. Rerun `./scripts/commit-all.sh "msg"`.
  That rollback is the one rule-6 exception; no other `reset`
  invocation is authorized.
- **"The parent push failed: some submodule commit is missing on
  remote"** — that's `push.recurseSubmodules=check` working as
  designed. Push the submodule (or rerun `push-all.sh` from scratch),
  then retry.
- **"`commit-all.sh` refused: detached HEAD"** — `cd` into the
  named submodule, `git checkout <branch>` (or create one), rerun.
- **"I want to commit only one submodule"** — run `commit-all.sh`
  with the other submodules clean. It only commits submodules that
  are dirty, so a targeted `git add` inside the one submodule
  followed by `commit-all.sh "msg"` does exactly that.

## Setup

If this is a fresh clone and scripts are failing because submodules
aren't initialized, run `scripts/setup.sh` once — it initializes all
submodules recursively, sets `push.recurseSubmodules=check`, points
`core.hooksPath` at the tracked `.githooks/` (relative path inside
each submodule, computed by `scripts/lib/relpath.sh`), turns on
`commit.gpgsign` / `tag.gpgsign` / `rebase.gpgsign` on the parent
and every submodule, and warns if the Rust toolchain is missing.
After that, the helpers above work. (`rebase.gpgsign` is a separate
git config key because `commit.gpgsign` doesn't cover rebase-
replayed commits; without it, `pull-all.sh`'s rebase-on-pull would
land unsigned commits that `post-commit` then rolls back.)

## Tracked Git hooks

Four hooks under `.githooks/` back the "go through the scripts"
rule at the Git-client level, once `setup.sh` has wired them in:

- `.githooks/pre-commit` — rejects any `git commit` invocation that
  didn't set `WORKSPACE_GIT_WRAPPER=1`. Only `commit-all.sh` exports
  that env var. If you see the "Commit blocked: git was not invoked
  via scripts/commit-all.sh" message, you ran raw `git commit` —
  back up, stage nothing manually, run `commit-all.sh` instead.
- `.githooks/commit-msg` — rejects any message without a matching
  `Signed-off-by: <name> <email>` trailer. Skips merges, reverts,
  fixups, and empty messages. `commit-all.sh` always passes `-s`,
  so this hook catches commits that bypassed the wrapper.
- `.githooks/post-commit` — if the commit just recorded lacks a
  valid GPG/SSH signature (`%G?` not `G`/`U`), rolls back with
  `git reset --soft HEAD~1` and saves the message to
  `.git/UNSIGNED_COMMIT_MSG`. Staged changes are preserved. The
  abort message points at `scripts/commit-all.sh` as the retry
  path; a raw-git fallback (`git commit -S -s -F <saved-msg>`
  or `git commit -S -s -c ORIG_HEAD`) is documented as a fresh
  commit, not an amend (rule 6 forbids amend). `setup.sh` turns
  on `commit.gpgsign=true` and `rebase.gpgsign=true` workspace-
  wide, so this fires only for commits that bypassed signing
  explicitly.
- `.githooks/pre-push` — walks every new commit in the push and
  rejects the push if any commit is unsigned (`%G?` not `G`/`U`)
  or lacks a `Signed-off-by:` trailer. Same exemptions as
  `commit-msg` for `Merge `/`fixup! `/`squash! `/`Revert `
  first-line prefixes. Redundant with commit-msg + post-commit
  for the normal `commit-all.sh` flow — it earns its keep by
  catching commits that got in via `--no-verify`, external
  `cherry-pick`, or tool-produced merges. Fires for every `git
  push` in parent and submodules (push-all.sh pushes each
  submodule first, then the parent; each push triggers the
  hook in its own repo). The abort message does **not** suggest
  amend / rebase / reset (rule 6), and instead asks you to
  trace how an unsigned / unsigned-off commit got into local
  history in the first place. Emergency escape hatch via
  `git config hooks.allowUnsignedPush true` — ask Yuka first.

Don't `--no-verify` around these hooks. If you legitimately need a
flow the wrappers don't support, extend the wrapper.
