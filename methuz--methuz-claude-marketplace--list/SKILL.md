# /clickup:list - List ClickUp Tasks

## Purpose
Fetch and display user stories/bugs from ClickUp filtered by status.

## Usage
```
/clickup:list                         # Default: "To Do" tasks
/clickup:list --status "in progress"  # Tasks currently being worked on
/clickup:list --status "to review"    # Tasks ready for review
/clickup:list --all                   # All tasks (all statuses)
```

## Common Status Filters
| Status | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| `to do` | Tasks ready to start (default) |
| `in progress` | Tasks currently being worked on |
| `to review` | Tasks awaiting review |
| `done` | Completed tasks |
| `--all` | All tasks across all statuses |

## Behavioral Flow

When this command is invoked:

1. **Load Environment**: Read ClickUp credentials from the project's `.env` file:
   - `CLICKUP_TOKEN` - API authentication token
   - `CLICKUP_LIST_ID` - The ClickUp list to fetch tasks from

2. **Parse Status Filter**:
   - Default: `To Do`
   - If `--status` provided, use that status (URL encode spaces as `%20`)

3. **Fetch Tasks**: Call ClickUp API with the specified status and format with jq:
   ```bash
   # IMPORTANT:
   # - Always use jq to format output compactly to avoid truncation
   # - Use subtasks=true to ensure ALL tasks are returned (not just first page)
   # - The API may paginate results; subtasks=true bypasses this for most cases

   # Default (To Do) - formatted output
   curl -s "https://api.clickup.com/api/v2/list/${CLICKUP_LIST_ID}/task?statuses[]=To%20Do&include_closed=false&subtasks=true" \
     -H "Authorization: ${CLICKUP_TOKEN}" | jq -r '
     "📋 Tasks Ready for Development (To Do)\n",
     (.tasks[] | "• [\(.id)] \(if (.tags | map(.name) | contains(["bug"])) then "🐛" elif (.tags | map(.name) | contains(["story"])) then "📖" else "  " end) \(.name)"),
     "",
     "Found \(.tasks | length) tasks ready for development.",
     "",
     "💡 Use: /clickup:process <id> to set up a worktree and start"
   '

   # In Progress - with branch info
   curl -s "https://api.clickup.com/api/v2/list/${CLICKUP_LIST_ID}/task?statuses[]=in%20progress&include_closed=false&subtasks=true" \
     -H "Authorization: ${CLICKUP_TOKEN}" | jq -r '
     "📋 Tasks In Progress\n",
     (.tasks[] | "• [\(.id)] \(if (.tags | map(.name) | contains(["bug"])) then "🐛" elif (.tags | map(.name) | contains(["story"])) then "📖" else "  " end) \(.name)\n  Branch: \((.custom_fields[] | select(.name == "branch") | .value) // "not set")"),
     "",
     "Found \(.tasks | length) tasks in progress.",
     "",
     "💡 Use: /clickup:work <id> to spawn a subagent to work on a task",
     "💡 Use: /clickup:work --all to work on all in-progress tasks",
     "💡 Use: /clickup:done to complete a task"
   '

   # All statuses - comprehensive view
   curl -s "https://api.clickup.com/api/v2/list/${CLICKUP_LIST_ID}/task?include_closed=false&subtasks=true" \
     -H "Authorization: ${CLICKUP_TOKEN}" | jq -r '
     "📋 All Tasks\n",
     (.tasks[] | "• [\(.id)] \(if (.tags | map(.name) | contains(["bug"])) then "🐛" elif (.tags | map(.name) | contains(["story"])) then "📖" else "  " end) [\(.status.status)] \(.name)"),
     "",
     "Found \(.tasks | length) total tasks."
   '
   ```

4. **Format Output**: Display tasks in a formatted table with:
   - Task ID (for use with `/clickup:process` or `/clickup:work`)
   - Type (bug or story based on tags)
   - Priority (Urgent, High, Normal, Low)
   - Title
   - Branch (if available, for "In Progress" tasks)

5. **Show Next Steps**: Context-aware suggestions based on status
