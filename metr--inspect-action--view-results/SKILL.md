# View Hawk Eval Results

When the user wants to analyze evaluation results, use these hawk CLI commands:

## 1. List Eval Sets

You can list all eval sets if the user do not know the eval set ID:

```bash
hawk list eval-sets
```

Shows: eval set ID, creation date, creator.

You can increase the limit of results returned by `--limit N`.

```bash
hawk list eval-sets --limit 50
```

Or you can search for a specific eval set by using `--search QUERY`.

```bash
hawk list eval-sets --search pico
```

## 2. List Evaluations

With an eval set ID, you can list all evaluations in the eval-set:

```bash
hawk list evals [EVAL_SET_ID]
```

Shows: task name, model, status (success/error/cancelled), and sample counts.

## 3. List Samples

Or you can list individual samples and their scores:

```bash
hawk list samples [EVAL_SET_ID] [--eval FILE] [--limit N]
```

## 4. Download Transcript

To get the full conversation for a specific sample:

```bash
hawk transcript <UUID>
```

The transcript includes full conversation with tool calls, scores, and metadata.

To get even more details, you can get the raw data by using `--raw`:

```bash
hawk transcript <UUID> --raw
```

### Batch Transcript Download

You can also download all transcripts for an entire eval set:

```bash
# Fetch all samples in an eval set
hawk transcripts <EVAL_SET_ID>

# Write to individual files in a directory
hawk transcripts <EVAL_SET_ID> --output-dir ./transcripts

# Limit number of samples
hawk transcripts <EVAL_SET_ID> --limit 10

# Raw JSON output (one JSON per line to stdout, or .json files with --output-dir)
hawk transcripts <EVAL_SET_ID> --raw
```

## Workflow

1. Run `hawk list eval-sets` to see available eval sets
2a. Run `hawk list evals <EVAL_SET_ID>` to see available evaluations
2b. or run `hawk list samples <EVAL_SET_ID>` to find samples of interest
3a. Run `hawk transcript <uuid>` to get full details on a single sample
3b. or run `hawk transcripts <eval_set_id> --output-dir ./transcripts` to download all
4. Read and analyze the transcript(s) to understand the agent's behavior

## API Environments

Production (`https://api.inspect-ai.internal.metr.org`) is used by default. Set `HAWK_API_URL` only when targeting non-production environments:

| Environment | URL |
|-------------|-----|
| Staging | `https://api.inspect-ai.staging.metr-dev.org` |
| Dev1 | `https://api.inspect-ai.dev1.staging.metr-dev.org` |
| Dev2 | `https://api.inspect-ai.dev2.staging.metr-dev.org` |
| Dev3 | `https://api.inspect-ai.dev3.staging.metr-dev.org` |
| Dev4 | `https://api.inspect-ai.dev4.staging.metr-dev.org` |

Example:
```bash
HAWK_API_URL=https://api.inspect-ai.staging.metr-dev.org hawk list eval_sets
```
