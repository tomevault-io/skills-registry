# Code Scoring

Systematic, quantitative code quality assessment using weighted categories and standardized deductions.

## Quick Start

**Full code review with score:**
```
Score this code on a 1-10 scale using the code-scoring rubric
```

**Category-specific assessment:**
```
Evaluate the error handling in this module using the scoring rubric
```

**Compare implementations:**
```
Score both implementations and recommend which is better
```

## Scoring Methodology

### The Formula

```
Final Score = 10 - Total Deductions

Where:
Total Deductions = SUM(Category Deductions * Category Weight)
Category Deduction = SUM(Issue Points * Severity Multiplier)
```

### Category Weights

| Category | Weight | Focus Areas |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Organization** | 12% | File structure, module boundaries, separation of concerns |
| **Naming** | 10% | Variables, functions, classes, constants, files |
| **Error Handling** | 12% | Try/catch, validation, error propagation, recovery |
| **Testing** | 12% | Coverage, quality, edge cases, maintainability |
| **Performance** | 10% | Efficiency, resource usage, scalability |
| **Security** | 12% | Input validation, auth, data protection, secrets |
| **Documentation** | 8% | Comments, API docs, README, inline explanations |
| **SOLID Principles** | 10% | SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP adherence |
| **Dependencies** | 6% | Version management, minimal deps, no circular refs |
| **Maintainability** | 8% | Readability, complexity, changeability |

**Total: 100%**

### Severity Multipliers

| Severity | Multiplier | Description |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| **Critical** | 2.0x | Security vulnerabilities, data loss risks, crashes |
| **Major** | 1.5x | Significant bugs, poor patterns, missing core functionality |
| **Minor** | 1.0x | Code smells, style issues, minor inefficiencies |
| **Nitpick** | 0.5x | Preferences, optional improvements |

## Quick Scoring Cheat Sheet

| Score | Label | Meaning | Typical Characteristics |
|-------|-------|---------|-------------------------|
| **10** | Exemplary | Production excellence | Minimal issues, well-tested, secure, documented |
| **9** | Excellent | Minor polish needed | 1-2 nitpicks, strong overall quality |
| **8** | Very Good | Ready with small fixes | Few minor issues, solid fundamentals |
| **7** | Good | Acceptable quality | Some improvements needed, no major issues |
| **6** | Satisfactory | Functional but rough | Multiple minor issues, needs cleanup |
| **5** | Adequate | Meets minimum bar | Works but has clear problems |
| **4** | Below Average | Needs significant work | Major issues present, risky to deploy |
| **3** | Poor | Substantial rework | Multiple major issues, architectural problems |
| **2** | Very Poor | Fundamental problems | Barely functional, serious concerns |
| **1** | Critical | Do not deploy | Security vulnerabilities, crashes, data risks |

## Scoring Workflow

### Step 1: Initial Scan

```
1. Count lines of code
2. Identify file/module structure
3. Note language and framework
4. Check for tests presence
5. Scan for obvious red flags
```

### Step 2: Category Assessment

For each of the 10 categories:

```
1. Review relevant code sections
2. Identify issues
3. Classify severity (critical/major/minor/nitpick)
4. Calculate: Issues * Severity Multiplier
5. Apply category weight
```

### Step 3: Calculate Final Score

```
Final Score = 10 - (Sum of weighted deductions)

If score < 1: score = 1
If score > 10: score = 10
```

### Step 4: Generate Report

```markdown
## Code Score: X.X/10

### Score Breakdown
| Category | Weight | Deductions | Weighted |
|----------|--------|------------|----------|
| Organization | 12% | ... | ... |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
