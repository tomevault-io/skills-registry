# MCP Tool Mastery

Master the 80+ MCP tools available in the GoodVibes plugin. This skill teaches you when and how to use each tool for maximum effectiveness.

## THE LAW: Tool-First Development

**This is non-negotiable. Violating these rules means you're not doing your job.**

### Before ANY Task

```bash
# 1. ALWAYS check tool schema first
mcp-cli info plugin_goodvibes_goodvibes-tools/<tool_name>

# 2. THEN make the call
mcp-cli call plugin_goodvibes_goodvibes-tools/<tool_name> '{"param": "value"}'
```

### The Golden Rules

1. **Never skip `mcp-cli info`** - Schemas are tool-specific. Your assumptions are wrong.
2. **Never do manually what a tool can do** - If a tool exists, use it.
3. **Skills contain expertise you lack** - Load them to become an expert.
4. **Tools provide current information** - Your training data is outdated.

## Tool Invocation Patterns

### Pattern 1: Schema Check First (MANDATORY)

```bash
# WRONG - Never do this
mcp-cli call plugin_goodvibes_goodvibes-tools/detect_stack '{}'

# CORRECT - Always check schema first
mcp-cli info plugin_goodvibes_goodvibes-tools/detect_stack
# Read the schema output
mcp-cli call plugin_goodvibes_goodvibes-tools/detect_stack '{}'
```

### Pattern 2: Parallel Info Calls

When using multiple tools, check all schemas first:

```bash
# Check all schemas in parallel
mcp-cli info plugin_goodvibes_goodvibes-tools/detect_stack
mcp-cli info plugin_goodvibes_goodvibes-tools/scan_patterns
mcp-cli info plugin_goodvibes_goodvibes-tools/project_issues

# Then make calls
mcp-cli call plugin_goodvibes_goodvibes-tools/detect_stack '{}'
mcp-cli call plugin_goodvibes_goodvibes-tools/project_issues '{}'
```

### Pattern 3: Skill Loading Workflow

```bash
# 1. Find relevant skills
mcp-cli info plugin_goodvibes_goodvibes-tools/recommend_skills
mcp-cli call plugin_goodvibes_goodvibes-tools/recommend_skills '{"task": "implement authentication"}'

# 2. Load the recommended skill
mcp-cli info plugin_goodvibes_goodvibes-tools/get_skill_content
mcp-cli call plugin_goodvibes_goodvibes-tools/get_skill_content '{"skill_path": "webdev/authentication/clerk"}'
```

### Pattern 4: Pre-Edit Validation

```bash
# Before making edits, validate they won't cause errors
mcp-cli info plugin_goodvibes_goodvibes-tools/validate_edits_preview
mcp-cli call plugin_goodvibes_goodvibes-tools/validate_edits_preview '{"file": "src/auth.ts", "changes": "..."}'
```

### Pattern 5: Safe Deletion

```bash
# Before deleting any symbol, verify it's safe
mcp-cli info plugin_goodvibes_goodvibes-tools/safe_delete_check
mcp-cli call plugin_goodvibes_goodvibes-tools/safe_delete_check '{"symbol": "oldFunction", "file": "src/utils.ts"}'
```

## Troubleshooting

### Tool Not Found

```bash
# List all available tools
mcp-cli tools

# Search for tools by keyword
mcp-cli grep "database"
```

### Schema Mismatch

```bash
# Always re-check schema if call fails
mcp-cli info plugin_goodvibes_goodvibes-tools/<tool>
```

### Tool Returns Error

1. Check schema matches your call
2. Verify required parameters
3. Check parameter types (strings vs objects)
4. Use stdin for complex JSON:

```bash
mcp-cli call plugin_goodvibes_goodvibes-tools/<tool> - <<'EOF'
{
  "complex": {
    "nested": "value"
  }
}
EOF
```

## Checklist: Am I Using Tools Correctly?

Before any task:
- [ ] Did I run `detect_stack`?
- [ ] Did I check `project_issues`?
- [ ] Did I search for relevant skills?

Before editing:
- [ ] Did I run `scan_patterns`?
- [ ] Did I check `find_tests_for_file`?
- [ ] Did I use `validate_edits_preview`?

After editing:
- [ ] Did I run `check_types`?
- [ ] Did I run `get_diagnostics`?

Before deletion:
- [ ] Did I run `safe_delete_check`?
- [ ] Did I verify with `find_references`?

**If you answered "no" to any of these, GO BACK AND USE THE TOOL.**
