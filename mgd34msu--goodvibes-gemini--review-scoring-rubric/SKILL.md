# Review Scoring Rubric

Complete scoring system for quantified code reviews with weighted categories and severity-based deductions.

## Quick Start

**Calculate score:**
```
Calculate a score for this codebase using the 10-category weighted rubric.
```

**Specific category audit:**
```
Analyze the Testing category and calculate its weighted contribution to the score.
```

## The Formula

```
Final Score = 10 - Total Weighted Deductions

Where:
Total Weighted Deductions = SUM(Category Deduction * Category Weight)
Category Deduction = SUM(Issue Points * Severity Multiplier)
```

**Maximum Deduction per Category:** 10 points (caps at 0 for category)

---

## Severity Multipliers

| Severity | Multiplier | Description | Example Issues |
|----------|------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Critical** | 2.0x | Active danger, data loss, security holes | SQL injection, RCE, hardcoded secrets |
| **Major** | 1.5x | Significant problems, high bug potential | God classes, no tests, N+1 queries |
| **Minor** | 1.0x | Code smells, maintainability issues | Long functions, magic numbers |
| **Nitpick** | 0.5x | Style, preferences, minor polish | Naming conventions, formatting |

## Score Calculation Example

```
Category: Security (Weight: 12%)

Issues Found:
1. SQL Injection (src/api/users.ts:45)
   - Base: 2.0, Severity: Critical (2.0x)
   - Deduction: 2.0 * 2.0 = 4.0

2. Hardcoded API key (src/config.ts:12)
   - Base: 2.0, Severity: Critical (2.0x)
   - Deduction: 2.0 * 2.0 = 4.0

3. Missing input validation (5 endpoints)
   - Base: 1.0, Severity: Major (1.5x)
   - Deduction: 1.0 * 1.5 = 1.5

Category Raw Deduction: 4.0 + 4.0 + 1.5 = 9.5 (capped at 10)
Category Raw Score: 10 - 9.5 = 0.5/10
Weighted Contribution: 0.5 * 0.12 = 0.06 (out of 1.20 max)
Grade: F
```

| **7** | Good | Acceptable. Some cleanup needed. |
| **6** | Satisfactory | Works but rough. Needs attention. |
| **5** | Adequate | Barely meets the bar. Clear problems. |
| **4** | Below Average | Significant issues. Risky to deploy. |
| **3** | Poor | Major rework needed. Architectural problems. |
| **2** | Very Poor | Fundamental issues. Barely functional. |
