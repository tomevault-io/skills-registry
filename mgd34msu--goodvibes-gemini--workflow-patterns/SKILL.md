# Workflow Patterns

Reusable patterns for structuring workflows in skills and agents.

## Sequential with Checklist

Use when steps must be completed in order with tracking:

```markdown
## Form Processing Workflow

Track progress:
- [ ] Step 1: Analyze form (run analyze_form.py)
- [ ] Step 2: Create field mapping
- [ ] Step 3: Validate (run validate.py)
- [ ] Step 4: Fill form
- [ ] Step 5: Verify output
```

**When to use**: Multi-step processes where completion tracking matters.

## Conditional Routing

Use when different paths apply based on context:

```markdown
## Document Workflow

1. Determine task type:
   - **Creating new?** -> Follow Creation workflow
   - **Editing existing?** -> Follow Editing workflow

## Creation workflow
[steps for new documents]

## Editing workflow
[steps for existing documents]
```

**When to use**: Tasks with distinct modes or branches.

## Validation Loop

Use when iterative refinement is needed:

```markdown
1. Make changes
2. Validate: `python validate.py`
3. If errors:
   - Fix issues
   - Return to step 2
4. Only proceed when validation passes
```

**When to use**: Operations requiring correctness verification.

## Progressive Disclosure Patterns

### Pattern 1: Quick Start + References

Front-load common usage, defer details:

```markdown
## Quick start
[Most common usage - get user productive fast]

## Advanced
- **Forms**: See [FORMS.md](references/forms.md)
- **API details**: See [REFERENCE.md](references/reference.md)
```

### Pattern 2: Domain Organization

Organize by topic when multiple domains exist:

```
bigquery/
  SKILL.md (overview + navigation)
  references/
    finance.md
    sales.md
    product.md
```

### Pattern 3: Conditional Depth

Provide escape hatches for advanced needs:

```markdown
## Basic usage
[Simple approach that works 80% of the time]

**For tracked changes**: See [REDLINING.md](references/redlining.md)
**For batch processing**: See [BATCH.md](references/batch.md)
```

## Degrees of Freedom

Match instruction specificity to the situation:

| Situation | Freedom Level | Example |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| Multiple valid approaches | High | "Analyze code structure and suggest improvements" |
| Preferred pattern exists | Medium | "Use this template, customize as needed" |
| Fragile/critical operation | Low | "Run exactly: `python migrate.py --verify`" |

## Combining Patterns

Patterns can be nested:

```markdown
## Main Workflow

1. Determine mode:
   - **Quick fix?** -> Use Quick Fix workflow
   - **Full analysis?** -> Use Analysis workflow

## Quick Fix workflow
- [ ] Identify issue
- [ ] Apply fix
- [ ] Validate: `npm test`
- [ ] If fails, return to step 2

## Analysis workflow
See [DEEP_ANALYSIS.md](references/deep-analysis.md) for comprehensive steps.
```

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Fix |
|--------------|---------|-----|
| No clear entry point | User doesn't know where to start | Add "Quick Start" section |
| Too many branches | Decision paralysis | Provide sensible defaults |
| No validation step | Errors discovered too late | Add explicit verification |
| References too deep | Content hard to find | Keep one level from SKILL.md |
