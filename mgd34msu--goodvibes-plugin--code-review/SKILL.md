# Code Review Quality Skill

This skill teaches you how to perform thorough, enterprise-grade code reviews using GoodVibes precision tools. A systematic code review catches issues early, ensures consistency, validates security and performance, and maintains high quality standards across the codebase.

## When to Use This Skill

Load this skill when:
- Reviewing pull requests or merge requests
- Performing code quality audits
- Validating security and performance of implementations
- Checking adherence to architectural patterns
- Assessing test coverage and quality
- Evaluating accessibility compliance
- Providing structured feedback to developers

Trigger phrases: "review this code", "check the PR", "quality audit", "security review", "performance review", "validate implementation".

## Core Workflow

### Phase 1: Discovery - Understand the Change

Before reviewing, understand what changed, why, and the scope of impact.

#### Step 1.1: Gather Change Context

Use `discover` to map all changed files and identify the type of change.

```yaml
discover:
  queries:
    - id: changed_files
      type: glob
      patterns: ["src/**/*"]  # List changed files for review
    - id: new_files
      type: glob
      patterns: ["**/*"]
    - id: test_files
      type: glob
      patterns: ["**/*.test.ts", "**/*.test.tsx", "**/*.spec.ts", "**/*.spec.tsx"]
  verbosity: files_only
```

**Extract from git:**

```yaml
precision_exec:
  commands:
    - cmd: "git diff --name-only HEAD~1..HEAD"
  verbosity: minimal
```

**What this reveals:**
- All files modified in the changeset
- New vs modified vs deleted files
- Test files included (or missing)
- Scope of change (frontend, backend, full-stack)

#### Step 1.2: Analyze Changed Code

Use `precision_read` to examine the actual changes.

```yaml
precision_read:
  files:
    - path: "src/api/user-routes.ts"  # Example changed file
      extract: content
    - path: "src/components/UserProfile.tsx"
      extract: content
  output:
    max_per_item: 200
  verbosity: standard
```

**Get diff context:**

```yaml
precision_exec:
  commands:
    - cmd: "git diff HEAD~1..HEAD -- src/api/user-routes.ts"
  verbosity: standard
```

#### Step 1.3: Find Related Code

Use `discover` to find imports, exports, and usage of changed symbols.

```yaml
discover:
  queries:
    - id: function_exports
      type: grep
      pattern: "export (function|const|class) (createUser|updateUser|deleteUser)"
      glob: "**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}"
    - id: usage_sites
      type: grep
      pattern: "(createUser|updateUser|deleteUser)\\("
      glob: "**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}"
    - id: related_tests
      type: grep
      pattern: "(createUser|updateUser|deleteUser)"
      glob: "**/*.test.{ts,tsx}"
  verbosity: locations
```

**What this reveals:**
- Where changed functions are used
- Potential breaking changes
- Test coverage for changed code
- Ripple effects across the codebase

### Phase 2: Security Review

Security issues are **critical** and must be caught in review.

#### Step 2.1: Check for Common Vulnerabilities

Use `discover` to find security anti-patterns.

```yaml
discover:
  queries:
    # SQL Injection
    - id: sql_injection
      type: grep
      pattern: '(query|execute|sql).*[`$].*\$\{'
      glob: "**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}"
    # XSS vulnerabilities
    - id: dangerous_html
      type: grep
      pattern: "(dangerouslySetInnerHTML|innerHTML|outerHTML)"
      glob: "**/*.{ts,tsx,jsx}"
    # Hardcoded secrets
    - id: hardcoded_secrets
      type: grep
      pattern: '(password|secret|api[_-]?key|token)\s*=\s*["''][^"'']+["'']'
      glob: "**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx,json}"
    # Missing authentication
    - id: unauthed_routes
      type: grep
      pattern: "export (async )?function (GET|POST|PUT|DELETE|PATCH)"
      glob: "src/app/api/**/*.ts"
  verbosity: locations
```

**Critical patterns to check:**

| Pattern | Severity | Why It Matters |
|---------|----------|----------------|
| SQL injection | Critical | Allows attackers to read/modify database |
| XSS vulnerabilities | Critical | Allows script injection, session hijacking |
| Hardcoded secrets | Critical | Exposes credentials in source code |
| Missing auth checks | Critical | Exposes protected resources |
| Unsafe deserialization | Critical | Remote code execution |
| CORS misconfiguration | Major | Allows unauthorized origins |
| Weak password rules | Major | Account compromise |
| Missing input validation | Major | Data corruption, injection |

#### Step 2.2: Validate Input Handling

All external input must be validated.

```yaml
discover:
  queries:
    # Check for validation schemas
    - id: zod_schemas
      type: grep
      pattern: "z\\.(object|string|number|array|enum)"
      glob: "**/*.{ts,tsx}"
    # Check for direct request.json() without validation
    - id: unvalidated_input
      type: grep
      pattern: "(await request\\.json\\(\\)|req\\.body)(?!.*safeParse)"
      glob: "src/app/api/**/*.ts"
    # Check for SQL parameterization
    - id: parameterized_queries
      type: grep
      pattern: "(db\\.(query|execute)|prisma\\.|sql`)"
      glob: "**/*.{ts,js}"
  verbosity: locations
```

**Best practices to validate:**
- All API routes validate input with Zod, Joi, or equivalent
- All database queries use parameterized queries (Prisma, prepared statements)
- File uploads validate content type and size
- URLs and redirects are validated against allowlists

#### Step 2.3: Check Authentication & Authorization

Verify that protected resources require authentication.

```yaml
discover:
  queries:
    # Find auth middleware usage
    - id: auth_middleware
      type: grep
      pattern: "(getServerSession|auth\\(\\)|requireAuth|withAuth)"
      glob: "src/app/api/**/*.ts"
    # Find resource ownership checks
    - id: ownership_checks
      type: grep
      pattern: "(userId|authorId|ownerId)\s*===\s*(session|user|currentUser)"
      glob: "**/*.{ts,tsx}"
    # Find RBAC checks
    - id: rbac_checks
      type: grep
      pattern: "(role|permission|can)\s*===\s*"
      glob: "**/*.{ts,tsx}"
  verbosity: locations
```

**Critical checks:**
- [ ] Protected API routes call auth middleware
- [ ] User can only modify their own resources (ownership checks)
- [ ] Admin-only actions check for admin role
- [ ] JWTs are validated with proper secret
- [ ] Session tokens are rotated and have expiration

### Phase 3: Performance Review

Performance issues cause poor UX and cost scalability.

#### Step 3.1: Check for N+1 Queries

N+1 queries are the #1 database performance killer.

```yaml
discover:
  queries:
    # Find loops with database calls
    - id: n_plus_one
      type: grep
      pattern: "(for|forEach|map).*await.*(prisma|db|query|find)"
      glob: "**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}"
    # Find Prisma include usage
    - id: prisma_includes
      type: grep
      pattern: "(findMany|findUnique|findFirst).*include:"
      glob: "**/*.{ts,js}"
  verbosity: locations
```

**How to fix:**
- Use `include` to eager load related records (Prisma)
- Use joins or `SELECT IN` for batch loading
- Implement DataLoader for GraphQL
- Cache frequently accessed data

#### Step 3.2: Check for Unnecessary Re-renders

React re-render issues harm frontend performance.

```yaml
discover:
  queries:
    # Find inline object/array creation in JSX
    - id: inline_objects
      type: grep
      pattern: "(onClick|onChange|style)=\\{\\{|=\\{\\["
      glob: "**/*.{tsx,jsx}"
    # Find missing useMemo/useCallback
    - id: missing_memoization
      type: grep
      pattern: "(map|filter|reduce)\\("
      glob: "**/*.{tsx,jsx}"
    # Find useEffect without dependencies
    - id: missing_deps
      type: grep
      pattern: "useEffect\\([^)]+\\)\\s*$"
      glob: "**/*.{tsx,jsx}"
  verbosity: locations
```

**Common issues:**

| Anti-pattern | Fix |
|-------------|-----|
| Inline object in props | Extract to constant or useMemo |
| Inline function in props | Wrap in useCallback |
| Large list without key | Add stable key prop |
| useEffect missing deps | Add all used variables to deps array |
| Context re-renders everything | Split context or use state managers |

#### Step 3.3: Check Database Indexes

Missing indexes cause slow queries.

```yaml
precision_read:
  files:
    - path: "prisma/schema.prisma"
      extract: content
  output:
    max_per_item: 500
  verbosity: standard
```

**Validate indexes exist for:**
- Foreign keys (userId, postId, etc.)
- Frequently filtered fields (status, createdAt, published)
- Fields used in WHERE clauses
- Compound indexes for multi-column queries

### Phase 4: Code Quality Review

Code quality affects maintainability and reliability.

#### Step 4.1: Check Type Safety

TypeScript should catch errors at compile time, not runtime.

```yaml
discover:
  queries:
    # Find any types
    - id: any_usage
      type: grep
      pattern: ":\s*any(\\s|;|,|\\))"
      glob: "**/*.{ts,tsx}"
    # Find type assertions (as)
    - id: type_assertions
      type: grep
      pattern: "as (unknown|any|string|number)"
      glob: "**/*.{ts,tsx}"
    # Find non-null assertions (!)
    - id: non_null_assertions
      type: grep
      pattern: "![.;,)\\]]"
      glob: "**/*.{ts,tsx}"
    # Find unsafe member access
    - id: unsafe_access
      type: grep
      pattern: "\\?\\."
      glob: "**/*.{ts,tsx}"
  verbosity: locations
```

**Type safety issues:**

| Issue | Severity | Fix |
|-------|----------|-----|
| `any` type usage | Major | Use proper types or unknown |
| `as any` assertions | Major | Fix the underlying type issue |
| `!` non-null assertion | Minor | Add null checks |
| Missing return types | Minor | Explicitly type function returns |
| Implicit any params | Major | Add parameter types |

#### Step 4.2: Check Error Handling

All async operations and API calls must handle errors.

```yaml
discover:
  queries:
    # Find floating promises
    - id: floating_promises
      type: grep
      pattern: "^\\s+[a-z][a-zA-Z]*\\(.*\\);$"
      glob: "**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}"
    # Find empty catch blocks
    - id: empty_catch
      type: grep
      pattern: "catch.*\\{\\s*\\}"
      glob: "**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}"
    # Find console.error (should use logger)
    - id: console_error
      type: grep
      pattern: "console\\.(error|warn|log)"
      glob: "**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}"
  verbosity: locations
```

**Error handling checklist:**
- [ ] All promises have `.catch()` or `try/catch`
- [ ] Errors are logged with context (user ID, request ID)
- [ ] User-facing errors are sanitized (no stack traces)
- [ ] API errors return proper HTTP status codes
- [ ] Retry logic for transient failures

#### Step 4.3: Check Code Organization

Large files and high complexity make code hard to maintain.

```yaml
precision_exec:
  commands:
    - cmd: "find src -not -path '*/node_modules/*' -not -path '*/dist/*' -name '*.ts' -o -name '*.tsx' -print0 | xargs -0 wc -l | sort -rn | head -20"
  verbosity: standard
```

**Code organization rules:**
- Files should be < 300 lines (exception: generated code)
- Functions should be < 50 lines
- Cyclomatic complexity < 10
- Max nesting depth: 3 levels
- Extract helpers to separate files

### Phase 5: Testing Review

Tests validate correctness and prevent regressions.

#### Step 5.1: Check Test Coverage

Every changed file should have tests.

```yaml
discover:
  queries:
    # Find test files
    - id: test_files
      type: glob
      patterns: ["**/*.test.{ts,tsx}", "**/*.spec.{ts,tsx}"]
    # Find files without tests
    - id: source_files
      type: glob
      patterns: ["src/**/*.{ts,tsx}"]
    # Check test imports
    - id: test_imports
      type: grep
      pattern: "from ['\"].*/(api|lib|components)/"
      glob: "**/*.test.{ts,tsx}"
  verbosity: files_only
```

**Compare source files to test files:**

```javascript
// Pseudo-logic (implement with precision tools)
const sourceFiles = results.source_files.files;
const testFiles = results.test_files.files;
const missingTests = sourceFiles.filter(f => !testFiles.some(t => t.includes(f.replace('.ts', ''))));
```

#### Step 5.2: Check Test Quality

Tests should test behavior, not implementation.

```yaml
discover:
  queries:
    # Find skipped tests
    - id: skipped_tests
      type: grep
      pattern: "(it\\.skip|test\\.skip|describe\\.skip)"
      glob: "**/*.test.{ts,tsx}"
    # Find focused tests (.only)
    - id: focused_tests
      type: grep
      pattern: "(it\\.only|test\\.only|describe\\.only)"
      glob: "**/*.test.{ts,tsx}"
    # Find expect assertions
    - id: assertions
      type: grep
      pattern: "expect\\("
      glob: "**/*.test.{ts,tsx}"
    # Find mock usage
    - id: mocks
      type: grep
      pattern: "(vi\\.mock|jest\\.mock|vi\\.fn)"
      glob: "**/*.test.{ts,tsx}"
  verbosity: locations
```

**Test quality checklist:**
- [ ] No `.skip` or `.only` (should be removed before merge)
- [ ] Each test has at least one assertion
- [ ] Tests have descriptive names ("it should...", "when...then...")
- [ ] Tests are isolated (no shared state)
- [ ] Mocks are used sparingly (prefer real implementations)
- [ ] Edge cases are tested (null, empty, large values)

### Phase 6: Architecture Review

Architecture violations create technical debt.

#### Step 6.1: Check Dependency Direction

Dependencies should flow from outer layers to inner layers.

```yaml
discover:
  queries:
    # Find domain imports in UI
    - id: ui_imports_domain
      type: grep
      pattern: "from ['\"].*/(domain|core|lib)/"
      glob: "src/components/**/*.{ts,tsx}"
    # Find UI imports in domain
    - id: domain_imports_ui
      type: grep
      pattern: "from ['\"].*/(components|pages|app)/"
      glob: "src/domain/**/*.{ts,tsx}"
    # Find circular dependencies
    - id: imports
      type: grep
      pattern: "^import.*from"
      glob: "src/**/*.{ts,tsx}"
  verbosity: locations
```

**Dependency rules:**
- UI components can import hooks, utils, domain logic
- Domain logic should NOT import UI components
- API routes can import domain logic, not UI
- Shared utils should have zero dependencies

#### Step 6.2: Check for Layering Violations

```yaml
discover:
  queries:
    # Database access in components
    - id: db_in_components
      type: grep
      pattern: "(prisma|db\\.(query|execute))"
      glob: "src/components/**/*.{ts,tsx}"
    # Business logic in API routes
    - id: logic_in_routes
      type: grep
      pattern: "export (async )?function (GET|POST)"
      glob: "src/app/api/**/*.ts"
  verbosity: files_only
```

**Read the route handlers to check:**
- Route handlers should be < 30 lines (delegate to services)
- No database queries in components (use server actions or API routes)
- No business logic in routes (extract to service layer)

### Phase 7: Accessibility Review

Accessibility ensures your app is usable by everyone.

#### Step 7.1: Check Semantic HTML

Use proper HTML elements for accessibility.

```yaml
discover:
  queries:
    # Find div buttons (should be <button>)
    - id: div_buttons
      type: grep
      pattern: "<div.*(onClick|onKeyDown)"
      glob: "**/*.{tsx,jsx}"
    # Find missing alt text
    - id: missing_alt
      type: grep
      pattern: "<img(?![^>]*alt=)"
      glob: "**/*.{tsx,jsx}"
    # Find missing labels
    - id: missing_labels
      type: grep
      pattern: "<input(?![^>]*aria-label)(?![^>]*id=)"
      glob: "**/*.{tsx,jsx}"
    # Find missing ARIA roles
    - id: missing_roles
      type: grep
      pattern: "<(nav|header|footer|main)(?![^>]*role=)"
      glob: "**/*.{tsx,jsx}"
  verbosity: locations
```

**Accessibility checklist:**
- [ ] Buttons use `<button>`, not `<div onClick>`
- [ ] Images have descriptive `alt` text
- [ ] Form inputs have labels or `aria-label`
- [ ] Focus states are visible (no `outline: none` without replacement)
- [ ] Color contrast meets WCAG AA (4.5:1 for text)
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works (tab order, Enter/Space)

#### Step 7.2: Check ARIA Patterns

```yaml
discover:
  queries:
    # Find custom components
    - id: custom_components
      type: grep
      pattern: "(Accordion|Dialog|Dropdown|Tabs|Tooltip)"
      glob: "src/components/**/*.{tsx,jsx}"
  verbosity: files_only
```

**Read components to validate:**
- Modals trap focus and close on Escape
- Dropdowns support arrow keys
- Tabs support arrow keys and Home/End
- Tooltips are accessible (not just on hover)

### Phase 8: Review Scoring

Use the **review-scoring** skill to provide structured feedback.

See `plugins/goodvibes/skills/protocol/review-scoring/SKILL.md` for the full rubric.

**The 10 Dimensions (weighted):**

1. **Correctness** (15%) - Does it work? Does it meet requirements?
2. **Type Safety** (10%) - Proper TypeScript usage, no `any`
3. **Security** (15%) - No vulnerabilities, input validation, auth checks
4. **Performance** (10%) - No N+1 queries, proper indexes, memoization
5. **Error Handling** (10%) - All errors caught, logged, and handled
6. **Testing** (10%) - Adequate test coverage, quality assertions
7. **Code Quality** (10%) - Readable, maintainable, follows patterns
8. **Architecture** (10%) - Proper layering, no violations
9. **Accessibility** (5%) - Semantic HTML, ARIA, keyboard nav
10. **Documentation** (5%) - JSDoc, README, inline comments where needed

**Score each dimension 1-10:**
- 1-3: Needs major work
- 4-6: Needs improvement
- 7-8: Good, minor issues
- 9-10: Excellent

**Overall score = weighted average**

Pass/fail thresholds:
- **9.5+**: Excellent (approve immediately)
- **8.0-9.4**: Good (approve with minor suggestions)
- **7.0-7.9**: Acceptable (request changes - minor issues)
- **5.0-6.9**: Needs work (request changes - major issues)
- **< 5.0**: Reject (needs significant rework)

### Phase 9: Automated Validation

Run automated checks to catch issues.

```yaml
precision_exec:
  commands:
    # Type check
    - cmd: "npm run typecheck"
    # Lint
    - cmd: "npm run lint"
    # Tests
    - cmd: "npm run test"
    # Security audit
    - cmd: "npm audit --audit-level=moderate"
  verbosity: standard
```

**All checks must pass before approval.**

### Phase 10: Provide Feedback

Structured feedback is actionable and specific.

**Review output format:**

```markdown
## Review Summary

**Overall Score**: 8.2/10
**Verdict**: APPROVE with suggestions

**What changed**: Added user profile API with authentication
**Files reviewed**: 8 files (5 source, 3 test)

## Dimension Scores

1. Correctness: 9/10
2. Type Safety: 7/10
3. Security: 9/10
4. Performance: 8/10
5. Error Handling: 7/10
6. Testing: 8/10
7. Code Quality: 9/10
8. Architecture: 8/10
9. Accessibility: 8/10
10. Documentation: 7/10

## Issues Found

### Major (should fix)

- **FILE:LINE** - Type safety: Function `updateProfile` has implicit `any` return type
  - Fix: Add explicit return type `Promise<User>`
  - Impact: TypeScript can't catch type errors in callers

### Minor (nice to fix)

- **src/api/profile.ts:42** - Error handling: Empty catch block swallows errors
  - Fix: Log error with context before re-throwing
  - Impact: Makes debugging harder

## What Was Done Well

- Excellent input validation with Zod schemas
- Comprehensive test coverage (95%)
- Proper authentication checks on all routes
- Clean separation of concerns (route -> service -> repository)
```

**Feedback guidelines:**

- Be specific: Include file path and line number
- Be actionable: Explain exactly how to fix
- Explain impact: Why does this matter?
- Acknowledge good work: Highlight what was done well
- Categorize by severity: Critical > Major > Minor

## Common Review Patterns

See `references/review-patterns.md` for detailed anti-patterns organized by category.

**Quick reference:**

### Security Patterns

- SQL injection: String concatenation in queries
- XSS: Unsafe HTML rendering
- Auth bypass: Missing auth checks
- Secrets exposure: Hardcoded API keys

### Performance Patterns

- N+1 queries: Loops with database calls
- Missing indexes: WHERE clauses without indexes
- Unnecessary re-renders: Inline objects in React
- Memory leaks: Event listeners not cleaned up

### Code Quality Patterns

- Type unsafety: `any` types, type assertions
- Error handling: Floating promises, empty catches
- Complexity: Functions > 50 lines, nesting > 3
- Duplication: Copy-paste code

### Testing Patterns

- Missing tests: Changed files without tests
- Poor assertions: `expect(result).toBeTruthy()`
- Test pollution: Shared state between tests
- Skipped tests: `.skip` or `.only` left in

## Precision Tools for Review

### Discover Tool

Run multiple grep/glob queries in parallel to find patterns.

**Example: Find security issues**

```yaml
discover:
  queries:
    - id: sql_injection
      type: grep
      pattern: 'query.*\$\{'
    - id: hardcoded_secrets
      type: grep
      pattern: 'api[_-]?key\s*=\s*["''][^"'']+'
    - id: xss
      type: grep
      pattern: 'dangerouslySetInnerHTML'
  verbosity: locations
```

### Precision Grep

Search with context, multiline support, and token limits.

**Example: Find error handling**

```yaml
precision_grep:
  queries:
    - id: catch_blocks
      pattern: "try\\s*\\{[\\s\\S]*?\\}\\s*catch"
  output:
    format: context
    context_after: 3
    context_before: 1
  verbosity: standard
```

### Precision Exec

Run validation commands.

```yaml
precision_exec:
  commands:
    - cmd: "npm run typecheck"
    - cmd: "npm run lint"
    - cmd: "npm test -- --coverage"
  verbosity: standard
```

## Validation Script

Use `scripts/validate-code-review.sh` to validate review completeness.

```bash
./scripts/validate-code-review.sh /path/to/review-output.md
```

**The script checks:**
- Security patterns were checked
- Performance patterns were checked
- Test coverage was reviewed
- All changed files were reviewed
- Review includes scoring with rubric
- Feedback is specific with file/line references

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Score inflation:**
- Don't give 9-10 scores when issues exist
- Be honest about quality gaps
- Critical issues should fail review

**Vague feedback:**
- BAD: "Fix the types"
- GOOD: "src/api/user.ts:42 - Add return type `Promise<User>` to function `getUser`"

**Ignoring positives:**
- Always acknowledge what was done well
- Positive feedback motivates improvement

**Inconsistent severity:**
- Security issues are always Critical
- Missing tests are Major, not Minor
- Style issues are Minor, not Major

## Advanced Techniques

### Batch Review with Discover

Review multiple PRs or files in parallel.

```yaml
discover:
  queries:
    - id: all_changes
      type: grep
      pattern: ".*"
      path: "src/"
  verbosity: files_only
```

Then read files in batch:

```yaml
precision_read:
  files:
    - path: "src/changed-file-1.ts"
    - path: "src/changed-file-2.ts"
  extract: content
  output:
    max_per_item: 100
  verbosity: standard
```

### Contextual Review

Use `precision_grep` with context to understand surrounding code.

```yaml
precision_grep:
  queries:
    - id: auth_checks
      pattern: "getServerSession|auth\\(\\)"
  output:
    format: context
    context_before: 5
    context_after: 10
  verbosity: standard
```

### Differential Review

Focus on changed lines only.

```yaml
precision_exec:
  commands:
    - cmd: "git diff HEAD~1..HEAD --unified=5"
  verbosity: standard
```

Parse the diff and review only changed sections.

### Automated Pattern Detection

Create a batch of security/performance checks.

```yaml
discover:
  queries:
    # Security
    - { id: sql_injection, type: grep, pattern: 'query.*\$\{' }
    - { id: xss, type: grep, pattern: 'dangerouslySetInnerHTML' }
    - { id: secrets, type: grep, pattern: 'password\s*=\s*["''][^"'']+' }
    # Performance
    - { id: n_plus_one, type: grep, pattern: 'for.*await.*prisma' }
    - { id: inline_objects, type: grep, pattern: 'onClick=\{\{', glob: '**/*.tsx' }
    # Quality
    - { id: any_usage, type: grep, pattern: ':\s*any', glob: '**/*.ts' }
    - { id: empty_catch, type: grep, pattern: 'catch.*\{\s*\}' }
  verbosity: locations
```

**Aggregate results and score based on findings.**
