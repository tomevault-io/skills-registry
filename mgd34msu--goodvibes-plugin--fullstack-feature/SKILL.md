# Fullstack Feature Orchestration

This skill defines the end-to-end workflow for implementing complete features that span multiple layers of the stack. It orchestrates specialized agents through 7 distinct phases, from requirements clarification through delivery.

## When to Use This Skill

Use fullstack-feature when the user requests:

- A complete feature that requires database, API, and UI changes
- End-to-end implementation with testing and review
- A new user-facing capability that touches multiple components
- Anything described as: "build X", "add X feature", "implement X capability"

**Do NOT use this skill for:**
- Single-layer changes (just API, just UI)
- Bug fixes (use bugfix or hotfix skills)
- Code review only (use review-scoring skill)
- Refactoring without new functionality

## Overview

The fullstack feature workflow consists of 7 phases:

1. **Understand** - Clarify requirements, load skills, identify affected layers
2. **Foundation** (sequential) - Database schema/migrations, type generation
3. **Core Implementation** (parallel) - API endpoints, UI components, state management
4. **Integration** (sequential) - Wire UI to API, state to UI, verify data flow
5. **Quality** (parallel) - Tests, security check, accessibility check
6. **Review** (runtime-driven) - WRFC chains from prior phases complete via runtime `<gv>` directives
7. **Commit + Log** - Triggered when runtime issues `complete` directives; git commit, update memory/logs, report to user

## Runtime Engine and WRFC Chains

The runtime engine automatically creates a WRFC (Work-Review-Fix-Complete) chain for each work agent. When an agent completes its work and emits a `<gv>` tag, the runtime:

1. Evaluates the output against the configured `score_threshold` (default: 9.5 from `goodvibes.json`)
2. Issues directives to the orchestrator via system messages
3. Orchestrator executes those directives mechanically

**Directive types:**
```json
{"action":"spawn","wid":"wrfc_xxx","type":"reviewer","task":"Review the code..."}
{"action":"spawn","wid":"wrfc_xxx","type":"engineer","task":"Fix the issues..."}
{"action":"complete","wid":"wrfc_xxx"}
{"action":"escalate","wid":"wrfc_xxx","reason":"Max fix attempts reached"}
```

**Directive compliance rules (absolute):**
1. **Immediate**: Execute directives the moment they arrive. NEVER defer, queue, or delay.
2. **First**: Execute directives BEFORE any other action. No intervening tool calls, no additional agent spawns, no user messages first.
3. **Autonomy ends**: Once the first directive arrives for a WRFC chain, the orchestrator has no further judgment over that chain. Only directives drive it.
4. **Runtime supersedes**: Runtime workflow logic ALWAYS supersedes orchestrator judgment. If a directive says review, review. If it says complete, complete.

The orchestrator does NOT manually spawn reviewers or fix agents. These come exclusively from runtime directives.

## Phase 1: Understand

### Purpose

Ensure you have complete clarity on what to build before spawning work agents. This phase prevents wasted effort from misunderstandings.

### Steps

1. **Clarify requirements** with the user:
   - What is the exact functionality requested?
   - Who are the users and what are their goals?
   - What are the acceptance criteria (how do we know it's done)?
   - Are there specific constraints (performance, accessibility, browser support)?
   - Are there existing patterns to follow or avoid?

2. **Identify affected layers**:
   - Database: New tables/columns? Migrations?
   - API: New endpoints? Modify existing?
   - Types: New type definitions?
   - UI: New components? Modify existing?
   - State: New state management?
   - Tests: Unit, integration, e2e?

3. **Load relevant outcome skills**:
   - Backend: `trpc`, `prisma`, `postgresql`, `clerk`, `nextauth`, `graphql`, `rest-api-design`
   - Frontend: `nextjs`, `react`, `tailwindcss`, `shadcn-ui`, `framer-motion`
   - Protocol: `gather-plan-apply`, `review-scoring`, `goodvibes-memory`

4. **Check goodvibes memory**:
   - `.goodvibes/memory/decisions.json` - Architectural choices
   - `.goodvibes/memory/patterns.json` - Coding patterns
   - `.goodvibes/memory/failures.json` - Past failures to avoid

5. **Create implementation plan**:
   - Decompose feature into sub-tasks
   - Identify dependencies between sub-tasks
   - Estimate scope (how many files/components)
   - Map sub-tasks to phases (Foundation, Core, Integration)

### Output

At the end of Phase 1, you must have:

- **Requirements document** (in memory/current-task.md)
- **Affected layers list** (database, API, UI, tests)
- **Implementation plan** (decomposed sub-tasks with dependencies)
- **Loaded skills** (relevant outcome skills available)

### Mode-Specific Behavior

**Vibecoding**: Confirm with user before proceeding to Phase 2.
**Justvibes**: Auto-proceed if requirements are clear. (Pause for clarification if ambiguous.)

## Phase 2: Foundation (Sequential)

### Purpose

Establish the data model and type foundation before building any upstream code. This ensures type safety and consistency across layers.

### Steps

1. **Database schema** (if required):
   - Spawn database agent to design schema
   - Create migration files
   - Run migrations (dev environment)
   - Verify migration success

2. **Type generation** (if using Prisma/Drizzle/etc):
   - Run ORM type generation command
   - Verify types are generated
   - Commit generated types (if necessary)

3. **Shared type definitions** (if not using ORM):
   - Create `src/types/[...].ts` files
   - Define entities, DTOs, request/response types
   - Export from barrel `index.ts`

### Agent Instructions

**Database agent**:

Protocol skills (required for all agents): gather-plan-apply, precision-mastery, error-recovery, goodvibes-memory

- Use `gather-plan-apply` protocol
- Follow existing schema patterns (check memory/decisions.json)
- Add appropriate indexes for query performance
- Add foreign key constraints
- Use timestamps (`createdAt`, `updatedAt`)
- Test migration before completing

**Engineer agent (type generation)**:

Protocol skills (required for all agents): gather-plan-apply, precision-mastery, error-recovery, goodvibes-memory

- Run type generation command
- Verify types are correct (spot check generated code)
- Run `tsc` to confirm no type errors

### Clear Definition of Done

- Database schema exists, migrations applied
- Types generated and exported
- `npm run typecheck` passes
- All files committed

### Mode-Specific Behavior

**Vibecoding**: Checkpoint after this phase. Commit with message `checkpoint: foundation - schema and types`.
**Justvibes**: Auto-proceed to Phase 3.

## Phase 3: Core Implementation (Parallel)

### Purpose

Implement the main functionality across API and UI layers in parallel. This maximizes throughput and minimizes wait time.

### Sub-Phases

These sub-phases run in parallel:

1. **API endpoints** (API agent)
2. **UI components** (UI agent)
3. **State management** (State agent)

### Agent Instructions

**API agent**:

Protocol skills (required for all agents): gather-plan-apply, precision-mastery, error-recovery, goodvibes-memory

- Implement endpoints using existing patterns (check decisions.json for API style)
- Add input validation (use Zod or similar)
- Add error handling
- Add authentication/authorization checks
- Use ORM for database access
- Add logging at appropriate levels
- Use `gather-plan-apply` protocol

**UI agent**:

Protocol skills (required for all agents): gather-plan-apply, precision-mastery, error-recovery, goodvibes-memory

- Create components using existing patterns (check decisions.json for UI libraries)
- Follow accessibility best practices (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation)
- Implement responsive design
- Add loading and error states
- Optimize performance (`useMemo`, `useCallback`)
- Use `gather-plan-apply` protocol

**State agent**:

Protocol skills (required for all agents): gather-plan-apply, precision-mastery, error-recovery, goodvibes-memory

- Implement state management using existing patterns (Zustand, Redux, etc)
- Define state shape and actions
- Add selectors for derived state
- Add persistence if required (localStorage, sessionStorage)
- Use `gather-plan-apply` protocol

### Clear Definition of Done

- All API endpoints implemented and validated
- All UI components created
- State management implemented
- `npm run typecheck` passes
- `npm run lint` passes
- All files committed

### Mode-Specific Behavior

**Vibecoding**: Checkpoint after this phase. Commit with message `checkpoint: core implementation`.
**Justvibes**: Auto-proceed to Phase 4.

## Phase 4: Integration (Sequential)

### Purpose

Connect UI to API, wire state to UI, and verify data flows end-to-end. This phase must be sequential because it depends on Phase 3 completion.

### Steps

1. **Wire UI to API**:
   - Add API client calls to components
   - Handle loading states during API calls
   - Handle error states from API
   - Display API responses in UI

2. **Wire state to UI**:
   - Connect state management to components
   - Use selectors to access state
   - Dispatch actions on user interactions
   - Verify UI updates when state changes

3. **End-to-end verification**:
   - Manually test data flow: UI -> API -> Database -> API -> UI
   - Confirm loading states appear
   - Confirm error states appear on failure
   - Confirm success states appear on success

4. **Fix integration issues**:
   - Fix type mismatches between UI and API
   - Fix data mapping issues
   - Fix state synchronization issues

### Agent Instructions

**Integration agent**:

Protocol skills (required for all agents): gather-plan-apply, precision-mastery, error-recovery, goodvibes-memory

- Read both API and UI code to understand interfaces
- Add API client calls in correct lifecycle hooks (`useEffect`, event handlers)
- Ensure error handling is present
- Ensure loading states are displayed
- Test each integration point manually
- Use `gather-plan-apply` protocol

### Clear Definition of Done

- UI components can call API endpoints
- Data flows from UI -> API -> DB -> API -> UI
- State works correctly
- Loading states display
- Error states display
- `npm run typecheck` passes
- All files committed

### Mode-Specific Behavior

**Vibecoding**: Checkpoint after this phase. Commit with message `checkpoint: integration`.
**Justvibes**: Auto-proceed to Phase 5.

## Phase 5: Quality (Parallel)

### Purpose

Verify the implementation meets quality standards across multiple dimensions. These checks run in parallel. Each spawned agent will have its own WRFC chain managed by the runtime engine.

### Sub-Phases

These sub-phases run in parallel:

1. **Tests** (Tester agent)
2. **Security check** (Security agent)
3. **Accessibility check** (A11y agent)

### Agent Instructions

**Tester agent**:

Protocol skills (required for all agents): gather-plan-apply, precision-mastery, error-recovery, goodvibes-memory

- Write unit tests for API endpoints
- Write component tests for UI
- Write integration tests for data flow
- Target >=80% coverage for new code
- Test both happy path and edge cases
- Use `gather-plan-apply` protocol

**Security agent**:

Protocol skills (required for all agents): gather-plan-apply, precision-mastery, error-recovery, goodvibes-memory

- Check for input validation on all endpoints
- Check for authentication/authorization checks
- Check for SQL injection vulnerabilities
- Check for XSS vulnerabilities
- Check for exposed secrets
- Check for CORS configuration
- Use `gather-plan-apply` protocol

**A11y agent**:

Protocol skills (required for all agents): gather-plan-apply, precision-mastery, error-recovery, goodvibes-memory

- Check for ARIA attributes on interactive elements
- Check for keyboard navigation support
- Check for color contrast (WCAG AA)
- Check for focus indicators
- Check for alt text on images
- Use `gather-plan-apply` protocol

### Clear Definition of Done

- Tests written and passing
- Security check complete (no critical issues)
- Accessibility check complete (no critical issues)
- All files committed

### Mode-Specific Behavior

**Vibecoding**: Checkpoint after this phase. Commit with message `checkpoint: quality checks`.
**Justvibes**: Auto-proceed; runtime handles review cycles.

## Phase 6: Review (Runtime-Driven)

### Purpose

Ensure all code meets production standards through systematic review and fix. The runtime engine manages this phase automatically via `<gv>` directives.

### How It Works

The orchestrator does NOT manually spawn reviewers. Instead:

1. Each work agent from Phases 2-5 completes and emits a `<gv>` tag
2. The runtime engine evaluates the output and issues directives:
   - If review is needed: `{"action":"spawn","type":"reviewer","task":"..."}`
   - If fixes are needed after review: `{"action":"spawn","type":"engineer","task":"Fix: ..."}`
   - If the score meets `score_threshold` (configured in `goodvibes.json`): `{"action":"complete"}`
   - If `max_fix_attempts` is exhausted: `{"action":"escalate","reason":"..."}`
3. The orchestrator executes each directive immediately and mechanically

### Orchestrator Behavior

- On `spawn` directive: spawn the specified agent with the provided task prompt
- On `complete` directive: mark the chain done, proceed to Phase 7 when all chains complete
- On `escalate` directive: report to user with the escalation reason; do not attempt to fix the chain manually

### Clear Definition of Done

- All WRFC chains have received `complete` directives from the runtime
- No chains are pending escalation resolution

### Mode-Specific Behavior

Both vibecoding and justvibes modes follow directives identically. The runtime engine determines when review cycles end. The orchestrator has no mode-specific behavior in this phase beyond executing directives.

## Phase 7: Commit + Log

### Purpose

Finalize the feature by committing to git and updating project memory. This phase is triggered when the runtime issues `complete` directives for all WRFC chains from Phases 2-5.

### Steps

1. **Create git commit**:
   - Stage all new/modified files
   - Write clear commit message (follow existing conventions)
   - Include `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>`
   - Commit

2. **Update goodvibes memory**:
   - Add to `.goodvibes/memory/patterns.json` (if new patterns emerged)
   - Add to `.goodvibes/memory/decisions.json` (if new decisions made)
   - Use `goodvibes-memory` skill

3. **Update goodvibes logs**:
   - Log feature completion to `.goodvibes/logs/tasks.jsonl`
   - Include feature name, files changed, final score
   - Use `goodvibes-memory` skill

4. **Report to user**:
   - Summarize what was built
   - List files created/modified
   - List commit SHA
   - Provide next steps (if any)

### Clear Definition of Done

- All files committed to git
- Memory updated
- Logs updated
- User report provided

### Mode-Specific Behavior

**Vibecoding**: Confirm commit message with user before committing.
**Justvibes**: Auto-commit with generated message.

## Mode-Specific Behavior

### Vibecoding Mode

Vibecoding mode is collaborative. The orchestrator:

- **Confirms** after Phase 1 (Understand) before proceeding
- **Checkpoints** after Phases 2, 3, 4, 5 (creates git commits)
- **Confirms** commit message before final commit in Phase 7
- Pauses for approval if uncertainties arise

Once agents are spawned, the runtime engine drives WRFC chains automatically. The orchestrator executes directives mechanically regardless of mode.

Checkpoint commit messages:
- `checkpoint: foundation - schema and types`
- `checkpoint: core implementation`
- `checkpoint: integration`
- `checkpoint: quality checks`

### Justvibes Mode

Justvibes mode is autonomous. The orchestrator:

- **Auto-proceeds** through all phases without user input
- Pauses only if requirements are ambiguous or critical decisions are needed
- Auto-commits in Phase 7 (generates commit message)

The runtime engine manages all WRFC cycles in both modes identically.

## Agent Orchestration Patterns

### Sequential Phases

Phases 2, 4, 7 must be sequential:

- **Phase 2 (Foundation)**: Must complete before Phase 3 because API/UI code depends on types
- **Phase 4 (Integration)**: Must come after Phase 3 because it connects API+UI
- **Phase 7 (Commit+Log)**: Must be last; triggered by `complete` directives for all chains

### Parallel Phases

Phases 3 and 5 spawn multiple agents in parallel:

- **Phase 3 (Core)**: API agent, UI agent, State agent run in parallel
- **Phase 5 (Quality)**: Tester agent, Security agent, A11y agent run in parallel

All agents in a parallel phase must receive `complete` directives before proceeding to the next phase.

### Agent Communication

Agents should NOT communicate directly. Instead:

- Agents write results to filesystem
- Orchestrator reads agent outputs
- Orchestrator passes relevant info to next agents

## Integration with Other Protocols

### Gather-Plan-Apply (GPA)

All work agents must follow the GPA loop:

1. **Discover**: Use `discover` tool to run parallel grep/glob/symbol queries
2. **Plan**: Identify files to create/modify, order of operations, batch opportunities
3. **Batch**: Group operations into batched precision_engine calls
4. **Loop**: Return to discovery if assumptions change

See `gather-plan-apply` skill for details.

### Review-Scoring (WRFC)

The runtime engine uses the review-scoring rubric internally when spawning reviewers. The orchestrator does not score code directly. Review thresholds are configured in `goodvibes.json` (`score_threshold`, `max_fix_attempts`).

See `review-scoring` skill for details on what the reviewer agent does.

### Goodvibes Memory

Use `goodvibes-memory` skill to:

- Read `.goodvibes/memory/{decisions,patterns,failures}.json` in Phase 1
- Write to `.goodvibes/logs/tasks.jsonl` in Phase 7
- Update memory files with new patterns/decisions in Phase 7

## Common Pitfalls

### Starting Implementation Too Early

Do not spawn work agents until Phase 1 is complete. Clarify requirements first.

### Parallelizing Sequential Phases

Do not run Phases 2 and 3 in parallel. Phase 3 depends on Phase 2 types.

### Skipping Quality Phase

Do not skip Phase 5. Tests are not optional. Security is not optional.

### Manually Scheduling Reviewers

Do not add reviewer tasks to Phase 6 manually. The runtime engine issues reviewer spawn directives automatically when each work agent completes. Manual scheduling bypasses the runtime's threshold enforcement.

### Deferring Directives

Do not defer, reorder, or skip `<gv>` directives. Execute them immediately as the first action when received.

### Committing Without All Chains Complete

Do not commit in Phase 7 until all WRFC chains have received `complete` directives. Partial completions are not done.

### Forgetting to Update Memory

Do not skip memory updates in Phase 7. Future agents rely on this context.

## Validation

Use `scripts/validate-feature-workflow.sh` to verify your orchestration follows this workflow. See `references/phase-templates.md` for detailed templates and examples.
