# Review Scoring Protocol

This skill defines the precise scoring rubric and review format used in Work-Review-Fix-Check (WRFC) loops. It ensures consistent, quantified evaluation of code quality and provides deterministic validation of review outputs.

## Scoring Rubric (1-10 Scale)

Every review evaluates code across 10 dimensions. Each dimension receives a score from 1 to 10, where:

- **1-3**: Critical deficiencies, fundamental issues
- **4-5**: Significant problems, below acceptable standards
- **6-7**: Acceptable but with notable issues
- **8-9**: Good quality with minor issues
- **10**: Exceptional, production-ready

### The 10 Dimensions

#### 1. Correctness (Weight: 20%)
Does the code work as intended?

**Scoring criteria:**
- **10**: Logic is flawless, all edge cases handled, null/undefined checks present, no off-by-one errors
- **7-9**: Minor edge cases missed, some defensive checks could be added
- **4-6**: Logic errors in common paths, missing null checks, incorrect conditionals
- **1-3**: Fundamental logic errors, crashes on common inputs, broken core functionality

**Common issues:**
- Missing null/undefined checks
- Off-by-one errors in loops/arrays
- Incorrect boolean logic
- Race conditions in async code
- Unhandled promise rejections

#### 2. Completeness (Weight: 15%)
Is everything implemented fully?

**Scoring criteria:**
- **10**: Feature fully implemented, no TODOs, no placeholders, no commented-out code
- **7-9**: Minor TODO comments for future enhancements (not core functionality)
- **4-6**: Core features stubbed out, placeholder implementations, missing critical paths
- **1-3**: Mostly placeholders, incomplete implementation, major features missing

**Common issues:**
- TODO comments in production code
- Placeholder functions returning hardcoded values
- Missing error states
- Incomplete form validation
- Mock data instead of real API calls

#### 3. Security (Weight: 15%)
Are vulnerabilities prevented?

**Scoring criteria:**
- **10**: Input validated, auth checked, secrets not exposed, injection-safe, CORS configured
- **7-9**: Minor security hardening opportunities (rate limiting, additional logging)
- **4-6**: Missing input validation, auth checks bypassed in some paths, secrets in code
- **1-3**: Critical vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, exposed credentials, no auth)

**Common issues:**
- Secrets hardcoded or committed to git
- Missing authentication checks
- SQL injection via string concatenation
- XSS via innerHTML or dangerouslySetInnerHTML
- CORS set to `*` in production
- Missing CSRF protection
- Sensitive data in client-side code

#### 4. Performance (Weight: 10%)
Is it efficient?

**Scoring criteria:**
- **10**: No N+1 queries, appropriate indexes, caching where needed, optimized re-renders
- **7-9**: Minor optimization opportunities (memoization, lazy loading)
- **4-6**: N+1 queries present, missing indexes, unnecessary re-renders
- **1-3**: Severe performance issues (blocking operations, memory leaks, infinite loops)

**Common issues:**
- N+1 database queries
- Missing database indexes
- Unnecessary React re-renders (missing useMemo/useCallback)
- Large bundle sizes (missing code splitting)
- Synchronous operations blocking event loop
- Memory leaks (event listeners not cleaned up)

#### 5. Conventions (Weight: 10%)
Does it follow project patterns?

**Scoring criteria:**
- **10**: Matches existing naming, file structure, import ordering, code style
- **7-9**: Minor style inconsistencies (formatting, import order)
- **4-6**: Different naming conventions, wrong file locations, inconsistent patterns
- **1-3**: Completely ignores project conventions, introduces conflicting patterns

**Common issues:**
- Inconsistent naming (camelCase vs snake_case)
- Wrong file locations (components in utils/)
- Import ordering violations
- Mixing tabs and spaces
- Different error handling patterns than rest of codebase

#### 6. Testability (Weight: 10%)
Are tests present and meaningful?

**Scoring criteria:**
- **10**: Comprehensive tests, edge cases covered, meaningful assertions, high coverage
- **7-9**: Tests exist but miss some edge cases or have weak assertions
- **4-6**: Minimal tests, only happy path, no edge cases
- **1-3**: No tests or tests that don't verify behavior

**Common issues:**
- No tests at all
- Tests only for happy path
- Tests with no assertions (smoke tests only)
- Missing edge case coverage
- Brittle tests tied to implementation details

#### 7. Readability (Weight: 5%)
Is it easy to understand?

**Scoring criteria:**
- **10**: Clear naming, appropriate abstraction, complex logic explained, self-documenting
- **7-9**: Mostly clear, a few cryptic variable names or unexplained complex logic
- **4-6**: Poor naming, overly complex, lacks comments where needed
- **1-3**: Incomprehensible, single-letter variables, deeply nested, no explanation

**Common issues:**
- Single-letter variable names (except loop counters)
- Functions over 50 lines
- Nesting over 4 levels deep
- Cryptic abbreviations
- Complex logic without explanatory comments

#### 8. Error Handling (Weight: 5%)
Are errors handled gracefully?

**Scoring criteria:**
- **10**: All errors caught, logged appropriately, user-facing messages clear, no silent failures
- **7-9**: Errors caught but logging could be improved, some generic messages
- **4-6**: Some try/catch blocks missing, silent failures, poor error messages
- **1-3**: No error handling, crashes on errors, no user feedback

**Common issues:**
- Empty catch blocks (silent failures)
- Generic error messages ("Something went wrong")
- Errors not logged
- Unhandled promise rejections
- No user-facing error states

#### 9. Type Safety (Weight: 5%)
Are types correct and comprehensive?

**Scoring criteria:**
- **10**: Types accurate, no `any`, generics used appropriately, strict mode enabled
- **7-9**: Mostly typed, a few `any` types with TODO comments to fix
- **4-6**: Many `any` types, type assertions without validation, loose typing
- **1-3**: TypeScript disabled, `any` everywhere, type assertions hiding errors

**Common issues:**
- Excessive use of `any`
- Type assertions (`as`) without runtime validation
- Missing return type annotations
- Incorrect generic constraints
- Disabling strict mode

#### 10. Integration (Weight: 5%)
Does it work with existing code?

**Scoring criteria:**
- **10**: Integrates seamlessly, doesn't break existing features, follows API contracts
- **7-9**: Minor integration points need adjustment
- **4-6**: Breaks existing features, violates API contracts, requires large changes elsewhere
- **1-3**: Incompatible with existing systems, breaks multiple features

**Common issues:**
- Breaking changes to public APIs
- Incompatible with existing auth flow
- Breaks other features (regression)
- Doesn't use shared utilities (reinvents wheel)
- Conflicts with existing state management

## Overall Score Calculation

The overall score is a weighted average of the 10 dimensions:

```
Overall = (Correctness x 0.20) + 
          (Completeness x 0.15) + 
          (Security x 0.15) + 
          (Performance x 0.10) + 
          (Conventions x 0.10) + 
          (Testability x 0.10) + 
          (Readability x 0.05) + 
          (Error Handling x 0.05) + 
          (Type Safety x 0.05) + 
          (Integration x 0.05)
```

**Example:**
```
Correctness: 9
Completeness: 8
Security: 10
Performance: 7
Conventions: 9
Testability: 6
Readability: 8
Error Handling: 7
Type Safety: 9
Integration: 9

Overall = (9x0.20) + (8x0.15) + (10x0.15) + (7x0.10) + (9x0.10) + 
          (6x0.10) + (8x0.05) + (7x0.05) + (9x0.05) + (9x0.05)
        = 1.8 + 1.2 + 1.5 + 0.7 + 0.9 + 0.6 + 0.4 + 0.35 + 0.45 + 0.45
        = 8.35/10
```

## Pass/Fail Thresholds

The overall score determines the verdict:

| Score Range | Verdict | Action Required |
|-------------|---------|----------------|
| **>= 9.5** | PASS | Ship it -- production ready |
| **8.0-9.49** | CONDITIONAL PASS | Minor issues -- fix and re-check (8.0 is inclusive, no full re-review) |
| **6.0-7.9** | FAIL | Significant issues -- fix and full re-review required |
| **Below 6.0** | FAIL | Major rework needed -- fix and full re-review required |

**Critical dimension rule**: If any dimension scores below 4, the overall verdict is automatically FAIL regardless of the calculated score.

## Required Review Output Format

Every review MUST produce this exact structure. Validation scripts check for these sections.

```markdown
## Review Summary
- **Overall Score**: X.X/10
- **Verdict**: PASS | CONDITIONAL PASS | FAIL
- **Files Reviewed**: [list of files]

## Dimension Scores
| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Correctness | X/10 | [specific findings] |
| Completeness | X/10 | [specific findings] |
| Security | X/10 | [specific findings] |
| Performance | X/10 | [specific findings] |
| Conventions | X/10 | [specific findings] |
| Testability | X/10 | [specific findings] |
| Readability | X/10 | [specific findings] |
| Error Handling | X/10 | [specific findings] |
| Type Safety | X/10 | [specific findings] |
| Integration | X/10 | [specific findings] |

## Issues Found

### Critical (must fix)
- [FILE:LINE] Description of issue. Fix: [specific fix]
- [FILE:LINE] Description of issue. Fix: [specific fix]

### Major (should fix)
- [FILE:LINE] Description of issue. Fix: [specific fix]
- [FILE:LINE] Description of issue. Fix: [specific fix]

### Minor (nice to fix)
- [FILE:LINE] Description of issue. Fix: [specific fix]
- [FILE:LINE] Description of issue. Fix: [specific fix]

## What Was Done Well
- [specific positive observation with file reference]
- [specific positive observation with file reference]
```

### Format Requirements

1. **Overall score**: Must be numeric (X.X/10 format, one decimal place)
2. **Verdict**: Must exactly match one of: PASS, CONDITIONAL PASS, FAIL
3. **Dimension scores**: All 10 dimensions present with X/10 format, notes must contain specific findings (not generic phrases like "looks good")
4. **Issue categorization**: Every issue must be in Critical/Major/Minor category
5. **FILE:LINE references**: Every issue must reference specific file and line number
6. **Fix suggestions**: Every issue must include specific fix guidance (what to change, how to change it, example code)
7. **What Was Done Well**: Must be present with at least one positive observation

### Issue Severity Guidelines

**Critical**: Must be fixed before shipping. Examples:
- Security vulnerabilities
- Data corruption bugs
- Authentication bypasses
- Crashes on common inputs
- Exposed secrets

**Major**: Should be fixed before shipping. Examples:
- Performance issues (N+1 queries)
- Missing error handling on important paths
- Accessibility violations
- Type safety violations (excessive `any`)
- Convention violations that affect maintainability

**Minor**: Nice to fix but not blockers. Examples:
- Suboptimal naming
- Missing comments on complex logic
- Minor style inconsistencies
- Opportunities for refactoring
- Weak test assertions

**Note**: Severity can depend on system risk context (e.g., performance issue may be Critical in high-scale systems).

## Fix Agent Requirements

When a fix agent receives a review with issues:

### Must Fix
1. **ALL Critical issues** -- No exceptions
2. **ALL Major issues** -- No exceptions
3. **Minor issues** -- Unless explicitly deprioritized by orchestrator

### Must Document
After applying fixes, the fix agent must produce:

```markdown
## Fixes Applied

### Critical Issues Addressed
- [FILE:LINE] [Original issue] -> Fixed by: [what was changed]
- [FILE:LINE] [Original issue] -> Fixed by: [what was changed]

### Major Issues Addressed
- [FILE:LINE] [Original issue] -> Fixed by: [what was changed]

### Minor Issues Addressed
- [FILE:LINE] [Original issue] -> Fixed by: [what was changed]

### Issues Not Fixed
- [FILE:LINE] [Original issue] -> Reason: [why it wasn't fixed]

**Example**:
- [src/api/legacy.ts:45] Complex refactoring of legacy code -> Reason: Out of scope for this PR, tracked in ticket #1234
```

### Prohibited Behaviors
1. **NO CLAIMING FIXED WITHOUT CHANGES**: Do not mark an issue as fixed without actually changing the code
2. **NO PARTIAL FIXES**: Either fix the issue completely or document why it can't be fixed
3. **NO SILENT SKIPS**: If you skip an issue, document it in "Issues Not Fixed" with reason
4. **NO NEW ISSUES**: Fixes should not introduce new bugs (check with re-review)

## Re-Review Requirements

After fixes are applied, a re-reviewer must:

### Verification Steps
1. **Check each previously flagged issue**
   - Verify the fix was applied
   - Verify the fix actually resolves the issue
   - Verify the fix didn't introduce new issues or just move the problem elsewhere

2. **Re-score all dimensions**
   - Do NOT just copy previous scores
   - Evaluate current state from scratch: (a) read modified files, (b) apply rubric criteria, (c) score based on current state
   - Document score changes ("Security: 6 -> 9")

3. **Identify new issues**
   - Issues found during re-review are NEW findings
   - Not counted as regressions unless they're directly caused by fixes
   - Categorize as Critical/Major/Minor using same rubric

### Re-Review Output Format

```markdown
## Re-Review Summary
- **Overall Score**: X.X/10 (was Y.Y/10)
- **Verdict**: PASS | CONDITIONAL PASS | FAIL
- **Previous Issues**: X critical, Y major, Z minor
- **Issues Resolved**: X critical, Y major, Z minor
- **New Issues Found**: X critical, Y major, Z minor

## Dimension Score Changes
| Dimension | Previous | Current | Change |
|-----------|----------|---------|--------|
| Correctness | X/10 | X/10 | +/- X |
| [etc] | ... | ... | ... |

## Previous Issues - Resolution Status

### Critical Issues
- [RESOLVED] [FILE:LINE] [Original issue] -> RESOLVED
- [NOT FIXED] [FILE:LINE] [Original issue] -> NOT FIXED: [reason]

### Major Issues
- [RESOLVED] [FILE:LINE] [Original issue] -> RESOLVED

### Minor Issues
- [RESOLVED] [FILE:LINE] [Original issue] -> RESOLVED

## New Issues Found
[Use standard Critical/Major/Minor format]
```

## WRFC Loop Context

This skill is a critical component of the Work-Review-Fix-Check loop:

1. **Work**: Engineer implements feature
2. **Review**: Reviewer applies this scoring rubric -> produces scored review
3. **Fix**: Fix agent addresses all Critical/Major issues -> produces fix report
4. **Check**: Re-reviewer verifies fixes -> re-scores -> determines if another loop needed

The orchestrator uses the numeric score and verdict to make decisions:
- **PASS (9.5+)**: Exit loop, mark complete
- **CONDITIONAL PASS (8.0-9.49)**: One more quick fix+check cycle
- **FAIL (<8.0)**: Full review-fix-check loop again

## Common Scoring Mistakes to Avoid

### Score Inflation
**Wrong**: Giving 8-9 scores when significant issues exist
**Right**: Use the rubric literally -- 6-7 means "acceptable but with notable issues"

### Inconsistent Severity
**Wrong**: Marking a security vulnerability as "Major" instead of "Critical"
**Right**: Use severity guidelines -- auth bypass is ALWAYS Critical

### Missing FILE:LINE References
**Wrong**: "The error handling is poor"
**Right**: "src/api/users.ts:42 - Empty catch block silently swallows errors"

### Vague Fix Suggestions
**Wrong**: "Fix the type safety issues"
**Right**: "Replace `any` with `User` type and add runtime validation with zod schema"

### Subjective Score Withholding
**Wrong**: Scoring 9.5 instead of 10 because "the domain is complex" or "staying below perfection"
**Right**: If no issues are identified, the score is 10. Scores must be objective and based solely on identified, actionable issues. A 10/10 is always achievable and must be awarded when no deficiencies are found. Never withhold points for subjective reasons like domain complexity, code novelty, or philosophical caution.

### Ignoring Positive Observations
**Wrong**: Only listing problems
**Right**: Also document what was done well (encourages good patterns)

### Verdict Mismatch
**Wrong**: Overall score 7.2/10 with verdict "PASS"
**Right**: Score 7.2 -> Verdict FAIL (threshold is 8.0 for conditional, 9.5 for pass)

## Validation Scripts

This skill includes deterministic validation scripts:

- **scripts/validate-review.sh**: Checks review output format compliance
- **scripts/validate-fix.sh**: Checks fix agent output addresses all critical/major issues

See `scripts/` directory for implementation details.
