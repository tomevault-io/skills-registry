# Check Documentation Quality

Validate documentation freshness, completeness, and quality against current codebase state.

## Anti-Hallucination Detection

**CRITICAL**: This skill should DETECT hallucinations in existing docs:
1. **Cross-reference claims** - For each claim in docs, verify against actual code
2. **Verify component counts** - If docs say "5 services", count actual services
3. **Check file references** - Verify all referenced files actually exist
4. **Validate diagrams** - Ensure diagram components match real codebase

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Parallel Documentation Analysis (Use Parallel Analysis)

#### For Multiple Documents

Spawn parallel subagents for each documentation file:

#### For Single Document (Section-Level Verification)

Even when checking ONE document, spawn subagents for each logical section. See [references/verification-patterns.md](references/verification-patterns.md) for detailed section-level verification patterns.

**Verification categories to parallelize**:
- Component/service names - Do they exist?
- Numeric counts - Are they accurate?
- Diagram entities - Are they real?
- File/path references - Do files exist?
- Technology claims - Are they in package files?
- Relationship claims - Do the connections exist in code?

### Phase 2: Parse Arguments

1. Extract optional focus area from `command arguments`
2. Focus areas: `core`, `data`, `infrastructure`, `all`
3. Default: check all documentation

### Phase 3: Scan and Analyze

1. Find all documentation files in `docs/`
2. Identify documentation types present
3. Check for ADRs and RFCs
4. Detect technology stack, database presence, deployment configs, project type

### Phase 4: Perform Validation Checks

**A. Relevance Check**: Determine which docs are relevant, identify missing documentation for detected technologies.

**B. Freshness Check**: Compare doc last-modified dates with related code changes using git history. Flag docs not updated after significant code changes.

**C. Completeness Check**: Verify all required sections are present, check for unreplaced `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` values, ensure diagrams exist where expected.

**D. Quality Check**: Validate Mermaid diagram syntax, check for broken internal links, verify markdown formatting, check for empty sections.

For detailed verification commands and bash patterns, see [references/verification-patterns.md](references/verification-patterns.md).

### Phase 5: Calculate Scores

See [references/scoring-criteria.md](references/scoring-criteria.md) for complete scoring rubrics.

**Score categories per document**:
- **Freshness** (0-100): Based on recency of updates relative to code changes
- **Completeness** (0-100): Based on section coverage and placeholder replacement
- **Quality** (0-100): Based on formatting, diagram validity, link integrity

**Overall Score**: Average of all document scores, weighted by importance (core docs > others).

### Phase 6: Generate Report

Produce a comprehensive report containing:
- Status summary with overall score
- List of documents by status (Good, Needs Attention, Missing)
- **Hallucination Report** - Claims that do not match reality
- Quality issues with specific locations and line numbers
- Actionable recommendations with specific commands

## Output Format

### Status Summary
```
Documentation Health Report

Overall Score: 85/100

Good (3 docs):
 docs/architecture.md (Score: 95/100)
 docs/onboarding.md (Score: 92/100)
 docs/adr/ (5 records, Score: 88/100)

Needs Attention (2 docs):
 docs/data-model.md (Score: 65/100)
 docs/deployment.md (Score: 58/100)

Missing (2 docs):
 docs/security.md
 docs/api-documentation.md

Quality Issues:
 docs/data-model.md:42 - Invalid Mermaid syntax
 docs/architecture.md:15 - Broken link to [non-existent.md]
### Recommendations Format

```
Priority Recommendations:

1. HIGH: Update data model documentation
 Command: docs-diagram er
 Reason: Schema changed 5 days ago, ER diagram missing

2. MEDIUM: Fix deployment documentation placeholders
 Command: docs-update deployment
 Reason: Contains unreplaced placeholders

3. LOW: Add security documentation
 Command: docs-diagram security
 Reason: Good practice for complete documentation
## Usage Examples

Check all documentation:
```
docs-check
With specific focus:
```
docs-check core
docs-check data
docs-check focus on database documentation
Quick check:
```
docs-check quick
## Important Notes

- **Non-destructive**: Only reads, never modifies documentation
- **Git-aware**: Uses git history to assess freshness
- **Context-aware**: Understands project type and relevant docs
- **Actionable**: Provides specific commands to fix issues
- **Incremental**: Can be run frequently

## When to Run

- Before onboarding new team members
- During documentation reviews
- After major refactoring
- As part of pre-release checklist
- When documentation feels stale
- Regularly (weekly or bi-weekly)

## Claude Code Enhanced Features

This skill includes the following Claude Code-specific enhancements:

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Parallel Documentation Analysis (Use SubAgents)

#### For Multiple Documents

Spawn parallel subagents for each documentation file:

```
Use Task tool with multiple parallel agents:

Agent 1 - Core Docs Verification:
- prompt: "Read docs/architecture.md and verify EVERY claim against the actual codebase. For each component mentioned, confirm it exists. For each count, verify with find/glob. Report any claims that cannot be verified."
- subagent_type: "general-purpose"

Agent 2 - Data Docs Verification:
- prompt: "Read docs/data-model.md and verify all entities exist in actual model files. Check each relationship claimed is real. Report mismatches."
- subagent_type: "general-purpose"

Agent 3 - Explore Codebase Reality:
- prompt: "Analyze the actual codebase structure. Count real components, services, models. This will be compared against documentation claims."
- subagent_type: "Explore"
```

#### For Single Document (Section-Level Verification)

Even when checking ONE document, spawn subagents for each logical section. See [references/verification-patterns.md](references/verification-patterns.md) for detailed section-level verification patterns.

**Verification categories to parallelize**:
- Component/service names - Do they exist?
- Numeric counts - Are they accurate?
- Diagram entities - Are they real?
- File/path references - Do files exist?
- Technology claims - Are they in package files?
- Relationship claims - Do the connections exist in code?

### Phase 2: Parse Arguments

1. Extract optional focus area from `$ARGUMENTS`
2. Focus areas: `core`, `data`, `infrastructure`, `all`
3. Default: check all documentation

### Phase 3: Scan and Analyze

1. Find all documentation files in `docs/`
2. Identify documentation types present
