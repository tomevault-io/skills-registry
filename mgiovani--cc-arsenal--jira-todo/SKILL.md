# Jira Todo - Daily Work Prioritization

Smart daily work planner that analyzes assigned tickets and provides actionable recommendations on what to work on next. This skill complements the **jira-cli** skill, which provides general Jira CLI knowledge and command reference.

## Anti-Hallucination Guidelines

**CRITICAL**: Recommendations must be based on ACTUAL Jira data:
1. **Only reference real tickets** - Every ticket ID must come from jira CLI output
2. **Verify statuses** - Never assume status; read it from the API response
3. **Check actual priorities** - Use the priority field from Jira, never infer
4. **Real story points** - Only show story points if they exist in the ticket
5. **No invented blockers** - Only mention blockers explicitly marked in Jira

## Project Key Detection

### Phase 1: Determine Project Key

Get the project key from (in order of priority):
1. **Command argument**: `--project ABC` or `-p ABC`
2. **Jira CLI config**: Read from `~/.config/.jira/.config.yml`

```bash
# Try to get project key from jira CLI config
PROJECT_KEY=$(cat ~/.config/.jira/.config.yml 2>/dev/null | grep -A1 "^project:" | grep "key:" | awk '{print $2}')
echo "Detected project: $PROJECT_KEY"
If no project key found, ask the user to specify with `--project <KEY>`.

## Workflow

### Phase 2: Gather Current Workload

```bash
# Get all assigned tickets in active statuses
jira issue list --assignee $(jira me) --status "To Do" "In Progress" "Code Review" "In Review" --plain --columns key,summary,status,priority,updated

# Check for blockers and dependencies
jira issue list --assignee $(jira me) --jql "status IN ('To Do', 'In Progress') AND (labels = 'blocked' OR description ~ 'blocked')" --plain

# Get recently updated tickets needing attention
jira issue list --assignee $(jira me) --updated -2d --status "Code Review" "In Review" "Waiting for Feedback" --plain
### Phase 3: Analyze with SubAgents (For Complex Workloads)

If more than 5 active tickets, use parallel analysis:

```
Agent 1 - Priority Analysis:
- prompt: "Analyze these Jira tickets and score by priority. Consider: Priority field weight, due dates, recent activity, blocking status. Return sorted list with scores."
- agent-type: "general-purpose"

Agent 2 - Dependency Analysis:
- prompt: "For these tickets, identify which ones are blocking others or being blocked. Map the dependency chain and impact."
- agent-type: "general-purpose"

Agent 3 - Context Analysis:
- prompt: "Check git branches and recent commits. Which tickets have active development? Which need context switch?"
- agent-type: "Explore"
### Phase 4: Apply Prioritization Algorithm

**Priority Scoring:**
- **Critical/Urgent Priority**: Weight x 10
- **Due Soon**: Days until due date (lower = higher score)
- **Recent Activity**: Updated in last 24h = +5 points
- **Blocking Others**: Has dependents = +3 points
- **Needs Response**: Recent comments = +2 points
- **Production Bug**: Bug type with High+ priority = +4 points

**Smart Recommendations:**
```python
if ticket.priority == "Highest" and ticket.type == "Bug":
 recommendation = "DROP EVERYTHING - Critical bug"
elif ticket.has_recent_comments and ticket.status == "Code Review":
 recommendation = "Address review feedback ASAP"
elif ticket.is_blocking_others:
 recommendation = "Unblock others - high team impact"
elif ticket.status == "In Progress" and days_since_update > 2:
 recommendation = "Continue momentum - you were making progress"
else:
 recommendation = "Good candidate for focused work time"
### Phase 5: Generate Output

Use TodoWrite to track the work items identified.

## Output Format

For the detailed output template, see [references/output-formats.md](references/output-formats.md).

**Report sections:**
- **Immediate Actions (Do First)**: Critical/urgent tickets requiring immediate attention
- **High Impact Work (Do Today)**: High-priority items that fit into today's schedule
- **This Week (Schedule Time)**: Medium-priority items to plan for the week
- **On Hold (Monitor)**: Tickets waiting on others or blocked
- **Work Summary**: Active ticket count, estimated hours, sprint progress
- **Smart Suggestions**: Time-blocking and energy management recommendations
- **Recommended Schedule**: Hour-by-hour daily plan

## Command Options

### `--project <KEY>` or `-p <KEY>`
Specify the Jira project key explicitly.
```bash
jira-todo --project ABC
jira-todo -p PROJ
### `--urgent-only`
Show only critical/urgent tickets requiring immediate attention.
```bash
jira-todo --urgent-only
# Only shows Priority: Highest, production bugs, blocking issues
### `--include-blocked`
Include tickets that are blocked (usually filtered out).
```bash
jira-todo --include-blocked
# Shows blocked tickets with suggestions for unblocking
### `--time-box <hours>`
Optimize recommendations for specific time availability.
```bash
jira-todo --time-box 3
# Recommends work that fits in ~3 hours
## Smart Features

### Context Awareness
- Detect if work is already in progress (recent commits, branch names)
- Suggest continuing vs. context switching based on cognitive load
- Consider typical work patterns (morning debugging vs. afternoon planning)

### Dependency Analysis
- Identify tickets blocking teammates
- Show impact chain (what gets unblocked when a ticket is finished)
- Highlight cross-team dependencies requiring coordination

### Energy Optimization
- Suggest complex debugging for high-energy periods
- Recommend routine tasks for low-energy times
- Balance creative work with maintenance tasks

### Progress Tracking
- Show sprint/milestone progress
- Identify tickets falling behind schedule
- Celebrate completed work momentum

## Integration Points

### With jira-daily Skill
- Previous day's work influences today's recommendations
- Completed items inform progress tracking

### With jira-cli Skill
- Use jira-cli for detailed command syntax and flag reference
- Refer to jira-cli workflows for sprint and epic management patterns

### With Development Tools
- Check current git branch for context
- Look for recent commits related to tickets
- Suggest based on recent file activity

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Basic usage (auto-detects project from config)
jira-todo

# Specify project explicitly
jira-todo --project ABC

# Only show urgent items
jira-todo --urgent-only

# Plan for limited time
jira-todo --time-box 4

# Include blocked tickets in analysis
jira-todo --include-blocked
## Important Notes

- **Requires jira-cli**: Install from https://github.com/ankitpokhrel/jira-cli
- **Config location**: `~/.config/.jira/.config.yml`
- **Project key**: Auto-detected from config or specify with `--project`
- **Real data only**: All recommendations based on actual Jira ticket data
