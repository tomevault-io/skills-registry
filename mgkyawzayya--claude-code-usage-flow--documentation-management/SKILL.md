3. Keep content concise and actionable
4. Verify README under 300 lines
5. Cross-check links and file paths

## Documentation Structure (Source of Truth)

```
docs/
├── project-overview-pdr.md   # Goals, features, requirements
├── codebase-summary.md       # Structure, models, routes, components
├── code-standards.md         # Conventions and patterns
└── system-architecture.md    # Design and data flow
```

Also: `README.md` (root) — Keep under 300 lines
