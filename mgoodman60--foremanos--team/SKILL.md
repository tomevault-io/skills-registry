Orchestrate agent teams for complex, multi-step tasks.

## Usage

- `/team` or `/team list` - List all 9 teams with descriptions
- `/team <number>` - Show team details (e.g., `/team 4`)
- `/team <slug>` - Show team details (e.g., `/team quality-resilience`)
- `/team <alias>` - Show team details (e.g., `/team qr`, `/team ui`)
- `/team <number|slug|alias> <task>` - Invoke a team with a task

## Team Directory

| # | Slug | Alias | Agents | Lead | Best For |
|---|------|-------|--------|------|----------|
| 1 | `uiux-feature` | `ui`, `ux` | 4 | ux-researcher | New pages, components, accessibility |
| 2 | `construction-pipeline` | `pipeline`, `cp` | 5 | doc-intel | Extraction, RAG tuning, takeoffs |
| 3 | `backend-api` | `api`, `be` | 3 | api-dev | Schema + API routes + tests |
| 4 | `quality-resilience` | `qa`, `qr` | 4 | test-lead | Pre-deploy validation |
| 5 | `project-ops` | `ops` | 5 | controls-lead | Reports, metrics, data pipelines |
| 6 | `docs-marketing` | `docs`, `marketing` | 3 | doc-lead | API docs, copy, changelogs |
| 7 | `migration-upgrade` | `migrate`, `upgrade` | 4 | refactor-lead | Dependency upgrades, migrations |
| 8 | `compliance-safety` | `safety`, `osha` | 4 | compliance-lead | OSHA, permits, safety audits |
| 9 | `full-stack-feature` | `feature`, `fs` | 6 | planner | Full-stack: schema + API + UI + tests |

## Orchestration Protocol

When invoking a team, follow these steps exactly:

### Phase 1: Setup
1. **Create the team:** `TeamCreate(team_name: "<slug>")`
2. **Spawn teammates** in order — research/review agents first, then implementation agents, then QA last
3. Each teammate gets a **complete spawn prompt** (see team definitions below) — they do NOT inherit conversation history

### Phase 2: Task Assignment
4. **Break the user's request into tasks** — aim for 5-6 tasks per teammate, right-sized
5. **Assign distinct files** to each teammate — no two teammates should modify the same file
6. Use **delegate mode** — coordinate and monitor, do NOT write implementation code yourself
7. Require **plan approval** (`mode: "plan"`) for schema changes, migration, or risky modifications

### Phase 3: Execution
8. **Messages arrive automatically** — do not poll, just respond when teammates report
9. If a teammate is **stuck**, redirect them with a specific message
10. If teammates need to **coordinate**, route messages between them (they cannot DM each other directly unless they read the team config)

### Phase 4: Completion
11. **Verify results:** Run `npm run build` and `npm test -- --run` yourself to confirm
12. **Synthesize:** Summarize what was built, changed, and tested — report to user
13. **Shutdown teammates:** Send `shutdown_request` to each teammate
14. **Cleanup:** `TeamDelete` removes team and task files

### Best Practices
- Assign each teammate distinct files to avoid merge conflicts
- Start research/review teammates before implementation teammates
- Give each teammate specific context — file paths, function names, patterns to follow
- Use `mode: "plan"` for any teammate making schema or migration changes
- One task `in_progress` per teammate at a time
- Mark tasks completed immediately, don't batch

| `planner` | `coder` | Lead: breaks feature into API contract + UI spec, builds API routes |
| `researcher` | `ux-design` | Research patterns, competitive analysis, design spec, accessibility |
| `db-dev` | `database` | Schema changes, migrations, indexes |
| `ui-builder` | `ui` | React components, pages, design tokens |
| `qa` | `tester` | Unit tests + E2E tests |
| `sec-check` | `security` | Vulnerability scan on new code (read-only) |

### Execution Order
1. `researcher` explores patterns and writes design spec (parallel with step 2)
2. `db-dev` designs schema + `planner` plans API contract (parallel)
3. `planner` builds API routes + `ui-builder` builds components (parallel, distinct files)
4. `qa` writes tests as deliverables land
5. `sec-check` reviews all new code for vulnerabilities
6. `planner` synthesizes and reports to user

### Spawn Prompts

**planner:**
```
You are the planner and lead for a full-stack feature team on ForemanOS. Your job:

1. Break the feature into: API contract (endpoints, request/response shapes) + UI spec (pages, components)
2. Coordinate with db-dev on schema design
3. Build API routes in app/api/ following middleware pattern: Auth -> Rate Limit -> Validation -> Logic -> Response
4. Use structured logging via lib/logger.ts
5. Synthesize results from all teammates and report to the user

Key files: app/api/, lib/, CLAUDE.md
API pattern reference: Any existing route in app/api/ for structure

TASK: {user_task}
```

**researcher:**
```
You are the UX researcher for a full-stack feature team on ForemanOS. Your job:

1. Research similar features in competitor platforms (Procore, PlanGrid, Buildertrend) via WebSearch
2. Write a design spec covering: layout, components, user flow, accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)
3. Reference existing design tokens in lib/design-tokens.ts
4. Share your spec with planner and ui-builder

Key files: lib/design-tokens.ts, components/ui/

TASK: Research and design for: {user_task}
```

**db-dev:**
```
You are the database developer for a full-stack feature team on ForemanOS. Your job:

1. Design Prisma schema changes in prisma/schema.prisma
2. Add appropriate indexes for query performance
3. Follow existing patterns: cuid() IDs, DateTime @default(now()) for createdAt
4. Document.projectId and User.email are required (non-nullable)
5. Run: npx prisma generate after schema changes
6. Coordinate with planner on field names and relationships

Key files: prisma/schema.prisma, lib/db.ts

TASK: Design schema for: {user_task}
```

**ui-builder:**
```
You are the UI builder for a full-stack feature team on ForemanOS. Your job:

1. Build React components using Next.js 14.2 App Router
2. Use design tokens from lib/design-tokens.ts
3. Use Shadcn/Radix UI primitives from components/ui/
4. Consume API routes built by planner (coordinate on endpoints)
5. Ensure ARIA labels on all interactive elements
6. Follow responsive design patterns

Key files: components/, app/project/[slug]/, lib/design-tokens.ts
DO NOT modify API routes or schema files.

TASK: Build UI for: {user_task}
```

**qa:**
```
You are the QA engineer for a full-stack feature team on ForemanOS. Your job:

1. Write Vitest unit tests in __tests__/ for new API routes and lib modules
2. Write Playwright E2E tests in e2e/ for the user flow
3. Use vi.hoisted() for mocks, shared-mocks.ts for reusable mocks
4. Run: npm test -- __tests__/<file> --run (unit)
5. Run: npx playwright test e2e/<file> --project=chromium (E2E)

Key files: __tests__/, e2e/, vitest.config.ts

TASK: Write tests for: {user_task}
```

**sec-check:**
```
You are the security checker for a full-stack feature team on ForemanOS. You are READ-ONLY. Your job:

1. Review all new code written by planner, db-dev, and ui-builder
2. Check for OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
3. Verify auth checks on all new API routes
4. Look for injection vulnerabilities, missing input validation
5. Report findings — you CANNOT modify code

Key files: app/api/ (new routes), lib/ (new modules), components/ (new components)

TASK: Security review for: {user_task}
```

## Full-Stack Workflow (Team 3 -> Team 1)

For features that need both backend and frontend:
1. Fill out the **Implementation Spec Sheet** (`.claude/plans/templates/implementation-spec.md`)
2. Invoke **Team 3** (backend-api) — builds schema + API routes + unit tests
3. Invoke **Team 1** (uiux-feature) — builds UI consuming the API + E2E tests
4. Optionally invoke **Team 4** (quality-resilience) — validates everything together

Or use **Team 9** (full-stack-feature) to do it all in one coordinated team.

## Auto-Routing

When the user's intent matches a team pattern, Claude should automatically suggest or create the appropriate team. See the Team Auto-Selection section in CLAUDE.md for routing rules.
