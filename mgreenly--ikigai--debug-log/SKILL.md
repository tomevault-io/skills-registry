# Debug Log

Printf-style logging for development and debugging. Compiles away completely in release builds.

## Purpose

- Development-time visibility into program state
- Add arbitrary trace points during debugging
- Zero overhead in release builds

## Usage

```c
#include "debug_log.h"

DEBUG_LOG("value=%d state=%s", x, state_name);
DEBUG_LOG("=== Entering function ===");
DEBUG_LOG("buffer contents: %.*s", (int)len, buf);
```

## Build Configuration

| Build | DEBUG defined | Behavior |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| Debug | Yes | Writes to `$IKIGAI_LOG_DIR/debug.log` |
| Release | No | Compiles to `((void)0)` - removed entirely |

## Initialization

In debug builds, call once early in `main()`:

```c
#ifdef DEBUG
ik_debug_log_init();
#endif
```

Or simply use the macro form (safe in any build):

```c
ik_debug_log_init();  // No-op if DEBUG not defined
```

## Output Format

```
[2025-01-15 10:30:00] src/client.c:34:main: === Session starting, PID=12345 ===
```

Format: `[timestamp] file:line:function: message`

## Log Location

- Current session: `$IKIGAI_LOG_DIR/debug.log` (default: `.ikigai/logs/debug.log`)
- Previous sessions: archived as `$IKIGAI_LOG_DIR/YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS±HH-MM.log` using the file's birth time
- Archive is skipped if the target already exists (session lasted < 1 s)
- `debug.log` is truncated on each new run

`IKIGAI_LOG_DIR` must be set or the process panics at startup. It is exported by `.envrc`.

## Inspecting Logs

```bash
tail -f .ikigai/logs/debug.log            # follow current session
ls .ikigai/logs/                           # list all archived sessions
```

## Alternate Buffer Note

ikigai runs in terminal alternate buffer mode. `printf()` and `fprintf(stderr, ...)` are not visible during execution. Use `DEBUG_LOG` instead.

## Source Files

- `apps/ikigai/debug_log.h` - Macro definition
- `apps/ikigai/debug_log.c` - Implementation (excluded from coverage)
