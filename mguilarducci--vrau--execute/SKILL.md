# Phase 3: Execute

## Checkpoint (READ THIS FIRST)
You are in: **EXECUTE PHASE**
Previous: Plan (must be merged to main)
Next: Done (PR merged, issue closed if applicable)

## MANDATORY Phase Gate Verification

**Before doing ANYTHING else, verify these prerequisites:**

```bash
# 1. Check plan exists and was merged
ls docs/designs/*/plan/*.md

# 2. Verify plan PR was merged (not just created)
git log --oneline main | head -20 | grep -i "plan"
```

**STOP if:**
- No `plan/*.md` files exist → You're not ready for execute phase
- Plan PR not merged to main → Plan needs review/approval first
- Only brainstorm exists → You need Plan phase first (invoke vrau:plan)

**A brainstorm document is NOT a plan. A detailed brainstorm is still NOT a plan.**

## Red Flags - STOP If You're Thinking This

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "The brainstorm is detailed enough to implement" | Brainstorm ≠ Plan. Go back to Plan phase. |
| "I can skip planning, it's obvious what to do" | Plans get REVIEWED. Brainstorms aren't plans. |
| "The changes are simple/already done" | Sunk cost. Delete unplanned work, follow workflow. |
| "I'll verify the plan was approved later" | Verify NOW. Before any implementation. |
| "Review said APPROVED on the brainstorm" | Brainstorm approval → Plan phase. NOT Execute. |
| "I can review my own code" | NO. You wrote it, you CANNOT review it. Request fresh eyes. |
| "I'll just check my changes quickly" | That's self-review. Request code review from fresh eyes INSTEAD. |
| "I tested it so it's fine" | Testing ≠ Review. Fresh eyes catch design issues you missed. |

**If any thought above occurs: STOP. You're rationalizing. Follow the workflow.**

## CRITICAL SAFETY RULE

**NEVER COMMIT TO MAIN BRANCH**

Check current branch:
```bash
git branch --show-current
```

**If on main/master:** STOP. Create a new branch or use worktree. NEVER proceed with commits on main.

## Steps
1. Run /sync-main - ensure branch is up to date
2. Ask user: worktree (use superpowers:using-git-worktrees) or new branch?
3. If Tracking Mode: GitHub → run /track-task "Started execute phase"
4. Read plan, execute tasks by parallel groups
   - Dispatch parallel agents for independent tasks
   - ALWAYS verify with live sources - docs change
   - After each group: /track-task "Completed task group X (tasks N, M, ...)"
5. After EACH parallel group: **request code review from SEPARATE agent** (fresh eyes)
   - Use superpowers:requesting-code-review (spawns reviewer subagent)
   - You wrote the code = you CANNOT review it. No exceptions.
   - If Tracking Mode: GitHub → run /track-task "Code review for group X: <VERDICT>"
   - APPROVED → continue to next group
   - Issues found → use superpowers:receiving-code-review, then request NEW fresh review
6. If Tracking Mode: GitHub → run /track-task "All tasks complete, running verification"
7. Run verification (superpowers:verification-before-completion)
8. Use superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch
   - If Tracking Mode: GitHub → include "Closes #<issue>" in final PR
   - If Tracking Mode: GitHub → run /track-task "Final PR #X created (closes #<issue>)"
   - Otherwise: standard PR

## Critical Rules
- [ ] **NEVER COMMIT TO MAIN BRANCH** - use feature branch or worktree
- [ ] ALWAYS verify with live sources - docs change, your knowledge may be stale
- [ ] Code review after EVERY parallel group (fresh eyes each time)
- [ ] MUST run verification before PR - never skip
- [ ] All commits include "refs #<issue>" (if Tracking Mode: GitHub)
- [ ] Only final PR uses "closes #<issue>" (if Tracking Mode: GitHub)
- [ ] Code changes → commit as specified in the plan
