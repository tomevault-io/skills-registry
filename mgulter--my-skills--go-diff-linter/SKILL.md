# Go Diff Linter

Lint only the code you changed, not the entire codebase. Formatters are applied automatically, Claude fixes lint issues manually.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Run linting and auto-format for changes vs develop branch
.claude/skills/go-diff-linter/scripts/run_lint.sh develop

# Report saved to .golangci-diff/report.md
```

## What It Does

1. **Extracts changed files** - Gets diff between your branch and base branch
2. **Runs linters** - Only on packages containing changed files (avoids unrelated errors)
3. **Filters issues** - Keeps only issues within changed line ranges
4. **Auto-formats** - Applies gofumpt and goimports to all changed files
5. **Generates report** - Markdown report for Claude to fix remaining lint issues

## Workflow

### Step 1: Run the Script

```bash
.claude/skills/go-diff-linter/scripts/run_lint.sh <base_branch> [-o report.md]
```

Example:
```bash
.claude/skills/go-diff-linter/scripts/run_lint.sh develop
.claude/skills/go-diff-linter/scripts/run_lint.sh main -o my-report.md
```

### Step 2: Review Changes

Formatters are applied automatically. Check with:
```bash
git status
git diff
```

### Step 3: Fix Lint Issues

Read the report: `.golangci-diff/report.md`

Report contains:
- Changed files and line ranges
- Each lint issue: file, line, linter, description, current code, suggested fix

Fix each issue using the Edit tool. **Only modify lines specified in the report.**

## Config

Always uses skill's `assets/.golangci.yml` for consistent linting (project config is temporarily backed up and restored).

**Enabled Linters:**
- Essential: govet, staticcheck, errcheck, ineffassign, unused, typecheck
- Security: gosec
- Bug prevention: bodyclose, nilerr, sqlclosecheck, contextcheck, rowserrcheck
- Code quality: gocritic, revive, misspell, errorlint, dupl, goconst, cyclop

**Auto-applied Formatters:**
- gofumpt (with extra-rules)
- goimports

## Key Behaviors

| Type | Scope | Action |
|------|-------|--------|
| Lint issues | Changed lines only | Claude manually fixes |
| Formatting | Changed files | **Auto-applied** |
| Unchanged code | Skip | Never touch |

## Example Report Output

```markdown
## Summary

- Total issues from linter: 15
- Lint issues in changed lines: 12
- Filtered out (unchanged code): 3
- Formatting: automatically applied

## Lint Issues (Must Fix)

### `pkg/handler/api.go`

**Line 42:5** - [gosec] Security issue
> G104: Errors unhandled

Current code:
```go
42: json.Unmarshal(data, &result)
```

Suggested fix:
```go
if err := json.Unmarshal(data, &result); err != nil {
    return err
}
```
```

## Requirements

- Go 1.21+
- golangci-lint v2.x (uses `--output.json.path` and `golangci-lint fmt`)
- Python 3.10+
- jq
