# agent:create

Scaffold a Claude Code subagent that has **durable memory** — not just a system
prompt, but a small filesystem the agent reads at boot and writes back to at
the end of each session.

The skill creates three things in one shot:

| Tier | What | Where | Read by |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Definition** (system prompt + YAML frontmatter) | `.claude/agents/<name>.md` | The Claude Code harness, at spawn |
| 2 | **Memory index** (boot sequence, ≤80 lines) | `.claude/agent-memory/<name>/MEMORY.md` | The subagent itself, auto-injected on every spawn |
| 3 | **Deep memory store** (PRIVACY, profiles, sessions, tasks, cache) | `.agents/<name>/` | The subagent, on demand per the boot sequence |

Files are templates. They include placeholders, hints, and a few sensible
defaults (e.g. PRIVACY.md as the first boot step, a self-curation block in the
definition, a `tasks/open-tasks.md` skeleton). The user customizes after the
scaffold runs.

## When this earns its place

Use it when the user is about to create — or wishes they had created — an
agent that should:

- Have a **persistent identity** across sessions, not a one-shot prompt
- Remember decisions, preferences, and "what works" without being told each time
- Carry **per-topic state** (per-person profiles, per-project notes, etc.)
- Curate its own memory after each session (append to what-works.md, log a session, mark a task done)

Skip it for:

- One-off slash commands (those go in `commands/`, not `agents/`)
- Skills that wrap a tool — those don't need their own memory store
- "Just give me a system prompt" — that's a one-file edit, not three-tier scaffolding

## The flow

### 1. Collect the minimum input

Before running the scaffolder, confirm with the user:

1. **Name** — kebab-case, used in all three tiers (e.g. `code-reviewer`, `release-notes-writer`, `data-scout`).
   The agent file will be `<name>.md`; the deep store will live at `.agents/<name>/`.
2. **Role / one-line purpose** — a single sentence the user would say if asked
   "what does this agent do for me?" Used in the description-trigger and in the
   identity blocks of all three tiers.
3. **Target directory** — where the three tiers should be created. Default is
   the current working directory. For a vault-style setup, pass the vault root
   (the scaffolder will create `.claude/agents/`, `.claude/agent-memory/`, and
   `.agents/` under it).

Optional fields (the scaffolder accepts but leaves blank if not provided):

- `--anchor` — a short anchor phrase the agent returns to (`"Boring is the feature."`, `"Signal, not noise."`)
- `--voice` — one line of voice notes (`"calm, dry, no exclamations, no emojis"`)
- `--triggers` — comma-separated keywords for the description (`"X, Y, Z"`)
- `--anti-triggers` — comma-separated "do NOT trigger for" topics
- `--force` — overwrite existing files (default: refuse if any of the three tiers already exists)

### 2. Run the scaffolder

```bash
# $CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT is set by Claude Code when the plugin is installed
python3 "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/agent:create/scripts/create_agent.py" \
  --name <agent-name> \
  --role "<one-line purpose>" \
  --target <vault-or-project-root> \
  [--anchor "<phrase>"] \
  [--voice "<one line>"] \
  [--triggers "kw1, kw2, kw3"] \
  [--anti-triggers "topic1, topic2"]
```

The script prints the absolute paths of every file it created and exits 0 on
success, non-zero with a clear message if a tier already exists (use `--force`
to overwrite, or pick a different name).

### 3. Review and customize

After the scaffold lands, walk the user through the three files that matter
most:

1. `**.claude/agents/<name>.md**` — fill in persona, boundaries, output formats.
   The template ships with section headings and `<!-- TODO -->` markers so it's
   obvious what's missing.
2. `**.claude/agent-memory/<name>/MEMORY.md**` — sanity-check the boot sequence.
   Add or remove file pointers based on what `memory/` actually contains.
3. `**.agents/<name>/memory/PRIVACY.md**` — set the privacy posture before the
   agent is ever invoked. The template has prompts for what to redact, what to
   keep in buckets, and what to point-to-vault rather than duplicate.

### 4. Run a first audit

After customization, the user can run `mh:agent:audit` (the sister skill in
this plugin) against the new agent to check that:

- All boot-sequence files referenced in MEMORY.md actually exist
- The description has both positive triggers and "do NOT trigger" rules
- PRIVACY.md, tasks/, and sessions/ are present
- Cross-tier consistency holds (name, identity one-liner)

This closes the loop: scaffold → customize → audit → iterate.

## What the scaffolder creates

```
<target>/
├── .claude/
│   ├── agents/
│   │   └── <name>.md                 ← Tier 1 — definition + system prompt
│   └── agent-memory/
│       └── <name>/
│           └── MEMORY.md             ← Tier 2 — auto-injected boot index
└── .agents/
    └── <name>/
        ├── memory/
        │   ├── PRIVACY.md            ← always read first by the agent
        │   ├── INDEX.md              ← pointers into the deep store
        │   └── _shared/.gitkeep      ← framework / pattern files (load on demand)
        ├── tasks/
        │   └── open-tasks.md         ← agent's own backlog (Markdown checkboxes)
        ├── sessions/
        │   └── .gitkeep              ← session logs land here per ritual
        ├── cache/
        │   └── .gitkeep              ← ephemeral cache (rates, RSS poll state, …)
        └── output/
            └── .gitkeep              ← draft outputs before publish
```

Templates live at `templates/` inside this skill. They are deliberately short:
they give shape, not content.

## Conventions baked into the templates

- **PRIVACY.md is step 1 of every boot sequence.** Always.
- **MEMORY.md kept ≤80 lines.** It pays its cost on every spawn — keep it lean.
  Detail goes to `memory/INDEX.md` and topic files.
- **Boot sequence is a numbered list.** No "read these files" prose — the order
  matters and should be explicit.
- **Self-curation block in the definition.** Every agent writes back at session
  end: what-works, decisions, tasks closed, MEMORY.md trim check.
- **`Subagents do NOT inherit the CLAUDE.md cascade`** is called out in the
  template — boot sequence should explicitly list any CLAUDE.md the agent
  depends on.

## What the skill does NOT do

By design, this skill stays out of the user's domain decisions:

- **No cadence integration** — no daily/weekly/monthly assumptions, no embedding
  the agent in any periodic-routine flow. If the user wants that, they wire it after.
- **No external-system handoffs** — no MCP wiring, no queue conventions, no
  cron/scheduling. The scaffolded agent is fully self-contained.
- **No persona invention** — anchor phrase, voice, triggers, and tool boundaries
  are user input. Templates have placeholders, not opinions.
- **No vault opinions** — the scaffolder writes the three tiers wherever you
  point it. It does not touch existing CLAUDE.md, README, or git config.

## Inputs / outputs

**Inputs:** name, role, target dir, optional anchor / voice / triggers / anti-triggers.
**Outputs:** three tiers of files described above, absolute-path-listed on stdout.
**Exit codes:** 0 on success; non-zero with a clear message on collision or
invalid input.
