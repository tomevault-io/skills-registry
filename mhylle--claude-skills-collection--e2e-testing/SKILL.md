description: Comprehensive E2E testing skill using Playwright MCP for systematic web application testing. This skill should be used when users need to test web-based systems end-to-end, set up test regimes, run exploratory tests, or analyze test history. Triggers on requests like "test my webapp", "set up E2E tests", "run the tests", "what's been flaky", or when validating web application functionality. The skill observes and reports only - it never fixes issues. Supports three modes - setup (create test regime), run (execute tests), and report (analyze results). Use when this capability is needed.

# E2E Testing Skill

## Overview

A comprehensive E2E testing skill using Playwright MCP for systematic testing of any web-based system. The skill:

- **Observes and reports** - Never fixes issues, only documents them
- **Discovers paths** - Finds undocumented functionality at runtime
- **Tracks history** - Identifies flaky areas and suggests variations
- **Produces dual reports** - Human-readable and machine-readable formats

## Prerequisites

Before using this skill, verify Playwright MCP is available:

1. Check for `playwright` in MCP server configuration
2. If missing, add to Claude settings:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@playwright/mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

If Playwright MCP is unavailable, inform the user and provide setup instructions before proceeding.

## Mode Selection

This skill operates in three modes. Determine mode from user request:

| User Request | Mode |
|--------------|------|
| "Set up tests for...", "Create test regime" | **Setup** |
| "Run the tests", "Test the...", "Execute tests" | **Run** |
| "Show test results", "What failed?", "What's flaky?" | **Report** |

If unclear, ask: "Would you like to set up a test regime, run existing tests, or view reports?"

---

## Setup Mode

**Purpose**: Create or update test regime through interactive discovery.

### Entry Points

Determine entry point from user context:

| Context | Entry |
|---------|-------|
| User provides URL | URL Exploration |
| User describes system purpose | Description-Based |
| User points to documentation | Documentation Extraction |
| Combination of above | Combined Flow (recommended) |

### Setup Workflow

#### Step 1: Gather Initial Context

Ask for any missing information:
- **URL**: Base URL of the application
- **Purpose**: What does this system do? (1-2 sentences)
- **Key workflows**: What are the critical user journeys?
- **Existing docs**: Any README, user stories, or specs?

#### Step 2: Explore Application

Use Playwright MCP to explore:

```
Navigate to base URL
Capture accessibility snapshot
Identify:
  - Navigation elements (menus, links)
  - Interactive elements (buttons, forms)
  - Key pages and sections
```

For each discovered element, note:
- Element type and purpose
- Alternative paths to reach it
- Required preconditions (login, etc.)

#### Step 3: Discover Alternative Paths

While exploring, actively look for:
- Multiple ways to accomplish the same goal
- Hidden or non-obvious functionality
- Edge cases in navigation

Document discoveries as: "Found alternative: [description]"

#### Step 4: Define Test Scenarios

For each key workflow, create scenario with:

```yaml
scenario: [Descriptive name]
description: [What this tests]
preconditions:
  - [Required state before test]
blocking: [true/false - does failure prevent other tests?]
steps:
  - action: [navigate/click/type/verify/wait]
    target: [selector or description]
    value: [input value if applicable]
    flexibility:
      type: [exact/contains/ai_judgment]
      criteria: [specific rules or judgment prompt]
success_criteria:
  - [What must be true for pass]
alternatives:
  - [Alternative path if primary fails]
```

#### Step 5: Create Test Regime File

Write regime to `tests/e2e/test_regime.yml`:

```yaml
# Test Regime: [Application Name]
# Created: [YYYY-MM-DD]
# Last Updated: [YYYY-MM-DD]

metadata:
  application: [Name]
  base_url: [URL]
  description: [Purpose]

global_settings:
  screenshot_every_step: true
  capture_network: true
  capture_console: true
  discovery_cap: 5  # Max new paths to discover per run

blocking_dependencies:
  - scenario: login
    blocks: [profile, settings, checkout]  # These won't run if login fails

scenarios:
  - scenario: [name]
    # ... scenario definition
```

#### Step 6: Present Regime for Review

Show user:
1. Summary of discovered scenarios
2. Blocking dependencies identified
3. Alternative paths found
4. Ask for confirmation or modifications

---

## Run Mode

**Purpose**: Execute tests sequentially with full evidence capture.

### CRITICAL: Test Status Integrity

**Principle: No Invalid Skips**

A test should only have three outcomes:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **PASSED** | The feature works as specified |
| **FAILED** | The feature doesn't work or doesn't exist |
| **SKIPPED** | Only for legitimate environmental reasons (see below) |

#### Valid Reasons to Skip a Test

- Test environment unavailable (database down, service unreachable)
- Explicit `@skip` decorator for documented WIP features with ticket reference
- Platform-specific tests running on wrong platform
- External dependency unavailable (third-party API down)

#### Invalid Reasons to Skip (Mark as FAILED Instead)

| Situation | Correct Status | Notes Format |
|-----------|----------------|--------------|
| Feature doesn't exist in UI | **FAILED** | "Expected [feature] not found. Feature not implemented." |
| Test wasn't executed/completed | **FAILED** | "Test not executed. [What wasn't verified]." |
| Test would fail | **FAILED** | That's the point of testing |
| "Didn't get around to it" | **FAILED** | Incomplete test coverage is a failure |
| Feature works differently than spec | **FAILED** | "Implementation doesn't match specification: [details]" |

#### Rationale

The purpose of a test is to **fail when something doesn't work**. Marking missing features or unexecuted tests as "skipped" produces artificially inflated pass rates and hides real issues. A test report that only shows green isn't useful if it achieved that by ignoring problems.

#### Implementation Examples

**When a test cannot find the expected UI element or feature:**
```
Status: FAILED
Notes: "FAILED: Expected 'Add to Cart' button not found. Feature not implemented or selector changed."
```

**When a test is not fully executed:**
```
Status: FAILED
Notes: "FAILED: Test not executed. Checkout flow verification was not completed - stopped at payment step."
```

**When environment is genuinely unavailable (valid skip):**
```
Status: SKIPPED
Notes: "SKIPPED: Payment gateway sandbox unavailable. Ticket: PAY-123"
```

---

### Pre-Run Checks

1. **Verify regime exists**: Check for `tests/e2e/test_regime.yml`
   - If missing: "No test regime found. Would you like to run Setup mode first?"

2. **Load history**: Check for `tests/e2e/test_history.json`
   - If exists: Note previously flaky scenarios for extra attention

3. **Verify Playwright MCP**: Confirm browser automation is available

### Execution Protocol

#### Rule 1: Always Start from Beginning

Every test run starts fresh from Step 1 of Scenario 1. Never skip steps or use cached state.

#### Rule 2: Sequential Execution

Execute scenarios in order. For each scenario:

```
1. Check preconditions
2. Execute each step:
   a. Perform action via Playwright MCP
   b. Capture screenshot
   c. Capture DOM state
   d. Capture network activity
   e. Capture console logs
   f. Evaluate success using flexibility criteria
3. Record result (pass/fail/blocked/skipped)
   - PASS: Step completed successfully
   - FAIL: Step failed OR element not found OR feature missing
   - BLOCKED: Dependent on a failed blocking scenario
   - SKIPPED: Only for valid environmental reasons (see Test Status Integrity)
4. If failed: Try alternatives if defined
5. If blocking failure: Stop dependent scenarios
```

#### Rule 3: Failure Handling

When a step fails:

1. **Mark as failed** - Record failure with evidence
2. **Try alternatives** - If alternatives defined, attempt them
3. **Assess blocking impact**:
   - Check if this scenario blocks others
   - If blocking: Mark dependent scenarios as "blocked"
   - If non-blocking: Continue to next scenario
4. **Never fix** - Document the issue, do not attempt repairs

#### Rule 4: Runtime Discovery

While executing, watch for undocumented paths:

- New navigation options not in regime
- Alternative ways to complete actions
- Unexpected UI states

For discoveries:
1. Queue for testing (up to `discovery_cap` limit)
2. Execute after all defined scenarios complete
3. Document findings in report

### Flexibility Criteria Evaluation

For each success check, apply the configured flexibility type:

| Type | Evaluation Method |
|------|-------------------|
| `exact` | String/value must match exactly |
| `contains` | Target must contain specified text |
| `ai_judgment` | Use AI reasoning: "Does this accomplish [goal]?" |

For `ai_judgment`, provide confidence level:
- **High**: Clear success/failure
- **Medium**: Likely success/failure but some ambiguity
- **Low**: Uncertain, recommend manual review

### Evidence Bundle

For each step, capture and store:

```
evidence/
  scenario-name/
    step-01/
      screenshot.png
      dom-snapshot.html
      network-log.json
      console-log.txt
      accessibility-snapshot.yaml
```

### History Integration

After run completes:

1. **Compare to previous runs**:
   - Same scenario passed before but failed now? Flag regression
   - Same scenario failed before? Note persistent issue
   - Intermittent pass/fail? Mark as flaky

2. **Update history file**:
```json
{
  "runs": [
    {
      "timestamp": "ISO-8601",
      "scenarios": {
        "scenario-name": {
          "result": "pass|fail|blocked|skipped",
          "result_notes": "Details about the result",
          "duration_ms": 1234,
          "steps_completed": 5,
          "confidence": "high|medium|low",
          "discoveries": []
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "flaky_scenarios": ["scenario-1", "scenario-2"],
  "suggested_variations": [
    {
      "scenario": "login",
      "variation": "Test with special characters in password",
      "reason": "Failed 3/10 runs with complex passwords"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Result status rules** (see Test Status Integrity):
- `pass`: Feature works as specified
- `fail`: Feature doesn't work, doesn't exist, or test incomplete
- `blocked`: Depends on failed blocking scenario
- `skipped`: ONLY for valid environmental reasons (with ticket reference)

3. **Generate variations for flaky areas**:
   - If scenario failed 3+ times in last 10 runs: Auto-suggest new test variations
   - Add to `suggested_variations` in history

---

## Report Mode

**Purpose**: Generate actionable reports from test results.

### Report Types

Generate both reports after every run:

#### Human-Readable Report

Output to `tests/e2e/reports/YYYY-MM-DD-HHmmss-report.md`:

```markdown
# E2E Test Report: [Application Name]

**Run Date**: YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss
**Duration**: X minutes
**Result**: X passed, Y failed, Z blocked, W skipped

## Summary

| Scenario | Result | Duration | Confidence |
|----------|--------|----------|------------|
| Login | PASS | 2.3s | High |
| Checkout | FAIL | 5.1s | High |

## Failures

### Checkout Flow

**Step Failed**: Step 3 - Click "Complete Purchase"
**Error**: Button not found within timeout

**Evidence**:
- Screenshot: `evidence/checkout/step-03/screenshot.png`
- Expected: Button with text "Complete Purchase"
- Actual: Page showed error message "Session expired"

**Reproduction Steps**:
1. Navigate to https://app.example.com
2. Login with test credentials
3. Add item to cart
4. Click checkout
5. [FAILS HERE] Click "Complete Purchase"

**Suggested Investigation**:
- Session timeout may be too aggressive
- Check if login state persists through checkout flow

## Discoveries

Found 2 undocumented paths:
1. **Alternative checkout**: Guest checkout available via footer link
2. **Quick reorder**: "Buy again" button on order history

## Flaky Areas

Based on history (last 10 runs):
- `search-results`: 7/10 pass rate - timing issue suspected
- `image-upload`: 8/10 pass rate - file size variations

## Suggested New Tests

Based on failures and history:
1. Test session persistence during long checkout
2. Test guest checkout flow (discovered)
3. Add timeout resilience to search tests
```

#### Machine-Readable Report

    }
  ]
}
```

### Report Presentation

After generating reports:

1. **Display summary** to user:
   - Overall pass/fail counts
   - Critical failures (blocking scenarios)
   - Regressions (newly failing)

2. **Highlight actionable items**:
   - What needs investigation
   - Discovered paths to add to regime
   - Suggested test variations

3. **Offer next steps**:
   - "Would you like to add the discovered paths to the test regime?"
   - "Should I update the regime with suggested variations?"
   - "Ready to share the machine report with the bug-fix skill?"
