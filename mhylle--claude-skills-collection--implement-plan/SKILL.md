# Implement Plan

Orchestrate the execution of **complete implementation plans** by delegating each phase to the `implement-phase` skill. This skill manages the full plan lifecycle.

---

## CRITICAL: Orchestrator Pattern (MANDATORY)

> **THIS SESSION IS AN ORCHESTRATOR. YOU MUST NEVER IMPLEMENT CODE DIRECTLY.**

### The Orchestration Hierarchy

```
implement-plan (this session - ORCHESTRATOR)
    │
    │   ⛔ NEVER writes code
    │   ⛔ NEVER uses Write/Edit tools
    │   ⛔ NEVER creates files
    │
    └── implement-phase (ORCHESTRATOR for phase)
            │
            │   ⛔ NEVER writes code
            │   ⛔ NEVER uses Write/Edit tools
            │   ⛔ NEVER creates files
            │
            └── Subagents (DO the actual work)
                    │
                    ✅ Write code
                    ✅ Create files
                    ✅ Run tests
                    ✅ Fix issues
```

### What This Session Does

| DO | DO NOT |
|----|--------|
| Read plan and prompts | Write code |
| Discover phase prompts | Create files |
| Invoke implement-phase skill | Use Write/Edit tools |
| Track plan-level progress | Implement directly |
| Present results to user | Fix issues directly |
| Handle user confirmation | Run implementation commands |

### Enforcement

If you find yourself about to use Write, Edit, or NotebookEdit tools in this session:

```
⛔ STOP - You are violating the orchestrator pattern
✅ INSTEAD - Delegate to implement-phase which will spawn subagents
```

## Architecture

```

    │
    ├── Phase 1 → implement-phase → [implementation, verification, review, ADR, sync]
    │                    ↓
    │              [user confirmation]
    │                    ↓
    ├── Phase 2 → implement-phase → [implementation, verification, review, ADR, sync]
    │                    ↓
    │              [user confirmation]
    │                    ↓
    ├── Phase N → implement-phase → [...]
    │                    ↓
    └── Final Verification & Summary
```

## Responsibilities

### This Skill (implement-plan)
- Read and understand the full plan
- Sequence phases correctly
- Delegate each phase to `implement-phase`
- Handle user confirmation between phases
- Track overall plan progress
- Generate final completion report

### Delegated to implement-phase
- All implementation work
- Exit condition verification
- Code review
- ADR compliance
- Plan file synchronization

## When to Use

- Implementing pre-approved technical plans or specifications
- Executing phased development work with defined success criteria
- Following structured implementation guides with verification steps
- Resuming partially-completed implementation work

## Execution Modes

### Current Mode: Guided Execution

Each phase requires user confirmation before proceeding to the next. This is the default, safe mode.

```
Phase 1 → implement-phase → ✅ Complete → [USER CONFIRMS] → Phase 2 → ...
```

### Future Mode: Autonomous Execution

> **Note**: This mode is planned but not yet implemented. When enabled, the entire plan will execute without pauses between phases.

```
Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3 → ... → Final Report
```

Autonomous mode will require:
- Explicit user opt-in: "implement the entire plan autonomously"
- Stricter quality gates
- Comprehensive rollback capability
- Detailed execution log

## Getting Started

When given a plan path or asked to implement a plan:

### 1. Locate and Read Plan

```
1. Find the plan file (docs/plans/, thoughts/plans/, or specified path)
2. Read the ENTIRE plan - full context is essential
3. Identify total number of phases
4. Extract task_list_id from plan metadata (for multi-session support)
5. Check for existing Tasks (TaskList shows progress from previous sessions)
```

**Multi-Session Support:**
If the plan has a `task_list_id` in its metadata, ensure you're using the same task list:
```bash
CLAUDE_CODE_TASK_LIST_ID=plan-2026-01-24-feature-name claude
```
This enables multiple sessions to share progress on the same plan.

### 2. Discover Phase Prompts

Check for pre-generated prompts from the `prompt-generator` skill:

```
# Check common prompt locations
1. Glob("docs/prompts/phase-*.md")           # Standard location
2. Glob("prompts/phase-*.md")                # Alternative location

# Match prompts to phases by number
phase-1-*.md  →  Phase 1
phase-2-*.md  →  Phase 2
...
```

**Prompt Discovery Output:**
```
● Prompt Discovery:
  Found: docs/prompts/phase-1-foundation.md      → Phase 1
  Found: docs/prompts/phase-2-data-pipeline.md   → Phase 2
  Found: docs/prompts/phase-3-agent-system.md    → Phase 3
  Missing: Phase 4 (no prompt found)

  Note: Phases with prompts will use pre-generated instructions.
        Phases without prompts will use plan file directly.
```

### 3. Read Related Context

```
# Tiered ADR reading (context conservation)
1. Read("docs/decisions/INDEX.md")              # Scan all ADRs first
2. Read("docs/decisions/ADR-NNNN.md", limit=10) # Quick Reference of relevant ones
3. Read full ADR only if needed for implementation details

# Read files referenced in plan
4. Load all files mentioned in the plan
```

### 4. Check Progress via Tasks

```
# Check for existing tasks for this plan
TaskList: Check for tasks matching "Phase N:" pattern

If tasks exist:
  - Resume from first non-completed task
  - Skip already-completed phases
  - Display current progress

If no tasks exist:
  - Tasks should have been created by create-plan
  - If missing, create them now (see create-plan Phase 7)
```

**Task Status Display:**
```
Tasks (2 done, 3 open):
  ✓ #1 Phase 1: Setup
  ✓ #2 Phase 2: Core Logic
  ◻ #3 Phase 3: Integration › blocked by #2
  ◻ #4 Phase 4: Testing › blocked by #3
  ◻ #5 Phase 5: Documentation › blocked by #4
```

### 5. Begin Phase Execution

For each phase:
1. Mark task as in_progress: `TaskUpdate(task_id, status: "in_progress")`
2. Delegate to `implement-phase`
3. On completion: `TaskUpdate(task_id, status: "completed")`

```
Skill(skill="implement-phase"): Execute Phase [N] of the implementation plan.

Context:
- Plan: [plan file path]
- Phase: [N] ([Phase Name])
- Task ID: [task_id from TaskList]
- Prompt: [prompt file path, if discovered]
- Previous Phase Status: [Complete/N/A]

Execute all quality gates and return structured result.
```

**With Prompt (preferred)**:
```
Skill(skill="implement-phase"): Execute Phase 2.

Context:
- Plan: docs/plans/trading-platform.md
- Phase: 2 (Data Pipeline)
- Task ID: 2
- Prompt: docs/prompts/phase-2-data-pipeline.md
- Previous Phase Status: Complete

The prompt contains detailed orchestration instructions.
Execute all quality gates and archive prompt on completion.
```

**Without Prompt (fallback)**:
```
Skill(skill="implement-phase"): Execute Phase 4.

Context:
- Plan: docs/plans/trading-platform.md
- Phase: 4 (Integration)
- Task ID: 4
- Prompt: None (use plan directly)
- Previous Phase Status: Complete

No pre-generated prompt. Use plan file for phase details.
```

## Phase Execution Protocol

### Before Each Phase

1. **Announce** the phase about to start
2. **Summarize** what will be implemented
3. **Note** any dependencies on previous phases

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
● STARTING PHASE 2: Authentication Service
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Objectives:
- Implement login/logout logic
- JWT token generation and validation

Dependencies:
- Phase 1 (Database Schema) must be complete ✅

Delegating to implement-phase...
```

### During Phase Execution

The `implement-phase` skill handles all details:
- Subagent delegation for implementation
- Exit condition verification
- Code review via `code-review` skill
- ADR compliance checking
- Plan file synchronization

### After Each Phase

Receive structured result from `implement-phase`:

```yaml
PHASE_RESULT:
  status: COMPLETE | FAILED | BLOCKED
  steps:
    implementation: PASS
    exit_conditions: PASS
    code_review: PASS_WITH_NOTES
    adr_compliance: PASS
    plan_sync: PASS
  manual_verification:
    - "Check login flow in browser"
  ready_for_next: true
```

### User Confirmation Point

After each phase completes, pause for user confirmation:

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
● PHASE 2 COMPLETE: Authentication Service
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Results:
  ✅ Implementation: 3 files created, 2 modified
  ✅ Exit Conditions: All passed
  ✅ Code Review: Passed with 2 recommendations
  ✅ ADR Compliance: Passed
  ✅ Plan Updated: 8 tasks marked complete

Manual Verification Required:
  - [ ] POST /auth/login returns token with expected claims
  - [ ] POST /auth/logout invalidates session

Recommendations (non-blocking):
  1. Consider using project's CustomLogger
  2. Add ADR-0012 reference to plan

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Please confirm manual verification steps, then respond to
proceed to Phase 3: API Endpoints
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

## Handling Blockers

When `implement-phase` returns a blocker:

### From implement-phase

```yaml
PHASE_RESULT:
  status: BLOCKED
  blocker: "Existing JWT implementation found in src/legacy/auth.js"
  options:
    - "Proceed with new implementation"
    - "Refactor legacy code"
    - "Abort and revise plan"
```

### Orchestrator Response

1. **STOP** further phase execution
2. **PRESENT** the blocker to user with options
3. **AWAIT** user decision
4. **RESUME** or **ABORT** based on decision

```
⛔ PHASE 2 BLOCKED

Issue: Existing JWT implementation found in src/legacy/auth.js.
The plan specifies creating new jwt.strategy.ts but doesn't
mention legacy code.

Options:
A) Proceed with new implementation, mark legacy for removal
B) Refactor legacy code instead of creating new file
C) Abort and revise the plan

Recommendation: Option A - cleaner separation

How should I proceed?
```

## Resuming Interrupted Work

Tasks persist across sessions, enabling seamless resume:

1. **Call TaskList** - Get all tasks for the plan
2. **Find first non-completed task** - This is the resume point
3. **Verify state** - Quick sanity check that previous work exists
4. **Continue** - Resume from the pending task

```
● Plan Status: Resuming interrupted work

Task Status (from TaskList):
  ✓ #1 Phase 1: Database Schema - completed
  ✓ #2 Phase 2: Authentication Service - completed
  ◻ #3 Phase 3: API Endpoints - in_progress  ← Resume here
  ◻ #4 Phase 4: Testing - pending (blocked by #3)

Resume Point: Phase 3 (API Endpoints)

Continuing from Phase 3...
```

**Multi-Session Resume:**
```bash
# Start new session with same task list
CLAUDE_CODE_TASK_LIST_ID=plan-2026-01-24-user-auth claude

# Tasks automatically show current progress
# Resume from where any session left off
```

**Benefits of Task-based resume:**
- Cross-session persistence (tasks survive session restart)
- Multi-session support (share progress across terminals)
- Dependency tracking (blocked tasks visible)
- Clear audit trail of progress

## Final Completion

After all phases complete:

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
● PLAN COMPLETE: User Authentication Implementation
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Summary:
  Phases Completed: 3/3
  Files Created: 12
  Files Modified: 5
  Tests Added: 47
  ADRs Created: 1 (ADR-0015)

Quality Gates (all phases):
  ✅ All exit conditions passed
  ✅ All code reviews passed
  ✅ All ADR compliance checks passed
  ✅ Plan fully synchronized

Final Verification:
  - [ ] E2E tests pass: `npm run test:e2e`
  - [ ] API documentation updated
  - [ ] Security review checklist complete

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Implementation complete. Ready for final review.
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

## Progress Tracking

Progress is tracked via **Task tools** with cross-session persistence. See [ADR-0001](../../docs/decisions/ADR-0001-separate-plan-spec-from-progress-tracking.md).

| Tracking Method | Scope | Purpose |
|-----------------|-------|---------|
| TaskList/TaskUpdate | Persistent | Track phase-level progress across sessions |
| Plan File | Persistent | Specification document (updated with ✅ on completion) |
| Status Updates | User | Communicate current state |

**Task Lifecycle:**
```
create-plan → TaskCreate (all phases with dependencies)
                  ↓
implement-plan → TaskUpdate(in_progress) → implement-phase → TaskUpdate(completed)
                  ↓
Resume (any session) → TaskList (find first pending task)
```

**Multi-Session Workflow:**
```bash
# Session 1: Start implementation
CLAUDE_CODE_TASK_LIST_ID=plan-my-feature claude
> /implement-plan docs/plans/my-feature.md
# ... complete Phase 1, 2 ...

# Session 2: Resume from another terminal
CLAUDE_CODE_TASK_LIST_ID=plan-my-feature claude
> /implement-plan docs/plans/my-feature.md
# Automatically resumes from Phase 3
```

Phase-level tracking is handled by `implement-phase` using Task tools.

## Reference Materials

See `references/plan-format.md` for:
- Standard plan structure and formatting
- Phase organization guidelines
- Exit condition patterns
- Verification step templates

## Key Principles

1. **Delegate phase execution** - Use `implement-phase` for all phase work
2. **Orchestrate, don't implement** - This skill coordinates, not codes
3. **User confirmation between phases** - Pause for human validation (current mode)
4. **Trust implement-phase results** - Act on structured return values
5. **Surface blockers immediately** - Don't hide problems from the user
6. **Track at plan level** - Let implement-phase handle phase-level tracking
7. **Prepare for automation** - Structure supports future autonomous mode
