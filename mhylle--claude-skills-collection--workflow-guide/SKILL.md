# Workflow Guide

A lightweight decision skill that recommends the appropriate workflow mode based on your task characteristics.

## Overview

The skills collection offers three parallel workflow modes. This guide helps you choose the right one by asking a few targeted questions about your task.

| Mode | Ideation | Planning | Implementation |
|------|----------|----------|---------------|
| **Solo** | `/brainstorm` | `/create-plan` | `/implement-plan` |
| **Small team** | `/team-brainstorm` | `/team-create-plan` | `/team-implement-plan` |
| **Full team** | `/team-brainstorm` | `/team-create-plan` | `/team-implement-plan-full` |

## Initial Response

When invoked, respond:

> "I'll help you pick the right workflow mode. Let me ask a few quick questions about your task."

## Assessment Questions

Ask these questions in order. After the user answers, you may have enough information to recommend immediately — do not ask unnecessary questions.

### Question 1: Scope

> "How would you describe the scope of this work?"
>
> - **A) Small** — A single feature, bug fix, or focused change (1-2 files, clear requirements)
> - **B) Moderate** — Multiple related changes across several files (3-10 files, some design decisions needed)
> - **C) Large** — A system-level change, new subsystem, or multi-phase project (10+ files, architectural decisions required)

### Question 2: Stakes

> "How critical is quality for this change?"
>
> - **A) Low** — Internal tooling, prototype, or experiment. Speed matters more than perfection
> - **B) Medium** — Production code, but well-tested area. Standard quality expectations
> - **C) High** — Security-sensitive, user-facing, or high-risk area. Adversarial review needed

### Question 3: Parallelism Potential

Only ask this if Scope is Moderate or Large:

> "Can parts of this work be done independently and in parallel?"
>
> - **A) No** — Each step depends on the previous one
> - **B) Somewhat** — Some parts are independent, but there are key dependencies
> - **C) Yes** — Multiple phases could proceed simultaneously with clear boundaries

## Recommendation Logic

Use the answers to recommend a mode:

### Solo Mode

**Recommend when:**
- Scope is Small (regardless of other answers)
- Scope is Moderate AND Stakes are Low
- Scope is Moderate AND Parallelism is No

**Why:** Minimal overhead, fastest for focused work. The orchestrator + subagent pattern handles sequential implementation efficiently.

**Token cost:** ~30-40K per phase

### Small Team Mode

**Recommend when:**
- Scope is Moderate AND Stakes are Medium or High
- Scope is Moderate AND Parallelism is Somewhat
- Scope is Large AND Parallelism is No
- Scope is Large AND Stakes are Medium (and phases are sequential)

**Why:** Adds adversarial review without the overhead of parallel execution. The Implementer/Reviewer dynamic catches issues that automated checks miss.

**Token cost:** ~60-80K per phase

### Full Team Mode

**Recommend when:**
- Scope is Large AND Parallelism is Somewhat or Yes
- Scope is Large AND Stakes are High
- Any combination where the plan has 4+ phases with independent work streams

**Why:** Parallel execution across phases with cross-phase review. Worth the coordination cost when you have genuinely independent work streams.

**Token cost:** ~100-150K per wave

## Decision Matrix

| Scope | Stakes | Parallelism | Recommendation |
|-------|--------|-------------|---------------|
| Small | Any | N/A | **Solo** |
| Moderate | Low | Any | **Solo** |
| Moderate | Medium | No | **Solo** |
| Moderate | Medium | Somewhat/Yes | **Small Team** |
| Moderate | High | Any | **Small Team** |
| Large | Low | No | **Solo** |
| Large | Low | Somewhat/Yes | **Small Team** |
| Large | Medium | No | **Small Team** |
| Large | Medium | Somewhat/Yes | **Full Team** |
| Large | High | No | **Small Team** |
| Large | High | Somewhat/Yes | **Full Team** |

## Output Format

After assessment, present the recommendation:

```
## Recommendation: [Mode Name]

**Your answers:** Scope: [answer] | Stakes: [answer] | Parallelism: [answer]

### Why this mode?
[1-2 sentences explaining the fit]

### What to do next

| Stage | Command |
|-------|---------|
| Ideation (if needed) | `/{command}` |
| Planning | `/{command}` |
| Implementation | `/{command}` |

### Alternative to consider
[If the recommendation is borderline, mention the adjacent mode and when to switch]
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Small bug fix

> **User:** "I need to fix a date formatting bug in the dashboard."
>
> **Assessment:** Scope: Small. No further questions needed.
>
> **Recommendation:** Solo mode. Use `/create-plan` then `/implement-plan`.

### Example 2: New authentication system

> **User:** "I want to add OAuth2 support with Google and GitHub providers."
>
> **Assessment:** Scope: Large (new subsystem, multiple integration points). Stakes: High (security-sensitive). Parallelism: Somewhat (Google and GitHub providers are independent, but share auth infrastructure).
>
> **Recommendation:** Full Team mode. Use `/team-brainstorm` to explore the design, `/team-create-plan` for adversarial planning, `/team-implement-plan-full` for parallel provider implementation with shared review.

### Example 3: Refactoring a module

> **User:** "I want to refactor the data processing module to use the new streaming API."
>
> **Assessment:** Scope: Moderate (multiple files, design decisions). Stakes: Medium (production code). Parallelism: No (sequential refactoring).
>
> **Recommendation:** Solo mode. The refactoring is sequential by nature. Use `/create-plan` then `/implement-plan`. Consider Small Team if you want adversarial review of the refactoring approach during planning (`/team-create-plan`).
