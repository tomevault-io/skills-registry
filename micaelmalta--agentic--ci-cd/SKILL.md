# CI/CD Skill

## Core Philosophy

**"Pipeline as code: repeatable, fast, and visible."**

Keep CI config in version control, make steps deterministic, and fail fast on build/test/lint. Deploy only from a defined pipeline when possible.

---

## Protocol

### 1. Identify System

| System             | Config location            | Typical use                        |
| ------------------ | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **GitHub Actions** | `.github/workflows/*.yml`  | Build, test, lint, release, deploy |
| **GitLab CI**      | `.gitlab-ci.yml`           | Same                               |
| **Jenkins**        | `Jenkinsfile` or UI        | Same                               |
| **CircleCI**       | `.circleci/config.yml`     | Same                               |
| **Other**          | Repo root or `ci/`, `.ci/` | Check project README or docs       |

Respect existing layout and naming (e.g. `build.yml`, `test.yml`, `deploy.yml`).

### 2. Pipeline Stages

- **Build**: Compile/install; produce artifacts. Cache deps when supported.
- **Test**: Unit and integration; use same commands as local (e.g. `npm test`, `pytest`).
- **Lint**: Linters and formatters; fail on violation or auto-fix and commit, per project policy.
- **Migrate**: Run database migrations before or during deploy (see Database Migrations below).
- **Deploy**: Only from main/release or tags; use secrets for credentials; prefer idempotent steps.

Add or change one job/workflow at a time; run the pipeline to verify.

### 3. Database Migrations in CI

Run database migrations before or during deploy as a separate CI step.

**Quick reference:** Run migrations in test/staging/production stages. Use ecosystem-specific commands (Prisma, Knex, Alembic, Django, goose, Rails). If migration fails, stop deployment.

**For complete database migration guide:** See [reference/DB_MIGRATIONS.md](reference/DB_MIGRATIONS.md), which covers:
- Migration stages and considerations
- Commands by ecosystem (Node, Python, Go, Ruby)
- CI migration patterns
- Zero-downtime migrations (multi-phase approach)
- Testing migrations (up/down, rollback)
- Common issues (lock timeout, constraint violations, dependencies)
- Rollback strategy and troubleshooting

### 4. Environment & Config Management

| Concern           | Approach                                                                                   |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Secrets**       | Use platform secret store (GitHub Secrets, Vault, AWS SSM); never in code or logs. See Secrets Safety below |
| **Env vars**      | Define in workflow YAML or platform settings; document required vars in README             |
| **Config files**  | Use environment-specific files (`.env.production`, `config/prod.json`) or inject at deploy |
| **Feature flags** | Integrate with flag service (LaunchDarkly, Unleash, custom) or env vars for simple cases   |

**Environment parity**: Keep dev/staging/prod as similar as possible. Document differences (e.g. mock services in dev).

**Config by environment:**

```yaml
# Example: GitHub Actions environment-specific deploy
jobs:
  deploy:
    environment: production # Uses production secrets
    env:
      DATABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.DATABASE_URL }}
      API_KEY: ${{ secrets.API_KEY }}
```

### 5. Observability & Monitoring

Set up observability (logging, metrics, tracing, alerts) in the pipeline and deployed application.

**Quick reference:** Use structured logs (JSON), track RED metrics (Requests, Errors, Duration), implement distributed tracing for microservices, alert on error rate spikes and latency. Add deployment events and smoke tests to CI.

**MCP (Datadog):** Use Datadog MCP (after `/setup`) to query metrics, search logs, check monitors, and validate deployment impact.

**For complete observability guide:** See [reference/OBSERVABILITY.md](reference/OBSERVABILITY.md), which covers:
- Observability layers (Logging, Metrics, Tracing, Alerts)
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Application metrics (RED method) and infrastructure metrics
- Distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry/Jaeger
- Alert rules and routing (PagerDuty, Slack)
- CI observability (deployment events, smoke tests)
- Health checks (liveness, readiness)
- Datadog MCP integration and best practices

### 6. Release Management

| Aspect               | Approach                                                                               |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Versioning**       | Semantic versioning (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`); automate with tools like `semantic-release` |
| **Tagging**          | Tag releases in git; deploy from tags for production                                   |
| **Changelog**        | Auto-generate from conventional commits or maintain manually (see git-commits skill)   |
| **Release branches** | Use `release/*` branches for staged releases; or deploy from `main` with tags          |

**Release workflow:**

1. Merge to main (or release branch)
2. CI creates version tag (from commits or manual)
3. CI builds release artifacts
4. Deploy to staging → production (gated)
5. Create GitHub Release with changelog

### 7. Fixing Failures

- **Read logs**: Identify failing step and error message.
- **Reproduce locally**: Run the same command (e.g. install, test, lint) in the same env (version, OS) when possible.
- **Fix**: Fix the code or the pipeline (dependency, env var, path, permission). Prefer fixing the cause over relaxing checks (e.g. don't disable tests to make CI green).
- **Secrets**: Never log or commit secrets; use the platform's secret store and reference by name. See Secrets Safety below.
- **Migration failures**: Check for locked tables, constraint violations, or missing dependencies; test migrations in staging first.

### Secrets Safety

Never log or commit secrets; always use platform secret store (GitHub Secrets, Vault, AWS SSM) and reference by name.

**Quick reference:**
- ❌ BAD: Hardcoded secrets, secrets in logs, secrets in code
- ✅ GOOD: Reference from secret store, mask in output, read from environment variables

**For complete secrets safety guide:** See [reference/SECRETS.md](reference/SECRETS.md), which covers:
- BAD practices (hardcoded, logged, committed secrets)
- GOOD practices (secret stores, masking, environment variables)
- Secret store options (GitHub, AWS, Vault, Azure, GCP)
- Secret scanning (git-secrets, GitHub scanning, TruffleHog)
- Secret rotation (when, how, zero-downtime)
- Handling secret leaks (revoke, rotate, investigate)
- Best practices by platform (GitHub Actions, GitLab, CircleCI)

For deep security analysis, invoke the **security-reviewer** skill.

### 8. Conventions

- Use matrix or parallel jobs for multiple runtimes/versions when relevant.
- Cache dependency installs (e.g. npm, pip, bundler) to speed runs.
- Set explicit versions for runtimes (e.g. `node-version`, `python-version`) so runs are reproducible.
- Document in README or `docs/ci.md` how to run the same steps locally.
- Document required environment variables and how to obtain secrets.

### 9. Commands

- **Trigger/check**: Push branch, open PR, or use "Re-run" in the CI UI.
- **Local parity**: Run the same install/test/lint commands as in the workflow (see workflow YAML).
- **Release**: `npm version patch/minor/major`, `git tag v1.2.3`, or use semantic-release.

- [ ] Build and test steps match local commands and versions where practical.
- [ ] Failures are addressed by fixing cause, not by skipping or weakening checks.
- [ ] Secrets are in secret store only; not in logs or code.
- [ ] Deploy steps are gated (branch/tag) and use credentials from secret store.
- [ ] Database migrations run in CI with rollback strategy documented.
- [ ] Environment variables documented; config separated from code.
- [ ] Observability configured: logging, metrics, alerts for deployments.
- [ ] Release process defined: versioning, tagging, changelog generation.

## Cross-Skill Integration

| Situation | Skill to invoke | How |
|-----------|----------------|-----|
| CI needs observability/monitoring | **Datadog MCP** | Use `list_monitors`, `query_metrics` (after `/setup`) |
| Pipeline has security concerns | **security-reviewer** skill | Read `skills/security-reviewer/SKILL.md` |
| CI tests failing | **testing** / **debugging** skill | Read respective SKILL.md files |
| Database migration in pipeline | Also check **testing** skill | Section 8: Database Migration Testing |
