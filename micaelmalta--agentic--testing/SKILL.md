# Testing Skill

## Core Philosophy

**"Tests document behavior and prevent regressions."**

Design and run tests that are fast, deterministic, and focused. Prefer testing behavior over implementation.

**⛔ TESTING IS MANDATORY - NOT OPTIONAL**

When working within the workflow skill:

- **NEVER** present tests as "optional" or "next steps"
- **NEVER** complete a workflow without tests passing
- **ALWAYS** write and run tests before commit
- **STOP** the workflow if tests are missing and write them first

For frontend/UI projects:

- Tests (`npm test` or equivalent) MUST pass
- Build (`npm run build` or equivalent) MUST succeed
- E2E tests via Playwright MCP MUST pass (if UI exists)

For backend projects (Go, Python, Ruby, etc.):

- Tests MUST pass before any commit

---

## Protocol

### 1. Understand Scope

- **Unit**: Single function/class in isolation (mocks for deps).
- **Integration**: Multiple components together (real or test doubles).
- **E2E**: Full stack or user flows (browser/API).

Choose the right level; avoid testing implementation details in unit tests.

**MANDATORY: For any UI-related testing, you MUST use the Playwright MCP server.** If the Playwright MCP is not configured, run `/setup` first to add it before proceeding with UI tests.

### 2. Test Design

- **Arrange** – Set up inputs and dependencies.
- **Act** – Call the code under test.
- **Assert** – Check outcomes and side effects.

One logical assertion per test when possible. Name tests by behavior: `it("returns 404 when resource is missing")` not `it("works")`.

### 3. Commands (by ecosystem)

| Context    | Command                                                     | Purpose                              |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Node/JS/TS | `npm test` or `npx vitest` / `jest`                         | Run test suite                       |
| Python     | `pytest` or `python -m pytest`                              | Run tests                            |
| Go         | `go test -race ./...`                                       | Run all packages with race detection |
| Rust       | `cargo test`                                                | Run tests                            |
| Generic    | Run the project’s test script from README or `package.json` | Respect project conventions          |

Run tests after changes. Fix or skip failing tests before adding new ones.

### 4. Coverage

- Use coverage only to find gaps, not as a target by itself.
- Prefer: critical paths, edge cases, and error handling.
- Report coverage when asked: `pytest --cov`, `npm run test:coverage`, `go test -race -cover ./...`, etc.

### 5. UI Testing with Playwright MCP (MANDATORY for UI)

**When the application has a UI, Playwright MCP is MANDATORY for E2E and UI testing.**

**Prerequisites:** Ensure Playwright MCP is configured via `/setup`. If not available, stop and run `/setup` before proceeding.

**Quick reference:** Playwright MCP provides browser automation tools (`browser_navigate`, `browser_click`, `browser_type`, `browser_screenshot`, `browser_snapshot`, `browser_wait_for`, etc.) for testing user flows, visual regression, and accessibility.

**For complete UI testing guide:** See [reference/UI_TESTING.md](reference/UI_TESTING.md), which covers:
- Playwright MCP capabilities and when to use them
- Example UI test flows (login, forms, multi-step wizards)
- Best practices (semantic selectors, waiting for dynamic content)
- Configuration and troubleshooting
- Integration with testing frameworks

### 6. Accessibility (a11y) Testing

Test that the application is usable by people with disabilities.

**Test types:** Automated (axe-core, pa11y, Lighthouse), Keyboard (tab order, focus), Screen reader (VoiceOver, NVDA, JAWS).

**Quick reference:** Test color contrast, alt text, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and screen reader announcements. Follow WCAG 2.1 Level AA guidelines.

**For complete a11y testing guide:** See [reference/A11Y_TESTING.md](reference/A11Y_TESTING.md), which covers:
- Automated, keyboard, and screen reader testing
- WCAG 2.1 criteria (Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust)
- Common issues and fixes
- Tools and resources
- Integration with CI/CD

### 7. Internationalization (i18n) Testing

Test that the application works correctly across languages and locales.

**Test types:** Translation coverage (no hardcoded text), Locale formatting (dates, numbers, currencies), RTL support (Arabic, Hebrew), Text expansion, Pluralization, Character encoding (Unicode, no mojibake).

**Quick reference:** Use pseudo-localization to catch hardcoded strings, test with longest translations (German), test RTL layouts (Arabic), verify pluralization rules per language.

**For complete i18n testing guide:** See [reference/I18N_TESTING.md](reference/I18N_TESTING.md), which covers:
- Translation coverage and pseudo-localization
- Locale formatting (dates, numbers, currencies)
- RTL (right-to-left) support testing
- Text expansion and UI breakage detection
- Pluralization for different languages
- Character encoding and mojibake detection
- Tools (i18next, FormatJS, Crowdin, Lokalise)

### 8. Database Migration Testing

Test that migrations work correctly and are reversible:

| Test               | Purpose                                            |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Up migration**   | Schema changes apply without error                 |
| **Down migration** | Rollback works; schema returns to previous state   |
| **Data integrity** | Existing data survives migration; constraints hold |
| **Idempotency**    | Running migration twice doesn't fail or corrupt    |

**Migration testing in CI:**

1. Start with clean DB
2. Run all migrations up
3. Seed with test data
4. Run latest migration down, then up again
5. Verify data integrity

### 9. LLM Evaluation and Testing

Test LLM-powered features (skills, agents, AI-assisted workflows) with specialized approaches.

**Challenges:** Non-deterministic outputs, semantic correctness, evaluation complexity, cost/latency.

**Quick reference:** Test behavior/outcomes (not exact output), use temperature=0 for deterministic tests, mock LLM calls for unit tests, run expensive E2E tests selectively, use scoring-based evaluation for quality.

**For complete LLM evaluation guide:** See [reference/LLM_EVALUATION.md](reference/LLM_EVALUATION.md), which covers:
- Testing challenges with LLMs (non-determinism, evaluation metrics, flaky tests)
- Test types (unit with mocks, integration, E2E with real LLM, regression/snapshot)
- Deterministic vs scoring-based tests
- Prompt evaluation frameworks (PromptFoo, LangSmith)
- Skill validation patterns (outcome-based, property-based, LLM-as-judge, differential)
- Common pitfalls (over-fitting, flaky tests, testing implementation details)
- Example test patterns and tools

### 10. Output

When adding or updating tests, provide:

- Short rationale (what behavior is covered).
- How to run the new/updated tests.
- Any new dependencies or config (e.g. test framework, env vars).

## Checklist

**⛔ MANDATORY (workflow cannot proceed without these):**

- [ ] Tests written for new/changed code
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Build succeeds (frontend/compiled languages)
- [ ] **UI: E2E tests via Playwright MCP pass** (mandatory if UI exists)

**Quality checks:**

- [ ] Tests are deterministic (no flake from time/random/network).
- [ ] No tests that only assert implementation details.
- [ ] Failures give clear messages (assertions describe expected vs actual).
- [ ] Test file/names follow project layout and naming.
- [ ] Accessibility tests pass (axe-core or equivalent); keyboard navigation works.
- [ ] i18n tested: no hardcoded strings, locale formatting correct, RTL supported (if applicable).
- [ ] Database migrations tested: up, down, and data integrity verified.

**⚠️ NEVER output "Optional: Add tests" - testing is MANDATORY.**
