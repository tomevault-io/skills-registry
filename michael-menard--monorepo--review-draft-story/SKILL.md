# /review-draft-story - Draft Story Review

## Description

Full-spectrum story review using parallel specialist sub-agents BEFORE implementation begins. Each specialist reviews from their domain perspective, findings are aggregated, and a final readiness decision is produced.

**Key Features:**

- Parallel specialist sub-agents (PM, UX, SM/Checklist)
- Product requirements completeness validation
- UX/UI specification review
- Implementation readiness assessment
- Consolidated feedback and recommendations
- GO/NO-GO decision with actionable fixes

## Usage

```bash
# Review a specific story
/review-draft-story 2002

# Review a story by ID
/review-draft-story WISH-2002

# Quick review (skip deep analysis)
/review-draft-story 2002 --quick

# Focus on specific aspect
/review-draft-story 2002 --focus=ux

# Skip PM review (no product context available)
/review-draft-story 2002 --skip-pm
```

## Parameters

- **story** - Story number (e.g., `2002`) or full path to story file
- **--quick** - Run lightweight review, skip deep specialists
- **--focus** - Focus on specific aspect: `pm`, `ux`, or `sm`
- **--skip-pm** - Skip PM review if no PRD/epic context
- **--skip-ux** - Skip UX review if no UI in this story

---

## EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS

**CRITICAL: Use Task tool to spawn parallel sub-agents. Use TodoWrite to track progress.**

---

## Context Optimization Strategy

**To minimize context consumption:**

1. **Don't load epic/architecture content into parent** - only get file paths
2. **Pass file paths to sub-agents** - let them read files directly
3. **Use concise YAML output** - only report issues, not all sections
4. **SM checklist: reference file** - don't duplicate all items in prompt
5. **Use Haiku for sub-agents** - faster and cheaper

**Impact:** Reduces parent context by 60-80% for stories with large epic/architecture docs.

---

## Phase 0: Initialize & Gather Context

```
TodoWrite([
  { content: "Gather story context", status: "in_progress", activeForm: "Gathering context" },
  { content: "Spawn specialist sub-agents", status: "pending", activeForm: "Spawning specialists" },
  { content: "Collect specialist feedback", status: "pending", activeForm: "Collecting feedback" },
  { content: "Aggregate findings", status: "pending", activeForm: "Aggregating findings" },
  { content: "Generate review report", status: "pending", activeForm: "Generating report" }
])
```

**Gather context:**

1. Fetch story from KB: `kb_get_story({ story_id: "{STORY_ID}", include_artifacts: true })`
2. Extract from the KB story record:
   - Title and description
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Tasks/subtasks
   - Dev Notes (from story fields or attached artifacts)
   - Testing section
   - Referenced files/architecture paths (just paths, not content)
3. Get parent epic from KB if referenced: `kb_search({ query: "epic {epic_name}", tags: ["plan"] })`
4. Get architecture doc references if present (don't read content — pass references to sub-agents)
5. Determine if story has UI components (affects UX review)

**OPTIMIZATION: Don't load epic/architecture content into parent context - pass file paths to sub-agents**

**Skip Logic:**

- Skip UX review if story has no UI components (API-only, backend, migrations)
- Skip PM review if `--skip-pm` or no epic/PRD context available

              - Are ACs written from user perspective (not technical)?

           5. **Dependencies & Sequencing**
              - Are dependencies clearly identified?
              - Is this story properly sequenced in the epic?
              - Are there hidden dependencies?

           6. **Risk Identification**
              - Are potential risks called out?
              - Are there business/compliance considerations?
              - Is there fallback behavior defined?

           Output format (ONLY include sections with issues):

### 1.3 Scrum Master / Implementation Readiness Specialist

**This sub-agent executes the standard story draft checklist criteria.**

````
Task(
  subagent_type: "general-purpose",
  model: "haiku",
  description: "SM checklist review",
  run_in_background: true,
  prompt: "You are Bob, a Scrum Master executing the Story Draft Checklist.

           Story ID: {STORY_ID}

           IMPORTANT:
           1. Fetch the story from KB: kb_get_story({ story_id: '{STORY_ID}', include_artifacts: true })
           2. Use the standard story draft checklist criteria:
              - Requirements clarity: Are requirements clearly defined and unambiguous?
              - Technical guidance: Are technical decisions and architecture guidance provided?
              - Testing: Are test scenarios defined including error/edge cases?
              - Self-containment: Can a developer implement this without seeking additional context?
              - Tasks: Are tasks broken down to a manageable level?
           3. Execute each checklist item systematically
           4. For each item, mark: [x] PASS, [~] PARTIAL, [ ] FAIL
           5. Identify blocking vs should_fix vs note issues

           Output format (ONLY include actual issues):
           ```yaml
           sm_review:
             overall_assessment: READY|NEEDS_REVISION|BLOCKED
             clarity_score: 1-10
             could_implement: true|false

             issues:
               - category: goal_clarity|technical_guidance|references|self_containment|testing

             developer_questions:
               - 'Question a dev would have'

             summary: 'Brief 1-2 sentence assessment from dev perspective'
           ```

           NOTE: Only list actual issues. If everything passes, issues array should be empty."
)
````

---

## Phase 2: Collect Results

**Wait for all specialists to complete:**

```
results = {
  pm: TaskOutput(task_id: "{pm_id}", block: true),
  ux: TaskOutput(task_id: "{ux_id}", block: true),
  sm: TaskOutput(task_id: "{sm_id}", block: true)
}
```

---

## Phase 3: Synthesize Concerns

**Parent orchestrator extracts and synthesizes all sub-agent findings into a unified concerns list:**

```yaml
concerns:
  - id: 1
    source: pm|ux|sm
    severity: blocking|should_fix|note
    category: requirements|scope|ux|technical|testing|etc
    concern: 'Clear description of the issue'
    suggestion: 'How to address it'
```

**Severity Levels:**

- **blocking**: Must fix before story can proceed
- **should_fix**: Important issue that should be addressed
- **note**: Minor observation, nice-to-have improvement

**Synthesis Rules (MUCH SIMPLER NOW):**

1. Parse YAML output from each sub-agent
2. Concatenate all `issues` arrays from PM, UX, and SM
3. Add sequential IDs and source labels
4. Sort by severity (blocking → should_fix → note)
5. Deduplicate if needed (keep highest severity)

**Example:**

```python
all_issues = pm_review.issues + ux_review.issues + sm_review.issues
concerns = [
  {id: i+1, source: issue.source, **issue}
  for i, issue in enumerate(sorted(all_issues, key=lambda x: severity_rank[x.severity]))
]
```

---

## Phase 4: Decision & Action

**Decision Logic:**

```python
blocking_count = len([c for c in concerns if c.severity == 'blocking'])
should_fix_count = len([c for c in concerns if c.severity == 'should_fix'])

if blocking_count > 0:
    decision = 'FAIL'
    action = 'APPEND_CONCERNS_TO_STORY'
elif should_fix_count > 0:
    decision = 'CONCERNS'
    action = 'APPEND_CONCERNS_TO_STORY'
else:
    decision = 'PASS'
    action = 'APPROVE_STORY'  # or MERGE_PR if post-implementation
```

---

### Path A: FAIL or CONCERNS → Write Review Artifact to KB

**Write concerns as a KB review artifact:**

Call `kb_write_artifact({ story_id: "{STORY_ID}", artifact_type: "review", artifact_name: "REVIEW-DRAFT", content: {concerns_content} })` with the following content structure:

```yaml
review_date: '{ISO-8601}'
reviewed_by: 'PM (John), UX (Sally), SM (Bob)'
decision: '{FAIL|CONCERNS}'

blocking_issues:
  - id: 1
    source: pm
    category: requirements
    concern: 'User value not clearly articulated'
    suggestion: 'Add explicit user benefit statement to story description'

  - id: 2
    source: sm
    category: testing
    concern: 'No test scenarios defined for error cases'
    suggestion: 'Add error handling test cases to Testing section'

should_fix_issues:
  - id: 3
    source: ux
    category: states
    concern: 'Loading state not specified'
    suggestion: 'Define skeleton/spinner behavior during data fetch'

notes:
  - id: 4
    source: pm
    category: scope
    concern: 'Consider splitting into two stories if complexity grows'
```

**Update story status in KB:**

```
kb_update_story_status({ story_id: "{STORY_ID}", status: "needs_revision" })  # if FAIL
kb_update_story_status({ story_id: "{STORY_ID}", status: "created" })         # if CONCERNS (can proceed with awareness)
```

---

### Path B: PASS (No Concerns) → Auto-Approve

**When all sub-agents return zero blocking or should_fix concerns:**

#### For Draft Story Review (pre-implementation):

1. **Update story status to Approved in KB:**

   ```
   kb_update_story_status({ story_id: "{STORY_ID}", status: "ready" })
   ```

2. **Write approval artifact to KB:**

   ```
   kb_write_artifact({ story_id: "{STORY_ID}", artifact_type: "review", artifact_name: "REVIEW-DRAFT", content: {
     review_date: "{ISO-8601}",
     reviewed_by: "PM (John), UX (Sally), SM (Bob)",
     decision: "APPROVED",
     summary: "All review criteria passed. Story is ready for implementation."
   }})
   ```

3. **Report success and next step:**
   ```
   ✓ APPROVED - Ready for /implement {story_id}
   ```

#### For PR Review (post-implementation):

1. **Merge the PR:**

   ```bash
   gh pr merge {PR_NUMBER} --squash --delete-branch
   ```

2. **Update story status to Done in KB:**

   ```
   kb_update_story_status({ story_id: "{STORY_ID}", status: "UAT" })
   ```

3. **Close associated GitHub issue (if any):**
   ```bash
   gh issue close {ISSUE_NUMBER} --comment "Completed and merged in PR #{PR_NUMBER}"
   ```

## Usage Modes

### Draft Story Review (pre-implementation)

```bash
/review-draft-story 2002
```

- Reviews story before coding begins
- PASS → status becomes "Approved", ready for `/implement`
- CONCERNS/FAIL → concerns appended, status becomes "Needs Revision"

### PR Review (post-implementation)

```bash
/review-draft-story 2002 --pr
```

- Reviews story after implementation, with associated PR
- PASS → PR merged, story archived, status becomes "Done"
- CONCERNS/FAIL → concerns appended, PR remains open

### Quick Review

```bash
/review-draft-story 2002 --quick
```

- Lightweight review, skips deep analysis
- Good for simple stories or re-reviews after fixes

### Skip Specific Reviewers

```bash
/review-draft-story 2002 --skip-ux    # API-only story
/review-draft-story 2002 --skip-pm    # No PRD context available
```
