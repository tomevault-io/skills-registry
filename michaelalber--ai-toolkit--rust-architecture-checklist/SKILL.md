# Rust Architecture Checklist

> "Rust's ownership system is not a constraint — it is a design tool. Code that fights the borrow checker is code that has not yet found its correct shape."
> -- Adapted from the Rust community

> "The compiler enforces memory safety. The architect enforces everything else."
> -- Rust Architecture Principle

## Core Philosophy

Rust's compiler enforces memory safety at compile time, eliminating entire vulnerability classes that plague C, C++, and even garbage-collected languages. This is a profound strength — but it creates a false sense of security. The compiler cannot enforce API design, trait coherence, error handling discipline, `unsafe` block correctness, or crate boundary hygiene. Those are architectural concerns, and they are what this checklist addresses.

This skill is a **checklist executor**, not a Socratic coach. It detects the project's context (Rust edition, async runtime, workspace structure), runs a systematic checklist, produces graded findings with file and line evidence, and recommends concrete improvements. The goal is a codebase that is not just memory-safe but also maintainable, idiomatic, and operationally sound.

**Non-Negotiable Constraints:**

1. **Detect before judge** — Identify Rust edition (2015/2018/2021), async runtime (Tokio/async-std/none), and workspace vs. single-crate structure before running any checklist items. Context changes what is idiomatic.
2. **Clippy must pass** — `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` is the baseline. A project that fails Clippy has not met the minimum bar. Report Clippy failures before running the architectural checklist.
3. **Evidence-based findings** — Every finding must cite a specific file and line number. "The codebase overuses `clone()`" is not a finding. "`src/handlers/order.rs:47` calls `.clone()` on a `Vec<OrderItem>` that could be borrowed" is a finding.
4. **`unsafe` blocks require justification** — Every `unsafe` block must have a `// SAFETY:` comment explaining the invariant that makes the code safe. Blocks without this comment are automatic High findings.
5. **Edition-aware idioms** — Rust 2021 idioms differ from Rust 2015. Do not flag 2015-era patterns as violations in a 2015-edition crate without noting the edition context.

## Domain Principles Table

| # | Principle | Description | Applied As |
|---|-----------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | **Ownership Discipline** | Unnecessary `clone()` calls are a code smell indicating the author fought the borrow checker instead of working with it. `Rc`/`Arc` should appear only when shared ownership is genuinely required — not as a workaround for lifetime complexity. | Scan for `.clone()` calls on non-trivial types; scan for `Rc`/`Arc` usage and verify each is justified by shared ownership semantics. |
| 2 | **Trait Coherence** | Traits define behavior contracts. "Marker trait soup" — implementing many traits on a type to satisfy generic bounds without clear semantic meaning — creates coupling and confusion. Trait implementations should be intentional and documented. | Check that trait implementations have clear semantic purpose; flag blanket implementations that exist only to satisfy compiler requirements without adding meaning. |
| 3 | **Error Handling Discipline** | `.unwrap()` and `.expect()` in library code are bugs waiting to happen. `thiserror` is the idiomatic choice for library error types; `anyhow` is appropriate for application-level error propagation. The `?` operator should be used consistently. | Scan for `.unwrap()` and `.expect()` outside of `#[cfg(test)]` blocks; verify error types use `thiserror` (library) or `anyhow` (application); check `?` operator usage. |
| 4 | **Crate Boundary Hygiene** | The public API surface of a crate should be the minimum necessary. `pub(crate)` is the correct default for internal items; `pub` is a deliberate API decision. Leaking internal types through the public API creates coupling that is hard to break. | Audit `pub` declarations; verify that types exposed in the public API are intentional; check that `pub(crate)` is used for internal items. |
| 5 | **Async Runtime Consistency** | Mixing Tokio and async-std in the same binary causes runtime conflicts. Every async binary should use exactly one runtime. Blocking calls inside async contexts (`std::thread::sleep`, synchronous I/O) starve the executor. | Verify one runtime per binary; scan for blocking calls inside `async fn`; check that `tokio::spawn` and `async_std::task::spawn` are not mixed. |
| 6 | **`unsafe` Justification** | Every `unsafe` block is a promise to the compiler: "I have verified the invariants that make this safe." Without a `// SAFETY:` comment, that promise is unverifiable. `unsafe` without justification is not just a style issue — it is a correctness issue. | Every `unsafe` block without a `// SAFETY:` comment is a High finding. Review `// SAFETY:` comments for correctness, not just presence. |
| 7 | **Dependency Minimization** | Rust's compile times are sensitive to dependency count. More importantly, every dependency is a supply chain risk. `Cargo.toml` dependencies should be audited: is each one necessary? Is there a lighter alternative? Is `cargo-audit` clean? | Run `cargo audit`; check for duplicate dependencies with `cargo tree`; flag dependencies that could be replaced with `std` functionality. |
| 8 | **Type-State Pattern** | Rust's type system can encode state machine invariants at compile time, making illegal state transitions impossible to express. When a domain has clear states (e.g., `Unvalidated`, `Validated`, `Submitted`), the type-state pattern eliminates entire classes of runtime errors. | Identify state machines in the domain; check whether invalid state transitions are prevented at compile time or only at runtime. |
| 9 | **Lifetime Clarity** | Anonymous lifetimes (`'_`) are appropriate when the lifetime is obvious from context. Named lifetimes are required when the relationship between lifetimes needs to be explicit. Overly complex lifetime annotations are a signal that the data structure needs redesign. | Flag functions with more than 2 named lifetime parameters as candidates for redesign; check that named lifetimes are used when anonymous lifetimes would obscure intent. |
| 10 | **Test Organization** | Unit tests belong in `#[cfg(test)]` modules in the same file as the code under test. Integration tests belong in `tests/`. Doc tests belong in `///` comments on public API items. Mixing these creates confusion about what is being tested and at what boundary. | Verify test organization follows Rust conventions; check that integration tests in `tests/` test the public API only; verify doc tests compile and pass. |

## Knowledge Base Lookups

Use `search_knowledge` (grounded-code-mcp) to ground findings in authoritative references.

| Query | When to Call |
|-------|--------------|
| `search_knowledge("Rust ownership borrowing clone Arc Rc design")` | During ownership discipline checks — ground clone/Arc/Rc findings |
| `search_knowledge("Rust trait design coherence orphan rule")` | During trait coherence checks — verify trait design principles |
| `search_knowledge("Rust error handling Result thiserror anyhow")` | During error handling checks — verify idiomatic error patterns |
| `search_knowledge("Rust async Tokio runtime executor blocking")` | During async pattern checks — verify runtime consistency rules |
| `search_knowledge("Rust unsafe block safety invariant comment")` | During unsafe audit — verify SAFETY comment requirements |
| `search_knowledge("Rust crate public API visibility pub crate")` | During crate boundary checks — verify visibility conventions |
| `search_knowledge("Rust type state pattern compile time safety")` | During type-state checks — verify pattern applicability |

## Workflow

```
DETECT (before any checklist items)
    [ ] Identify Rust edition: grep `edition` in Cargo.toml (2015/2018/2021)
    [ ] Identify async runtime: grep for `tokio`, `async-std`, `smol` in Cargo.toml
    [ ] Identify workspace vs. single crate: check for `[workspace]` in root Cargo.toml
    [ ] Count unsafe blocks: grep -rn "unsafe" src/
    [ ] Run baseline: cargo clippy -- -D warnings (report failures before proceeding)
    [ ] Run: cargo audit (report CVEs before proceeding)

        |
        v

SCAN (systematic checklist execution)
    For each checklist category (Ownership, Traits, Errors, Async, Unsafe, Crate Boundaries,
    Dependencies, Type-State, Lifetimes, Tests):
        [ ] Run category-specific checks
        [ ] Collect findings with file:line evidence
        [ ] Assign severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)

        |
        v

REPORT (graded findings)
    [ ] Produce summary table (findings by category and severity)
    [ ] List Critical findings first with full evidence
    [ ] List High findings
    [ ] List Medium and Low findings
    [ ] Produce unsafe audit table

        |
        v

RECOMMEND
    [ ] Top 3 highest-impact improvements
    [ ] Clippy configuration recommendation
    [ ] CI integration checklist
```

**Exit criteria:** All checklist categories scanned; graded report produced; unsafe audit table complete.

## AI Discipline Rules

### CRITICAL: Evidence Before Findings

**WRONG:**
```
The codebase overuses clone() and has poor error handling.
```

**RIGHT:**
```
Finding R-003 (Medium): Unnecessary clone() at src/handlers/order.rs:47
The Vec<OrderItem> is cloned to pass to process_order(), but process_order()
only reads the items. Changing the signature to accept &[OrderItem] eliminates
the allocation.

Evidence: grep -n "\.clone()" src/handlers/order.rs
47:    let items = order.items.clone();
```

### CRITICAL: Edition Context Before Judgment

**WRONG:**
```
This code uses the old-style extern crate syntax — this is a violation.
```

**RIGHT:**
```
This crate uses Rust 2015 edition (Cargo.toml: edition = "2015").
The extern crate syntax is required in 2015 edition and is not a violation.
If upgrading to 2021 edition is feasible, `cargo fix --edition` can automate
the migration. See rust-migration-analyzer for edition upgrade guidance.
```

### CRITICAL: unsafe Without SAFETY Is Always High

**WRONG:**
```
This unsafe block looks fine, so I'll mark it as Low.
```

**RIGHT:**
```
Finding R-007 (High): unsafe block without SAFETY comment at src/ffi.rs:112
Every unsafe block requires a // SAFETY: comment explaining the invariant
that makes the code correct. The absence of this comment means the safety
guarantee is unverifiable, regardless of whether the code appears correct.
```

### REQUIRED: Clippy Before Checklist

**WRONG:** Running the architectural checklist on a project that fails `cargo clippy`.

**RIGHT:** Report all Clippy failures first. State: "The following Clippy failures must be resolved before the architectural checklist is meaningful." Then list them. Proceed with the checklist only after the user acknowledges.

## Anti-Patterns Table

| # | Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Correct Approach |
|---|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1 | **Clone-Driven Development** | Cloning to avoid borrow checker errors hides design problems. The borrow checker is telling you the ownership model is wrong. | Redesign ownership: pass references, use lifetimes, or restructure data to make ownership clear. |
| 2 | **Arc Everywhere** | Using `Arc<Mutex<T>>` as a default for shared state adds overhead and can cause deadlocks. | Use `Arc` only when shared ownership is genuinely required. Prefer passing owned values or references. |
| 3 | **unwrap() in Library Code** | `.unwrap()` panics on `None` or `Err`. In library code, panicking is almost never correct — the caller should decide how to handle errors. | Return `Result<T, E>` or `Option<T>` from library functions. Reserve `.unwrap()` for tests and cases where the invariant is provably true (document it). |
| 4 | **Stringly-Typed Errors** | `Result<T, String>` or `Result<T, Box<dyn Error>>` in library code loses type information and makes error handling impossible for callers. | Use `thiserror` to define typed error enums for library crates. Use `anyhow` for application-level error propagation. |
| 5 | **Mixed Async Runtimes** | Mixing Tokio and async-std in the same binary causes runtime panics or undefined behavior. | Choose one runtime per binary. If a dependency requires a different runtime, use a compatibility shim or replace the dependency. |
| 6 | **Blocking in Async** | `std::thread::sleep()`, synchronous file I/O, or CPU-intensive work inside `async fn` blocks the executor thread, starving other tasks. | Use `tokio::time::sleep()`, `tokio::fs`, and `tokio::task::spawn_blocking()` for blocking work. |
| 7 | **Pub Everything** | Making all types and functions `pub` to avoid thinking about API design creates an unstable, leaky API surface. | Default to `pub(crate)`. Promote to `pub` only when the item is part of the intentional public API. |
| 8 | **Trait Soup** | Implementing 10 traits on a type to satisfy generic bounds without clear semantic purpose creates coupling and makes the type's contract unclear. | Each trait implementation should have a clear semantic reason. If a trait is implemented only to satisfy a bound, reconsider the bound. |
| 9 | **Lifetime Avoidance via Clone** | Cloning data to avoid writing lifetime annotations is a performance and design smell. | Learn to write lifetime annotations. If lifetimes are genuinely complex, consider restructuring ownership. |
| 10 | **Test-Only unwrap() Leakage** | Using `.unwrap()` freely in tests is acceptable, but test helper functions that use `.unwrap()` and are called from production code are not. | Keep test utilities in `#[cfg(test)]` modules. Never call test-only helpers from production paths. |

## Error Recovery

### Clippy Fails with Many Warnings

```
Symptoms: cargo clippy -- -D warnings produces 20+ warnings

Recovery:
1. Group warnings by category (unused imports, dead code, style, correctness)
2. Report the count by category to the user
3. Recommend: cargo clippy --fix for auto-fixable warnings
4. For correctness warnings (not just style): escalate — these may indicate real bugs
5. Do NOT proceed with the architectural checklist until the user acknowledges
   the Clippy failures and decides how to handle them
```

### cargo audit Reports CVEs

```
Symptoms: cargo audit finds one or more CVEs in dependencies

Recovery:
1. List each CVE with: crate name, CVE ID, severity, description
2. Check if the vulnerable code path is actually used: cargo tree -i <crate>
3. Check if a patched version is available: cargo update <crate>
4. If no patch exists, check for alternative crates
5. Report findings before proceeding — CVEs in dependencies are High findings
   regardless of whether the vulnerable code path is exercised
```

### unsafe Blocks Without SAFETY Comments Are Numerous

```
Symptoms: grep finds 10+ unsafe blocks without // SAFETY: comments

Recovery:
1. List all locations in the unsafe audit table
2. Mark each as High finding
3. Do NOT attempt to write SAFETY comments — that requires understanding
   the invariants, which requires the original author's knowledge
4. Recommend: the author adds SAFETY comments as a prerequisite to
   any further architectural work
5. Note: this is a blocking finding for library crates; less severe for
   application code where the unsafe is isolated
```

### Project Uses Rust 2015 Edition

```
Symptoms: Cargo.toml shows edition = "2015" or no edition field

Recovery:
1. Note the edition in the detection report
2. Apply 2015-era idioms when evaluating (extern crate, macro_rules! imports, etc.)
3. Do NOT flag 2015-era patterns as violations without noting the edition context
4. Recommend edition upgrade as a Medium finding: cargo fix --edition
5. Cross-reference rust-migration-analyzer for edition upgrade guidance
```

## Integration with Other Skills

| Skill | Relationship |
|-------|-------------|
| `rust-security-review` | Security-focused complement to this checklist. Run after this checklist passes. This skill covers architecture; `rust-security-review` covers OWASP and `unsafe` security implications. |
| `rust-feature-slice` | When this checklist identifies poor module organization, `rust-feature-slice` provides the structural pattern to fix it. |
| `axum-scaffolder` | When this checklist identifies HTTP layer issues (missing middleware, poor error handling in handlers), `axum-scaffolder` provides the correct patterns. |
| `sqlx-migration-manager` | When this checklist identifies database access issues (raw SQL strings, missing compile-time query verification), `sqlx-migration-manager` provides the migration safety protocol. |
| `rust-migration-analyzer` | When this checklist identifies an outdated Rust edition or deprecated crates, `rust-migration-analyzer` provides the upgrade path. |
| `supply-chain-audit` | When `cargo audit` finds CVEs, `supply-chain-audit` provides deeper dependency analysis and remediation guidance. |
| `architecture-review` | This skill is a checklist executor (what the compiler cannot enforce). `architecture-review` is a Socratic coach (architectural tradeoffs and design decisions). Use both for a complete review. |
