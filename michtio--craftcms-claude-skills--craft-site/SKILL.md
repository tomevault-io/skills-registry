# Craft CMS 5 — Front-End Twig (Atomic Design)

Atomic design system patterns for Craft CMS 5 site templates. Vanilla Twig —
no module dependency. Works with any Craft 5 project.

This skill is scoped to **front-end template architecture** — component design,
routing, composition, theming, and buildchain. For extending Craft (plugins,
modules, PHP), see the `craftcms` skill.

## Companion Skills — Always Load Together

When this skill triggers, also load:

- **`craft-twig-guidelines`** — Twig coding standards: variable naming, null handling, whitespace control, include isolation, Craft helpers. Required for any Twig code.
- **`craft-content-modeling`** — Sections, entry types, fields, Matrix, relations. Required when deciding what content to query or how templates access data.
- **`ddev`** — All commands run through DDEV. Required for running Vite, npm, and Craft CLI commands.

## Documentation

- Twig in Craft: https://craftcms.com/docs/5.x/development/twig.html
- Template tags: https://craftcms.com/docs/5.x/reference/twig/tags.html
- Template functions: https://craftcms.com/docs/5.x/reference/twig/functions.html
- Twig 3 docs: https://twig.symfony.com/doc/3.x/

Use `WebFetch` on specific doc pages when a reference file doesn't cover enough detail.

## Common Pitfalls (Cross-Cutting)

- Missing `only` on `{% include %}` — ambient variables leak in silently.
- Variant logic via conditionals (`{% if variant == 'x' %}`) instead of extends/block.
- Naming atoms by parent context (`hero-button`) instead of visual treatment (`button--primary`).
- `utilities` prop used as override — it's additive. Override via named-slot merge.
- Queries inside views — views receive data, they don't fetch it.
- Missing `.eagerly()` on relation fields in views — causes N+1 queries.
- Missing `devMode` fallback in builders for unknown block types.
- Hardcoded Tailwind colors (`bg-yellow-600`) instead of brand tokens (`bg-brand-accent`).
- Mixing buttons and links — buttons are actions (resolve to `<a>`, `<button>`, or `<span>` from props), links are navigation (always `<a>`). Separate atom categories.
- Tracking/analytics inside components — decouple to data attributes at view/page level.
- Forgetting `project-config/touch` after editing YAML outside the CP — Git pulls, manual edits, and merge conflict resolution don't update `dateModified`. Run `ddev craft project-config/touch` then `ddev craft up`, or `craft up` on other environments won't detect the change.

## Component System Conventions

One canonical component system across all projects. Atoms are context-agnostic — always named by visual treatment, never by parent. HTML element type is resolved from props (`url` → `<a>`, `type` → `<button>`, fallback → `<span>`).

External link detection is derived from the URL, never passed as a prop. Components auto-apply `target="_blank"`, `rel="noopener noreferrer"`, external icon, and sr-only text when a URL is external.

FontAwesome is the universal icon system. Icons are passed as FA class strings.

Visual variants use extends/block — base template defines structure, variant overrides classes. Never use conditional logic to switch between variant styles. For structural skeletons with content slots, use `{% embed %}` — see `composition-patterns.md`.

Image handling uses a single atom with config-driven presets, not separate variant files per context.

## CSS & Theming Conventions

This skill assumes Tailwind CSS for class composition examples. Adapt patterns
to your CSS framework — the architectural principles (named keys, additive
utilities, semantic tokens) are framework-agnostic.

Class collections use named keys per style concern — this is the primary mechanism for preventing conflicts. The `utilities` prop is additive (extending), not overriding. Override specific concerns via named-slot merge.

Multi-brand theming uses CSS custom properties activated by `data-brand="{{ currentSite.handle }}"` on `<html>`. Components reference semantic Tailwind classes (`bg-brand-accent`) resolved via CSS variables. Template-level brand overrides only exist when the HTML structure itself differs between brands — not for color/font/spacing differences.

Token naming follows three layers: primitives (`--brand-{color}-{shade}`), semantics (`--brand-{purpose}`), and framework mapping (`--color-brand-{purpose}`).

Tailwind v4 cascade layers don't fix class conflicts within the same utilities layer. Named-key collections remain necessary.

## Routing Conventions

PHP handles data, Twig handles presentation. Views receive data through includes — they never query it themselves.

`collect()` is used for both props and class building. The full Collection API is available in Twig via Craft.

The JS boundary follows a decision tree: Twig is the default → Alpine/DataStar for UI state → Vue for application state.
