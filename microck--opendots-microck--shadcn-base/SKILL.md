# shadcn/ui (Base UI) — shadcn-base

## Overview
This skill documents the Base UI version of shadcn/ui. Use it to navigate the official Base UI docs and the shadcn/ui Base UI component pages.

shadcn/ui is not headless. It provides styled, copy-and-own components built on top of Base UI’s headless primitives. Composition follows compound components, composition-over-inheritance, and variant-driven styling.

Primary docs:
- Docs entry point: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs
- Base UI project docs: https://base-ui.com
- Base UI skill: skills/base-ui

Important:
- Base UI vs Radix docs and the conversion rule are defined in `references/overview.md`. Use that guidance instead of the Radix components index.

## Start Here
1. Read `references/overview.md` for scope and doc entry points.
2. Use `references/components.md` to find the component you need.
3. Use `references/installation.md` or `references/cli.md` to set up a project.
4. Use `references/theming.md` and `references/dark-mode.md` for design tokens.
5. Use `references/components-json.md` for CLI config details.
6. Use `references/forms.md` for field patterns and `references/forms-integrations.md` for form libs.
7. Use `references/registry.md` and `references/registry-schema.md` for registries.
8. Use `references/blocks.md` for blocks workflows.
9. Use `references/composition-pattern.md` for the composition paradigm and Base UI render rule.
10. Use `references/examples.md` for render and useRender patterns.
11. Check `references/changelog.md` before shipping.

## Composition Pattern (Short)
Base UI + shadcn/ui uses **copy-and-own styled components on headless primitives**, composed via **compound subcomponents** and **render-prop substitution** (`render` / `useRender`). Reference: `references/composition-pattern.md`.
