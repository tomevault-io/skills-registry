# React Native Setup Expert

Expert in React Native and Expo environment configuration across macOS, Windows, and Linux. Specializes in troubleshooting installation issues, SDK configuration, and development environment optimization.

## What I Know

### Prerequisites & Installation

**Node.js & npm**
- Node.js 18.x or later required
- Version verification: `node --version && npm --version`
- Troubleshooting Node.js installation issues
- npm vs yarn vs pnpm for React Native projects

**Xcode (macOS - iOS Development)**
- Xcode 15.x or later required
- Command line tools installation: `xcode-select --install`
- License acceptance: `sudo xcodebuild -license accept`
- Platform installation verification
- Common Xcode errors and fixes

**Android Studio (Android Development)**
- Android Studio Hedgehog or later
- Required SDK components:
  - Android SDK Platform 34 or later
  - Android SDK Build-Tools
  - Android Emulator
  - Android SDK Platform-Tools
- ANDROID_HOME environment variable setup
- SDK Manager configuration
- Common Android Studio issues

**Watchman**
- Installation via Homebrew (macOS): `brew install watchman`
- Purpose: File watching for fast refresh
- Troubleshooting watchman errors
- Cache clearing strategies

### Environment Configuration

**iOS Setup**
- CocoaPods installation and troubleshooting
- Pod install issues and resolutions
- Xcode project configuration
- Provisioning profiles and certificates
- iOS Simulator management
- Device selection: `xcrun simctl list devices`

**Android Setup**
- Gradle configuration
- Android SDK path configuration
- Environment variables (ANDROID_HOME, PATH)
- AVD (Android Virtual Device) creation
- Emulator performance optimization
- ADB troubleshooting

**Metro Bundler**
- Port 8081 configuration
- Cache clearing: `npx react-native start --reset-cache`
- Custom Metro config
- Asset resolution issues

### Common Setup Issues

**"Command not found" Errors**
- PATH configuration
- Shell profile updates (.zshrc, .bash_profile)
- Symlink issues

**SDK Not Found**
- SDK path verification
- Environment variable troubleshooting
- SDK Manager reinstallation

**Pod Install Failures**
- CocoaPods version issues
- Ffi gem compilation errors
- Ruby version compatibility
- `pod deintegrate && pod install` strategy

**Build Failures**
- Clean build strategies
- Dependency conflicts
- Native module compilation errors
- Xcode derived data clearing

## When to Use This Skill

Ask me when you need help with:
- Initial React Native environment setup
- Installing and configuring Xcode or Android Studio
- Setting up iOS simulators or Android emulators
- Troubleshooting "Command not found" errors
- Resolving SDK path or ANDROID_HOME issues
- Fixing CocoaPods installation problems
- Clearing Metro bundler cache
- Configuring development environment variables
- Troubleshooting build failures
- Setting up watchman for file watching
- Verifying development environment prerequisites

## Quick Setup Commands

### iOS (macOS)
```bash
# Install Xcode command line tools
xcode-select --install

# Accept Xcode license
sudo xcodebuild -license accept

# Install CocoaPods
sudo gem install cocoapods

# Install watchman
brew install watchman

# Verify setup
xcodebuild -version
pod --version
watchman version
```

### Android (All Platforms)
```bash
# Verify Android setup
echo $ANDROID_HOME
adb --version
emulator -version

# List available emulators
emulator -list-avds

# List connected devices
adb devices
```

### React Native Project
```bash
# Create new React Native project
npx react-native init MyProject

# Navigate to project
cd MyProject

# Install iOS dependencies
cd ios && pod install && cd ..

# Start Metro bundler
npm start

# Run on iOS (separate terminal)
npm run ios

# Run on Android (separate terminal)
npm run android
```

## Pro Tips

1. **Clean Builds**: When in doubt, clean everything
   ```bash
   # iOS
   cd ios && rm -rf build Pods && pod install && cd ..

   # Android
   cd android && ./gradlew clean && cd ..

   # Metro
   npx react-native start --reset-cache
   ```

2. **Environment Variables**: Always verify environment variables after changes
   ```bash
   # Add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bash_profile
   export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk
   export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator
   export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools

   # Reload shell
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

3. **Simulator Management**: List and boot specific devices
   ```bash
   # iOS
   xcrun simctl list devices
   xcrun simctl boot "iPhone 15 Pro"

   # Android
   emulator -list-avds
   emulator -avd Pixel_6_API_34
   ```

4. **Quick Health Check**: Verify entire environment
   ```bash
   node --version      # Node.js
   npm --version       # npm
   xcodebuild -version # Xcode (macOS)
   pod --version       # CocoaPods (macOS)
   adb --version       # Android tools
   watchman version    # Watchman
   ```

## Integration with SpecWeave

This skill integrates with SpecWeave's increment workflow:
- Use during `/specweave:increment` planning for environment setup tasks
- Reference in `tasks.md` for setup-related acceptance criteria
- Include in `spec.md` for mobile-specific prerequisites
- Document setup issues in increment `reports/` folder
