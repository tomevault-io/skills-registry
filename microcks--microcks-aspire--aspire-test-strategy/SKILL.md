# Aspire Test Strategy

## Overview

This skill guides the selection between **builder tests** (fast, no containers) and **integration tests** (full container startup) to optimize test execution time in Aspire-based projects.

## Core Principle

**Always choose the lightest test approach that validates the requirement.**

- Builder tests are milliseconds fast - use them for configuration verification
- Integration tests are seconds/minutes slow - use them only when runtime behavior must be validated

## Decision Matrix

### Use Builder Tests When

Testing aspects that can be verified at **build/configuration time**:

- ✅ Resource registration and naming
- ✅ Resource dependencies and relationships  
- ✅ Environment variables configuration
- ✅ Annotations presence and values
- ✅ Resource builder chaining
- ✅ Parameter wiring and references

**Pattern:**
```csharp
public void WhenApplicationIsBuilt_ThenResourcesAreConfigured()
{
    var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder();
    // ... configure resources
    using var app = builder.Build();
    var appModel = app.Services.GetRequiredService<DistributedApplicationModel>();
    // ... verify configuration without starting containers
}
```

### Use Integration Tests When

Testing aspects that require **runtime behavior**:

- ✅ Actual container startup and health
- ✅ Network communication between services
- ✅ Message publishing and consumption
- ✅ HTTP endpoints responding correctly
- ✅ Database connections and queries
- ✅ End-to-end workflows

**Pattern:**
```csharp
[Collection("FixtureName")]
public class IntegrationTests(Fixture fixture)
{
    [Fact]
    public async Task WhenMessageIsSent_ThenItIsReceived()
    {
        // Uses fixture with started containers
        // ... test runtime behavior
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### When Splitting Existing Tests

If a test file mixes configuration and runtime concerns:

1. Create a new `*BuilderTests.cs` file for configuration tests
2. Keep runtime tests in the original `*Tests.cs` file with fixture
3. Builder tests should NOT use collections or fixtures that start containers

### Naming Conventions

- **Builder tests**: `*BuilderTests.cs` - Tests configuration without starting containers
- **Integration tests**: `*Tests.cs` - Tests runtime behavior with containers

### Example Refactoring

**Before (slow):**
```csharp
[Collection(MicrocksAmqpCollection.CollectionName)] // Starts containers!
public class MicrocksAmqpTests(MicrocksAmqpFixture fixture)
{
    [Fact]
    public void WhenApplicationIsStarted_ThenResourcesExist()
    {
        // Just checking configuration but starting containers unnecessarily
        var appModel = fixture.App.Services.GetRequiredService<DistributedApplicationModel>();
        Assert.NotNull(appModel.Resources.OfType<MicrocksAsyncMinionResource>().Single());
    }
}
```

**After (fast):**
```csharp
// MicrocksAmqpBuilderTests.cs - No fixture, no containers
public class MicrocksAmqpBuilderTests
{
    [Fact]
    public void WhenApplicationIsBuilt_ThenResourcesAreConfigured()
    {
        var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder();
        // ... configure
        using var app = builder.Build();
        // ... verify configuration
    }
}
```

## When Creating New Tests

1. **Start with builder tests** for configuration aspects
2. **Add integration tests** only for features requiring runtime validation
3. **Keep builder tests separate** from integration test files

This approach ensures fast feedback loops while maintaining comprehensive coverage.

[TODO: Choose the structure that best fits this skill's purpose. Common patterns:

**1. Workflow-Based** (best for sequential processes)
- Works well when there are clear step-by-step procedures
- Example: DOCX skill with "Workflow Decision Tree" → "Reading" → "Creating" → "Editing"
- Structure: ## Overview → ## Workflow Decision Tree → ## Step 1 → ## Step 2...

**2. Task-Based** (best for tool collections)
- Works well when the skill offers different operations/capabilities
- Example: PDF skill with "Quick Start" → "Merge PDFs" → "Split PDFs" → "Extract Text"
- Structure: ## Overview → ## Quick Start → ## Task Category 1 → ## Task Category 2...

**3. Reference/Guidelines** (best for standards or specifications)
- Works well for brand guidelines, coding standards, or requirements
- Example: Brand styling with "Brand Guidelines" → "Colors" → "Typography" → "Features"
- Structure: ## Overview → ## Guidelines → ## Specifications → ## Usage...

**4. Capabilities-Based** (best for integrated systems)
- Works well when the skill provides multiple interrelated features
- Example: Product Management with "Core Capabilities" → numbered capability list
- Structure: ## Overview → ## Core Capabilities → ### 1. Feature → ### 2. Feature...

Patterns can be mixed and matched as needed. Most skills combine patterns (e.g., start with task-based, add workflow for complex operations).

Delete this entire "Structuring This Skill" section when done - it's just guidance.]

## [TODO: Replace with the first main section based on chosen structure]

[TODO: Add content here. See examples in existing skills:
- Code samples for technical skills
- Decision trees for complex workflows
- Concrete examples with realistic user requests
- References to scripts/templates/references as needed]

## Resources

This skill includes example resource directories that demonstrate how to organize different types of bundled resources:

### scripts/
Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.) that can be run directly to perform specific operations.

**Examples from other skills:**
- PDF skill: `fill_fillable_fields.py`, `extract_form_field_info.py` - utilities for PDF manipulation
- DOCX skill: `document.py`, `utilities.py` - Python modules for document processing

**Appropriate for:** Python scripts, shell scripts, or any executable code that performs automation, data processing, or specific operations.

**Note:** Scripts may be executed without loading into context, but can still be read by Claude for patching or environment adjustments.

### references/
Documentation and reference material intended to be loaded into context to inform Claude's process and thinking.

**Examples from other skills:**
- Product management: `communication.md`, `context_building.md` - detailed workflow guides
- BigQuery: API reference documentation and query examples
- Finance: Schema documentation, company policies

**Appropriate for:** In-depth documentation, API references, database schemas, comprehensive guides, or any detailed information that Claude should reference while working.

### assets/
Files not intended to be loaded into context, but rather used within the output Claude produces.

**Examples from other skills:**
- Brand styling: PowerPoint template files (.pptx), logo files
- Frontend builder: HTML/React boilerplate project directories
- Typography: Font files (.ttf, .woff2)

**Appropriate for:** Templates, boilerplate code, document templates, images, icons, fonts, or any files meant to be copied or used in the final output.

---

**Any unneeded directories can be deleted.** Not every skill requires all three types of resources.
