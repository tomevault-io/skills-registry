# Agent Academy Mission Builder

This skill scaffolds new content for the **microsoft/agent-academy** repository at
https://github.com/microsoft/agent-academy. It covers two distinct mission types and handles
everything from naming to final markdown output, including badge generation for Special Ops.

Think of this skill like a mission briefing officer: it gets the concept from you, does the
reconnaissance (checks the repo, checks for duplicates, maps cross-links), then hands you back
a fully briefed document you only need to fill in the "boots on the ground" steps for.

---

## Phase 0: Gather Intel (Interview the User)

Before writing anything, collect the following. Ask in one message, not one question at a time:

**Required info:**
1. **Mission type**: Course mission (Recruit / Operative / Commander) OR Special Ops?
2. **Topic / feature**: What Copilot Studio capability, integration, or concept does this cover?
3. **Rough description**: What will the learner *build or do* by the end?
4. **Difficulty** (for Special Ops): Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced (maps to 1 / 2 / 3 stars)
5. **Prerequisites**: What must the learner have done or have access to?

For **course missions**, also ask:
- Which mission number does this follow? (sets the folder name like `07-`)
- What is the overall course scenario it fits into? (e.g., Operative = Hiring system)

For **Special Ops**, also ask:
- Industry or use-case context (healthcare, retail, HR, IT, finance, etc.)? Or "general"?
- Any specific integrations (SharePoint, Teams, Dataverse, Azure, MCP, etc.)?

If the user hasn't given you enough to go on, ask. Otherwise proceed.

---

## Phase 1: Reconnaissance (Repo Check)

Use `web_search` and `web_fetch` to:

1. **Check for duplicates**: Search `site:github.com/microsoft/agent-academy [topic keyword]`
   and `microsoft.github.io/agent-academy [topic keyword]`. If something very similar exists,
   flag it and ask the user whether to proceed anyway or pivot the angle.

2. **Map existing missions**: Fetch https://microsoft.github.io/agent-academy/recruit/ and
   https://microsoft.github.io/agent-academy/operative/ to get the current mission list.
   Use this to:
   - Assign the correct next mission number for course missions
   - Identify missions to cross-link (e.g., if this mission uses MCP, link to Mission 10 MCP)
   - Spot curriculum gaps the new mission fills

3. **Check Special Ops listing**: Fetch https://microsoft.github.io/agent-academy/special-ops/
   to see what already exists and identify tags/categories in use.

Report findings briefly before proceeding. If there's a close duplicate, surface it clearly.

---

## Phase 2: Mission Naming

Agent Academy missions use military/spy operation themed names. Rules:

- **Course missions**: Use `🚨 Mission XX: [Action Verb] + [What They Build]`
  Examples: `🚨 Mission 03: Create a Multi-Agent Orchestration System`
  The operation name appears in the briefing paragraph: `Operation [Codename]`
  Codenames are dramatic and thematic: "Operation Talent Scout", "Operation Symphony",
  "Operation MCP Rendezvous". They relate to what the mission accomplishes.

- **Special Ops**: The lab *title* is a punchy phrase, often with a symbol if relevant.
  Examples: `Microsoft Copilot Studio & MCP`, `Power Platform CLI MCP`
  The operation name in the briefing: same dramatic style.
  The **badge bottom banner name** is a clever play on the mission topic. See badge section.

**Naming formula for operation codenames**: [Military/Intelligence Term] + [Thematic Noun].
Examples:
- Adaptive Cards → "Operation Flash Card"
- Event Triggers → "Operation Trip Wire"
- AI Safety → "Operation Safe Harbor"
- Document Generation → "Operation Paper Trail"
- Dataverse Grounding → "Operation Deep Root"

Generate 2-3 name options and let the user pick, or auto-select the best one.

## Phase 3: Scaffold the Markdown

## Phase 4: Auto-Draft Background Intel and Scenario

Don't leave these blank. Fill them in using knowledge of Copilot Studio and the feature:

1. Write 2-4 paragraphs of background. Voice: energetic, not dry docs.
2. Always include an analogy. Existing ones in the repo:
   - MCP = "USB-C of AI integration"
   - Orchestrator = "symphony conductor"
   - Agent = "digital coworker"
   Find a new one for the new concept.
3. For Special Ops: draft the fictional scenario with company name, industry, and problem.

---

## Phase 5: Step-by-Step Drafting

Fill in Mission Tasks based on Copilot Studio knowledge:

- One action per step, clear action verbs (Select, Navigate, Enter, Configure, Test)
- Bold UI element names: **Test your agent**, **Publish**, **Save**
- Code format for: values to type, field names, test messages to send
- Use `[!NOTE]`, `[!TIP]`, `[!WARNING]` callouts freely
- Where exact steps are unknown, add `<!-- TODO: Add screenshot -->` and
  `[FILL IN: describe what needs to happen here]` placeholders

---

## Phase 6: Tags and Cross-Links (Special Ops Only)

See `references/tags.md` for full tag taxonomy. Select 1-3 technology tags and 1-3 industry tags.

Difficulty = number of stars on the badge:
- 1 star: Beginner (single feature, under 30 min, no admin required)
- 2 stars: Intermediate (2-3 concepts, 30-60 min, some config)
- 3 stars: Advanced (multi-step, VSCode, Azure/admin required, 60+ min)

Always cross-link to the most relevant course mission. Check `docs/recruit/index.md`, `docs/operative/index.md`, `docs/commander/index.md`, and `docs/special-ops/index.md` for the current mission inventory.

---

## Phase 7: Deliver Output

1. **Scaffolded markdown file** create the mission file directly in the repo in the corresponding folder. If it's a recruit course mission, create a folder under `docs/recruit/` with the appropriate mission name and place an `index.md` file inside as well as an `assets` folder for images, for example, `docs/recruit/mcp-lab/index.md`. Repeat this pattern for operative and commander missions under their respective folders. For Special Ops, create the folder under `docs/special-ops/` with the slug name and place the `index.md` file and `assets` folder inside, for example, `docs/special-ops/mcp-lab/index.md`.
2. **Summary** of what was pre-filled vs. what needs manual work (be explicit about TODOs)
3. **Cross-link map** of which missions link here, and where this links
4. **For Special Ops**: Tags, difficulty, badge banner name, and image generation prompt
5. **Duplicate check result** with links to anything similar that exists

End every delivery with:
> "The bones are done. Fill in the step-by-step and swap in real screenshots. Want me to
> draft any specific task section in more detail?"
