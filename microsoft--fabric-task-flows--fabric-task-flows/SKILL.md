> ⚠️ **Artifacts-only mode:** When `deploy_mode` is `artifacts_only`, this skill is NOT invoked — the pipeline runner handles this phase deterministically. The instructions below apply only when `deploy_mode` is `live`.

# Fabric Documentation

> **Goal:** Produce ONE deliverable — `docs/project-brief.md` — that a CTO can read in 10 minutes.

> **⚡ Pre-generated brief:** The runner writes a structured `project-brief.md` synthesized from all handoffs before this skill is invoked, with `<!-- AGENT: FILL -->` markers where narrative polish is needed. Your job: (1) verify facts against the source handoffs, (2) add narrative polish so the brief reads like a CTO memo rather than a template, (3) replace every `<!-- AGENT: FILL -->` marker.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Read Pipeline Handoffs

Read these files **in parallel** from `_projects/[name]/docs/` (all are independent inputs):
- `discovery-brief.md` — problem statement and signals
- `architecture-handoff.md` — items, waves, decisions, trade-offs, diagram
- `deployment-handoff.md` — what was deployed, config rationale, manual steps
- `test-plan.md` — acceptance criteria, edge cases
- `validation-report.md` — pass/fail results

### Step 2: Polish `project-brief.md`

Edit `_projects/[name]/docs/project-brief.md` in place (it is pre-generated).

Follow the template in `references/documentation-templates.md`. Key rules:
1. **~1,500 words max** — every fact appears exactly once
2. **Decisions inline** — as a table in "Why This Architecture", NOT separate ADR files
3. **No separate files** — do NOT create README.md, architecture.md, deployment-log.md, or decisions/*.md
4. **Synthesize, don't copy** — distill the handoffs into narrative, don't paste YAML blocks

### Step 3: Verify Completeness

The brief must answer these 5 questions:
1. What problem are we solving? (from discovery)
2. What did we build? (items + diagram from architecture)
3. Why this approach? (decisions from architecture)
4. How to deploy it? (from deployment handoff)
5. Did it work? (from validation)

## Constraints

- Documents only — no architecture decisions or deployments
- ONE output file: `project-brief.md`
- Do NOT create README.md, architecture.md, deployment-log.md, or decisions/*.md
