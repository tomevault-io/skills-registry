# Lemmafit Post React Audit


## Audit: Logic-in-JS-post

Check whether any effect-free logic required for the current build phase is found written directly in JavaScript or TypeScript instead of Dafny.

### What to check

1. **State derivations in React** — Any computed value derived from state (filtering, sorting, calculations, conditional logic) that is not exposed through `Api.Present` or a Dafny function. These belong in Dafny.
2. **Validation in JS** — Input validation, constraint checks, or boundary enforcement done in React hooks or components instead of Dafny predicates.
3. **Business rules in event handlers** — Pure conditional guards on dispatching (e.g., "only allow X if Y" where Y is derivable from model state) that aren't enforced by Dafny preconditions or exposed as predicates. Exclude effect-gating logic (e.g., "only call Stripe API if active") — that belongs in JS.
4. **Formatting with logic** — Display formatting that encodes business rules (e.g., color based on threshold, status text based on state) rather than pure cosmetic formatting.
5. **Duplicated logic** — Logic that exists in Dafny and is available via API but is re-implemented in JS (even partially), creating a consistency risk.
6. **Utils with hidden logic** — Utility functions in `src/utils` that contain domain logic rather than pure display helpers.

## Severity Labels

Label each finding with one of:

| Severity | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `critical` | Effect-free logic in JS that could produce wrong behavior if it diverges from Dafny, or logic duplicated between JS and Dafny | Must move to Dafny before shipping |
| `moderate` | Effect-free logic in JS that should be a Dafny function or predicate but isn't yet causing a correctness risk | Should move to Dafny |
| `minor` | Borderline case where JS logic is arguably pure formatting, or a trivial derivation not worth a Dafny round-trip | Can keep in JS, document why |

## Output Format

Present findings as a numbered list with severity tag and file location:

```
## Logic-in-JS Post-React Audit

1. [critical] src/hooks/useSubscription.ts:42 — computes prorated refund in JS, duplicates Dafny proration logic
2. [moderate] src/components/PlanCard.tsx:18 — derives "canUpgrade" from state fields, should be a Dafny predicate
3. [minor] src/utils/format.ts:10 — date formatting, pure display (OK)
```

## Pass Criteria

The audit passes when there are **zero critical and zero moderate findings**. If any remain, move the logic to Dafny (back to Step 2), re-verify, then re-run this audit.
