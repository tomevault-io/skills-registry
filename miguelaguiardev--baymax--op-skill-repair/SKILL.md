SKILL: SKILL SELF-REPAIR (AUTOREPAIR)

Goal
Allow Baymax to update skills when execution reveals missing or incorrect steps.

Definitions
- Skill: operational doc for workflow, prerequisites, commands, verification, evidence.
- Skill failure: workflow cannot proceed because the skill is wrong, incomplete, or ambiguous.

Triggers
- repeated command failures from missing prerequisites
- tooling mismatch (bun/pnpm, biome/eslint)
- CI drift (jobs changed, artifacts moved)
- new service requirements (env vars/config)
- repeated user clarifications for the same step
- local/CI behavior divergence

Repair Loop
1) Detect and stop safely.
2) Classify failure:
   - prerequisite missing
   - outdated command/config
   - environment mismatch
   - ambiguous step
3) Produce Skill Patch (minimal change).
4) Ask approval to apply patch to documentation.
5) Apply patch (or provide paste-ready markdown).
6) Resume from earliest safe step.
