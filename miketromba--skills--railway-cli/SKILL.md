# Railway CLI

Operate the [Railway](https://railway.com) platform from the command line. Covers the full lifecycle: authentication, project setup, deployment, services, variables, environments, logs, domains, volumes, functions, and local development.

**Source of truth**: [Railway CLI Docs](https://docs.railway.com/cli.md)

## Handling Missing Installation

Assume `railway` is installed. If a command fails with "command not found" or similar, install it before retrying:

```bash
# macOS (preferred)
brew install railway

# Any OS with Node.js >= 16
npm i -g @railway/cli

# Shell script (macOS / Linux / WSL)
bash <(curl -fsSL cli.new)
```

After install, verify with `railway --version`, then resume the original task.

## Self-Discovery

The Railway CLI evolves across versions. When you encounter an unfamiliar subcommand or need to check current flags:

```bash
railway --help              # Top-level commands
railway <command> --help    # Subcommand flags and usage
```

Always prefer `--help` output over memorized flags when composing complex commands. This keeps behavior correct even as the CLI updates.

## Authentication

```bash
railway login                   # Browser-based login
railway login --browserless     # Token-based login (CI, SSH sessions)
railway logout
railway whoami                  # Verify current identity
```

**CI/CD token auth** (no interactive login):
- `RAILWAY_TOKEN` — project-scoped actions
- `RAILWAY_API_TOKEN` — account/workspace-scoped actions

```bash
RAILWAY_TOKEN=<token> railway up
```

## Project Lifecycle

### Create or link

```bash
railway init                    # Create new project (interactive)
railway link                    # Link cwd to existing project
railway unlink                  # Unlink cwd
```

### Inspect

```bash
railway status                  # Current project/service/environment info
railway list                    # All projects in workspace
railway open                    # Open project in browser
```

## Deployment

```bash
railway up                      # Deploy cwd
railway up --detach             # Deploy without tailing logs
railway deploy --template postgres  # Deploy from a template
railway redeploy                # Redeploy latest deployment
railway restart                 # Restart service (no new build)
railway down                    # Remove latest deployment
```

## Services

```bash
railway add                     # Add service (interactive)
railway add --database postgres # Add a database (postgres, mysql, redis, mongo)
railway add --repo user/repo    # Add service from GitHub repo
railway service                 # Switch linked service (interactive)
railway scale                   # Scale service replicas
railway delete                  # Delete the project
```

## Variables

```bash
railway variable list                   # List all variables
railway variable set KEY=value          # Set a variable
railway variable set K1=v1 K2=v2       # Set multiple at once
railway variable delete KEY             # Remove a variable
```

## Environments

```bash
railway environment                     # Switch environment (interactive)
railway environment new <name>          # Create environment
railway environment delete <name>       # Delete environment
```

## Local Development

```bash
railway run <cmd>               # Run command with Railway env vars injected
railway shell                   # Open shell with Railway env vars
railway dev                     # Run services locally with Docker
```

`railway run` is useful for running migrations, seeds, or scripts that need production/staging credentials without `.env` files.

## Logs & Debugging

```bash
railway logs                    # Stream live deployment logs
railway logs --build            # View build logs
railway logs -n 100             # Last N lines
railway ssh                     # SSH into running service container
railway connect                 # Connect to database shell (psql, mysql, redis-cli, mongosh)
```

## Networking

```bash
railway domain                  # Generate a Railway subdomain
railway domain example.com      # Attach a custom domain
```

## Volumes

```bash
railway volume list
railway volume add
railway volume delete
```

## Functions

```bash
railway functions list
railway functions new
railway functions push
```

## Utilities

```bash
railway completion bash         # Generate shell completions (bash/zsh/fish)
railway docs                    # Open docs in browser
railway upgrade                 # Upgrade CLI to latest version
```

## Global Flags

These flags work across most commands:

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-s, --service <name-or-id>` | Target a specific service |
| `-e, --environment <name-or-id>` | Target a specific environment |
| `--json` | Output as JSON (useful for scripting) |
| `-y, --yes` | Skip confirmation prompts |
| `-h, --help` | Show help |
| `-V, --version` | Show CLI version |

## Common Workflows

### First-time project setup

```bash
railway login
railway init          # or: railway link
railway up
railway domain        # get a public URL
railway logs          # verify deployment
```

### Add a database to an existing project

```bash
railway add --database postgres
railway connect       # verify connectivity
railway variable list # check injected DATABASE_URL
```

### Deploy with environment targeting

```bash
railway environment new staging
railway up -e staging
railway logs -e staging
```

### Run a one-off command with prod vars

```bash
railway run -e production npx prisma migrate deploy
```
