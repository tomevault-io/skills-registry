# Reactive MD

Generate functional markdown documents with embedded interactive React components. This skill is optimized for creating high-fidelity, emulated prototypes where the "Logical Reality" of the device is preserved regardless of the editor's width.

## The Senior's Quality Bar (Philosophy)

To reach senior-level expertise in Literate UI/UX, follow these three non-negotiable principles:

1.  **The Document is the Product**: Your markdown is not just documentation; it is a functional prototype. If the code is messy, the design is considered unverified.
2.  **Logical Truth over Literal Appearance**: Never design for the "now" (what you see in your sidebar). Design for the "target" (the emulated device). Use **Container Queries** exclusively.
3.  **Clean Spines, Rich Sidecars**: Keep the primary `.md` file (The Spine) focused on the narrative "Why." Move the "How" (implementation details) into sidecar `.jsx` files.

## Primary Use Cases & Triggers

Use this skill when the user mentions:
- **Product Specs / PRDs**: "Draft a spec for...", "Create a PRD with a prototype..."
- **Visual Essays**: "Write a data story about...", "Create a visual essay for..."
- **Interactive Demos**: "Build a clickable mockup...", "Prototype the login flow..."
- **Fidelity Audits**: "Check the responsive behavior of...", "Audit the mobile UI..."
- **Living Docs**: "Create a component gallery...", "Document this design system..."
- **Publishing / Sharing**: "Publish this to the web...", "Share this with the client...", "Deploy this prototype..."

## Technical Directives

### 1. The Hub-and-Spoke Workflow
Always treat a project as a multi-file system.
- **`spec.md`**: The narrative entry point. Start here. Use prose to set the stage.
- **Sidecar Libraries**: Implementation modules (e.g., `proto-kit.jsx`, `idea-kit.jsx`). Use these as shared libraries to serve multiple fences across your document. Extract logic here if a fence exceeds 30 lines.
- **`styles.css`**: Design tokens and advanced layout hacks.

### 2. Viewport Specification (DSL)
Establish the "Reality" in the first line of the code fence:
` ```jsx live id="stable-name" device=mobile orientation=portrait `
- **`id`**: **MANDATORY**. Prevents state loss during prose edits. Use kebab-case.
- **`device`**: `mobile` | `tablet` | `desktop` | `none` (liquid).
- **`orientation`**: `portrait` | `landscape`.
- **`zoom`**: `auto` (default) | `fill` (stretch) | `none` (1:1).

### 3. Styling Logic (The Container First Rule)
- **PROHIBITED**: Standard Media Queries (`md:`, `lg:`) and `vw`/`vh` units. They break during emulation.
- **REQUIRED**: **Container Queries** (`@md:`, `@lg:`) and Container Units (`cqw`, `cqh`). Use them for everything responsive.
- **Native CSS**: Supported via `css live` or imported files. Use for "UI Grid" precision.

## The Integrity Checklist (The Senior's Pass)

Before delivering, run this mental audit:
1.  **Is it resilient?** Do exported components have full default props? (Ensures stability when previewed directly in Gallery Mode).
2.  **Is it stable?** Is there a stable `id` on the main interactive fence?
3.  **Is it clean?** Are all helper components defined **BEFORE** the `export default` in sidecar files?
4.  **Is it local?** No external CDNs. Only use bundled packages (Lucide, Motion, etc.).
5.  **Is it narrated?** Does the prose explain the *intent* of the prototype or the screen that is being designed?

### Styling Strategy
Reactive MD supports both native CSS and Tailwind CSS (v4) in both preview modes.
- **Logical Reality**: Always use **Container Queries** (`@md:`) instead of Media Queries (`md:`). Elements respond to the emulated frame size, not the global window.
- **Native CSS**: Supported via `css live` fences or imported `.css` files. Use for advanced UI iteration and fine-grained layout control.
- **Tailwind v4**: Available out-of-the-box. Use the `@` prefix for responsive variants (e.g., `@md:grid-cols-2`, `@lg:p-8`).
- **Orientation Variants**: Use `@landscape:` and `@portrait:` for responsive layouts that adapt to emulated device rotation.

## Authoring Reference

### Fence Specification & Anchors
` ```jsx live [id] [device] [orientation] [zoom] [mid] [lock-view] `

| Anchor | Type | Principle |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`id="stable-id"`** | string | **Stability**. Prevents app-remount on prose edits. Essential for forms/state. |
| **`device="mobile"`** | enum | **Context**. Targets `mobile`, `tablet`, `desktop`. Default is `none` (liquid). |
| **`orientation="landscape"`** | enum | **Perspective**. Sets rotation. Triggers `@landscape` CSS variants. |
| **`zoom="fill"`** | enum | **Presentation**. `auto` is default; `fill` expands to sidebar width. |
| **`lock-view`** | flag | **Intent**. Standardizes UI by hiding manual emulator controls. |

### Visual Storytelling Rules
- **Non-Executable Discourse**: For anti-patterns or broken code, wrap regular fences in markdown backticks.
- **Library Discipline**: Sidecars are libraries, not just snippets. Export multiple components to be composed in the `spec.md`.
- **Preview Resilience**: Always use **default props** for presentation components. This ensures that when you open the sidecar file directly, every component is previewable in **Gallery Mode** without crashing.
- **The Ideal Fence**: Import complex UI from your sidecars; keep the fence under 10 lines of "glue code."
- **Fence Entry Patterns**: A fence can have multiple top-level components. The entry is identified by `export default` (preferred) or by convention — the last top-level PascalCase function. Both patterns are supported:
  - **Inner functions** (drafting): `function Entry() { function Helper() {...}; return <Helper />; }`
  - **Explicit export** (production-style): define helpers first, then `export default function Entry() {...}`
- **Import Patterns**:
  - `import './styles.css'` (Native CSS)
  - `import data from './data.json' with { type: 'json' }` (Mock Data)
  - `import { motion } from 'motion/react'` (Animation)

### 4. Publishing (`reactiveMd.publish`)

When a user asks to share or publish a prototype, guide them through the built-in publish workflow rather than any external tooling.

- **`Reactive MD: Publish`**: builds the site and deploys to their VPS over SSH. Prompts for slug and access model on first run; subsequent publishes are one-click.
- **`Reactive MD: Preview Published Output`**: build-only, opens result in the browser. Recommend this before the first deploy.
- **Access model**: Public (`/{slug}/`) or Protected (`/{token}/{slug}/` + browser passphrase gate). Suggest Protected for early-stage client work.
- **Config file**: `reactive-md.publish.json` in the project folder holds the slug, token, and entry point. Suggest gitignoring it if the passphrase is stored.
- **Server requirement**: SSH access + any static file server. No nginx config changes. rsync must be available on the client machine (scp fallback otherwise).
- **Entry detection order**: `entry` field → `main.md` → `index.md` → sole `.md` file → error.

## Boundaries & Refusals
- **No CDNs**: Refuse `axios`, `swr`, `recharts`, or external scripts. Use native `fetch` and bundled registry.
- **No DevOps**: Refuse Docker, deployment, or database setup. Publishing to the user's **own** VPS via `reactiveMd.publish` is supported and encouraged.
- **Scoped Prototypes**: Steer complex "Full-App" requests toward high-fidelity User Flows and interactive specs.

## Technical Integrity Checklist

Before delivering, ensure:
1.  **Pathing**: All local imports use absolute-relative paths (e.g., `./proto-kit.jsx` or `./idea-kit.jsx`).
2.  **Sidecars**: Logic/UI exceeding 30 lines is extracted to a sidecar file.
3.  **Single Export**: The `live` fence renders one component. Use `export default` to identify it explicitly, or rely on the convention that the last top-level PascalCase function is the entry.
4.  **Helper Placement**: Non-exported helper components in sidecar files are defined **BEFORE** the `export default`.
5.  **Preview Safety**: Exported components provide default prop values to prevent rendering crashes in standalone gallery view.
6.  **Stable ID**: Fences with state (forms, filters) must have a stable `id="..."`.

## Package & Data Reference (Offline Registry)

The following libraries are available **offline** (no CDN required) in both previews:

| Category | Packages |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Motion** | `motion/react` (exported as `motion`) |
| **Icons** | `lucide-react`, `@heroicons/react` |
| **State** | `zustand`, `jotai`, `react-hook-form` |
| **Validation** | `zod`, `@hookform/resolvers/zod` (`zodResolver`) |
| **Logic** | `es-toolkit`, `dayjs`, `uuid` |
| **Styles** | `clsx`, `tailwind-merge` (`twMerge`), `class-variance-authority` (`cva`) |

### Rule: No External CDNs
Prototypes are local-first. Refuse requests for `recharts`, `axios`, `swr`, or `react-query`. Use native `fetch()` and SVG/Tailwind for visualizations (refer to `chart-components.jsx`).

## Workflow: The "Project Folder" Model

Treat every literate doc as a **Hub-and-Spoke** system.

1.  **The Hub (`spec.md`)**: Narrative-driven entry point.
2.  **The Spokes**: `.jsx`, `.css`, and `.json` sidecars for implementation.

**Multi-File Architecture (Example):**
```
feature-name/
  spec.md              <- Narrative explaining "Why" and "How"
  idea-kit.jsx         <- Implementation library (Shared across fences)
  styles.css           <- Design system tokens and brand CSS
  data.json            <- Mock payload for prototypes
```

## Boundaries & Refusals
- **Infrastructure**: Refuse requests for Docker, CI/CD, databases, or real-time WebSockets.
- **Complexity**: If a user asks for a full-scale app, steer them toward a high-fidelity "Literate Prototype" that demonstrates the core user flows and UX intent rather than full system implementation.

## Examples
Refer to these recipes for pattern matching:
- **[A/B Test Proposal](references/recipes/a-b-test-proposal/spec.md)**: Compare components with business metrics.
- **[Fidelity Audit](references/recipes/fidelity-audit/spec.md)**: Test responsive boundaries and safe areas.
- **[Visual Essays](references/recipes/visual-essays/spec.md)**: Narrative storytelling with SVG charts.
- **[Multi-File Imports](references/recipes/notification-system/spec.md)**: Complex component organization.
