# Codex Skill Guide

Use Codex proactively for complex architectural decisions, deep code analysis, refactoring, security/performance audits, code reviews before commits/PRs, when stuck after 2+ failed attempts, or when the user explicitly requests GPT/Codex assistance.

## Models

| Role | Model |
| --- | --- |
| Primary | `gpt-5.4` |
| Fallback | `gpt-5.3-codex` |

Default to `gpt-5.4`. Fall back to `gpt-5.3-codex` if the user requests it or if `gpt-5.4` fails.

---

## Running `codex exec`

1. Ask the user (via `AskUserQuestion`) which model (`gpt-5.4` or `gpt-5.3-codex`) AND which reasoning effort (`xhigh`, `high`, `medium`, or `low`) in a **single prompt**. Default suggestion: `gpt-5.4` + `high`.

2. **Always use `-s read-only`** — codex is primarily a validator/analyzer. Only escalate sandbox if the user explicitly asks codex to edit files or needs network access:
   - User asks to edit/refactor → `-s workspace-write --full-auto` (confirm via `AskUserQuestion` first)
   - User needs network → `-s danger-full-access --full-auto` (confirm via `AskUserQuestion` first)

3. Assemble the command:
   - `-m <MODEL>` — model selection
   - `-c model_reasoning_effort="<effort>"` — reasoning effort
   - `-s read-only` — default sandbox (see step 2 for exceptions)
   - `-o /tmp/codex-last.txt` — always capture full response
   - `-C <DIR>` — working directory
   - `--skip-git-repo-check` — always include

4. Append `2>/dev/null` to suppress thinking tokens (stderr). Only show stderr if debugging.

5. Run the command, then read `/tmp/codex-last.txt` with the Read tool to get the full response (Bash output may truncate). Summarize for the user.

6. After completion: "You can resume this session at any time by saying 'codex resume'."

### Quick Reference - exec

| Use case | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Analysis/validation (default) | `codex exec --skip-git-repo-check -m MODEL -s read-only -o /tmp/codex-last.txt "prompt" 2>/dev/null` |
| Apply local edits | `codex exec --skip-git-repo-check -m MODEL -s workspace-write --full-auto -o /tmp/codex-last.txt "prompt" 2>/dev/null` |
| Network/broad access | `codex exec --skip-git-repo-check -m MODEL -s danger-full-access --full-auto -o /tmp/codex-last.txt "prompt" 2>/dev/null` |
| Different directory | `codex exec --skip-git-repo-check -C <DIR> -m MODEL -s read-only -o /tmp/codex-last.txt "prompt" 2>/dev/null` |

---

## Resuming Sessions

`resume` works both as top-level command and as `exec` subcommand:

| Mode | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Interactive resume (picker) | `codex resume` |
| Interactive resume (last) | `codex resume --last` |
| Non-interactive resume | `echo "prompt" \| codex exec --skip-git-repo-check resume --last 2>/dev/null` |

- Don't use config flags on resume unless explicitly requested.
- For `codex exec resume`, flags go between `exec` and `resume`.

---

## Running `codex review`

No need to ask for model/reasoning — review uses sensible defaults.

1. Ask the user (via `AskUserQuestion`) what to review:
   - **Uncommitted changes** — all local modifications
   - **Against a branch** — compare to base branch (e.g., `main`)
   - **Specific commit** — review a commit SHA

2. Optionally ask for custom review focus (security, performance, conventions, etc.)

3. Run the appropriate command and summarize findings.

### Quick Reference - review

| Use case | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Uncommitted changes | `codex review --uncommitted` |
| Against main branch | `codex review --base main` |
| Against specific branch | `codex review --base feature/xyz` |
| Specific commit | `codex review --commit abc123` |
| Commit with title context | `codex review --commit abc123 --title "Add user auth"` |
| With custom focus | `codex review --uncommitted "Focus on security"` |

**Note**: `--title` requires `--commit` (not `--base`).

### Configuration Overrides

```bash
codex review --uncommitted -c model="gpt-5.3-codex"
```

---

## Decision Guide: exec vs review

| Situation | Use |
| --- | --- |
| "Review my changes" | `codex review --uncommitted` |
| "Review this PR" | `codex review --base main` |
| "Analyze this architecture" | `codex exec` |
| "Help me debug this" | `codex exec` |
| "Refactor this code" | `codex exec` with workspace-write |
| "Is this secure?" | `codex review` for diffs, `codex exec` for deep analysis |

---

## Following Up

- After every command, use `AskUserQuestion` to confirm next steps
- For `exec`: offer to resume with `codex resume --last`
- For `review`: offer to help address specific findings

## Error Handling

- Stop and report failures on non-zero exit; request direction before retrying
- Summarize warnings or partial results and ask how to adjust
