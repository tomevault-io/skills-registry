# Plot Continuity Check

## Purpose

Systematically verify that all references in campaign documents are internally consistent — NPCs exist, locations are established, timelines align, and facts do not contradict each other.

## Continuity Check Process

### 1. Extract All References

Load and analyze all campaign content:

```
get_campaign_details()
# Campaign-level documents (world lore, session notes, etc.)
list_documents()  # omit module_id for campaign-level docs
read_document(document_id: document_id)
# Module-level documents
list_modules()
# For each module:
get_module_details(module_id: module_id)
list_documents(module_id: module_id)
read_document(document_id: document_id)
```

### 2. Build Reference Index

Extract and catalog all named entities:

#### Characters
- Extract NPC names mentioned in documents
- Cross-reference with `list_characters(character_type: "npc")`
- Use location/faction filters to verify groupings: `list_characters(character_type: "npc", location: "...")`, `list_characters(character_type: "npc", faction: "...")`
- Note roles, locations, and relationships
- Verify character inventories match document references: `get_character_inventory(character_id)`

#### Locations
- Extract places mentioned in read-aloud text, backstory, and NPC locations
- Check for consistent spelling and naming

#### Items
- Extract named items in documents, module loot, and character inventories
- Verify catalog references exist via `search_catalog(category: "item")`

#### Timeline Events
- Extract dates, times, and relative references ("X days ago")
- Check character ages against event dates
- Verify sequence consistency

#### Factions/Organizations
- Extract groups mentioned in documents
- Map NPC faction assignments
- Document inter-faction relationships

### 3. Cross-Reference Check

For each reference, verify:

| Check | Question |
|-------|----------|
| **Existence** | Does this NPC/location actually exist in the campaign? |
| **Spelling** | Is the name spelled consistently everywhere? |
| **Facts** | Are stated facts consistent across documents? |
| **Timeline** | Do dates and sequences make sense? |
| **Relationships** | Are NPC relationships consistently described? |

### 4. Common Continuity Issues

Look specifically for:

- **Orphan References**: NPC mentioned in document but not created as character
- **Name Variations**: "Lord Blackwood" vs "Baron Blackwood" vs "Blackwood"
- **Location Drift**: Inn called "The Rusty Nail" in one doc, "The Bent Nail" in another
- **Timeline Paradoxes**: Event happened "10 years ago" but NPC was "born 5 years ago"
- **Resurrection Issues**: Dead NPC referenced as alive in later content
- **Missing Connections**: NPC has no way to know information they reveal
- **Distance Problems**: Locations described inconsistently (next door vs across town)

## Output Format

Provide a structured continuity report:

```markdown
# Continuity Report: [Campaign Name]

## Summary
- Documents analyzed: X
- NPCs referenced: Y
- Locations referenced: Z
- Issues found: N

## Character Continuity

### Verified NPCs
| Name | Location | Role | Status |
|------|----------|------|--------|
| [Name] | [Location] | [Role] | [OK] Consistent |

### Orphan References
- "[Name]" mentioned in [Document] but no character record exists
- Suggestion: Create NPC or clarify reference

### Inconsistencies
- [NPC] described as [X] in [Doc1] but [Y] in [Doc2]

## Location Continuity

### Verified Locations
- [Location]: Referenced in [X] documents, consistent

### Naming Inconsistencies
- "[Name1]" vs "[Name2]" - likely same location?

## Timeline Continuity

### Verified Events
| Event | When | Referenced In |
|-------|------|---------------|
| [Event] | [Time] | [Documents] |

### Paradoxes
- [Event1] and [Event2] create impossible timeline

## Recommendations
1. [Specific fix]
2. [Specific fix]
```

## Interactive Mode

When checking interactively:

1. Start with a high-level scan
2. Report findings by category
3. Ask: "Should I investigate [specific issue] further?"
4. Offer to create missing NPCs or update documents to fix inconsistencies
