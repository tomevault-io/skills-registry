# Loot & Treasure Audit

## Purpose

Analyze treasure and magic item distribution across the campaign to ensure appropriate wealth and power progression. Identify modules with no loot, excessive rewards, or missing item types.

## Analysis Process

### 1. Gather All Loot Data

```
list_modules()
# For each module:
get_module_details(module_id)
# Extract: module_items (loot), monsters (for hoard context)

# Check campaign-level documents for treasure references
list_documents()  # omit module_id for campaign-level docs

list_characters(character_type: "npc")
# For each NPC:
get_character(character_id)
get_character_inventory(character_id)
# Extract: inventory items that might be loot

list_characters(character_type: "pc")
# For each PC:
get_character_inventory(character_id)
# Extract: items already awarded to players
```

### 2. Catalog Items

For each item found:
```
search_catalog(category: "item")(name: item_name)
```

Extract rarity, type (weapon, armor, wondrous, etc.), attunement requirement, and value.

### 3. Distribution Analysis

Calculate:
- Total gold value by module
- Magic items by rarity
- Items by type
- Items requiring attunement

### 4. Identify Issues

| Issue | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Loot Desert** | Module has no treasure defined |
| **Gold Flood** | Far exceeds level-appropriate wealth |
| **Attunement Overload** | Too many attunement items (limit: 3) |
| **Type Gap** | No weapons, or no armor, or no caster items |
| **Rarity Mismatch** | Legendary item at level 3 |
| **Consumable Drought** | No potions/scrolls for resource recovery |

## Output Format

```markdown
# Treasure Audit: [Campaign Name]

## Summary
- Total modules: [X]
- Modules with loot: [Y]
- Total magic items: [Z]
- Estimated gold value: [N] gp

## Magic Item Distribution

|--------|-------|---------------------|
| Common | [N] | [Expected] |
| Uncommon | [N] | [Expected] |
| Rare | [N] | [Expected] |
| Very Rare | [N] | [Expected] |
| Legendary | [N] | [Expected] |

### By Type

|------|-------|------|
| Weapons | [N] | [Yes/No] |
| Armor | [N] | [Yes/No] |
| Wondrous | [N] | [Yes/No] |
| Consumables | [N] | [Yes/No] |

### Attunement Load

## Module Breakdown

| Module | Gold | Magic Items | Issues |
|--------|------|-------------|--------|
| [Name] | [X] gp | [List] | [Issues] |

## Loot Deserts (No Treasure)
- [Module]: No loot defined
  - Suggestion: Add [appropriate items] based on CR [X] monsters

## Balance Concerns
- [Module]: [Issue description]
  - Suggestion: [Fix]

## Recommendations

### Missing Item Types
- Campaign needs more [type] items
- Suggested additions:
  - [Item] (search: `search_catalog(category: "item")(item_type: "X", rarity: "Y")`)

### Rarity Adjustments
- [Module] has [rarity] items too early
- Consider replacing with: [alternatives]
```

## Interactive Mode

1. Analyze full campaign loot
2. Present summary findings
3. For loot deserts, offer to search the catalog and add items via `add_item_to_module`
4. For balance issues, suggest specific swaps
