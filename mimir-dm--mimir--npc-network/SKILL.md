# NPC Network Analysis

## Purpose

Analyze and visualize relationships between NPCs, their faction affiliations, knowledge networks, and social connections. Identify isolated NPCs, missing connections, and opportunities for richer storytelling.

## Analysis Process

### 1. Gather NPC Data

```
list_characters(character_type: "npc")
# Filter by location or faction for focused analysis:
list_characters(character_type: "npc", location: "Waterdeep")
list_characters(character_type: "npc", faction: "Zhentarim")
# For each NPC:
get_character(character_id: character_id)
```

Extract from each NPC: name, role, location, faction affiliation, and module assignment.

### 2. Extract Implicit Relationships

Read documents to find relationship mentions:

```
# Campaign-level documents (world lore, session notes)
list_documents()  # omit module_id for campaign-level docs
read_document(document_id: document_id)
# Module-level documents
# For each module:
list_documents(module_id: module_id)
read_document(document_id: document_id)
```

Look for:
- Direct relationships: "X is Y's brother"
- Implied connections: Characters in the same location
- Faction ties: Members of the same organization
- Conflict relationships: Enemies, rivals
- Knowledge chains: Who knows what secrets

### 3. Build Relationship Matrix

Categorize relationships:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Family** | Blood relations, marriage |
| **Professional** | Employer/employee, colleagues |
| **Faction** | Same organization membership |
| **Location** | Same place, neighbors |
| **Conflict** | Enemies, rivals, grudges |
| **Secret** | Hidden connections players can discover |
| **Knowledge** | Who knows information about whom |

### 4. Network Analysis

Identify:

**Hub NPCs** — Characters with many connections. These are high-value targets for players. Consider: Are they protected? What happens if they die?

**Isolated NPCs** — Characters with no connections. These represent missed storytelling opportunities. Consider: How do players encounter them?

**Faction Clusters** — Groups of connected NPCs. Map internal faction dynamics and cross-faction connections.

**Information Flow** — How does news travel? Who would know if X happened? Trace rumor mill paths.

## Output Format

```markdown
# NPC Network: [Campaign Name]

## Faction: [Faction Name]
+-- [Leader NPC] (Leader)
|   +-- employs -> [NPC]
|   +-- rivals -> [NPC from other faction]
+-- [Member NPC]
|   +-- siblings -> [NPC]
+-- [Member NPC]

## Location: [Location Name]
+-- [NPC] - [Role]
+-- [NPC] - [Role]
+-- [NPC] - [Role]

## Key Relationships
- [NPC] <-secret lovers-> [NPC]
- [NPC] <-owes debt-> [NPC]
- [NPC] <-seeking revenge-> [NPC]

## Isolated NPCs (No Connections)
- [NPC]: Consider connecting to [suggestion]

## Hub NPCs (4+ Connections)
- [NPC]: [List of connections]
  - Risk: High-value target
  - Contingency: [Suggestion]
```

    C -->|secret deal| E[Thieves Guild Leader]
```

## Interactive Mode

1. Present overall network structure
2. Ask: "Which relationships would you like to explore?"
3. Deep-dive into specific factions or characters
4. Suggest missing connections: "These NPCs share a location but have no defined relationship. Should they know each other?"
5. Offer to update NPC records with discovered relationships
