# Campaign Pressure Testing

## Purpose

Systematically challenge campaign content by adopting an adversarial player mindset. Identify weaknesses, plot holes, and failure points before players discover them.

## Pressure Test Process

### 1. Gather Context

Load the campaign and module being tested:

```
get_campaign_details()
get_module_details(module_id: module_id)
list_characters(character_type: "npc")

# Check for maps and token placements
list_maps(module_id: module_id)
get_map(map_id: map_id)

# Check campaign-level documents for world context
list_documents()  # omit module_id for campaign-level docs

# Check for orphaned NPCs (not assigned to any module)
list_characters(character_type: "npc")
# Flag any NPC without a module assignment or location
```

Read all relevant documents to understand the scenario.

### 2. Apply Pressure Test Categories

Work through each category, asking probing questions:

**Murder Hobo Test**
- What if players kill the quest giver immediately?
- What if they attack every NPC on sight?
- Are there consequences that don't dead-end the campaign?

**Skip Content Test**
- What if players ignore the hook entirely?
- Can they bypass the dungeon and go straight to the BBEG?
- What if they refuse the quest?

**Clever Solution Test**
- Can they solve this with a single spell (Fly, Teleport, Speak with Dead)?
- What if they befriend the villain?
- Can divination magic reveal too much too early?

**Resource Test**
- What if they're out of spell slots when they reach the boss?
- What if they have unlimited money to throw at the problem?
- What if they hire an army of mercenaries?

**Information Test**
- What happens if they miss the key clue?
- Are there backup ways to get critical information?
- What if they get information out of order?

**Social Test**
- What if they intimidate/charm their way past obstacles?
- Can high Persuasion trivialize the challenge?
- What if they take hostages?

### 3. Document Findings

For each issue found, categorize severity:

| Severity | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Critical** | Campaign dead-ends, no recovery possible |
| **Major** | Significant content bypassed, story breaks |
| **Minor** | Suboptimal experience but recoverable |
| **Note** | Something to be aware of during play |

### 4. Suggest Mitigations

For each issue, propose solutions:
- Add contingency NPCs or events
- Create backup information sources
- Add consequences instead of blocking
- Prepare improvisational anchors

## Output Format

```markdown
# Pressure Test Report: [Module Name]

## Executive Summary
[1-2 sentence overall assessment]

## Critical Issues
- [Issue]: [Why it's a problem] -> [Suggested fix]

## Major Issues
- [Issue]: [Why it's a problem] -> [Suggested fix]

## Minor Issues
- [Issue]: [Why it's a problem] -> [Suggested fix]

## Strengths
- [What the module does well defensively]

## Recommended Preparations
- [DM notes to add]
- [Contingency NPCs to prepare]
- [Backup plot hooks]
```

## Interactive Mode

1. Present a scenario: "The players have just arrived at the tavern where the quest giver waits..."
2. Ask: "What's the worst thing your players might do here?"
3. Explore the consequences together
4. Document the failure mode and mitigation
