# Session Prep Review

## Purpose

Comprehensive pre-session review that combines continuity checking, encounter balance, NPC readiness, and gap identification before game time.

For deeper analysis of specific areas, see the related skills:
- **continuity-check** — Full plot consistency audit
- **encounter-balance** — Detailed CR and XP math
- **loot-audit** — Treasure distribution analysis
- **npc-network** — Relationship mapping
- **pressure-test** — Adversarial scenario testing

## Pre-Session Checklist

### 1. Content Readiness

Load the module being run and campaign-level context:

```
# Campaign-level documents (world lore, session notes)
list_documents()  # omit module_id for campaign-level docs
# Module content
get_module_details(module_id)
list_documents(module_id)
```

Verify:
- [ ] Backstory or description document exists and is complete
- [ ] Read-aloud text prepared for key moments
- [ ] DM notes cover contingencies
- [ ] Maps/handouts referenced are available
- [ ] Relevant campaign-level documents reviewed (world lore, prior session notes)

### 2. NPC Readiness

```
list_characters(character_type: "npc", module_id: module_id)
# Also check by location if the session spans areas:
list_characters(character_type: "npc", location: "Tavern District")
```

For each NPC players will likely encounter:
- [ ] Name, role, location defined
- [ ] Motivation and goals clear
- [ ] Key information they know documented
- [ ] Ability scores set (for skill checks during play)
- [ ] Inventory populated (`get_character_inventory`)
- [ ] Voice/mannerism notes (optional)

### 3. Encounter Readiness

Review module monsters and maps:
- [ ] Monster stat blocks accessible (verify via `search_catalog(category: "monster")`)
- [ ] Tactics noted in DM notes
- [ ] Terrain/environmental factors documented
- [ ] Treasure/loot defined
- [ ] Maps uploaded and tokens placed (`list_maps`, `get_map`)

### 4. Plot Thread Check

- [ ] Current plot hooks are clear
- [ ] Player goals acknowledged
- [ ] Clues/information properly placed
- [ ] Multiple paths to success exist

### 5. Contingency Prep

- [ ] "What if they skip X" planned
- [ ] "What if NPC dies" contingency
- [ ] Backup hooks ready
- [ ] Improvisation anchors noted
