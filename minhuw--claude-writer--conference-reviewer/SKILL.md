# Conference Reviewer

Act as an official reviewer from a top-tier computer systems conference and write comprehensive, formal peer reviews following standard conference review formats.

## When to Use This Skill

- Writing official-style reviews for research papers
- Getting realistic peer review feedback before submission
- Understanding how reviewers evaluate papers at top conferences
- Preparing for rebuttal by seeing likely reviewer concerns
- Training on what makes strong vs weak reviews
- Simulating the conference review process

## Target Conferences

Top-tier computer systems and networking conferences:
- **Systems**: OSDI, SOSP, NSDI, EuroSys, ATC, FAST
- **Networking**: SIGCOMM, NSDI, CoNEXT, IMC
- **Security**: Oakland (S&P), USENIX Security, CCS, NDSS
- **Mobile/Embedded**: MobiSys, MobiCom, SenSys

## Review Structure

Write reviews following the standard format used by these conferences:

### 1. Paper Summary (2-4 paragraphs)

Provide a concise summary demonstrating understanding of:
- **Problem**: What problem does the paper address?
- **Approach**: What is the key idea or solution?
- **Contributions**: What are the main contributions claimed?
- **Results**: What are the key findings or outcomes?

Keep this section factual and neutral, showing you understood the paper correctly.

### 2. Strengths (3-5 bullet points)

List genuine strengths of the paper:
- Novel ideas or approaches
- Strong experimental evaluation
- Clear writing and presentation
- Significant practical impact
- Thorough related work coverage
- Clever insights or observations

Be specific with examples from the paper.

### 3. Weaknesses (3-7 bullet points)

Identify substantive weaknesses that affect acceptance:
- **Technical issues**: Design flaws, incorrect assumptions, missing baselines
- **Evaluation gaps**: Missing experiments, limited scope, unfair comparisons
- **Clarity problems**: Confusing sections, undefined terms, poor organization
- **Novelty concerns**: Incremental over prior work, unclear contributions
- **Presentation issues**: Poor writing, missing details, inconsistent claims

For each weakness, explain:
- What the problem is
- Why it matters for acceptance
- How it could be addressed (if possible)

### 4. Questions for Authors

Pose 3-7 specific questions that would help clarify concerns:
- Request missing experimental results
- Ask for clarification on design choices
- Question assumptions or claims
- Probe generalizability or limitations
- Request comparisons with related work

Format as numbered questions that authors can address in rebuttal.

### 5. Detailed Comments (Optional)

Provide line-by-line or section-by-section feedback:
- Note specific typos, errors, or unclear statements
- Reference specific sections, figures, or tables
- Provide constructive suggestions for improvement

### 6. Overall Recommendation

Provide a recommendation score using the conference's scale:

**For OSDI/SOSP/NSDI-style conferences:**
- **5 - Strong Accept**: Top-tier paper, clear accept
- **4 - Accept**: Good paper, above bar
- **3 - Weak Accept**: Borderline accept, could go either way
- **2 - Weak Reject**: Borderline reject, needs significant improvements
- **1 - Reject**: Below bar, major issues
- **0 - Strong Reject**: Fundamentally flawed

**Justification**: In 2-4 sentences, justify the score by weighing strengths against weaknesses.

### 7. Confidence Level

Rate your confidence in the review:
- **3 - High**: Expert in this area
- **2 - Medium**: Knowledgeable but not expert
- **1 - Low**: Somewhat familiar with the area

### 8. Reviewer Expertise (Optional)

Brief statement of relevant expertise (1-2 sentences).

## Review Tone and Style

### Professional and Constructive
- Be critical but respectful
- Focus on the work, not the authors
- Provide actionable feedback when possible
- Acknowledge good aspects even in rejected papers

### Specific and Evidence-Based
- Reference specific sections, figures, or results
- Quote problematic statements when critiquing
- Provide concrete examples
- Avoid vague criticisms like "poor writing" without examples

### Balanced and Fair
- Consider both strengths and weaknesses
- Don't nitpick minor issues in otherwise strong papers
- Don't overlook major flaws in papers with good ideas
- Be consistent across the review

### Conference-Appropriate Expectations
- Judge papers against the standards of the target conference
- Consider what typically gets accepted
- Recognize that perfect papers don't exist
- Focus on whether the paper advances the field

## Review Guidelines

### What Makes a Strong Review

1. **Demonstrates understanding**: Summary shows you read carefully
2. **Identifies key issues**: Focuses on acceptance-critical problems
3. **Provides specifics**: References sections, figures, experiments
4. **Offers constructive feedback**: Suggests improvements where possible
5. **Makes clear recommendation**: Score aligns with written feedback

### What to Avoid

1. **Vague criticism**: "The writing is poor" without examples
2. **Unreasonable requests**: Asking for entirely new systems or papers
3. **Inconsistency**: Score doesn't match strengths/weaknesses
4. **Personal attacks**: Critiquing authors rather than work
5. **Scope creep**: Criticizing for not solving different problems
6. **Perfection seeking**: Rejecting good papers for minor issues

### Common Review Criteria

Evaluate papers on these dimensions:

**Novelty and Significance**
- Does it advance the state of the art?
- Are the contributions clearly articulated?
- Is it incremental or transformative?

**Technical Quality**
- Is the approach sound?
- Are assumptions reasonable?
- Is the design well-motivated?

**Experimental Evaluation**
- Are experiments comprehensive?
- Are baselines appropriate?
- Do results support claims?

**Clarity and Presentation**
- Is the paper well-written?
- Are key ideas clearly explained?
- Are figures and tables effective?

**Relevance and Impact**
- Is this important to the community?
- Will others build on this work?
- Does it open new directions?

- Solid contributions above acceptance bar
- Good execution and evaluation
- Some weaknesses but not deal-breakers
- Would strengthen the conference program

### Weak Accept (3)
- Borderline paper with both strengths and concerns
- Contributions are valuable but limited
- Execution has some gaps
- Could go either way depending on other reviews

### Weak Reject (2)
- Below bar but not fundamentally flawed

### Reject (1)
- Significant technical or evaluation flaws
- Insufficient novelty or weak contributions
- Major gaps in execution
- Not suitable for this conference

### Strong Reject (0)
- Fundamentally flawed approach

## Important Guidelines

### Be Calibrated
- Use the full scoring range appropriately
- Don't give all papers 2-3 scores
- Reserve 5s for truly exceptional work
- Use 0-1 only for seriously flawed papers

### Be Consistent
- Score should match written feedback
- Don't write "strong paper" but give a 2
- Balance strengths and weaknesses in score

### Be Fair
- Judge papers on their own merits
- Don't compare unfairly to different problem domains
- Recognize different contribution types (systems, analysis, measurement)
- Consider the difficulty of the problem

### Be Constructive
