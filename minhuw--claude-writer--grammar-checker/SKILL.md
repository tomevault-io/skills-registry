# Grammar Checker

Systematically scan research paper text through multiple passes to identify and fix typos, grammar errors, inappropriate word choices, and awkward expressions.

## When to Use This Skill

- Proofreading research papers before submission
- Performing systematic error detection across multiple categories
- Fixing specific grammar and usage issues
- Cleaning up text after major revisions
- Final pass before conference submission
- Non-native speakers checking for common errors

## Multi-Pass Scanning Approach

Perform systematic scans in the following order, completing each pass before moving to the next:

### Pass 1: Typos and Spelling
Scan for:
- Misspelled words
- Incorrect technical terminology
- Inconsistent capitalization (e.g., "LaTeX" vs "Latex")
- Inconsistent hyphenation (e.g., "real-time" vs "real time")
- Common typos (e.g., "teh", "recieve", "seperate")
- Missing or extra spaces
- Duplicated words (e.g., "the the")

### Pass 2: Grammar Errors
Scan for:
- Subject-verb agreement errors
- Incorrect verb tenses
- Wrong article usage (a/an/the)
- Incorrect prepositions
- Pronoun-antecedent agreement
- Sentence fragments
- Run-on sentences
- Comma splices
- Misplaced modifiers

### Pass 3: Inappropriate Words and Phrases
Scan for:
- Informal language (e.g., "gonna", "kinda", "a lot of")
- Colloquialisms and slang
- Contractions (e.g., "don't", "can't", "won't")
- First-person pronouns overuse in inappropriate contexts
- Vague quantifiers (e.g., "very", "really", "quite")
- Weasel words (e.g., "perhaps", "might", "possibly" when not needed)
- Emotional or subjective language
- Anthropomorphization (e.g., "the system thinks", "the paper argues")

### Pass 4: Awkward Expressions
Scan for:
- Unnecessarily complex sentence structures
- Passive voice where active is clearer
- Wordy phrases that can be simplified
- Redundant expressions (e.g., "past history", "future plans")
- Unclear pronoun references
- Dangling participles
- Split infinitives (when awkward)
- Awkward word order
- Non-idiomatic phrases for non-native speakers

### Pass 5: Academic Writing Style
Scan for:
- Inconsistent terminology across sections
- Undefined acronyms on first use
- Incorrect tense (present for current work, past for related work)
- Inappropriate use of hyphens to connect clauses
- Missing transitions between ideas
- Inconsistent formatting (citations, equations, etc.)
- Overly casual or overly complex language

## Output Format

For each pass, provide:

### 1. Pass Header
```
===== Pass X: [Category Name] =====
```

### 2. Issues Found
For each issue detected:
```
Location: [section/paragraph/line reference]
Issue Type: [specific error type]
Original: "[quoted text with error]"
Fixed: "[corrected text]"
Explanation: [why this is an error and why the fix is appropriate]
```

### 3. Pass Summary
```
Total issues found: [number]
Issues fixed: [number]
```

### 4. Final Summary
After all passes:
```
===== Overall Summary =====
Total scans performed: 5
Total issues found: [number]
Total fixes applied: [number]

Issues by category:
- Typos and Spelling: [count]
- Grammar Errors: [count]
- Inappropriate Words: [count]
- Awkward Expressions: [count]
- Academic Style: [count]
```

### 5. Corrected Text
Provide the fully corrected version of the text with all fixes applied.

## Scanning Guidelines

### Be Systematic
- Complete each pass fully before moving to the next
- Don't skip passes even if earlier passes found few errors
- Reread the text in each pass with fresh focus on that category

### Be Specific
- Quote the exact text with the error
- Provide precise location references
- Explain why something is an error
- Justify the proposed fix

### Be Conservative
- Only flag genuine errors, not stylistic preferences
- Don't "fix" correct but unusual constructions
- Preserve technical terminology even if uncommon
- Respect author's voice and style when appropriate

### Be Consistent
- Apply the same standards throughout the text
- Don't flag similar issues differently
- Maintain consistency with previous fixes

## Common Errors in Academic Writing

### Article Errors (for non-native speakers)
- Missing articles: "We propose ~~system~~ → a system"
- Wrong article: "We use ~~a~~ HTTP → the HTTP protocol"
- Unnecessary article: "The ~~the~~ latency is low → Latency is low"

### Preposition Errors
- "Different ~~with~~ → from"
- "Consist ~~in~~ → of"
- "Depend ~~from~~ → on"
- "Focus ~~to~~ → on"

### Verb Tense Errors
- Related work: "Smith et al. ~~propose~~ → proposed"
- Current work: "We ~~proposed~~ → propose"
- Results: "Figure 1 ~~showed~~ → shows"

### Common Typos in Technical Writing
- "seperator" → "separator"
- "occured" → "occurred"
- "sucessful" → "successful"
- "thier" → "their"
- "recieve" → "receive"

### Awkward Constructions
- "In order to" → "To" (simpler)
- "Due to the fact that" → "Because"
- "At this point in time" → "Now"
- "Make use of" → "Use"

### Inappropriate Informal Language
- "a lot of data" → "substantial data" or "large amounts of data"
- "get better results" → "achieve better results" or "obtain better results"
- "pretty good" → "quite good" or "favorable"
- "kind of interesting" → "somewhat interesting" or remove qualifier

## Error Severity Levels

Classify errors by severity to prioritize fixes:

### Critical (Must Fix)
- Grammar errors that change meaning
- Technical term misspellings
- Factual errors in text
- Undefined acronyms

### Major (Should Fix)
- Grammar errors that don't change meaning but are incorrect
- Awkward expressions that confuse readers
- Inconsistent terminology
- Informal language in formal sections

### Minor (Nice to Fix)
- Stylistic improvements
- Slightly awkward but correct constructions
- Overly complex sentences that could be simpler
- Minor redundancies

## Special Considerations for Academic Papers

### LaTeX Integrity
- Do not modify LaTeX commands or environments
- Only fix text content within commands
- Preserve math mode content unless clearly erroneous
- Maintain citation formatting

### Technical Terminology
- Verify technical terms against standard usage
- Don't "correct" domain-specific jargon
- Preserve acronym formatting (e.g., "RDMA", "TCP/IP")
- Check consistency of system/protocol names

### Common Academic Patterns
- "We propose X" ✓ (correct present tense)
- "The system achieves Y" ✓ (correct)
- "As shown in Figure Z" ✓ (correct)
- "This demonstrates that..." ✓ (correct)

## Target Audience

Research papers for top-tier computer science conferences (OSDI, NSDI, SOSP, SIGCOMM, etc.) written by both native and non-native English speakers.

## Important Guidelines

### Do Not Over-Correct
- Accept correct but uncommon constructions
- Don't impose one "right" way when multiple are valid
- Preserve author's voice when possible
- Focus on errors, not preferences

### Provide Explanations
- Explain why something is an error
- Note when a fix improves clarity vs correctness
- Indicate severity of each issue
- Help authors learn from corrections

### Be Thorough But Efficient
- Complete all five passes systematically
- Don't redundantly flag the same error type
- Group similar errors when reporting
- Focus on patterns, not just individual instances

### Maintain Academic Tone
- All corrections should preserve formal academic style
- Don't make text too casual or too stuffy
- Maintain appropriate technical level
- Keep language precise and clear
