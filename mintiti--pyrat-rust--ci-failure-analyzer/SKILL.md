# CI Failure Analyzer

Analyzes GitHub Actions CI failures for the current git branch and provides detailed failure reports.

## Instructions

When the user asks about CI status, failures, or test errors, follow these steps:

### 1. Get the current branch name

```bash
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD
```

### 2. List recent CI runs for the current branch

```bash
gh run list --branch <branch-name> --limit 5
```

This shows the most recent workflow runs with their status (completed/success/failure).

### 3. Identify the most recent failed run

Look for runs with `failure` status in the output. Get the run ID (first column).

### 4. Get detailed failure logs

```bash
gh run view <run-id> --log-failed
```

This shows only the failed job logs, filtering out successful steps.

### 5. Extract key failure information

Parse the logs to find:
- Which test(s) failed
- The actual error messages and stack traces
- Which Python version or environment had the failure
- The root cause of the failure

Use grep to find error patterns:
```bash
gh run view <run-id> --log | grep -A 20 "FAILED"
gh run view <run-id> --log | grep -B 5 -A 30 "ERRORS\|FAILURES"
gh run view <run-id> --log | grep -A 100 "ModuleNotFoundError\|ImportError\|AssertionError"
```

### 6. Present a clear failure report

Format the report as:

```markdown
## CI Status for branch: <branch-name>

**Most recent run:** <status> (run ID: <run-id>)

### Failure Summary

- **Failed tests:** List of failed test names
- **Total results:** X failed, Y passed, Z skipped
- **Error type:** ModuleNotFoundError / AssertionError / etc.

### Root Cause

Clear explanation of what went wrong

### Failed Test Details

For each failed test:
- Test file and function name
- Error message
- Relevant stack trace excerpt
```

## Tips

- Always start with `gh run list --branch` to get the current branch status
- Use `--log-failed` first for concise output
- If more context is needed, use full `--log` with grep
- Look for patterns like "FAILED", "ERROR", "ModuleNotFoundError", "AssertionError"
- CI logs can be very long - focus on the actual failure messages
- Check multiple test environments (different Python versions) if failures occur

## Example Usage

**User asks:** "Check the CI status"

**You should:**
1. Get current branch: `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`
2. List runs: `gh run list --branch <branch> --limit 5`
3. If failed, analyze: `gh run view <run-id> --log-failed`
4. Present failure report with root cause and failed tests

**User asks:** "Why did the tests fail?"

**You should:**
1. Follow same process as above
2. Deep dive into error messages with grep
3. Explain the root cause clearly
4. Suggest potential fixes if obvious from the error
