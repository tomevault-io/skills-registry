# US Census Data Skill

Query demographic, economic, housing, and population data from the US Census Bureau API. Supports American Community Survey (ACS), Decennial Census, and Population Estimates.

## Prerequisites

Before querying, check if the user has an API key:

1. Look for `CENSUS_API_KEY` in the user's `.env` file
2. If found, append to requests: `&key=<api_key>`
3. If not found, instruct the user to:
   - Register at https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html
   - Add to `.env`: `CENSUS_API_KEY=your_key_here`

The API works without a key for testing but is rate-limited and may block requests.

## Quick Start

The Census API is at `api.census.gov`. Queries require:
1. **Dataset path**: `/data/{year}/{dataset}` (e.g., `/data/2022/acs/acs5`)
2. **Variables**: `?get=NAME,B01001_001E` (variable codes)
3. **Geography**: `&for=county:*&in=state:17` (FIPS codes)
4. **API Key**: `&key=YOUR_KEY` (required for production use)

## Workflow

### Step 1: Clarify the Data Need

Ask the user:
- **Topic**: What data? (population, income, housing, education, poverty, etc.)
- **Geography**: What level? (nation, state, county, tract, block group, ZCTA?)
- **Time period**: Which year(s)?
- **Dataset**: ACS 5-year (most common), ACS 1-year, or Decennial Census?

### Step 2: Choose the Dataset

| Need | Dataset | Endpoint | Notes |
|------|---------|----------|-------|
| Detailed demographics (small areas) | ACS 5-Year | `/data/{year}/acs/acs5` | Block group+, most reliable |
| Recent data (large areas only) | ACS 1-Year | `/data/{year}/acs/acs1` | 65k+ population areas only |
| Exact population counts | Decennial | `/data/2020/dec/dhc` | Every 10 years, block level |
| Annual population change | Pop Estimates | `/data/{year}/pep/population` | County+, intercensal |

See `references/datasets.md` for complete dataset documentation.

### Step 3: Find Variables

Census variables use codes like `B19013_001E` (median household income). The `E` suffix = estimate, `M` suffix = margin of error.

**Option A - Popular Variables Reference:**
See `references/popular-variables.md` for curated list of common variables.

**Option B - Variable Search API:**
```
GET https://api.census.gov/data/2022/acs/acs5/variables.json
```

**Option C - Groups (Tables) API:**
```
GET https://api.census.gov/data/2022/acs/acs5/groups.json
```

See `references/datasets.md` for common table prefixes and naming conventions.

### Step 4: Build the Query

**Basic structure:**
```
https://api.census.gov/data/{year}/{dataset}?get={variables}&for={geography}&key={api_key}
```

**Example - Median income by county in Illinois:**
```
https://api.census.gov/data/2022/acs/acs5?get=NAME,B19013_001E&for=county:*&in=state:17&key=YOUR_KEY
```

**Geography predicates:**
- `for=state:*` - All states
- `for=county:*&in=state:17` - All counties in Illinois
- `for=tract:*&in=state:17&in=county:031` - All tracts in Cook County, IL
- `for=block%20group:*&in=state:17&in=county:031&in=tract:010100` - Block groups in tract

See `references/geographies.md` for complete geography hierarchy and FIPS codes.

### Step 5: Handle Response

Census API returns JSON array where first row is column headers:
```json
[
  ["NAME", "B19013_001E", "state", "county"],
  ["Cook County, Illinois", "62088", "17", "031"],
  ["DuPage County, Illinois", "99007", "17", "043"]
]
```

For large queries, the API has no built-in pagination. Request specific geographies or use `&in=` filters.

## Query Syntax Reference

### Parameters

| Parameter | Purpose | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| `get` | Variables to return | `get=NAME,B01001_001E,B19013_001E` |
| `for` | Target geography | `for=county:*` or `for=county:031` |
| `in` | Parent geography filter | `in=state:17` |
| `key` | API key | `key=abc123` |

### Variable Syntax

- Request multiple: `get=NAME,B01001_001E,B19013_001E` (comma-separated)
- Request table: `get=group(B19013)` (all variables in table)
- Include MOE: `get=B19013_001E,B19013_001M`

### Geography Wildcards

Use `*` for "all" at that level:
- `for=state:*` - All 50 states + DC + territories
- `for=county:*&in=state:06` - All counties in California
- `for=tract:*&in=state:06&in=county:037` - All tracts in LA County

## Common Query Patterns

**State-level totals:**
```bash
curl "https://api.census.gov/data/2022/acs/acs5?get=NAME,B01001_001E&for=state:*&key=$CENSUS_API_KEY"
```

**County-level within a state:**
```bash
curl "https://api.census.gov/data/2022/acs/acs5?get=NAME,B19013_001E&for=county:*&in=state:17&key=$CENSUS_API_KEY"
```

**Tract-level (requires state + county):**
```bash
curl "https://api.census.gov/data/2022/acs/acs5?get=NAME,B01001_001E&for=tract:*&in=state:17&in=county:031&key=$CENSUS_API_KEY"
```

**Multiple variables:**
```bash
curl "https://api.census.gov/data/2022/acs/acs5?get=NAME,B01001_001E,B19013_001E,B25001_001E&for=county:*&in=state:17&key=$CENSUS_API_KEY"
```

## Output Format

Provide the user with:
1. **Dataset**: Name + endpoint + year
2. **Variables**: Code + label for each
3. **Geography**: Level + filters
4. **Query**: Full URL or curl command
5. **Caveats**: MOE notes, update frequency, limitations

### Example Response Format
```
Dataset: ACS 5-Year 2022
Endpoint: https://api.census.gov/data/2022/acs/acs5

Variables:
- NAME: Geography name
- B19013_001E: Median Household Income (estimate)
- B19013_001M: Median Household Income (margin of error)

Geography: All counties in Illinois (state FIPS 17)

Query:
curl "https://api.census.gov/data/2022/acs/acs5?get=NAME,B19013_001E,B19013_001M&for=county:*&in=state:17&key=$CENSUS_API_KEY"

Note: ACS data are estimates with margins of error. 5-year estimates are most reliable for small geographies.
```

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| 400 Bad Request | Invalid variable or geography | Check variable exists for that dataset/year |
| 204 No Content | Valid query, no matching data | Geography may not exist or have data |
| Empty array `[]` | No data for that geography | Try different year or geography level |
| "error: unknown variable" | Variable doesn't exist | Use variables.json endpoint to verify |
| Missing data for small areas | ACS 1-year limitation | Use ACS 5-year for areas <65k population |

## Margins of Error (ACS Data)

ACS estimates have sampling error. Always consider:
- `E` suffix = estimate, `M` suffix = margin of error (90% confidence)
- Small geographies have larger MOEs
- 5-year estimates are more reliable than 1-year
- Decennial Census has no MOE (100% count)

See `references/datasets.md` for MOE calculation guidance.

## Geometry (TIGERweb)

Census data API returns tabular data only. For geographic boundaries, use TIGERweb:

See `references/tigerweb.md` for geometry retrieval and data joining.
