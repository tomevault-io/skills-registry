# Fork & Customize — Legislator Lookup

You are helping a user fork and customize the **legislator-lookup** repository for their own
organization and jurisdiction. This is a headless Next.js full-stack app that lets a civic org
show visitors who their elected officials are based on their address.

Work through the sections below **in order**. Each section has a goal and a set of questions to
ask. Do not skip ahead — wait for the user's answers before proceeding. Summarize what you will
change at the end of each section before making edits.

---

## Phase 0 — Orientation

Before you start, make sure you understand the repo layout. The key files you will be editing:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `frontend/src/lib/app-config.ts` | **Central config hub** — branding, geography, district layers, office slots, geocoding provider, map provider |
| `frontend/src/app/globals.css` | Color theme (Tailwind CSS 4 `@theme inline` block) |
| `frontend/src/app/layout.tsx` | Fonts and HTML metadata |
| `frontend/src/app/page.tsx` | Main UI — header, address input, official cards, footer |
| `frontend/data/officials.yaml` | The officials roster dataset |
| `frontend/data/district-maps/<state-slug>/` | GeoJSON boundary and district shapefiles |
| `frontend/src/lib/geocoding/providers.ts` | Geocoding provider implementations |
| `frontend/src/lib/geocoding/types.ts` | `GeocodingProviderName` union type |
| `frontend/src/lib/geocoding/index.ts` | Provider factory |
| `frontend/src/lib/maps/` | Map provider abstraction (protomaps, mapbox, google-maps) |
| `Dockerfile` | Docker production build |
| `railway.toml` | Railway deployment config |

Read `frontend/src/lib/app-config.ts` first — it is the single source of truth that drives
everything else.

---

## Phase 1 — Organization Branding

**Goal:** Re-skin the app for the user's organization.

### Questions to ask

1. **Do you have an existing website I can view to pull branding from?** (colors, logo, fonts,
   tone). If yes, use WebFetch to visit the site and extract:
   - Primary, secondary, and accent colors
   - Font families (display + body)
   - Organization name and tagline
   - Any logo or favicon assets

2. **Do you have a source code repo** for your existing site that I can review for design tokens
   or a style guide?

3. If neither, ask for:
   - Organization name
   - A one-line subtitle / tagline for the header (default: "Find your elected officials in seconds")
   - Footer blurb text
   - Attribution name and URL
   - Preferred color palette (or ask if the defaults are fine)

### What to change

Once you have the answers, update these files:

#### `frontend/src/lib/app-config.ts` — `branding` section

```typescript
branding: {
  orgName: "<org name>",
  headerSubtitle: "<subtitle>",
  footerBlurb: "<footer blurb>",
  attributionName: "<attribution>",
  attributionUrl: "<url>",
},
```

#### `frontend/src/app/globals.css` — color theme

The color theme lives in the `@theme inline` block. The key tokens:

```css
@theme inline {
  --color-ink: #122641;          /* primary dark — header, buttons, text */
  --color-ink-soft: #1a355c;     /* slightly lighter dark — button hover */
  --color-accent-sky: #2da9d8;   /* accent — links, location button, decorative */
  --color-accent-coral: #e2504a; /* secondary accent — errors, borders */
  --color-warm: #f7f3ea;         /* page background */
  --color-concrete: #e9e4d9;     /* borders, dividers */
  --color-steel: #64748b;        /* muted text */
  --color-steel-light: #94a3b8;  /* lighter muted text */
  --color-surface: #ffffff;      /* card backgrounds */
}
```

Also update the `body` background-color and dot pattern color in the same file to match
`--color-warm` and `--color-ink`.

#### `frontend/src/app/layout.tsx` — fonts

The app uses two Google Fonts loaded via `next/font/google`:

- `Space_Grotesk` — display font (headings, org name, labels)
- `Source_Sans_3` — body font (everything else)

If the org has specific fonts, swap them here. If their fonts are not on Google Fonts, switch to
`next/font/local` and place font files in `frontend/public/fonts/`.

#### `frontend/src/app/page.tsx` — UI copy and structure

This is a single-file React component (~640 lines). Key areas to customize:

- **Header block** (~line 340-365): org name with decorative stars, subtitle, coral accent bar
- **"Find Your Officials" card** (~line 366-500): section heading, button labels
- **Official result cards** (~line 545-600): office label, party badge, website/phone links
- **Footer** (~line 613-640): org name, blurb, attribution link, decorative diamonds

The decorative elements (stars `✶`, diamonds `◆`, grid overlay) can be changed or removed to
match the org's style.

#### Favicon

Replace `frontend/src/app/favicon.ico` with the org's favicon.

---

## Phase 2 — Jurisdiction & District Geography

**Goal:** Configure the app for the correct state/jurisdiction and district boundaries.

### Questions to ask

1. **What state or jurisdiction is this for?** Get the state name, abbreviation, and slug.
2. **What district types do you need?** Common ones:
   - Congressional (US House)
   - State Senate
   - State House / Assembly
   - County commission / board
   - City council / ward
   - School board
   - Judicial districts
   - Any other local boundaries

### If this is NOT Illinois

The sample data ships with Illinois GeoJSON shapefiles. For a different jurisdiction, the user
needs to:

#### A. Replace the GeoJSON district maps

Each district type needs a GeoJSON `FeatureCollection` where each `Feature` is one district.
The critical requirement: each feature must have a **numeric district identifier** in its
`properties` object.

**Where to get shapefiles:**

- **US Census TIGER/Line**: https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/tiger-line-file.html
  - Congressional districts, state legislative districts, county subdivisions
  - Download as Shapefile, convert to GeoJSON with `ogr2ogr` or mapshaper.org
- **State GIS portals**: Most states publish their own redistricting shapefiles
- **redistrictingdatahub.org**: Cleaned and standardized district boundaries
- **Local government GIS**: City wards, county commission districts, school boards

**File organization:**

```
frontend/data/district-maps/<state-slug>/
├── boundary/
│   └── boundary.geojson        # Jurisdiction outline (FeatureCollection, 1 feature)
├── congressional/
│   └── districts.geojson       # One feature per district
├── state_senate/
│   └── districts.geojson
├── state_house/
│   └── districts.geojson
└── <any-other-layer>/
    └── districts.geojson
```

Help the user identify the **property name** in each GeoJSON that holds the district number.
Common patterns from Census TIGER data:

| Layer | Common property names |
|-------|----------------------|
| Congressional | `CD119FP`, `GEOID`, `DISTRICT` |
| State Senate | `SLDUST`, `DISTRICT`, `DIST_NUM` |
| State House | `SLDLST`, `DISTRICT`, `DIST_NUM` |
| County | `DISTRICT`, `DIST`, `COUNTYFP` |
| City Ward | `WARD`, `ward`, `ward_id` |

After placing the files, open one and check the `properties` of the first feature to confirm the
property name. Record it — you will need it for the config.

#### B. Update `app-config.ts` — geography section

```typescript
const STATE_SLUG = "<state-slug>";  // e.g. "ohio", "virginia"
const DISTRICT_MAP_ROOT = `district-maps/${STATE_SLUG}`;

// In APP_CONFIG:
geography: {
  jurisdictionName: "<display name>",  // e.g. "Ohio"
  countryCode: "US",
  state: {
    code: "<XX>",       // e.g. "OH"
    name: "<full name>",
    slug: STATE_SLUG,
  },
  bounds: {
    minLat: <south boundary>,
    maxLat: <north boundary>,
    minLng: <west boundary>,
    maxLng: <east boundary>,
  },
  focusPoint: { lat: <center lat>, lng: <center lng> },
  districtMapPack: {
    root: DISTRICT_MAP_ROOT,
    boundaryPath: `${DISTRICT_MAP_ROOT}/boundary/boundary.geojson`,
    layers: {
      // One entry per district type. The key becomes the layer ID
      // referenced in officials.yaml and the officeSlots config.
      congressional: {
        label: "Congressional",
        path: `${DISTRICT_MAP_ROOT}/congressional/districts.geojson`,
        numberProperty: "<property name from GeoJSON>",
        numberPropertyAliases: ["<lowercase variant>"],
      },
      // ... repeat for each layer
    },
  },
},
```

**How to find bounds and focus point:**
- Use https://boundingbox.klokantech.com/ — select the state, copy CSV format (W,S,E,N)
- `minLng=W, minLat=S, maxLng=E, maxLat=N`
- Focus point is typically the largest city or geographic center

---

## Phase 3 — Office Slots & Officials Roster

**Goal:** Define which offices appear in results and populate the officials data.

This is the key difference from an endorsement guide — here you are mapping **actual elected
officials** to their offices, not endorsements to races.

### Questions to ask

1. **Which elected offices should appear in results?** For each office:
   - Is it statewide (e.g. US Senator, Governor) or district-based?
   - If district-based, which district layer does it map to?
2. **Do you have a list of current officials?** (names, parties, websites, phone numbers)
3. **How many seats per office type?** (e.g. 2 US Senators, 1 US Representative per district)

### A. Update `app-config.ts` — officeSlots

The `officeSlots` array drives the UI ordering and determines how each office is resolved.

```typescript
officials: {
  officeSlots: [
    // Statewide offices — appear for every address
    { id: "us_senate_1", label: "US Senator", statewide: true },
    { id: "us_senate_2", label: "US Senator", statewide: true },

    // District offices — resolved by the user's district in the matching layer
    { id: "us_house", label: "US Representative", districtLayer: "congressional" },
    { id: "state_senate", label: "State Senator", districtLayer: "state_senate" },
    { id: "state_house", label: "State Representative", districtLayer: "state_house" },

    // Local offices — use their own district layers
    { id: "city_council", label: "City Council", districtLayer: "city_ward" },
    { id: "county_commissioner", label: "County Commissioner", districtLayer: "cook_county" },
  ],
},
```

Rules:
- Each slot needs a unique `id` that matches entries in `officials.yaml`
- `label` is displayed in the UI as the office title
- Statewide slots use `statewide: true` (no district lookup)
- District slots use `districtLayer: "<layer-id>"` where the layer ID matches a key in
  `districtMapPack.layers`
- Slots appear in the API response and UI in the order listed here

### B. Replace `officials.yaml`

The officials file uses this structure:

```yaml
officials:
  # Statewide offices (no district field)
  - office_id: us_senate_1
    name: Jane Smith
    party: D
    url: https://smith.senate.gov
    phone: "(202) 555-0100"

  - office_id: us_senate_2
    name: John Doe
    party: R
    url: https://doe.senate.gov

  # District-specific offices
  - office_id: us_house
    district:
      layer: congressional     # must match a key in app-config layers
      number: 7                # must match a district number in the GeoJSON
    name: Alice Johnson
    party: D
    url: https://johnson.house.gov
    phone: "(202) 555-0200"
```

Rules:
- `office_id` must match an `id` in the `officeSlots` config
- **Statewide** officials omit the `district` field entirely
- **District** officials must have `district.layer` (matching a config layer key) and
  `district.number` (matching a GeoJSON feature's number property)
- `party` is typically a single character: `D`, `R`, `I`, `G`, `L`, etc.
- `url` and `phone` are optional — they render as links in the official's card
- You need one entry per official per district. For a state with 15 congressional districts,
  that is 15 entries with `office_id: us_house`
- If the org hasn't gathered all officials yet, create a placeholder file with the correct
  structure and a few examples so they can fill it in later. The UI shows "Not configured"
  for any office slot without a matching official.

---

## Phase 4 — Geocoding Provider

**Goal:** Select and configure the address lookup service.

### Questions to ask

1. **Which geocoding service do you plan to use?** The app has built-in support for:

   | Provider | Env Variable | Free Tier | Notes |
   |----------|-------------|-----------|-------|
   | Geocode Earth | `GEOCODE_EARTH_API_KEY` | Trial available | Pelias-based, good US coverage |
   | Mapbox | `MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN` | 100k req/mo free | Popular, requires Mapbox account |
   | Google Maps | `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` | $200/mo credit | Most complete, requires billing |
   | Geoapify | `GEOAPIFY_API_KEY` | 3k req/day free | Budget-friendly option |

2. If they want a **different provider** not listed above, you will need to implement a new
   provider. See "Adding a New Geocoding Provider" below.

3. **Do you already have an API key?** They do not need to share it — just confirm they have one
   or know how to obtain one.

### Using a built-in provider

Update `frontend/src/lib/app-config.ts`:

```typescript
geocoding: {
  provider: "mapbox",  // or "geocode-earth", "google-maps", "geoapify"
  autocompleteLimit: 8,
},
```

The corresponding environment variable must be set at runtime (not committed to the repo).

### Adding a new geocoding provider

If the user needs a provider not already implemented, follow this pattern:

1. **Add the provider name** to the union type in `frontend/src/lib/geocoding/types.ts`:

   ```typescript
   export type GeocodingProviderName =
     | "geocode-earth"
     | "mapbox"
     | "google-maps"
     | "geoapify"
     | "new-provider";   // <-- add here
   ```

2. **Implement the provider** in `frontend/src/lib/geocoding/providers.ts`. Every provider must
   implement the `GeocodingClient` interface:

   ```typescript
   interface GeocodingClient {
     provider: GeocodingProviderName;
     geocodeAddress(address: string): Promise<GeocodeResult>;
     autocompleteAddress(query: string): Promise<AutocompleteSuggestion[]>;
     reverseGeocode(lat: number, lng: number): Promise<string | null>;
   }
   ```

   Use the existing providers as a template. Key things each method must do:
   - `geocodeAddress`: Forward geocode an address string → `{ lat, lng, matchedAddress }`
   - `autocompleteAddress`: Return address suggestions as the user types → array of
     `{ address, lat, lng }`
   - `reverseGeocode`: Convert coordinates to a display address → string or null

   Use the shared helpers already in the file:
   - `fetchJson(url, options?)` — HTTP with 10s timeout
   - `normalizeAutocompleteResults(features, addressGetter, scope)` — filters by bounds + limits
   - `getEnvOrThrow(name, value)` — reads env var or throws

3. **Register the provider** in the `createGeocodingClient` factory in
   `frontend/src/lib/geocoding/providers.ts` (~line 543):

   ```typescript
   case "new-provider":
     return createNewProviderClient(scope);
   ```

4. **Set the provider** in `app-config.ts` and document the required env variable.

---

## Phase 5 — Map Provider

**Goal:** Configure how district map tiles are rendered.

### Questions to ask

1. **Which map tile provider do you want to use?** Built-in support for:

   | Provider | Env Variable | Notes |
   |----------|-------------|-------|
   | Protomaps | `NEXT_PUBLIC_PROTOMAPS_API_KEY` | Default. Free tier, self-hostable tiles |
   | Mapbox | (uses same `MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN`) | If already using Mapbox for geocoding |
   | Google Maps | (uses same `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`) | If already using Google for geocoding |

2. **Do you want district map embeds?** The `ui.showDistrictShapes` config controls whether
   each official's card shows a small map of their district. Set to `false` to disable maps
   entirely (no map API key needed).

### What to change

Update `frontend/src/lib/app-config.ts`:

```typescript
maps: {
  provider: "protomaps",  // or "mapbox" or "google-maps"
  protomaps: { style: "light" },  // only used if provider is protomaps
},
ui: {
  showDistrictShapes: true,  // set to false to disable district maps
},
```

The map provider uses MapLibre GL JS (loaded via CDN in `layout.tsx`) with Protomaps vector
tiles by default. The `DistrictMap` component in `src/components/DistrictMap.tsx` renders each
official's district outline on a small embedded map.

If adding a new map provider, implement the `MapAdapter` interface in `src/lib/maps/`:

```typescript
interface MapAdapter {
  provider: MapProviderName;
  mountDistrictMap(options: DistrictMapMountOptions): () => void;  // returns cleanup function
}
```

---

## Phase 6 — Deployment

**Goal:** Get the app deployed and accessible.

### Questions to ask

1. **How do you plan to deploy?** Common options:
   - **Railway** (pre-configured in this repo)
   - **Vercel** (natural fit for Next.js)
   - **Fly.io**
   - **AWS / GCP / Azure** (ECS, Cloud Run, App Engine, etc.)
   - **Docker on own infrastructure**

2. **Do you have a custom domain?**

### Deployment guides

#### Railway (already configured)

The repo includes `railway.toml` and `Dockerfile`. Steps:

1. Push repo to GitHub
2. Create a Railway project and connect the GitHub repo
3. Add environment variables in the Railway dashboard:
   - Geocoding API key (e.g. `GEOCODE_EARTH_API_KEY`)
   - Map tiles key if using Protomaps (`NEXT_PUBLIC_PROTOMAPS_API_KEY`)
4. Railway auto-deploys on push to main
5. Health check endpoint: `/api/health`

#### Vercel

Next.js on Vercel needs no Dockerfile. Steps:

1. Remove or ignore the `Dockerfile` (Vercel uses its own build system)
2. Set the root directory to `frontend` in Vercel project settings
3. Add env vars in Vercel dashboard
4. Push to deploy

Note: The `Dockerfile` and `railway.toml` can stay in the repo without affecting Vercel.

#### Docker (generic)

```bash
docker build -t legislator-lookup .
docker run -p 3000:3000 \
  -e GEOCODE_EARTH_API_KEY=<key> \
  -e NEXT_PUBLIC_PROTOMAPS_API_KEY=<key> \
  legislator-lookup
```

The Dockerfile is a standard Node 20 build. It works on any container platform.

#### Fly.io

1. Install `flyctl`
2. Run `fly launch` from the repo root (it will detect the Dockerfile)
3. Set secrets: `fly secrets set GEOCODE_EARTH_API_KEY=<key> NEXT_PUBLIC_PROTOMAPS_API_KEY=<key>`
4. Deploy: `fly deploy`

#### Static export (not recommended)

The app relies on server-side API routes for geocoding (to keep API keys secret). A static
export would require rewriting the geocoding calls to run client-side, which exposes API keys.

---

## Phase 7 — Testing & Validation

**Goal:** Make sure everything works before going live.

After making changes, run through this checklist:

### 1. Install and build

```bash
cd frontend
npm ci
npm run build
```

Fix any TypeScript errors. Common issues:
- Mismatched layer IDs between `app-config.ts` officeSlots and `officials.yaml`
- Missing GeoJSON files referenced in config
- Typos in geocoding provider name

### 2. Run tests

```bash
npm test
```

Some tests reference Illinois-specific coordinates and data. Tests that may need updating:
- `__tests__/lookup-coordinates.test.ts` — endpoint tests using specific lat/lng
- `__tests__/lookup-address.test.ts` — address geocoding tests (need valid API key)
- `__tests__/services.test.ts` — district lookup and official matching tests
- `__tests__/lookup-validation.test.ts` — bounds validation tests

Run `npm run test:fast` to skip geocoding-dependent tests during development.

### 3. Lint

```bash
npm run lint
```

### 4. Manual smoke test

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then test:
- Visit http://localhost:3000
- Click "Use My Current Location" button
- Type an address in the autocomplete field
- Verify officials appear in the result cards with correct office labels
- Check that district map embeds render (if `showDistrictShapes` is enabled)
- Test an address outside the jurisdiction (should show an error)
- Test the shareable URL by copying the `?lat=...&lng=...` query string

### 5. API smoke test

```bash
# By coordinates
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/lookup?lat=<lat>&lng=<lng>"

# By address
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/lookup?address=<address in jurisdiction>"

# Autocomplete
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/autocomplete?q=<partial address>"

# Reverse geocode
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/reverse?lat=<lat>&lng=<lng>"

# Health check
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/health"
```

---

## Phase 8 — Final Touches

Before handing off, consider these:

### CI/CD

The repo has a GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/ci.yml` that runs lint, tests, and
build on push to main and on PRs. Make sure the tests pass after your changes, or update the
test fixtures for the new jurisdiction.

### Security

- Never commit API keys. Use environment variables.
- The geocoding API key is server-side only (no `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix).
- The Protomaps key uses `NEXT_PUBLIC_` because it is used client-side for map tile requests.
- The app has no database, auth, or user accounts — it is read-only.

### Performance

- GeoJSON files are loaded into memory and cached on first request. Very large shapefiles
  (>10 MB) may slow cold starts. Consider simplifying geometries with mapshaper.org or
  `turf.simplify()` before adding them.
- The `showDistrictShapes` config returns simplified GeoJSON geometry in API responses. District
  shapes are simplified with `turf.simplify({ tolerance: 0.002 })` before being sent to the
  client.

### Accessibility

- The app uses semantic HTML and has keyboard navigation for the autocomplete dropdown
  (arrow keys, enter, escape).
- Color contrast should be checked if you change the theme colors. Use the WebAIM contrast
  checker.

### Non-US jurisdictions

The app assumes US-style geocoding (addresses, states, ZIP codes) but the core architecture is
jurisdiction-agnostic. For non-US use:
- Update `countryCode` in config
- Provide appropriate GeoJSON boundaries
- Choose a geocoding provider with good coverage in the target country
- The bounds and focus point system works globally

---
