# Production Readiness Assessment System

Enterprise-grade production readiness evaluation framework that exceeds the standards of top-tier technology companies (Google, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft). This skill conducts exhaustive multi-dimensional analysis of any GitHub repository to determine production deployment readiness.

## Overview

Production readiness is not just about working code—it encompasses security posture, operational excellence, scalability architecture, observability infrastructure, compliance requirements, cost efficiency, and team preparedness. This skill evaluates all dimensions systematically.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and analyze a GitHub repository
python scripts/production_readiness.py https://github.com/owner/repo

# Generate comprehensive report
python scripts/production_readiness.py https://github.com/owner/repo --output report.md

# Specific dimension analysis
python scripts/production_readiness.py https://github.com/owner/repo --focus security,performance
```

## Assessment Dimensions

This framework evaluates **15 critical dimensions**:

| Dimension | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Security | Critical | Vulnerabilities, auth, encryption, secrets management |
| Architecture | Critical | Design patterns, scalability, modularity |
| Reliability | Critical | Error handling, fault tolerance, recovery |
| Performance | High | Latency, throughput, resource efficiency |
| Observability | High | Logging, metrics, tracing, alerting |
| Testing | High | Coverage, quality, automation |
| DevOps | High | CI/CD, IaC, deployment strategies |
| Data Management | High | Migrations, backups, consistency |
| API Contracts | Medium | Versioning, documentation, stability |
| Documentation | Medium | Code docs, runbooks, architecture diagrams |
| Compliance | Variable | Regulatory requirements (GDPR, SOC2, etc.) |
| Cost Optimization | Medium | Resource efficiency, scaling costs |
| Dependencies | Medium | Currency, vulnerabilities, licensing |
| Configuration | Medium | Secrets, environment management |
| Team Readiness | Medium | Knowledge transfer, on-call procedures |

## Scoring Methodology

### Overall Production Readiness Score

```
Score = Σ(Dimension Score × Weight) / Σ(Weights)
```

**Readiness Levels:**
- **90-100**: Production Ready - Deploy with confidence
- **75-89**: Nearly Ready - Minor issues to address
- **50-74**: Significant Work Needed - Major gaps identified
- **25-49**: Not Ready - Critical issues blocking deployment
- **0-24**: Substantial Rebuild Required - Fundamental problems
