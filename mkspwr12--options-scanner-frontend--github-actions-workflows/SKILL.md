## Trigger Decision Tree

Use this to choose the right event trigger for your workflow:

```
Is this a code change?
├─ YES ─ Push to branch? ──────────────── on: push (branches, paths)
│        PR validation? ────────────────── on: pull_request
│        PR from fork? ─────────────────── on: pull_request (NOT pull_request_target!)
│        Tag/release? ──────────────────── on: push (tags: 'v*')
│
├─ NO ── Manual/on-demand? ─────────────── on: workflow_dispatch (with inputs)
│        Recurring schedule? ───────────── on: schedule (cron)
│        Called by another workflow? ────── on: workflow_call (reusable)
│        React to issue/comment/label? ─── on: issues / issue_comment / label
│
└─ MULTI-TRIGGER ─ CI + manual deploy? ── combine push + workflow_dispatch
```

## Minimal Workflow Example

```yaml
name: CI Pipeline
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
    paths: ['src/**', 'tests/**']
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
permissions:
  contents: read
concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 15
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with: { node-version: '20.x', cache: 'npm' }
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build
      - run: npm test
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with: { name: build-output, path: dist/, retention-days: 7 }
```

**Demonstrates**: path-filtered triggers, explicit permissions, concurrency, timeout, built-in caching, artifact upload.

## Core Concepts

Each concept is summarized below. Detailed YAML lives in the linked reference file.

### Workflow Syntax & Events

**Key elements**: `name`, `on` (triggers), `env` (global vars), `permissions`, `concurrency`, `jobs`.
Path filters (`paths` / `paths-ignore`) prevent unnecessary runs. Use `concurrency.cancel-in-progress: true` to avoid queue buildup.

> 📖 [references/workflow-syntax-reference.md](references/workflow-syntax-reference.md)

### Jobs, Steps & Runners

- **Job dependencies**: `needs: [job-a, job-b]` for DAG ordering.
- **Conditionals**: `if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'` on jobs or steps.
- **Status functions**: `success()`, `failure()`, `always()`, `cancelled()`.
- **Runners**: `ubuntu-latest` (default), `windows-latest`, `macos-latest`, or `[self-hosted, label]`.
- **Timeouts**: Always set `timeout-minutes` to prevent runaway jobs.

> 📖 [references/jobs-and-steps-patterns.md](references/jobs-and-steps-patterns.md)

### Secrets, Variables & Matrix Builds

- **Secrets**: Use `${{ secrets.NAME }}` — never hardcode. Scoped to repo, environment, or org.
- **Variables**: `${{ vars.NAME }}` for non-sensitive config (environment URLs, feature flags).
- **Environment scoping**: `environment: production` restricts secret/variable access + enables approval gates.
- **Matrix strategy**: Cross-product of OS × language version. Use `exclude` / `include` to customize. Set `fail-fast: false` for full coverage.

> 📖 [references/secrets-variables-matrix.md](references/secrets-variables-matrix.md)

### Reusable Workflows & Custom Actions

- **Reusable workflows** (`on: workflow_call`): DRY pattern for shared CI/CD pipelines. Accept `inputs` and `secrets`, emit `outputs`.
- **Composite actions**: Bundle multi-step logic into a single `uses:` step. Must set `shell:` on every `run:`.
- **JavaScript actions**: Full programmability via `@actions/core` and `@actions/github`.
- **When to use which**: Reusable workflow = multi-job orchestration. Composite action = reusable step sequence. JS action = complex logic with API calls.

> 📖 [references/reusable-workflows-and-actions.md](references/reusable-workflows-and-actions.md)

### Caching & Artifacts

- **Built-in caching**: Most `setup-*` actions have a `cache` input — prefer this over manual `actions/cache`.
- **Manual caching**: Use `actions/cache@v4` with content-hash keys (`hashFiles('**/lockfile')`).
- **Artifacts**: `upload-artifact` / `download-artifact` for passing build outputs between jobs. Set `retention-days`.
- **Docker layer caching**: Use `cache-from: type=gha` with `docker/build-push-action`.

## Security Best Practices

> ⚠️ **This section is NOT compressed. Read every item.**

### 1. Secret Management

```yaml
# ✅ GOOD: Reference secrets through env vars
- run: ./deploy.sh
  env: { API_KEY: ${{ secrets.API_KEY }} }

# ❌ BAD: Hardcoded credentials
- run: ./deploy.sh
  env: { API_KEY: 'sk_live_abc123' }  # NEVER
```

### 2. Pin Action Versions

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@b4ffde65f46336ab88eb53be808477a3936bae11  # ✅ SHA pin (v4.1.1)
- uses: actions/checkout@v4                                         # ⚠️ Major tag (OK)
- uses: actions/checkout@main                                       # ❌ Mutable branch
```

### 3. Minimal Permissions

```yaml
permissions:          # ✅ Least-privilege
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
# permissions: write-all  ← ❌ NEVER
```

### 4. Pull Request Security

Use `on: pull_request` (read-only token, safe for forks).
`pull_request_target` grants write token + secrets — **only** use with label gating + SHA checkout:

```yaml
on:
  pull_request_target:
    types: [labeled]
jobs:
  safe-job:
    if: contains(github.event.pull_request.labels.*.name, 'safe-to-run')
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with: { ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }} }
```

### 5. Script Injection Prevention

```yaml
# ✅ GOOD: Untrusted input via env var    │  # ❌ BAD: Direct interpolation
- env:                                     │  - run: echo "${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}"
    TITLE: ${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}
  run: echo "$TITLE"
```

### 6. Security Checklist

- [ ] All secrets stored in GitHub Secrets (repo/org/environment), never in code
- [ ] Actions pinned to SHA or major version tag
- [ ] `permissions` block is explicit and minimal on every workflow
- [ ] `pull_request_target` is avoided or gated by label + SHA checkout
- [ ] All `${{ }}` expressions from user input go through env vars, not inline shell
- [ ] Dependency review / `npm audit` / `dotnet list package --vulnerable` in CI
- [ ] CODEOWNERS protects `.github/workflows/**`
- [ ] Environment protection rules (approvals) on production deployments

---

## Troubleshooting

Set **repository secrets** `ACTIONS_RUNNER_DEBUG=true` and `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG=true` for verbose logs.

| Symptom | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Push doesn't trigger | Branch name is **case-sensitive** — verify exact match |
| Path filter blocks run | Ensure changed files match `paths:` glob |
| Scheduled workflow missed | Cron runs on default branch only; disabled after 60 days inactivity |
| Reusable workflow fails | Use `secrets: inherit` or pass each secret explicitly |
| Cache miss | Verify `path` matches cache location; commit lock file |
| Artifact not found | `download-artifact` job must `needs:` the uploading job |
| Permission denied | Add specific permission to `permissions:` block |

```bash
actionlint .github/workflows/*.yml   # local syntax validation
```

---

## Best Practices Summary

### ✅ DO

- Pin actions to commit SHAs (or at minimum major version tags)
- Declare explicit `permissions` on every workflow
- Set `timeout-minutes` on every job
- Use `concurrency` with `cancel-in-progress` to avoid queued duplication
- Cache dependencies (prefer built-in `cache` option on setup actions)
- Use matrix builds for cross-platform / multi-version testing
- Extract shared logic into reusable workflows or composite actions
- Protect `.github/workflows/` via CODEOWNERS
- Test workflow changes in feature branches before merging to main
- Use environment-scoped secrets with approval gates for production

### ❌ DON'T

- Hardcode secrets or credentials anywhere in workflow files
- Use `pull_request_target` without label gating and SHA checkout
- Grant `write-all` permissions
- Skip security scanning (`npm audit`, `trivy`, `CodeQL`)
- Ignore workflow failures — treat CI red as a blocking defect
- Use mutable branch refs (`@main`) for third-party actions
- Commit build artifacts to the repository
- Mix application logic with workflow orchestration logic
