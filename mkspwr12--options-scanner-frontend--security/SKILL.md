description: Implement production security practices covering OWASP Top 10, input validation, injection prevention, and secrets management. Use when hardening applications against vulnerabilities, implementing authentication/authorization, managing secrets, configuring HTTPS/TLS, or conducting security audits. Use when this capability is needed.

# Security

> **Purpose**: Language-agnostic security practices to protect against common vulnerabilities.  
> **Focus**: Input validation, injection prevention, authentication, secrets management.  
> **Note**: For language-specific implementations, see [C# Development](../../development/csharp/SKILL.md) or [Python Development](../../development/python/SKILL.md).

## When to Use This Skill

- Hardening applications against OWASP Top 10
- Implementing authentication and authorization
- Managing secrets and credentials securely
- Configuring HTTPS/TLS
- Conducting security audits

## Prerequisites

- OWASP Top 10 awareness
- Understanding of HTTP security headers

## Decision Tree

```
Security concern?
├─ User input? → VALIDATE + SANITIZE (see Input Validation)
│   ├─ Goes into SQL? → Parameterized queries ONLY
│   ├─ Goes into HTML? → Encode output (XSS prevention)
│   └─ Goes into shell? → Avoid; use SDK/API instead
├─ Authentication?
│   ├─ New system? → Use established provider (OAuth2/OIDC)
│   └─ Existing? → Verify token validation, session management
├─ Secrets/credentials?
│   ├─ In code? → REMOVE → use env vars or vault
│   └─ In config? → Move to secrets manager
│       └─ Run: scripts/scan-secrets.ps1 to verify
├─ Dependencies?
│   └─ Run: scripts/scan-security.ps1 → update vulnerable packages
└─ Deployment?
    └─ HTTPS only, security headers, CORS configured
```

## OWASP Top 10 (2025)

1. **Broken Access Control** - Authorization failures, privilege escalation
2. **Cryptographic Failures** - Weak encryption, exposed secrets
3. **Injection** - SQL, NoSQL, command, LDAP injection
4. **Insecure Design** - Missing security controls in architecture
5. **Security Misconfiguration** - Default configs, unnecessary features enabled
6. **Vulnerable Components** - Outdated dependencies with known CVEs
7. **Authentication Failures** - Weak passwords, broken session management
8. **Software/Data Integrity** - Unsigned updates, insecure CI/CD
9. **Logging/Monitoring Failures** - Missing audit logs, delayed detection
10. **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)** - Unvalidated URLs, internal network access

## Security Checklist

**Before Production:**
- [ ] All user input validated and sanitized
- [ ] SQL queries use parameterized statements
- [ ] Passwords hashed with bcrypt/Argon2
- [ ] Secrets in environment variables or vault
- [ ] HTTPS enforced with HSTS
- [ ] Security headers configured
- [ ] Authentication and authorization implemented
- [ ] Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- [ ] CORS configured restrictively
- [ ] Dependencies scanned for vulnerabilities
- [ ] Sensitive data encrypted at rest
- [ ] Security audit logs enabled
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive info
- [ ] File uploads validated and scanned
- [ ] API endpoints have input size limits

## Scripts

| Script | Purpose | Usage |
|--------|---------|-------|
| [`scan-secrets.ps1`](scripts/scan-secrets.ps1) | Scan repo for hardcoded secrets, API keys, credentials | `./scripts/scan-secrets.ps1 [-Path ./src]` |
| [`scan-secrets.sh`](scripts/scan-secrets.sh) | Cross-platform secrets scanner (bash) | `./scripts/scan-secrets.sh --path ./src` |
| [`scan-security.ps1`](scripts/scan-security.ps1) | Scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities | `./scripts/scan-security.ps1 [-FailOn critical]` |

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| SQL injection detected | Use parameterized queries, never concatenate user input into SQL |
| JWT token expired errors | Implement token refresh flow, check clock skew between services |
| Secrets exposed in logs | Use structured logging with secret redaction, never log request bodies with credentials |
