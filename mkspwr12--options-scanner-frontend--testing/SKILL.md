description: Apply testing strategies including test pyramid, unit/integration/e2e testing, and coverage requirements. Use when writing unit tests, designing integration test suites, implementing end-to-end tests, measuring test coverage, or setting up continuous testing pipelines. Use when this capability is needed.

# Testing

> **Purpose**: Language-agnostic testing strategies ensuring code quality and reliability.  
> **Goal**: 80%+ coverage with 70% unit, 20% integration, 10% e2e tests.  
> **Note**: For language-specific examples, see [C# Development](../csharp/SKILL.md) or [Python Development](../python/SKILL.md).

## When to Use This Skill

- Writing unit tests for new code
- Designing integration test suites
- Implementing end-to-end test automation
- Measuring and improving test coverage
- Setting up continuous testing in CI/CD pipelines

## Prerequisites

- Testing framework installed (pytest, Jest, xUnit, etc.)
- CI/CD pipeline for automated test execution

## Decision Tree

```
Writing or reviewing tests?
├─ New feature/story?
│   ├─ Has acceptance criteria? → Write e2e test first, then unit tests
│   └─ No criteria? → Write unit tests for public API surface
├─ Bug fix?
│   └─ Write regression test FIRST (red), then fix (green)
├─ Refactoring?
│   └─ Ensure existing tests pass → refactor → verify green
├─ What type of test?
│   ├─ Pure logic, no I/O? → Unit test (70% of total)
│   ├─ Database/API/file I/O? → Integration test (20%)
│   └─ Full user workflow? → E2E test (10%)
└─ Coverage below 80%?
    └─ Run: scripts/check-coverage.ps1 → add tests for uncovered paths
```

## Test Pyramid

```
        /\
       /E2E\      10% - Few (expensive, slow, brittle)
      /------\
     / Intg   \   20% - More (moderate cost/speed)
    /----------\
   /   Unit     \ 70% - Many (cheap, fast, reliable)
  /--------------\
```

**Why**: Unit tests catch bugs early, run fast, provide precise feedback. E2E tests validate workflows but are slow and flaky.

## Test Coverage

### Coverage Metrics

```
Coverage Types:
  - Line Coverage: % of code lines executed
  - Branch Coverage: % of if/else branches taken
  - Function Coverage: % of functions called
  - Statement Coverage: % of statements executed

Target: 80%+ overall coverage
```

**Coverage Tools by Language:**
- **.NET**: Coverlet, dotCover
- **Python**: coverage.py, pytest-cov
- **Node.js**: Istanbul (nyc), Jest
- **Java**: JaCoCo, Cobertura
- **PHP**: PHPUnit --coverage

### What to Test

**✅ Always Test:**
- Business logic and algorithms
- Data transformations
- Validation rules
- Error handling paths
- Edge cases and boundary conditions
- Security-critical code

**❌ Don't Test:**
- Third-party library internals
- Framework code
- Simple getters/setters (unless logic involved)
- Configuration files
- Auto-generated code

## Testing Best Practices

### Write Testable Code

**Testable Code Characteristics:**
```
✅ Single Responsibility Principle
✅ Dependency Injection
✅ Pure Functions (no side effects)
✅ Small, focused methods
✅ Minimal global state
✅ Clear interfaces

❌ Tightly coupled code
❌ Hidden dependencies
❌ God classes
❌ Hard-coded dependencies
❌ Static methods everywhere
```

### Test Fixtures

**Setup and Teardown:**
```
class UserServiceTests:
  # Run once before all tests
  beforeAll():
    testDatabase.connect()
  
  # Run before each test
  beforeEach():
    testDatabase.clear()
    seedTestData()
  
  # Run after each test
  afterEach():
    testDatabase.clear()
  
  # Run once after all tests
  afterAll():
    testDatabase.disconnect()
  
  test "getUser returns correct user":
    # Test uses clean database state
    user = service.getUser(1)
    assert user.name == "Test User"
```

### Parameterized Tests

**Data-Driven Testing:**
```
testCases = [
  {input: 0, expected: 0},
  {input: 1, expected: 1},
  {input: -1, expected: -1},
  {input: 100, expected: 100}
]

for each testCase in testCases:
  test "abs({testCase.input}) returns {testCase.expected}":
    result = abs(testCase.input)
    assert result == testCase.expected
```

## Testing Frameworks

**Unit Testing:**
- **.NET**: xUnit, NUnit, MSTest
- **Python**: pytest, unittest
- **Node.js**: Jest, Mocha, Vitest
- **Java**: JUnit, TestNG
- **PHP**: PHPUnit

**Integration Testing:**
- **API Testing**: REST Assured, Supertest, Postman/Newman
- **Database Testing**: Testcontainers, DbUnit

**E2E Testing:**
- **Browser**: Playwright, Cypress, Selenium, Puppeteer
- **Mobile**: Appium, Detox

## Scripts

| Script | Purpose | Usage |
|--------|---------|-------|
| [`check-coverage.ps1`](scripts/check-coverage.ps1) | Check test coverage against threshold (80% default) | `./scripts/check-coverage.ps1 [-Threshold 90]` |
| [`check-coverage.sh`](scripts/check-coverage.sh) | Cross-platform coverage checker (bash) | `./scripts/check-coverage.sh --threshold 80` |
| [`check-test-pyramid.ps1`](scripts/check-test-pyramid.ps1) | Verify test distribution matches pyramid ratios | `./scripts/check-test-pyramid.ps1` |
| [`scaffold-playwright.py`](scripts/scaffold-playwright.py) | Generate Playwright e2e test scaffold (TS or Python) | `python scripts/scaffold-playwright.py --lang typescript --url http://localhost:3000` |

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Flaky tests in CI | Remove timing dependencies, use deterministic test data, add retries for known flaky tests |
| Low coverage despite many tests | Focus on branch coverage not just line coverage, test edge cases |
| Integration tests too slow | Use test containers, parallelize test suites, mock external services |
