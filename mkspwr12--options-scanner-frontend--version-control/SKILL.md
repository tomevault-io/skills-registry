# Version Control

> **Purpose**: Effective use of Git for collaboration and code management.

---

## When to Use This Skill

- Writing Git commit messages following conventions
- Choosing a branching strategy
- Configuring Git hooks for quality gates
- Resolving merge conflicts
- Implementing semantic versioning with Git tags

## Prerequisites

- Git 2.30+ installed
- Text editor configured for Git

## Decision Tree

```
Git operation?
├─ Starting new work?
│   ├─ Feature → branch from main: feature/issue-123-description
│   ├─ Bug fix → branch from main: fix/issue-456-description
│   └─ Hotfix → branch from release: hotfix/critical-issue
├─ Committing?
│   ├─ Small, atomic changes (one logical change per commit)
│   └─ Format: type(scope): description (#issue)
├─ Merging?
│   ├─ Feature branch → squash merge to main
│   ├─ Release branch → merge commit (preserve history)
│   └─ Conflict? → Rebase feature on main, resolve, re-push
└─ Undoing?
    ├─ Uncommitted changes? → git stash or git checkout
    ├─ Last commit (not pushed)? → git reset --soft HEAD~1
    └─ Pushed commit? → git revert (never force-push shared branches)
```

## Commit Messages

```bash
# Format
type(scope): Brief description (50 chars max)

Detailed explanation (wrap at 72 characters)

Types:
- feat: New feature
- fix: Bug fix
- docs: Documentation
- style: Formatting
- refactor: Code restructuring
- test: Adding tests
- chore: Maintenance
- perf: Performance improvement
- ci: CI/CD changes
- build: Build system changes

# Examples
feat(auth): Add password reset functionality

Implements password reset via email with time-limited tokens.
Tokens expire after 1 hour.

Fixes #234

---

fix(api): Correct null reference in UserService

Added null check before accessing user properties in
GetUserProfileAsync method.

Resolves #456
```

---

## Git Workflow

```bash
# Feature branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/user-auth

# Make changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat(auth): Add login endpoint"

# Push and create PR
git push origin feature/user-auth

# After PR review, rebase if needed
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main

# Squash commits before merging (optional)
git rebase -i HEAD~3

# Force push after rebase
git push origin feature/user-auth --force-with-lease
```

---

## Branching Strategy

### GitFlow

```bash
# Main branches
- main/master: Production-ready code
- develop: Integration branch

# Supporting branches
- feature/*: New features
- bugfix/*: Bug fixes
- hotfix/*: Emergency production fixes
- release/*: Release preparation

# Example workflow
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/add-payment

# ... make changes ...
git push origin feature/add-payment
# Create PR to develop

# Release
git checkout -b release/v1.2.0 develop
# ... version bump, final testing ...
git checkout main
git merge release/v1.2.0
git tag -a v1.2.0 -m "Release version 1.2.0"
git push origin main --tags
```

---


## Scripts

| Script | Purpose | Usage |
|--------|---------|-------|
| [`setup-hooks.ps1`](scripts/setup-hooks.ps1) | Install Git hooks (pre-commit, commit-msg) for quality enforcement | `./scripts/setup-hooks.ps1 [-Mode native]` |

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Merge conflict in binary files | Use Git LFS for binaries, prefer text-based formats where possible |
| Git hook not running | Check executable permissions (chmod +x), verify .git/hooks/ path |
| Detached HEAD state | Create a branch from current state: git checkout -b recovery-branch |
