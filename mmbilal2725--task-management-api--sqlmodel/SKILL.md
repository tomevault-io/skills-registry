# SQLModel for FastAPI

Comprehensive skill for building database-driven FastAPI applications with SQLModel, PostgreSQL, and SQLAlchemy.

## Quick Start

### Basic Setup

```python
# Install dependencies
pip install sqlmodel psycopg2-binary alembic pytest

# Create database models
from sqlmodel import SQLModel, Field, create_engine
from typing import Optional

class User(SQLModel, table=True):
    id: Optional[int] = Field(default=None, primary_key=True)
    username: str = Field(unique=True, index=True)
    email: str = Field(unique=True, index=True)

# Create engine and tables
engine = create_engine("postgresql://user:pass@localhost/db")
SQLModel.metadata.create_all(engine)

# Use in FastAPI
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends
from sqlmodel import Session

app = FastAPI()

def get_session():
    with Session(engine) as session:
        yield session

@app.post("/users")
def create_user(user: User, session: Session = Depends(get_session)):
    session.add(user)
    session.commit()
    session.refresh(user)
    return user
```

## Common Workflows

### Creating a New Model

1. Define the model in your models file
2. Add relationships if needed
3. Create request/response schemas
4. Generate migration: `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add model"`
5. Review and apply migration: `alembic upgrade head`
6. Implement CRUD functions
7. Create API endpoints
8. Write tests

### Setting Up Database

1. Install dependencies: `pip install sqlmodel psycopg2-binary alembic`
2. Create database configuration in `database.py`
3. Define models in `models.py`
4. Initialize Alembic: `alembic init alembic`
5. Configure Alembic for SQLModel (see [migrations.md](references/migrations.md))
6. Create initial migration
7. Set up dependency injection for sessions

### Optimizing Performance

1. Add indexes on frequently queried columns (see [models.md](references/models.md))
2. Use eager loading for relationships (see [relationships.md](references/relationships.md))
3. Configure connection pooling (see [sessions.md](references/sessions.md))
4. Implement pagination (see [queries.md](references/queries.md))
5. Use bulk operations for multiple inserts/updates (see [crud.md](references/crud.md))
6. Add query caching if needed (see [performance.md](references/performance.md))

### Adding Relationships

1. Define foreign key in child model
2. Add `Relationship` field in both models
3. Use `back_populates` to link them
4. For many-to-many, create link table
5. Configure cascade behavior if needed (see [relationships.md](references/relationships.md))
6. Update migrations
7. Test relationship loading

## Best Practices Summary

### Model Design
- Use `Optional[int]` with `default=None` for auto-increment primary keys
- Add indexes to foreign keys and frequently queried fields
- Use enums for status/category fields
- Separate table models from request/response models
- Use mixins for common fields (created_at, updated_at)

### Session Management
- Always use dependency injection in FastAPI endpoints
- Use context managers (`with Session()`) for manual sessions
- Configure connection pooling for production
- Set `pool_pre_ping=True` to handle stale connections

### Queries
- Use eager loading to avoid N+1 queries
- Add appropriate indexes before querying large datasets
- Use cursor-based pagination for large result sets
- Use `select()` for all queries instead of legacy query API

### Migrations
- Always review auto-generated migrations before applying
- Test migrations locally before production
- Make migrations reversible (implement both upgrade and downgrade)
- Use separate migrations for schema and data changes

### Testing
- Use SQLite in-memory database for tests
- Use fixtures for test data
- Override FastAPI dependencies in tests
- Test both success and failure cases

### Performance
- Index foreign keys and frequently queried columns
- Use bulk operations for multiple inserts/updates
- Configure appropriate pool sizes based on load
- Monitor slow queries and optimize them

### Security
- Never use string formatting for queries (use parameterized queries)
- Hash passwords with bcrypt or similar
- Validate all user input with Pydantic
- Use environment variables for database credentials
- Handle database errors gracefully without exposing internals

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Import errors with SQLModel models:**
- Ensure all models are imported in `alembic/env.py`
- Import models before calling `SQLModel.metadata.create_all()`

**N+1 query problems:**
- Use `selectinload()` or `joinedload()` for relationships
- Check query logs with `echo=True` on engine

**Connection pool exhausted:**
- Increase `pool_size` and `max_overflow`
- Ensure sessions are properly closed (use context managers)
- Check for long-running transactions

**Migration conflicts:**
- Use `alembic heads` to check for multiple heads
- Merge branches with `alembic merge`
- Resolve conflicts manually in migration files

**Slow queries:**
- Add indexes on queried columns
- Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to check query plan
- Consider using read replicas for read-heavy workloads
