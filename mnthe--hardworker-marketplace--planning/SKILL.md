# Planning Protocol

## Overview

Define how to analyze context, make design decisions, and decompose work into tasks.

**Two modes:**
- **Interactive**: Orchestrator conducts Deep Interview for decisions
- **Auto**: Planner agent makes decisions based on context alone (--auto or --skip-interview)

---

## Phase 1: Read Context

Read session files in order:
1. `session.json` - goal and metadata
2. `context.json` - summary, key files, patterns from explorers
3. `exploration/*.md` - detailed findings as needed

---

## Phase 2: Complexity Analysis

Analyze goal and context to determine interview depth:

| Complexity | Files | Keywords | Impact | Rounds |
|------------|-------|----------|--------|--------|
| trivial | 1-2 | fix, typo, add | None | 1 (4-5 Q) |
| standard | 3-5 | implement, create | Single module | 2 (8-10 Q) |
| complex | 6-10 | refactor, redesign | Multi-module | 3 (12-15 Q) |
| massive | 10+ | migrate, rewrite | Entire system | 4 (16-20 Q) |

**Note**: User can request more rounds via adaptive check. No upper limit.

---

## Phase 3: Deep Interview (Interactive Mode)

**Skip if**: `--auto` or `--skip-interview` flag set

### Interview Structure

Each round asks 4-5 questions using AskUserQuestion (max 4 questions per call).

### Context-Aware Options (CRITICAL)

**Options marked `[...]` MUST be generated from exploration context, NOT generic templates.**

See `references/context-aware-options.md` for:
- Generation process from context.json and exploration/*.md
- Option generation rules by question type
- Context-aware vs generic examples
- Validation checklist

### Data-Driven Interview Questions

Interview questions must be generated from exploration data, not generic templates.

#### Question Generation Rules

**BAD (generic):** "어떤 아키텍처 패턴을 사용할까요?"
**GOOD (data-driven):** "graph/service.go가 2곳에서 사용됩니다. 두 곳 모두 동시에 변경할까요?"

**Formula:** [탐색에서 발견한 사실] + [그로 인한 설계 선택지] + [각 선택지의 trade-off]

#### Interview Question → Design Section Mapping

| Question Category | Design Section |
|---|---|
| "어떤 접근법?" | Approach Selection, Decisions |
| "영향 범위는?" | Impact Analysis |
| "성공 기준은?" | Verification Strategy |
| "위험 요소는?" | Assumptions & Risks |
| "테스트 방법은?" | Verification Strategy |

### Interview Rounds

Rounds are adjusted based on complexity assessment:

| Complexity | Rounds | Focus Areas |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| trivial | 1 | Intent, Scope, Success criteria |
| standard | 2 | + Technical decisions (arch, tech stack, testing) |
| complex | 3 | + Edge cases, errors, concurrency, performance |
| massive | 4 | + UI/UX, observability, documentation, deployment |

**Note**: User can request additional rounds via adaptive check. No upper limit.

See `references/interview-rounds.md` for:
- Detailed question templates for each round
- Domain-specific question templates
- Adaptive check pattern
- Decision recording format

---

## Phase 4: Document Design

**IMPORTANT: Design documents go to PROJECT directory.**

```bash
WORKING_DIR=$(bun $SCRIPTS/session-get.js --session ${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID} --field working_dir)
DESIGN_PATH="$WORKING_DIR/docs/plans/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)-{goal-slug}-design.md"
```

Write comprehensive design.md including:
- Overview and approach selection
- **Interview decisions with rationale** (from Phase 3)
- Architecture and components
- Error handling strategy
- Testing strategy
- Scope (in/out)

See `references/design-template.md` for complete template.

### Self-Containedness Check

After writing the design document, the planner performs a self-containedness check:

- [ ] Context Orientation만 읽고 이 프로젝트가 뭔지 알 수 있는가?
- [ ] 모든 Criterion에 실행 명령과 기대 출력이 있는가?
- [ ] Impact Analysis의 모든 소비자에 대한 처리 방안이 있는가?
- [ ] 문서에 없는 결정을 worker가 내려야 하는 상황이 있는가?
- [ ] "기능 동일", "정상 동작" 같은 주관적 표현이 없는가?

If any check fails, fix the design document before proceeding to Codex doc-review.

---

## Phase 4.5: Codex Doc-Review

After writing the design document, validate it via Codex doc-review.

```bash
bun $SCRIPTS/codex-verify.js \
  --mode doc-review \
  --design "$DESIGN_PATH" \
  --goal "${GOAL}" \
  --output /tmp/codex-doc-${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}.json
```

**Result Handling:**

| Verdict | Action |
|---------|--------|
| PASS | Continue to Phase 5 (Task Decomposition) |
| SKIP | Codex not installed — continue (graceful degradation) |
| FAIL (converging) | Fix issues and retry |
| FAIL (max retries) | Auto-pass via `codex-autopass.js` |

### Retry Budget

| Mode | Max Retries |
|------|-------------|
| Interactive (default) | 5 |
| Auto (`--auto`) | 3 |

### Convergence Detection

Track error counts across attempts to detect trends:

- **Converging**: Error count decreasing across attempts (fixes are working)
- **Oscillating**: Error count fluctuating up and down (fixes introduce new issues)
- **Diverging**: Error count increasing across attempts (fixes make things worse)

On each FAIL, record the error count from `doc_issues`. Compare with previous attempts:

```
Attempt 1: 5 errors
Attempt 2: 3 errors  → converging (continue)
Attempt 3: 4 errors  → oscillating (warn, continue)
Attempt 4: 2 errors  → converging (continue)
Attempt 5: 2 errors  → stalled (max retries reached → auto-pass)
```

### Interactive Mode (default)

1. Show `doc_issues` to user via AskUserQuestion
2. User confirms fix direction
3. Edit design document
4. Re-run doc-review
5. Track convergence: compare error count with previous attempt
6. Repeat until PASS, user skips, or max retries (5) reached
7. On max retries → execute auto-pass protocol

### Auto Mode (--auto)

1. Read `doc_issues` from result
2. Auto-fix design document
3. Re-run doc-review
4. Track convergence: compare error count with previous attempt
5. Repeat until PASS or max retries (3) reached
6. On max retries → execute auto-pass protocol

### Auto-Pass Protocol

When max retries reached without achieving PASS:

1. Run `codex-autopass.js --session ${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}`
2. Script creates a PASS result file at `/tmp/codex-doc-${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}.json`
3. Append a "Known Doc-Review Issues (Auto-Passed)" section to the design document listing unresolved issues
4. Proceed to Phase 5 (Task Decomposition)

The auto-pass section in the design document serves as a record that doc-review did not fully pass, allowing workers and verifier to be aware of known gaps.

**CLI Error:** Retry once on execution failure. On repeated failure, report to user.

**Note:** A PreToolUse gate blocks `session-update.js --phase EXECUTION` without a passing Codex doc-review result at `/tmp/codex-doc-${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}.json`.

---

## Phase 5: Decompose Tasks

### Write Execution Strategy (Post-Review)

After doc-review passes, add the Execution Strategy section to the design document.
This section was intentionally excluded from the initial design to allow doc-review to validate the pure design first.

See `references/design-template.md` for the Execution Strategy (Post-Review) template.

### Task Guidelines

| Aspect | Rule |
|--------|------|
| **Granularity** | One deliverable, ~30 min work, testable |
| **Complexity** | `standard` (sonnet) for CRUD/simple; `complex` (opus) for architecture/security |
| **Dependencies** | Independent `[]`, Sequential `["1"]`, Multi `["1","2"]`, Verify `[all]` |

### Create Tasks with Scripts

Use `task-create.js` for each task. Always include a final verify task.

See `references/task-examples.md` for:
- Complete script command examples
- Task decomposition patterns by feature type
- Dependency graph examples

---

## Flag Reference

| Flag | Effect on Interview |
|------|---------------------|
| (default) | Full Deep Interview based on complexity |
| `--skip-interview` | Skip interview, use ad-hoc AskUserQuestion as needed |
