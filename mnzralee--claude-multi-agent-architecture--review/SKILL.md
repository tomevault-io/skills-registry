# Code Review Skill

Review code following quality and security standards.

---

## Review Process

1. **Understand the change** - Read the PR description and commits
2. **Check for issues** - Security, bugs, performance, maintainability
3. **Verify patterns** - Ensure code follows project conventions
4. **Test coverage** - Check if tests cover the changes
5. **Provide feedback** - Clear, actionable comments

- [ ] Authorization checks (role-based access)
- [ ] No sensitive data in logs

## Common Issues to Flag

### Security
```typescript
// BAD: SQL injection risk
const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = '${userId}'`;

// GOOD: Parameterized query
const user = await db.user.findUnique({ where: { id: userId } });
```

### Error Handling
```typescript
// BAD: Swallowing errors
try {
  await doSomething();
} catch (e) {
  // Silent fail
}

// GOOD: Handle or propagate
try {
  await doSomething();
} catch (error) {
  logger.error({ error }, 'Failed to do something');
  throw error;
}
```

### Type Safety
```typescript
// BAD: any type
const data: any = response.data;

// GOOD: Proper typing
interface UserResponse {
  id: string;
  name: string;
}
const data: UserResponse = response.data;
```
