# Work Recording Skill

Transform development sessions into compelling engineering stories that capture not just what happened, but why it mattered and what was learned.

---

## Location: write to YOUR OWN journal

Each developer has their own append-only journal directory. Write to the authoring developer's namespace, never to another developer's.

```
you write to: docs/workrecords/work-record-YYYY-MM-DD.md
```

[CUSTOMIZE: adjust the path to match your project's docs layout. A common convention is `docs/<your-name>/workrecords/work-record-YYYY-MM-DD.md` for multi-developer projects.]

The path is determined by WHO is writing, not by which feature, service, or repo the work touched. The storytelling voice below requires first-person "I"; two developers cannot share an "I", so they cannot share a journal file. Cross-developer coordination lives at the spec, roadmap, and ADR layer, not by mingling daily journals.

See `.claude/rules/work-records.md` for the full per-developer-path rule, if your project uses one.

---

## Philosophy: The Engineering Story

**Work records are not logs. They are stories.**

Every session is a journey with:
- A **beginning** (context, challenge)
- A **middle** (investigation, discovery, implementation)
- An **end** (resolution, lessons learned)

The best work records read like a senior engineer explaining their day to a colleague over coffee: technical, insightful, and memorable.

---

## The Journal Principle: Write It Like Lecture Notes

Work records serve a dual purpose: they are both a professional engineering journal and lecture notes for the developer's future self. When writing, imagine revisiting this record months later to understand what happened, why, and what was learned.

### What to Capture

**Brainstorming and critical-thinking moments.** When multiple approaches are considered, document the reasoning chain: what options surfaced, what tradeoffs were weighed, and why one path was chosen over others. The rejected alternatives matter as much as the chosen one because they encode the constraints that shaped the decision.

**Decision-making rationale.** Every major decision should have its reasoning chain written out. Not "we chose X" but "we chose X because Y constraint and Z evidence, after ruling out A (too slow) and B (security risk)." A future reader should be able to reconstruct the logic without guessing.

**"What surprised us" moments.** Unexpected discoveries, architectural revelations, bugs that taught something about the system. These are often the most valuable parts of a work record because they reveal things that are not obvious from reading the code alone.

**Alternatives considered and rejected.** This is the context that evaporates fastest. Six months later, no one remembers why the team did not use the simpler approach unless it was written down.

### When to Write

**Continuously during the session, not just at end of day.** After each major milestone, decision, or discovery, append to the work record immediately. Context decays with every passing hour. The richest narrative comes from writing while the reasoning is still fresh.

**Mid-iteration sibling records are mandatory, not batched at iteration or session close.** In an orchestrated multi-agent loop, append a sibling work-record at each major milestone WITHIN the iteration, before the context is cleared. Batching at iteration close defeats the purpose: the `/clear` that ends an iteration discards the in-context narrative, so a single end-of-iteration dump flattens several distinct decisions into one lossy paragraph and silently drops the reasoning chain each milestone produced. Dispatch the work-recorder sibling (or append directly) on each trigger below, in-iteration, not at the boundary.

Practical triggers for mid-session updates (each one fires a sibling append, in-iteration):
- A research phase completes and changes your understanding
- A design decision is made after weighing alternatives
- An unexpected bug or constraint is discovered
- An agent or track completes a major work package
- The user provides feedback that shifts approach

### Voice and Style

Write in first-person singular ("I") as if the developer is writing their own journal. Use prose paragraphs for reasoning and context. Use tables and lists for structured data (commits, file counts, status). The narrative should flow like a story with clear cause-and-effect chains, not like a changelog. Never use "we" or third-person. The developer is the author.

## End-of-Day Deliverable Summary Table (MANDATORY)

Every work record MUST end with this table. It is the single source of truth for what was delivered. Calculate durations from git commit timestamps (first and last commit per deliverable). Mark review boards and planning phases with * since they have no dedicated commits.

**How to calculate:** Run `git log --format="%ai | %s" --since="YYYY-MM-DD"` to get commit timestamps. Group commits by deliverable. Duration = last commit time minus first commit time for that group. For items with no commits (review boards, planning), estimate from the gap between the previous and next deliverable's commits.

**Time zone:** [CUSTOMIZE: replace with your local time zone, e.g. UTC, EST, IST, etc.]

```markdown
---

## End-of-Day Deliverable Summary

**Wall clock: HH:MM - HH:MM [TZ] (Xh XXm)**

| # | Deliverable | Duration | Commits | Key Numbers |
|---|-------------|----------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | [Deliverable name] | Xh XXm | N | [Quantified output] |
| 2 | [Deliverable name] | Xh XXm | N | [Quantified output] |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| | **TOTAL** | **Xh XXm** | **N** | **[Summary stats]** |

*Estimated from inter-commit gaps (no dedicated commits for review boards/planning).
```

**Rules for this table:**
- One row per distinct deliverable (not per commit)
- Duration is commit-span time, not estimated effort
- Key Numbers column must have quantified metrics (file counts, instance counts, agent counts)
- Review boards get their own row (they are significant work even without commits)
- Planning and architecture work gets its own row if it spans 30 or more minutes
- The TOTAL row sums commits and shows wall clock duration
- Never fabricate hours. If you cannot determine duration from commits, mark with *

---

## Daily Summary Template

At end of day, compile the deliverable summary table above, plus:

```markdown
### The Day in Brief

[1-2 paragraph narrative of what was accomplished]

---

### Challenges Overcome

| Challenge | Solution | Learning |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| [Challenge] | [Solution] | [Learning] |

---

### Tomorrow's Focus

1. [Priority 1]
2. [Priority 2]
3. [Priority 3]

---

### Day's Key Insight

[The one thing worth remembering from today's work]
```

---

## Command Reference

## Integration with Other Skills

| Skill | Integration |
|-------|-------------|
| `/commit` | Log commits with context |
| `/debug` | Capture investigation narrative |
| `/review` | Document review findings |
| `/multi-agent-orchestration` | Track agent coordination |

---

## Remember

**The goal is not to write documentation. The goal is to tell the story of engineering.**

A reader should finish a session record and:
1. Understand what problem we faced
2. Follow our journey to the solution
3. Learn something they can apply elsewhere
4. Know what happened and WHY
