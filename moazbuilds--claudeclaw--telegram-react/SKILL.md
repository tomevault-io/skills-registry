# Telegram Reaction Directive

When replying for Telegram, you can include a reaction directive anywhere in the output:

- Syntax: `[react:<emoji>]`
- Example: `Nice work [react:🔥]`

Runtime behavior:

- The bot removes all `[react:...]` tags from the outgoing text.
- It applies the first valid directive as a Telegram reaction to the user's message.
- The remaining text is sent normally.
