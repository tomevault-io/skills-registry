## MobAI Usage Rules (IMPORTANT)

When automating mobile devices, ALWAYS use this order:

1. **mobai:native-runner** - For ANY native app UI automation (tapping, typing, swiping, observing UI)
2. **mobai:web-runner** - For ANY web browser or WebView automation
3. **mobai:agent** - For complex multi-step tasks requiring AI reasoning
4. **Raw HTTP API** - ONLY for: listing devices, starting/stopping bridge

**ALWAYS try DSL subagents first.** Raw HTTP API for tap/type/swipe/screenshot/ui-tree is a LAST RESORT.

**Screenshots:** When using the API, screenshots are automatically saved to `/tmp/mobai/screenshots/` and the path is returned. Use the Read tool to view them.

# MobAI Device Control

This skill enables you to control Android and iOS devices through the MobAI HTTP API running locally.

## Sub-Agent Architecture

For complex automation tasks, use a **hierarchical approach** with specialized sub-agents:

### When to Use Sub-Agents

| Scenario | Approach |
|----------|----------|
| Simple query (list devices, take screenshot) | Direct API call |
| Native app automation (Settings, Instagram) | Spawn **native-runner** sub-agent |
| Browser chrome (URL bar, tabs, nav buttons) | Spawn **native-runner** sub-agent |
| Web page DOM content (CSS selectors, JS, DOM) | Spawn **web-runner** sub-agent (try native-runner first) |
| Complex multi-step task | Break into subgoals, spawn appropriate sub-agent for each |

### Native Runner (`/native-runner`)

Use for **native mobile apps** - apps that use platform UI components:
- Settings app, Mail, Photos, Calendar
- Third-party apps (Instagram, WhatsApp, Uber)
- Any app where you need to tap UI elements by accessibility predicates

**Uses DSL batch execution** with element predicates for robust automation.

**How to spawn:**
```
Use the native-runner skill to accomplish: [subgoal description]
Device ID: [deviceId]
```

### Web Runner (`/web-runner`)

Use web-runner when you need to interact with DOM content inside a web page or WebView:
- Native-runner failed with NO_MATCH on web page elements
- You need CSS selectors to target specific HTML elements
- You need to execute JavaScript on the page
- You need to read/manipulate DOM content programmatically

**IMPORTANT: iOS Simulators NOT supported** - Web context requires a physical iOS device. Use native-runner for simulators.

**Try native-runner first** - it works for most web page interactions via accessibility tree.

**DO NOT use for browser UI elements** (address bar, tabs, back button) - those are native!

**Uses DSL batch execution** with CSS selectors and JavaScript.

**How to spawn:**
```
Use the web-runner skill to accomplish: [subgoal description]
Device ID: [deviceId]
```

### Example: Complex Task Decomposition

User request: "Log into Twitter, search for 'AI news', and screenshot the results"

**Step 1:** List devices to get device ID (direct API call)
**Step 2:** Launch Twitter app (direct API call)
**Step 3:** Spawn native-runner: "Tap the search tab and enter 'AI news'"
**Step 4:** Wait for results (determine if it's native or web)
**Step 5:** If web results: spawn web-runner: "Scroll to see results"
**Step 6:** Take screenshot (direct API call)

## How to Make API Calls

Use the `mcp__mobai-http__http_request` tool to make HTTP requests:

```json
{
  "method": "GET",
  "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8686/api/v1/devices"
}
```

For POST/PUT/PATCH requests with a body:
```json
{
  "method": "POST",
  "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8686/api/v1/devices/{id}/dsl/execute",
  "body": "{\"version\":\"0.2\",\"steps\":[{\"action\":\"observe\",\"context\":\"native\"}]}"
}
```

**Parameters:**
- `method`: HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
- `url`: Full URL to request
- `body`: Request body as JSON string (for POST/PUT/PATCH)
- `headers`: Optional additional headers
- `timeout`: Request timeout in milliseconds (default: 600000 = 10 minutes)

## API Base URL

```
http://127.0.0.1:8686/api/v1
```

No authentication is required. The API runs on localhost only.

## Response Format

**Success responses:**
```json
{"success": true, "data": {...}}
```

**Error responses:**
```json
{"error": "error message", "code": "optional_code", "details": "optional_details"}
```

## Quick Reference - Common Operations

### Device Management (Direct API)

```
GET /devices                    # List all connected devices
GET /devices/{id}               # Get specific device info
GET /devices/{id}/screenshot    # Capture screenshot (saved to file, path returned). Add ?path=~/Downloads&name=foo to save to custom location.
GET /devices/{id}/apps          # List installed apps (or use DSL observe with include: ["installed_apps"])
```

### Bridge Control (Direct API)

```
POST /devices/{id}/bridge/start # Start on-device bridge (60s timeout)
POST /devices/{id}/bridge/stop  # Stop on-device bridge
```

### DSL Batch Execution (Preferred for Automation)

```
POST /devices/{id}/dsl/execute  # Execute DSL script with retries
```

Example DSL script:
```json
{
  "version": "0.2",
  "steps": [
    {"action": "observe", "context": "native", "include": ["ui_tree"]},
    {"action": "tap", "predicate": {"text_contains": "Settings"}},
    {"action": "observe", "context": "native", "include": ["ui_tree"]}
  ],
  "on_fail": {"strategy": "retry", "max_retries": 2}
}
```

### Scrollable List Operations (Direct API)

```
POST /devices/{id}/scroll-until-visible  # Scroll to find element
POST /devices/{id}/collect-list          # Collect all list items
```

### AI Agent (Direct API)

```
POST /devices/{id}/agent/run    # {"task": "...", "agentType": "toolagent"}
```

### App Management (Direct API)

```
POST /devices/{id}/kill-app          # Force-kill app: {"bundleId": "..."}
DELETE /devices/{id}/apps/{bundleId} # Uninstall app by bundle ID
```

### Location Simulation (Direct API)

```
POST /devices/{id}/location          # Set GPS: {"lat": 40.71, "lon": -74.00}
DELETE /devices/{id}/location        # Reset to real GPS
```

### Performance Metrics (Via DSL)

Use `metrics_start` and `metrics_stop` DSL actions for performance testing:

```json
{
  "version": "0.2",
  "steps": [
    {"action": "metrics_start", "types": ["system_cpu", "system_memory", "fps", "network", "battery"], "capture_logs": true, "label": "test"},
    {"action": "open_app", "bundle_id": "com.example.app"},
    {"action": "delay", "duration_ms": 5000},
    {"action": "metrics_stop", "format": "summary"}
  ]
}
```

Returns health score, anomalies, and recommendations. Metric types: `system_cpu`, `system_memory`, `fps`, `network`, `battery`, `process`.

## Choosing Between Native and Web Mode

**CRITICAL: Browser apps (Safari, Chrome) have TWO zones:**
1. **Browser chrome (NATIVE)**: address bar, tab bar, back/forward buttons, share button, bookmarks → use **native-runner**
2. **Web content viewport (WEB)**: the actual webpage content inside the browser → use **web-runner**

**Use Native Mode (native-runner) when:**
- Working with native app UI (buttons, switches, lists)
- Interacting with browser chrome: URL bar, navigation buttons, tab switching
- Tapping by element predicate (text, type, label)
- UI tree shows native components (Button, TextField, Switch)

**Use Web Mode (web-runner) ONLY when:**
- You need to interact with the DOM content of a web page or WebView
- Filling HTML forms, clicking HTML links/buttons, or reading text from web pages
- You need CSS selectors to target elements rendered by HTML/CSS/JS
- Native taps aren't working because the content is rendered by WebKit/Blink engine

**NEVER use web-runner for:** browser chrome UI (address bar, tabs, navigation buttons) - always use native-runner for those!

**Detection Tips:**
1. Get UI tree first - if it shows web-like elements (WebView), the CONTENT is web mode
2. Browser UI elements (address bar, tabs) are ALWAYS native even when Safari/Chrome is open
3. If native tap fails on expected element inside webpage, try web mode

## Important Notes

- **Use DSL for automation** - Batch execution is more efficient than individual API calls
- **Direct API for queries** - List devices, screenshots, app lists don't need DSL
- Always ensure the bridge is running (`bridgeRunning: true`) before automation
- Sub-agents use DSL internally - they handle batch execution for you
- See `api-reference.md` for full endpoint documentation
