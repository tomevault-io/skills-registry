# Prompt Writing

Create and optimize YAML-based prompts for AI assistants following industry best practices.

## Quick Start

### Standard YAML Prompt Structure

```yaml
system_prompt: |-
  # Section with ### header
  ## Subsection with ## header
  Content with clear structure.
  
  **Bold key concepts**
  
  - Bullet points for requirements
  - Consistent indentation (2 spaces)
  
  1. Numbered lists for sequences
  2. Use when order matters

user_prompt: |
  Direct instructions with {{ variable placeholders }}
```

### Key Principles

1. **Structure**: Use `|-` for multi-line system prompts, `|` for user prompts
2. **Templating**: Use `{{ variable }}` for dynamic content
3. **Separators**: Use `---` sparingly, only between major sections
4. **Language**: Keep prompts in consistent language (English recommended for templates)

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing any prompt, verify:

- [ ] No unclosed braces `{{` without `}}`
- [ ] No excessive separators (`---`, `***`)
- [ ] Consistent heading hierarchy (`###` → `##`)
- [ ] Clear variable placeholders with descriptive names
- [ ] Proper YAML indentation preserved
- [ ] No HTML tags in Markdown content
- [ ] Lists have parallel structure

## Common Patterns

### System Prompt with Sections

```yaml
system_prompt: |-
  ### Role Definition
  You are a professional [role name]. Your task is to [core responsibility].
  
  ### Requirements
  1. First requirement
  2. Second requirement
  3. Third requirement
  
  ### Guidelines
  - Do this
  - Don't do that
  - Always do this
  
  ### Output Format
  Respond in plain text without separators.
```

### Jinja2 Template Variables

```yaml
user_prompt: |
  Please analyze the following {{ document_type }}:
  
  Name: {{ filename }}
  Content: {{ content }}
  
  Summary ({{ max_words }} words):
```
