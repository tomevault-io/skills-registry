# Monica Requirement & Design Workflow

This skill provides a structured two-phase workflow for requirement gathering and architectural design in the Monica framework.

## Overview

| Phase | Trigger | Output |
|-------|---------|--------|
| Requirements | User provides a brief requirement idea | `.pending/{NNN}-{name}/requirements.md` |
| Design | User requests design for an existing requirement | `.pending/{NNN}-{name}/design.md` |

## Phase 1: Requirements Gathering

### Initiation

When the user provides a brief requirement or idea:

1. Create the `.pending/` directory at project root if it does not exist.
2. Determine the next folder number by finding the highest existing number in `.pending/` and incrementing by one. If no folders exist, start at `001`. Format as three-digit zero-padded number (e.g., `001`, `002`, `013`).
3. Derive a brief kebab-case name from the requirement (e.g., `user-auth`, `distributed-cache`, `markdown-export`).
4. Create the subfolder: `.pending/{NNN}-{brief-name}/`
5. Create `requirements.md` using the template from `references/requirements-template.md`.
6. Populate the Overview section with the user's initial description.

### Iterative Refinement

Conduct requirement refinement through iterative questioning. Follow these principles:

**Progressive disclosure**: Ask 1-3 focused questions per iteration. Do not overwhelm the user with all questions at once. Prioritize questions by impact.

**Question categories** (use in approximate order):

1. **Scope clarification**: What is in scope vs. out of scope? What problem does this solve?
2. **User stories**: Who are the consumers of this feature? What are the primary use cases?
3. **Integration points**: Which existing Monica modules does this interact with? Does it depend on or extend existing modules?
4. **Constraints**: Performance requirements? Compatibility requirements? Technology constraints?
5. **Edge cases**: What happens when things go wrong? What are the boundary conditions?
6. **Non-goals**: What should this explicitly NOT do? What is deferred to future work?

**Industry best practices to apply**:

- Think about scalability, extensibility, and separation of concerns.
- Consider similar solutions in well-known frameworks or libraries.
- Identify potential architectural patterns (e.g., CQRS, event sourcing, mediator, repository).
- Suggest improvements or alternatives the user may not have considered.

**After each user response**:
- Update `requirements.md` with the refined information.
- Summarize what was captured.
- Ask the next round of questions (if refinement is not complete).

### Completion

Stop the requirements phase when the user signals completion with phrases such as:
- "可以了", "够了", "就这样", "完成", "OK"
- "done", "looks good", "that's it", "enough", "complete"

Upon completion:
- Perform a final update to `requirements.md` ensuring all sections are populated.
- Present a concise summary of the complete requirements.
- Inform the user they can enter the design phase later by invoking this skill with the requirement name.

## Phase 2: Architectural Design

### Initiation

When the user requests design for an existing requirement:

1. Identify the requirement folder in `.pending/` by name or number. If no matching folder is found, list available requirement folders and ask the user to clarify, or offer to start a new requirements gathering phase.
2. Read the existing `requirements.md` from that folder.
3. Analyze the current project structure:
   - Scan existing Monica modules (`Monica.*/`) to understand the module landscape.
   - Identify related modules the new feature may depend on or extend.
   - Review relevant patterns from the `mo-development` skill references.

### Analysis

Before writing the design document, perform the following analysis:

1. **Module placement**: Determine whether this requires a new module (`Monica.{Name}/`), an extension to an existing module, or a cross-cutting concern.
2. **Pattern selection**: Determine which Monica patterns apply:
   - Standard infrastructure module (Module, Option, Guide, BuilderExtensions)
   - UI module (Mixed, Standalone, or Framework pattern)
   - Hosted service (MoBackgroundService or CoordinatedLeaderService)
   - Service layer (UI with `Res<T>` or infrastructure with exceptions)
3. **Dependency mapping**: Identify which existing modules this depends on and which modules may depend on it.
4. **Interface design**: Define the public abstractions (interfaces, base classes) that consumers will use.
5. **Directory structure**: Plan the file and folder layout following Monica conventions.

### Design Document Creation

Create `design.md` in the requirement folder using the template from `references/design-template.md`. Populate all sections based on the analysis.

The design document must:
- Follow Monica module conventions (refer to `mo-development` skill for patterns).
- Use primary constructors for DI classes.
- Separate UI services (`Res<T>`) from infrastructure services (exceptions) per project policy.
- Include concrete interface definitions with XML doc comments in English.
- Specify the complete directory structure with file purposes.
- List implementation steps in dependency order.

### Design Review

After creating the design document:
- Present a summary of the architectural decisions.
- Highlight any trade-offs or alternatives considered.
- Ask the user if any adjustments are needed.
- Update `design.md` based on feedback.

## Project Context

### Monica Module Landscape

To understand the current module landscape, scan directories matching `Monica.*/` at the project root. Group them by category (Core, Infrastructure, Communication, Domain, Scheduling, UI, Specialized, Code Generation) based on their names and contents.
