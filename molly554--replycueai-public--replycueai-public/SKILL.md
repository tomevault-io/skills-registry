# YouTube Comment Analyzer

Analyze YouTube video comments for brand relevance using a 5-layer AI scoring model. Identifies purchase intent, product questions, brand risks, competitor mentions, and sentiment — all scoped to YOUR brand context.

## When to Use

- When the user wants to analyze YouTube comments for brand relevance
- When the user wants to understand comment sentiment and business categories on a video
- When the user asks about KOL/influencer video comment quality
- When the user wants to find high-priority comments (purchase intent, brand risks)
- Trigger phrases: "analyze comments", "YouTube comment analysis", "brand relevance", "comment sentiment"

## Configuration

Required environment variables:
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — Your Anthropic API key for Claude AI analysis
- `YOUTUBE_API_KEY` — Your YouTube Data API v3 key for fetching comments

## Input Parameters

The user should provide:
1. **YouTube Video URL** (required) — e.g., `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID`
2. **Brand Name** (required) — The brand/product to analyze relevance for
3. **Collaboration Type** (optional, default: "auto") — One of:
   - `dedicated` — Entire video is about this brand/product
   - `sponsored` — Brand segment within the video
   - `mention` — Brief mention of the brand
   - `placement` — Product visible but not discussed
   - `auto` — Let AI determine relevance thresholds
4. **Brand Context** (optional) — Additional context: website URL, product names, keywords
5. **Output Format** (optional, default: "markdown") — `markdown`, `csv`, or `json`
6. **Language** (optional, default: "auto") — Output language (`en`, `zh`, `ja`, `ko`, etc.)

## Instructions

Follow these steps to analyze YouTube video comments:

### Step 1: Extract Video ID and Fetch Comments

Extract the video ID from the URL, then use the YouTube Data API to fetch comments.

```bash
# Extract video ID from URL (handles youtube.com/watch?v=, youtu.be/, etc.)
VIDEO_ID="<extracted from user URL>"

# Fetch comments via YouTube Data API v3
curl -s "https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/commentThreads?part=snippet&videoId=${VIDEO_ID}&maxResults=100&order=relevance&key=${YOUTUBE_API_KEY}"
```

Parse the response to extract:
- Comment ID
- Comment text
- Author name
- Published date
- Like count
- Reply count

Also fetch the video title:
```bash
curl -s "https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/videos?part=snippet&id=${VIDEO_ID}&key=${YOUTUBE_API_KEY}"
```

### Step 2: Analyze Comments with Claude AI

Send comments in batches of 15 to Claude for analysis. Use the following system prompt and scoring model.

**Model:** `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` (cost-efficient for batch analysis)

**System Prompt:**

```
You are an expert in analyzing YouTube comments for brand relevance in KOL/influencer sponsored videos.

## Your Task
Given a brand context and YouTube video context, analyze each comment using a multi-layer scoring model.

## Step 1: Semantic Relevance (semantic_score: 0.0-1.0)
Does the comment relate to the product, brand, or sponsored content?
- 0.9-1.0: Directly discusses the product/brand by name
- 0.7-0.89: Discusses product features, use cases, or category closely tied to the brand
- 0.5-0.69: Tangentially related (general product category discussion)
- 0.0-0.49: Unrelated (off-topic, "first!", personal KOL comments, video production)

## Step 2: Intent Classification (business_category)
Classify into ONE:
- purchase_intent: wants to buy, asks price/discount/where to get it
- product_question: asks about features, compatibility, bugs, pricing, privacy
- brand_risk: false claims, scam links, privacy concerns, KOL misrepresentation
- competitor_mention: compares with or mentions competitor products
- positive_feedback: praises product, recommends it
- negative_feedback: complains, disappointed, wants refund
- irrelevant: unrelated to the brand/product

sub_category (for product_question and brand_risk only):
- product_question → feature | bug | compatibility | pricing | privacy
- brand_risk → false_claim | scam | privacy_concern | kol_misrepresentation

## Step 3: Entity Detection (entity_match)
Check comment for:
- "exact_brand": brand name explicitly mentioned
- "partial": indirect reference ("this tool", "the app", product feature name)
- "competitor": competitor brand mentioned
- "none": no brand/product entity detected

## Step 4: Video Relevance (video_relevance_score: 0.0-1.0)
How closely does the VIDEO TITLE relate to the brand/product?
- 0.9-1.0: Video is entirely about this brand/product
- 0.6-0.89: Video covers a category the brand is in
- 0.3-0.59: Loosely related topic
- 0.0-0.29: Video has nothing to do with the brand
This score should be THE SAME for all comments in the same batch (same video).

## Step 5: Output per comment
Return a JSON array. Each object MUST include:
- id: the comment ID
- business_category, sub_category
- semantic_score: 0.0-1.0
- video_relevance_score: 0.0-1.0
- entity_match: "exact_brand" | "partial" | "competitor" | "none"
- priority: "high" | "medium" | "low"
  - high: brand_risk; strong negative emotion; scam/phishing
  - medium: purchase_intent; product_question; competitor_mention; mild negative
  - low: positive_feedback; neutral; irrelevant
- suggested_action: "reply" | "escalate" | "monitor" | "ignore"
- key_insight: one-line summary
- evidence_quoted_text: key phrase (max 50 chars)
- classification_reason: one sentence why
- sentiment: positive | neutral | negative | toxic
- intent: question | complaint | praise | spam | scam | phishing | brand_mention | competitor_mention | general
- threat_level: safe | review | auto_hide | auto_delete
- confidence: 0.0-1.0
- competitor_mentioned: competitor name or null

IMPORTANT: Analyze comments in their ORIGINAL language. Support all languages including English, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Hindi, Arabic, Spanish, Portuguese, etc. Output fields (key_insight, classification_reason) should match the user's preferred language.

Respond ONLY with a JSON array.
```

**User Prompt Template:**

```
## Brand Context
Brand: {brand_name}
Website: {brand_website} (if provided)
Products: {products} (if provided)
Keywords: {keywords} (if provided)

## Video Context
Video title: {video_title}
Collaboration type: {collaboration_type}
(Dedicated=entire video about brand, Sponsored=brand segment in video, Mention=brief mention, Placement=product visible but not discussed)

## Comments to analyze
{comments as numbered list: "1. [id] comment text"}
```

### Step 3: Compute Brand Relevance Score

For each analyzed comment, compute the final brand relevance score using the **5-layer scoring model**:

```
finalScore = 0.50 × semantic_score      (comment-brand text relevance)
           + 0.15 × video_relevance     (video title-brand relevance)
           + 0.15 × entity_score        (brand name detection)
           + 0.10 × intent_score        (business category signal)
           + 0.10 × context_score       (collaboration type baseline)
```

**Entity Score Mapping:**
| entity_match | score |
|---|---|
| exact_brand | 1.0 |
| competitor | 0.8 |
| partial | 0.7 |
| none | 0.3 |

**Intent Score Mapping:**
| business_category | score |
|---|---|
| purchase_intent | 1.0 |
| product_question | 0.9 |
| brand_risk | 0.9 |
| competitor_mention | 0.85 |
| negative_feedback | 0.7 |
| positive_feedback | 0.6 |
| irrelevant | 0.1 |

**Context Score Mapping:**
| collaboration_type | score |
|---|---|
| dedicated | 1.0 |
| sponsored | 0.8 |
| auto (NotSure) | 0.7 |
| mention | 0.6 |
| placement | 0.5 |

**Brand Relevance Thresholds** (finalScore must exceed to be "brand-relevant"):
| collaboration_type | threshold |
|---|---|
| dedicated | 0.50 |
| sponsored | 0.60 |
| mention | 0.85 |
| placement | 0.85 |
| auto (NotSure) | 0.75 |

### Step 4: Format and Output Results

Output based on the user's chosen format. Always include a summary section and the CTA.

**Markdown Output Template:**

```markdown
# YouTube Comment Analysis — {brand_name}

**Video:** {video_title}
**URL:** {video_url}
**Collaboration Type:** {collaboration_type}
**Total Comments Analyzed:** {total}
**Brand-Relevant:** {relevant_count} ({relevant_pct}%)
**Irrelevant:** {irrelevant_count} ({irrelevant_pct}%)

## Summary
