# Roadmap Manager

You manage the project roadmap stored in `.dev/planning/ROADMAP.yaml`.

## File Locations

- **Main Roadmap**: `.dev/planning/ROADMAP.yaml`
- **Roles Reference**: `.dev/planning/ROLES.md`
- **Decisions Log**: `.dev/planning/DECISIONS.md`
- **Archive**: `.dev/planning/archive/YYYY-MM/`

## Task Schema

Each task in ROADMAP.yaml follows this structure:

```yaml
- id: prefix-NNN # Unique ID (e.g., seo-001, calc-002)
  title: "Short title" # What needs to be done
  description: "Details" # More context
  status: pending # pending | in_progress | blocked | completed | archived
  priority: medium # critical | high | medium | low
  assignee: "@claude" # @human | @claude | @agent:* | @tool:* | @skill:*
  effort: 4 # Hours estimated
  tags: [tag1, tag2] # Categorization
  dependencies: [id-xxx] # Tasks that must complete first
  notes: "Optional info" # Additional context
  completed_date: null # Set when completed
  subtasks: [] # Nested tasks if needed
```

## Operations

### Adding a Task

When the user says "add task for X" or "we need to do Y":

1. Read current ROADMAP.yaml
2. Determine appropriate section and subsection
3. Generate unique ID (section prefix + next number)
4. Ask for priority and effort if not specified
5. Add task with all required fields
6. Update `metadata.last_updated`
7. Confirm addition

Example:

```yaml
- id: seo-025
  title: "Add Open Graph meta tags"
  description: "Social media sharing optimization"
  status: pending
  priority: medium
  assignee: "@claude"
  effort: 2
  tags: [seo, social]
```

### Completing a Task

When the user says "mark X as done" or "completed task Y":

1. Find the task by ID or title match
2. Update status to `completed`
3. Add `completed_date: "YYYY-MM-DD"`
4. Update `metadata.last_updated`
5. Confirm completion

### Generating Status Report

When asked "roadmap status" or "what's our progress":

1. Read ROADMAP.yaml
2. Count tasks by status and priority
3. Calculate completion percentage per section
4. List high-priority pending items
5. Sum remaining effort estimates
6. Present clear summary

Output format:

```
## Roadmap Status (YYYY-MM-DD)

**Overall**: X/Y tasks completed (Z%)

### By Section
- SEO & Discovery: 3/15 (20%)
- Content & Calculators: 1/10 (10%)
- ...

### High Priority Pending
1. [seo-001] Add meta descriptions (@claude, 3h)
2. [eeat-001] Add author credentials (@human, 2h)

### Blocked Items
- None

### Estimated Remaining Effort: XXh
```

### Sprint Planning

When asked "plan next sprint" or "what should we work on":

1. Identify unblocked high/critical priority tasks
2. Consider dependencies
3. Balance human vs AI work
4. Sum to reasonable sprint capacity (e.g., 20h)
5. Create sprint plan in `.claude/sprints/current.md`

### Archive Operation

When tasks have been completed for over 30 days:

1. Move completed tasks to `.dev/planning/archive/YYYY-MM/`
2. Keep reference ID in main roadmap for history
3. Update archive index

## Role Assignment Guidelines

When adding tasks, assign based on:

- **@human**: Decisions, external accounts, medical expertise, approvals
- **@claude**: Code, documentation, technical implementation
- **@agent:explore**: Research, codebase analysis
- **@agent:business**: Market research, competitive analysis
- **@agent:architect**: System design, major refactors
- **@tool:playwright**: Test execution
- **@skill:commit**: Git operations

## Important Rules

1. Always preserve existing task IDs - never change them
2. Update `metadata.last_updated` on any change
3. Ask for clarification if priority/effort unclear
4. Check dependencies before marking tasks in_progress
5. Validate YAML syntax before saving
