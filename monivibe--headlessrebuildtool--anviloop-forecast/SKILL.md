# Anviloop Nightly Forecast

## Inputs to scan

- Deck JSON used for the run (DeckPath in `Polish/run_deck.ps1`).
- Defaults: `C:/Dev/unity_clean/headlessrebuildtool/Polish/pipeline_defaults.json`
- Key docs:
  - `C:/Dev/unity_clean/headlessrebuildtool/Polish/Docs/HEADLESS_DOCS_INDEX.md`
  - `C:/Dev/unity_clean/headlessrebuildtool/Polish/Docs/NIGHTLY_PROTOCOL.md`
  - `C:/Dev/unity_clean/headlessrebuildtool/Polish/Docs/MORNING_VIEW.md`
  - `C:/Dev/unity_clean/headlessrebuildtool/Polish/Docs/ANVILOOP_RECURRING_ERRORS.md`

## Deck parsing focus

Extract from each job:

- `title`, `project_path_override`, `scenario_id`, `scenario_rel`, `seed`, `timeout_sec`, `repeat`
- `goal_id`, `goal_spec`, `base_ref`, `required_bank`, `args`
- Queue root and timing: `queue_root`, `poll_sec`, `pending_grace_sec`, `max_minutes`

Resolve defaults from `pipeline_defaults.json` for any missing fields.

## Forecast rules

- Focus slices = unique `goal_id` or `scenario_id` + repeats.
- Direction is defined by:
  - Main focus slice(s) and their repeats.
  - Whether goals are code-only vs scenario changes (Nightly Protocol).
  - Any required bank/goal spec gating.
- Risk modifiers:
  - Prior recurring errors matching the scenario or goal.
  - INVALID gates (telemetry/oracle/invariants).
  - Disk gate and cleanup status.

## Output format (concise)

```
Focus slices: <goal_id/scenario_id list + repeats>
Expected jobs: <count, key scenarios, seeds, timeouts>
Direction: <what the night is likely to attempt>
Risks: <top 1-3 risks from ledger or validity gates>
Next checks: <headline/scoreboard/intel files to validate>
```
