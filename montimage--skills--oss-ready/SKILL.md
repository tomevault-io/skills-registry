# OSS Ready

Transform projects into professional open-source repositories with standard components.

## Repo Sync Before Edits (mandatory)

Before making any changes, sync with the remote to avoid conflicts:

```bash
branch="$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)"
git fetch origin
git pull --rebase origin "$branch"
```

If the working tree is dirty, stash first, sync, then pop. If `origin` is missing or conflicts occur, stop and ask the user before continuing.

## Workflow

### 0. Create Feature Branch

Before making any changes:
1. Check the current branch - if already on a feature branch for this task, skip
2. Check the repo for branch naming conventions (e.g., `feat/`, `feature/`, etc.)
3. Create and switch to a new branch following the repo's convention, or fallback to: `feat/oss-ready`

### 1. Analyze Project

Identify:
- Primary language(s) and tech stack
- Project purpose and functionality
- Existing documentation to preserve
- Package manager (npm, pip, cargo, etc.)

**Use sub-agents for parallel discovery.** Launch multiple Agent tool calls concurrently to keep the main context clean:

- **Agent 1 — Stack detection**: Scan for `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, `pom.xml`, and identify the primary language(s), build tools, and package manager. Return a structured summary.
- **Agent 2 — Existing docs inventory**: List all existing documentation files (README, CONTRIBUTING, LICENSE, docs/, .github/) and summarize their current state — present, missing, or outdated. Return a checklist.
- **Agent 3 — Project purpose**: Read the main entry point, existing README, and any project description fields to determine the project's purpose and key features. Return a short project summary.

Collect the results from all three agents before proceeding.

### 2. Create/Update Core Files

**Use sub-agents for parallel file creation.** The files below are independent of each other. Dispatch them concurrently using the Agent tool, then collect results:

- **Agent A — README.md**: Enhance the existing README (or create one) with the sections listed below. Use the project summary from Step 1.
- **Agent B — CONTRIBUTING.md**: Generate the contributing guide with the sections listed below. Use the stack info from Step 1.
- **Agent C — Asset files**: Copy LICENSE, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, and SECURITY.md from the skill assets directory using `cp` commands only (never read+write — content triggers filtering). Replace placeholders with `sed` after copying.

Each agent should return the path(s) of files it created or updated.

**README.md** - Enhance with:
- Project overview and motivation
- Key features list
- Quick start (< 5 min setup)
- Prerequisites and installation
- Usage examples with code
- Project structure
- Technology stack
- Contributing link
- License badge

**CONTRIBUTING.md** - Include:
- How to contribute overview
- Development setup
- Branching strategy (feature branches from main)
- Commit conventions (Conventional Commits)
- PR process and review expectations
- Coding standards
- Testing requirements

**LICENSE** - Default to MIT unless specified.

**CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md** - Contributor Covenant.

**SECURITY.md** - Vulnerability reporting process.

**IMPORTANT — Copy asset files using shell commands only.** Some asset files (CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, SECURITY.md) contain language about harassment, abuse, and vulnerability disclosure that **will trigger content filtering** if you attempt to read and re-write the content. Always use `cp` to copy these files. Never read their contents into context and write them back out.

```bash
# Copy from the skill's assets directory — use cp, do NOT read+write
SKILL_ASSETS="{SKILL_DIR}/assets"
cp "$SKILL_ASSETS/LICENSE-MIT" LICENSE
cp "$SKILL_ASSETS/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md" CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
cp "$SKILL_ASSETS/SECURITY.md" SECURITY.md
```

After copying, only use `sed` to replace placeholders (e.g., `[INSERT CONTACT METHOD]`, `[INSERT EMAIL]`) with project-specific values. Do not rewrite the full file.

### 3. Create GitHub Templates

Copy from the skill's `assets/.github/` using shell commands:

```bash
mkdir -p .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE
cp "$SKILL_ASSETS/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md" .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/
cp "$SKILL_ASSETS/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md" .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/
cp "$SKILL_ASSETS/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md" .github/
```

### 4. Create Documentation Structure, Metadata, and .gitignore

**Use sub-agents for parallel execution.** These tasks are independent — dispatch them concurrently:

- **Agent D — Documentation structure**: Create the `docs/` directory and populate the relevant files based on the project type identified in Step 1. Target structure:
  ```
  docs/
  ├── ARCHITECTURE.md    # System design, components
  ├── DEVELOPMENT.md     # Dev setup, debugging
  ├── DEPLOYMENT.md      # Production deployment
  └── CHANGELOG.md       # Version history
  ```
- **Agent E — Project metadata**: Update the package file with OSS-standard fields based on the tech stack:
  - **Node.js**: `package.json` — name, description, keywords, repository, license
  - **Python**: `pyproject.toml` or `setup.py`
  - **Rust**: `Cargo.toml`
  - **Go**: `go.mod` + README badges
- **Agent F — .gitignore**: Verify and update `.gitignore` with comprehensive patterns for the detected tech stack.

Each agent should return a summary of what it created or updated.

### 5. Present Checklist

After completion, show:
- [x] Files created/updated
- [ ] Items needing manual review
- Recommendations for next steps

## Guidelines

- Preserve existing content - enhance, don't replace
- Use professional, welcoming tone
- Adapt to project's actual tech stack
- Include working examples from the actual codebase

## Assets

Templates in `assets/`:
- `LICENSE-MIT` - MIT license template
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` - Contributor Covenant
- `SECURITY.md` - Security policy template
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md`
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md`
- `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`
