# OpenSpec to Beads Conversion

Convert OpenSpec design artifacts into self-contained Beads issues for implementation.

## Critical Principle

**Beads must be self-contained.** Extract and embed relevant context from OpenSpec rather than referencing it. Agents need complete context within the bead description.

## What to Include in Each Bead

Every bead description should contain:

1. **Implementation steps** - Specific files to modify, code patterns to follow
2. **Design context** - Architectural rationale, technology choices
3. **Acceptance criteria** - How to verify completion
4. **Related context** - Background needed to understand the task

## Simple Task Example

```bash
bd create "Add TypeScript strict mode to stack config" \
  -t task -p 2 -l typescript,oncall-background-processes

bd update beads-xxx --description "Enable TypeScript strict mode for oncall-background-processes-stack.

Files to modify:
- stacks/oncall-background-processes-stack/tsconfig.json

Changes:
1. Add 'strict: true' to compilerOptions
2. Add 'strictNullChecks: true' (redundant but explicit)
3. Ensure 'noImplicitAny: true' is present

Design rationale: Strict mode catches type errors early and improves code quality. This stack uses CDK infrastructure code where type safety is critical for preventing runtime deployment errors.

Verification:
- Run bash scripts/type-check.sh
- Confirm no new type errors introduced
- Existing type errors in this stack are acceptable (document count if any)"
```

## Complex Task Example

```bash
bd create "Implement dual-write for ShiftUpdate Lambda" \
  -t task -p 1 -l migration,lambda,apollo

bd update beads-xxx --description "Add Apollo dual-write support to ShiftUpdateIntegration Lambda.

Files to modify:
- dynamodb-event-functions/ShiftUpdateIntegration/index.js
- dynamodb-event-functions/ShiftUpdateIntegration/shift-update-integration-stack.ts

Implementation steps:
1. Import layer modules in index.js:
   const { executeAssignmentDayOperation } = require('/opt/nodejs/assignment-day-migration-manager');
   const { updateAssignmentDayInApollo } = require('/opt/nodejs/apollo-assignment-day-mutations');

2. Wrap existing updateAssignmentDay() with dual-write pattern:
   - appSyncOperation: existing GraphQL call
   - apolloOperation: call updateAssignmentDayInApollo() with companyId
   - Pass to executeAssignmentDayOperation()

3. Update stack file bundling config:
   - Add layer modules to externalModules array
   - Ensure amplifyLayer is attached

Design pattern: Use established dual-write migration pattern (see NotifyAdminsOnAccept for reference). The migration manager handles feature flag logic for routing to AppSync vs Apollo based on APOLLO_OPERATIONS env var.

Environment behavior:
- NONE: AppSync only
- DUALWRITE: Both APIs, prefer AppSync result (except company 8)
- APPLOI_QA: Company 8 → Apollo, others → AppSync
- ON: All companies → Apollo

Verification:
- Confirm Lambda builds without errors
- Check CloudWatch logs for dual-write execution
- Run bash scripts/type-check.sh"
```

## Label Conventions

Use the OpenSpec change name as a label:

```bash
# If OpenSpec change is "refresh-dev-cycle-docs"
bd create "Update README with new workflow" \
  -t task -p 2 -l refresh-dev-cycle-docs,docs

# Makes querying easy
bd list --label refresh-dev-cycle-docs
```

## Dependency Handling

Add dependencies when tasks must be sequenced:

```bash
# Task Y depends on X completing first
bd dep add beads-yyy beads-xxx
```

Common dependency patterns:
- Infrastructure before application code
- Data migrations before feature rollout
- Shared utilities before dependent features
