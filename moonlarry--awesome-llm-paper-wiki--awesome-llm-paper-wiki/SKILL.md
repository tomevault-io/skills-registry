# paper-wiki — Academic Literature Survey Skill

> Manage a local Markdown literature vault. Scan, organize, tag, survey, and recommend — all from one skill.

## What This Skill Does

paper-wiki turns a folder of paper Markdown files into a structured, indexed literature vault with:

- **Journal organization**: auto-sort papers into `paper/{direction}/{journal_abbr}/`
- **Tag management**: multi-dimensional tagging (task, method, dataset, domain, signal, etc.)
- **Survey reports**: journal reports, direction reports, method/dataset stats, idea novelty surveys, literature reviews
- **Submission guidance**: journal scoring, revision suggestions, resubmit audits, review loops

## Quick Start

- "Initialize vault" → **init**
- "Scan Battery papers" → **scan-organize**
- "Generate RESS journal report" → **journal-report**
- "Recommend submission target for my paper" → **submission-recommend**

---

## Configuration

Configuration is read from `config.json` at project root. Key sections: `output_lang`, `templates`, `research_workflows`, `web_search`. For the full schema, field descriptions, and defaults, see `docs/configuration.md`. Before workflows that depend on vault paths, language settings, or report behavior, inspect `config.json` and apply its active values.

---

## Output Language Rules

All internal content (this SKILL.md, schemas, scripts, templates) is in **English**. User-facing output follows `output_lang` from `config.json`: `zh` → Chinese, `en` → English. File paths, directory names, variable names, and frontmatter keys remain in English regardless of `output_lang`.

---

## Report Citation Policy

All report-generation workflows must maintain a citation registry:

- Mark every evidence-bearing paper with `[N]` in prose, tables, and claims. Number by first appearance; reuse numbers.
- The final References section must include every cited paper and ONLY cited papers.
- Reference format: `[N] Title. Journal, Year. DOI: xxx. URL: xxx. Source: local path or [arxiv-web].`
- Omit missing fields (DOI, URL, year) rather than using placeholders.
- Before finalizing: verify citation numbers are continuous, every in-text citation has one reference entry, and every reference entry is cited at least once.
- Direction-review scope: standard 40-80 refs; deep 80-120 refs. Every reference must be cited in the body.

---

## Full-Coverage Report Policy

For `journal-report` and `direction-report`, the evidence pipeline is mandatory. The protocol enforces screening, coverage ledger, citation traceability, and unsupported-claim risk checks. `report_family.py --complete` is the authoritative completion gate.

**Full protocol**: Load `references/evidence-validation-protocol.md` together with the report workflow reference file before execution.

**Summary**: Stage 1 builds screening/ledger evidence files → Stage 2 writes the report with full-coverage matrix → Stage 3 verifies count equality → Stage 4 runs the hard completion gate. `--metadata-only` overrides to the legacy deterministic path.

---

## How Workflows Execute

**SKILL.md is the dispatch layer, not the operational manual.** When a user request matches a row in the routing table below:

1. Load the referenced workflow file(s) from the skill directory.
2. Execute the steps defined in that file.
3. Do not execute a workflow from the routing table alone — catalog entries provide routing, not procedure.
4. If a workflow references another workflow by name, load that workflow's reference file before using it.

**Required files may include both a workflow reference file and supporting reference files.** Load all listed files before execution.

---

## Workflow Routing

Route user intent to the appropriate workflow and reference file:

| User Intent | Workflow | Reference File |
|:---|:---|:---|
| "initialize vault" / "初始化文献库" | init | `references/workflows/01-init.md` |
| "scan papers" / "扫描文献", "organize by journal" / "整理期刊" | scan-organize | `references/workflows/02-scan-organize.md` |
| "ingest" / "入库", "process paper" / "处理论文" | ingest | `references/workflows/03-ingest.md` |
| "tag" / "标签", "assign tags" / "打标" | tag | `references/workflows/04-tag.md` |
| "journal report for XX" / "XX期刊报告" | journal-report | `references/workflows/05-journal-report.md` + `references/evidence-validation-protocol.md` |
| "direction report for XX" / "XX方向报告" | direction-report | `references/workflows/06-direction-report.md` + `references/evidence-validation-protocol.md` |
| "review paper" / "literature review" / "综述" | direction-review | `references/workflows/18-direction-review.md` |
| "method stats" / "方法统计", "dataset stats" | stat-report | `references/workflows/07-stat-report.md` |
| "idea survey" / "novelty survey" / "idea调研" | idea-survey | `references/workflows/08-idea-survey.md` |
| "prepare evidence for research ideas" / "idea evidence" | idea-evidence | `references/workflows/19-idea-evidence.md` |
| "generate research ideas" / "找idea" / "brainstorm" | idea-create | `references/workflows/20-idea-create.md` |
| "idea discovery pipeline" / "idea全流程" | idea-discover | `references/workflows/21-idea-discover.md` |
| "check novelty" / "claim novelty" / "claim查新" | idea-claim-novelty-check | `references/workflows/22-idea-claim-novelty-check.md` |
| "review my paper" / "adversarial review" / "多轮审稿" | auto-review-loop | `references/workflows/23-auto-review-loop.md` |
| "review and revise my paper for this venue" / "论文审稿改稿闭环" | paper-review-loop | `references/workflows/25-paper-review-loop.md` |
| "resubmit audit" / "venue transfer audit" / "转投审计" | resubmit-audit | `references/workflows/24-resubmit-audit.md` |
| "read this paper" / "单篇文献精读" | paper-read | `references/workflows/17-paper-read.md` |
| "web find" / "联网检索" / "search papers" | web-find | `references/workflows/09-web-find.md` |
| "daily digest" / "今日 arxiv" / "最新预印本" | web-digest | `references/workflows/10-web-digest.md` |
| "import web clipper" / "导入 web clipper" | web-import-clipper | `references/workflows/11-web-import-clipper.md` |
| "submission recommendation" / "投稿推荐" | submission-recommend | `references/workflows/12-submission-recommend.md` |
| "revision suggestions" / "修改建议" | revision-suggest | `references/workflows/13-revision-suggest.md` |
| "vault status" / "文献库状态" | status | `references/workflows/14-status.md` |
| "health check" / "检查" / "lint" | lint | `references/workflows/15-lint.md` |
| "full pipeline" / "完整流程" | pipeline | `references/workflows/16-pipeline.md` |

**Routing notes:**
- Every workflow runs independently. If preconditions are unmet, output a clear message but do NOT auto-chain unless the user explicitly requests "full pipeline".
- **direction-review** = literature review / survey synthesis. **idea-survey** = novelty/similarity analysis for a specific idea.
- For reviewer-backed workflows (idea-evidence, idea-create, idea-discover, idea-claim-novelty-check): prefer Codex-compatible MCP reviewer, otherwise dual-agent, otherwise degraded single-agent. Label degraded mode.
- For review/audit workflows (auto-review-loop, resubmit-audit, paper-review-loop): prefer Codex-compatible MCP reviewer. In Claude Code, explicitly call `codex`. Fallback to dual-agent then single-agent degraded.
- **Conference Seed Mode**: When idea-create is triggered with an explicit conference paper file path, load `references/workflows/19-idea-evidence.md` and execute its `### Conference Seed Mode` section first. The routing table entry for idea-create includes this path; the activation gate is in `references/workflows/20-idea-create.md`.
- **MCP-first web search**: For web-find and web-digest workflows, MCP tools (`paper-search-mcp`, `arxiv-mcp-server`) are preferred when available. Fallback to CLI (`web_search.py`) when MCP unavailable. At workflow completion, if CLI was used, output MCP installation suggestion. Do NOT auto-install MCP servers; follow official docs if user agrees.

## Template System

Templates live in `templates/generic/`. Domain-specific templates in `templates/domains/{Direction}/`. The template registry is tracked in `config.json` → `templates.registry`.

**Status check** (`status` workflow): reports template coverage and staleness.
**Lint** (`lint` workflow): detects missing or stale domain templates.
**Regeneration** threshold is set in `config.json` → `templates.regeneration_threshold`.

---

## Safety Rules

1. **Never delete** files in `paper/` — these are the user's original paper Markdown files
2. **File moves** require `--dry-run` first, then user confirmation before `--apply`
3. **Preserve `## User Notes`** — never overwrite content under this heading in any file
4. **Log everything** — all file operations go to `workspace/logs/`
5. **Tag priority** — user tags > rule tags > manually confirmed extra suggestions (never remove user tags)
6. **No cross-direction moves** — files stay within their research direction unless user explicitly requests
7. **No overwrites** — if target file exists during organize, log as conflict, do not overwrite
