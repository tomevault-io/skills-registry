## Before Implementation

Gather context to ensure successful test implementation:

| Source | Gather |
|--------|--------|
| **Codebase** | Code structure, existing tests, testing patterns, Python version |
| **Conversation** | What to test (unit/integration/e2e), coverage targets, CI/CD platform |
| **Skill References** | Testing patterns from `references/` (fixtures, mocking, async, coverage) |
| **Fetch Docs** | Use `fetch-library-docs` skill to get latest pytest/pytest-asyncio documentation |

Ensure all required context is gathered before implementing tests.

---

## Skill Triggers & Use Cases

| Trigger | Skill Action |
|---------|--------------|
| "Write tests for this FastAPI endpoint" | Generate unit + integration tests with proper fixtures |
| "Test async functions" | Setup pytest-asyncio with @pytest.mark.asyncio |
| "Mock external API calls" | Generate mocking patterns with unittest.mock or pytest-mock |
| "Set up test fixtures" | Create reusable fixtures for database, auth, HTTP client |
| "Improve test coverage" | Analyze coverage gaps, add tests for edge cases |
| "Organize test suite" | Structure tests into unit/integration/e2e with conftest.py |
| "Debug failing test" | Use pytest introspection, assertions, verbose output |
| "CI/CD integration" | Configure pytest for GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc. |

## Required Clarifications

Before implementing, ask the user these questions:

### 1. **Test Scope & Type** ❓
   - What are you testing? (endpoint/function/model/integration?)
   - Test types needed: Unit? Integration? End-to-end?
   - **Affects**: Test organization and fixture complexity

### 2. **Async Requirements** ❓
   - Does your code use async/await (FastAPI does)?
   - Do you need to test async functions?
   - External async calls to mock? (databases, APIs)
   - **Affects**: pytest-asyncio configuration and fixture setup

### 3. **Database & Fixtures** ❓
   - Do tests need database access?
   - Use in-memory (SQLite), test containers, or real database?
   - Need test data fixtures? (users, products, etc.)
   - **Affects**: Fixture complexity and database setup

### 4. **Mocking Strategy** ❓
   - External APIs to mock? (email, payment, etc.)
   - Internal functions to patch?
   - Monkeypatch vs unittest.mock vs pytest-mock?
   - **Affects**: Mock configuration patterns

### 5. **Coverage Targets** ❓
   - Target coverage percentage? (80%, 90%, 100%?)
   - Which modules/packages are critical?
   - CI/CD pipeline needs coverage reporting?
   - **Affects**: Test organization and CI configuration

## User Input Not Required For

These are inferred or handled flexibly; don't ask unless user mentions them:
- Testing framework (it's pytest—this skill is pytest-specific)
- Assertion style (pytest uses plain assert)
- Test discovery (pytest auto-discovers by convention)
- Parametrization library (pytest has built-in @pytest.mark.parametrize)

---

## Core Workflows

## Decision Trees

### Test Type Decision

```
What are you testing?
├─ Single function/method → Unit test (see unit-testing.md)
├─ Multiple components working together → Integration test (see integration-testing.md)
└─ Complete request flow through API → End-to-end test (see integration-testing.md)

Is the code async?
├─ YES → Use @pytest.mark.asyncio (see async-testing.md)
└─ NO → Standard pytest pattern
```

### Fixture Scope Decision

```
How often should fixture setup/cleanup run?
├─ Every test → Use function scope (default, fastest)
├─ All tests in module → Use module scope
├─ All tests in session → Use session scope
└─ Different value per test → Use parametrize
```

### Mock vs Real Decision

```
Should test use real or mocked service?
├─ Real database → Use test database or in-memory SQLite
├─ External API → Mock it (prevents flaky tests)
├─ Internal function → Mock for isolation
└─ Time/date → Use freezegun for deterministic tests
```

### Test Organization
- **`unit-testing.md`** - Unit test patterns, isolation, edge cases
- **`integration-testing.md`** - Integration tests, fixtures, database, end-to-end
- **`fixtures.md`** - Fixture creation, scoping, parametrization, composition

### Advanced Patterns
- **`mocking.md`** - Mock, patch, unittest.mock, pytest-mock, monkeypatch
- **`coverage.md`** - pytest-cov, coverage reports, CI/CD integration
- **`best-practices.md`** - Test organization, naming, clarity, maintenance

### FastAPI-Specific
- **`fastapi-testing.md`** - TestClient, httpx.AsyncClient, endpoint testing, auth mocking

## Error Handling in Skill

When implementing tests:
- ✅ Fetch official docs BEFORE writing tests
- ✅ Use established patterns from `references/`
- ✅ Test both happy path and error cases
- ✅ Use fixtures to avoid test interdependencies
- ✅ Mock external services to avoid flaky tests

When uncertain:
- Use `fetch-library-docs` to get latest pytest patterns
- Check `references/pytest-basics.md` for common patterns
- Ask user for specific context (code, requirements)

---

## What This Skill Does

✅ Create unit tests for functions and classes

✅ Create and organize fixtures
✅ Setup mocking and patching patterns
✅ Configure coverage reporting
✅ Integrate with CI/CD pipelines
✅ Debug failing tests with pytest introspection
✅ Organize tests into clear, maintainable structure

❌ Modify source code (only creates tests)
❌ Deploy test infrastructure (CI/CD setup only)
❌ Generate test data endlessly (uses focused fixtures)
