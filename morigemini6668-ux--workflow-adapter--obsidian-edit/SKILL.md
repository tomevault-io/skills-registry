# Obsidian Edit

Modify existing notes in an Obsidian vault. Support operations include updating content, appending sections, revising frontmatter, and restructuring note organization while preserving Obsidian conventions (wikilinks, tags, callouts).

## Workflow

### 1. Resolve Vault Path

Look up the vault path in `.claude/workflow-adapter.local.md`. If frontmatter contains `obsidian_vault_path`, use that value.

If no path is configured, ask the user for their Obsidian vault path using AskUserQuestion (the interactive prompt tool). After receiving the path, save it to `.claude/workflow-adapter.local.md` frontmatter so it persists for future use.

### 2. Identify the Target Note

Determine which note the user wants to edit. The target may be specified by:
- **Explicit filename**: "api-authentication-discussion.md 수정해줘"
- **Title reference**: "API 인증 논의 노트 업데이트해줘"
- **Context**: The note just created or recently discussed in the conversation

If the target is ambiguous, search the vault to find candidate notes:
- Use Glob to match filenames: `*{keyword}*.md`
- Use Grep to search titles in frontmatter: `title:.*{keyword}`

If multiple candidates are found, present the list and ask the user to select one. If no match is found, inform the user and suggest alternative search terms.

### 3. Read the Current Note

Read the full content of the target note. Parse and identify:
- **Frontmatter**: Existing metadata fields and values
- **Structure**: Section headings and their hierarchy
- **Content**: Body text, callouts, task lists, code blocks
- **Links**: Existing `[[wikilinks]]` and tags

### 4. Understand the Edit Request

Analyze what the user wants to change. Common edit types:

- **Append**: Add new sections or content to the end
- **Update section**: Modify a specific section's content
- **Revise frontmatter**: Change tags, status, title, or other metadata
- **Restructure**: Reorganize sections or headings
- **Add links**: Insert new `[[wikilinks]]` or tags
- **Update tasks**: Check off completed items or add new ones
- **Correct content**: Fix errors or update outdated information

### 5. Preview Changes

Present the edited note to the user before saving. Show the changes clearly:
- Display the full updated note as a code block
- Briefly describe what was changed (e.g., "Added '다음 단계' section, updated tags")

Ask the user via AskUserQuestion:
- **Save**: Write the changes to the vault
- **Adjust**: Apply additional modifications, then preview again
- **Cancel**: Discard changes and keep the original note

Repeat this preview step until the user approves. Only proceed to step 6 after explicit approval.

### 6. Write the Updated Note

Overwrite the original file with the updated content. Preserve the original filename unless the user explicitly requests a rename.

Confirm to the user:
- The file path of the updated note
- A brief summary of what was changed

## Edit Guidelines

- Preserve existing frontmatter fields not being modified
- Maintain the note's existing language and writing style
- Keep existing `[[wikilinks]]` and tags intact unless explicitly asked to remove them
- When appending content, match the formatting style of the existing note
- Update the `date` field in frontmatter only if the user requests it
- Add new tags without removing existing ones, unless instructed otherwise

## Frontmatter Updates

When modifying frontmatter fields:
- Preserve YAML formatting (indentation, array style)
- Keep fields in the same order as the original
- Add new fields after existing ones

Common frontmatter edits:
- Adding/removing tags: Modify the `tags` array
- Updating status: Change `status` value (e.g., `draft` -> `complete`)
- Adding related notes: Append to `related` list
- Changing title: Update `title` and optionally rename the file

## Edge Cases

- **Note not found**: Search the vault and present candidates. If none match, inform the user.
- **Conflicting changes**: If the edit would remove important content, warn the user before proceeding.
- **Large notes**: For notes exceeding 500 lines, read and display only the relevant sections during preview rather than the entire file.

## Constraints

- Always preview changes before writing. Never overwrite without user approval.
- Preserve all content not targeted by the edit request.
- Maintain Obsidian compatibility: valid frontmatter, proper wikilink syntax, correct callout format.
- Refer to `references/edit-patterns.md` for detailed editing patterns and frontmatter manipulation techniques.
