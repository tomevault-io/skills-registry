# The Swift 6 Paradigm Shift: A Comprehensive Analysis of Language Fundamentals, System Architecture, and Concurrency Safety

## Executive Summary

The release of Swift 6 represents a watershed moment in the history of
the language, marking the transition from a high-level application
language to a true systems programming language capable of spanning the
entire computing spectrum---from embedded microcontrollers to
distributed server clusters. While previous iterations prioritized API
stability and ecosystem maturity, Swift 6 fundamentally redefines the
contract between the developer and the machine. It introduces a
rigorous, mathematically verifiable model for data ownership and
concurrency, eliminating entire classes of memory safety vulnerabilities
and race conditions at compile time.^1^

This report provides an exhaustive technical dissection of the Swift 6
language mode. We analyze the theoretical underpinnings and practical
applications of its defining features: the strictly checked concurrency
model, the introduction of noncopyable types (\~Copyable) for precise
resource management, the refinement of protocol-oriented design through
opaque types, and the stabilization of typed error propagation.
Furthermore, we explore the architectural implications of Region-Based
Isolation (RBI) and the sending keyword, which collectively enable
high-performance concurrent systems without the overhead of traditional
locking mechanisms.^3^ The objective is to equip senior systems
architects and lead engineers with the deep theoretical understanding
and practical workflows required to leverage Swift 6 for robust,
scalable application development.

## 1. The Systems Programming Revolution: Contextualizing Swift 6

To understand the specific features of Swift 6, one must first
appreciate the broader strategic shift it represents. Swift has arguably
completed its \"application phase\"---where the focus was on replacing
Objective-C for Apple platforms---and has entered its \"systems phase.\"
This era is defined by the need for predictable performance, minimal
runtime overhead, and safety guarantees that extend beyond the main
thread.

### 1.1 The Push for Embedded and Kernel Contexts

Swift 6 introduces \"Embedded Swift,\" a subset and compilation mode
designed for restricted environments such as microcontrollers (ARM,
RISC-V) and kernel development. This is not merely a new target; it is
the driving force behind many language changes. In these environments,
runtime object allocation and dynamic type metadata are prohibitively
expensive or impossible.

- **Removal of Runtime Dependency**: Features like \~Copyable types and
  Typed Throws allow developers to write code that does not trigger heap
  allocations or rely on the Swift runtime for error boxing.

- **Generic Specialization**: The compiler is now more aggressive in
  generic specialization, producing small, standalone binaries suitable
  for bare-metal deployment.^2^

### 1.2 Cross-Platform and C++ Interoperability

Swift 6 acts as a bridge between modern safety and legacy
infrastructure. The interoperability with C++ has matured significantly,
allowing Swift to ingest C++ \"move-only\" types directly as \~Copyable
Swift structs. This bidirectional interoperability extends to:

- **Virtual Methods**: Swift can now call C++ virtual methods on
  reference types.

- **Stdlib Support**: Enhanced support for std::map, std::optional, and
  std::vector allows for seamless integration with high-performance C++
  libraries used in finance and gaming.

- **Platform Parity**: Linux and Windows are treated as first-class
  citizens. New capabilities include building fully static executables
  on Linux (eliminating \"dependency hell\") and massive build-time
  improvements on Windows via parallelization in the Package Manager.^1^

This context is crucial: Swift 6 features are not just \"syntactic
sugar\" for iOS apps; they are structural primitives designed to allow
Swift to compete with Rust and C++ in the domain of high-performance
systems engineering.

## 2. Value Semantics and the Ownership Model

The most profound change in Swift 6 is the explication of *ownership*.
Since its inception, Swift has relied on a \"copy-on-write\" (COW)
illusion to manage value types. While convenient, this model relies on
implicit reference counting and runtime uniqueness checks
(isKnownUniquelyReferenced), which incur non-deterministic overhead.
Swift 6 peels back this abstraction, offering developers granular
control over the lifetime and movement of data via Noncopyable Types.

### 2.1 The Limits of Copy-on-Write (COW)

In the traditional Swift model, value types (structs, enums) are
copyable by default. When a struct containing a reference type (like an
Array\'s backing buffer) is assigned to a new variable, the reference
count is incremented. Mutation triggers a check: if the reference count
is greater than one, the buffer is copied (COW) to ensure isolation.^6^

**Architectural Deficiencies of Implicit Copyability:**

1.  **Performance overhead**: The atomic reference counting operations
    required to maintain COW safety can dominate execution time in tight
    loops or concurrent algorithms.

2.  **Logical Incoherence**: Certain types fundamentally represent
    unique resources. A \"File Handle,\" a \"Mutex Lock,\" or a
    \"Database Transaction\" cannot be meaningfully copied. Duplicating
    a file handle might lead to race conditions on the file pointer or
    double-close errors.

Swift 6 resolves this by allowing types to opt-out of the Copyable
protocol.

### 2.2 Noncopyable Types (\~Copyable)

The \~Copyable syntax (pronounced \"suppressing Copyable\") introduces
affine types to Swift. A value of a \~Copyable type can be consumed
(moved) exactly once. After consumption, the compiler statically
prevents any further use of the variable.^8^

#### 2.2.1 Structural Definition and Deinitializers

One of the most significant capabilities unlocked by \~Copyable is the
ability to add a deinit to a struct. Previously, structs could not have
deinitializers because their lifecycles were tied to the arbitrary
number of copies floating through the system. With unique ownership, the
lifecycle is deterministic: when the single owner goes out of scope,
deinit is called.

**Table 2.1: Struct Capabilities in Swift 5 vs. Swift 6**

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Feature**             **Swift 5 (Copyable     **Swift 6 (\~Copyable
                          Structs)**              Structs)**
  ----------------------- ----------------------- -----------------------
  **Lifecycle**           Indeterminate (bound by Deterministic (Unique
                          copies)                 Ownership)

  **Deinitializer**       Not Allowed             Allowed (deinit)

  **Assignment**          Creates a Copy          Moves ownership
                                                  (Original invalid)

  **Resource Mgmt**       Requires Wrapper Class  Direct RAII (Resource
                                                  Acquisition Is
                                                  Initialization)
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Example: A Zero-Overhead File Descriptor

This pattern allows for systems-level resource management without the
allocation cost of a class.

> Swift

import Foundation\
\
struct FileDescriptor: \~Copyable {\
private let fd: Int32\
\
init(path: String) {\
self.fd = open(path, O_RDONLY)\
print(\"File \\(path) opened with fd: \\(fd)\")\
}\
\
// This deinit is guaranteed to run exactly once when the unique\
// instance escapes scope or is consumed.\
deinit {\
close(fd)\
print(\"File descriptor \\(fd) closed\")\
}\
\
func readData() {\
// Implementation of read\
}\
}

In this example, the FileDescriptor cannot be accidentally duplicated.
The compiler enforces the invariant that there is only ever one handle
to the underlying operating system resource.

### 2.3 Ownership Keywords: Consuming, Borrowing, and Inout

To manipulate noncopyable types, Swift 6 introduces explicit ownership
transfer keywords. These keywords define the contract between a caller
and a callee regarding who is responsible for the value\'s lifetime.^8^

#### 2.3.1 consuming: Transfer of Ownership

When a function parameter is marked consuming, the function takes full
responsibility for the value. The caller gives up the value and cannot
use it again. This is analogous to a \"move\" in Rust or C++.

> Swift

func closeFile(\_ file: consuming FileDescriptor) {\
// We now own \'file\'.\
// When this function ends, \'file\' is deinitialized.\
}\
\
func usage() {\
let fd = FileDescriptor(path: \"/tmp/data.bin\")\
closeFile(fd)\
// fd.readData() // COMPILE ERROR: Variable \'fd\' used after consume\
}

If the consuming function does not pass the value elsewhere, the value
is destroyed at the end of the function body.

#### 2.3.2 borrowing: Ephemeral Access

The borrowing keyword grants a function temporary read access to a value
without transferring ownership. The caller retains responsibility for
the lifetime. This is the default for normal Swift methods, but for
\~Copyable types, it must be explicitly reasoned about to ensure the
value isn\'t consumed while borrowed.

**Table 2.2: Ownership Transfer Semantics**

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Keyword**       **Semantic        **Caller State    **Mutability**
                    Meaning**         Post-Call**       
  ----------------- ----------------- ----------------- -----------------
  **consuming**     \"I take this     Invalidated       Owned (Mutable if
                    from you.\"       (cannot be used)  declared var)

  **borrowing**     \"I will look at  Valid (usable)    Immutable
                    this briefly.\"                     (Read-only)

  **inout**         \"I will look and Valid (reflects   Mutable
                    modify this.\"    mutations)        (Read-write)
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

#### 2.3.3 The consume Operator

Swift 6 also introduces a consume operator for use within function
bodies. This is used to explicitly end the lifetime of a variable and
transfer its value into a new context, such as a switch statement or a
return value. This is critical for avoiding \"use-after-free\" logic
errors, which are now caught at compile time.^8^

### 2.4 Generics and Noncopyable Types

Integrating noncopyable types into the generic system required a massive
overhaul of the standard library. In Swift 5, a generic type T was
implicitly assumed to conform to Copyable. In Swift 6, this constraint
can be relaxed using the syntax \~Copyable.

This allows standard containers like Optional and Result to wrap
noncopyable resources. For example, Optional\<FileDescriptor\> is a
valid type in Swift 6. This required rewriting the standard library
primitives to handle conditional copyability---where the container is
copyable *if and only if* the element it contains is copyable.^10^

**Conditional Conformance Example:**

> Swift

enum Box\<Wrapped: \~Copyable\>: \~Copyable {\
case empty\
case full(Wrapped)\
}\
\
// Extension to make Box Copyable ONLY if Wrapped is Copyable\
extension Box: Copyable where Wrapped: Copyable {}

This elegant design ensures that legacy code (which assumes copyability)
continues to work, while new systems code can leverage generics without
the overhead of copying.^13^

## 3. Protocol-Oriented Design: The Existential Pivot

Swift has long championed \"Protocol-Oriented Programming\" (POP).
However, the implementation of POP often relied on **existential
types**---the ability to treat a protocol as a type (e.g., var s:
Shape). Swift 6 crystallizes the performance and semantic costs of this
approach, pushing developers strongly toward **opaque types** (some) and
parameterized protocols.

### 3.1 The Hidden Cost of Existentials (any)

When a variable is declared as var s: Shape, Swift creates an
**Existential Container**.

1.  **Memory Allocation**: The container typically has a fixed size (3
    words or 24 bytes on 64-bit systems). If the concrete value (e.g., a
    complex Polygon struct) is larger than this buffer, the runtime must
    allocate memory on the heap and store a pointer. This introduces
    allocation overhead for value types that was often invisible to
    developers.^15^

2.  **Dynamic Dispatch**: Method calls on an existential type must go
    through the Protocol Witness Table (PWT), preventing the compiler
    from inlining or optimizing the call.

3.  **Type Erasure**: The specific type information is lost. any Shape
    could be a Circle now and a Square later.

To make these costs explicit, Swift 6 mandates the any keyword for
existential types (e.g., any Shape). This serves as a visual marker for
the developer: \"Warning: Dynamic dispatch and potential allocation
happening here\".^16^

### 3.2 The Static Alternative: Opaque Types (some)

In contrast, some Protocol (Opaque Types) leverages **Parametric
Polymorphism**. When a function returns some Shape, the compiler knows
exactly which concrete type is returned, even if the caller does not.

- **Performance**: Since the type is fixed at compile time, there is no
  boxing, no heap allocation for the container, and method calls can be
  statically dispatched or inlined.

- **Identity**: some Shape preserves type identity. Two variables
  returned from the same function returning some Shape are guaranteed to
  be the same underlying type, allowing them to be compared or
  merged.^18^

**Architectural Decision Framework: any vs. some**

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Context**             **Recommended Type**    **Reasoning**
  ----------------------- ----------------------- -----------------------
  **Heterogeneous         any Protocol            An array \`\` can hold
  Collections**                                   both Circle and Square.
                                                  This is the only way to
                                                  store mixed types
                                                  dynamically.

  **Function Parameters** some Protocol           Allows the compiler to
                                                  specialize the function
                                                  for the concrete type.
                                                  Replaces verbose \<T:
                                                  Protocol\> syntax.

  **Return Types**        some Protocol           Hides implementation
                                                  details (Information
                                                  Hiding) without
                                                  incurring the
                                                  performance penalty of
                                                  boxing.

  **Dependency            any Protocol            Often requires swapping
  Injection**                                     implementations at
                                                  runtime, necessitating
                                                  the dynamic nature of
                                                  existentials.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3.3 Primary Associated Types

A longstanding pain point in Swift was the inability to easily use
protocols with Associated Types (PATs) as types. One could not simply
write var c: Collection. Swift 6 introduces **Primary Associated Types**
to solve this.

By declaring a primary associated type in the protocol definition:

> Swift

protocol Collection\<Element\> {\... }

Developers can now constrain opaque and existential types using a
lightweight syntax:

> Swift

func process(\_ items: some Collection\<String\>) {\... }

This is semantically equivalent to func process\<C: Collection\>(\_
items: C) where C.Element == String. This syntactic sugar dramatically
lowers the barrier to entry for writing generic code, encouraging more
performant, statically typed APIs over type-erased wrappers (like
AnySequence).^20^

## 4. Type-Safe Error Propagation: Typed Throws

For its first decade, Swift employed an error handling model where any
throwing function could theoretically throw *any* error conforming to
the Error protocol. While flexible, this \"untyped\" model forced
developers to rely on documentation or generic catch blocks, as the
compiler could not verify which specific errors were possible. Swift 6
introduces **Typed Throws**, bringing strict type safety to error
propagation.^1^

### 4.1 Syntax and Semantics

Swift 6 extends the throws keyword to accept a specific type:
throws(ErrorType).

> Swift

enum DatabaseError: Error {\
case connectionFailed\
case recordNotFound\
}\
\
// Contract: This function can ONLY throw DatabaseError\
func fetchUser(id: Int) throws(DatabaseError) -\> User {\
guard isConnected else { throw.connectionFailed }\
// throw FileSystemError.diskFull // COMPILE ERROR\
}

This strict contract allows the compiler to infer the error type in
catch blocks. A developer consuming fetchUser can write an exhaustive
switch statement on the error without needing a default catch clause,
ensuring all error cases are handled explicitly.^24^

### 4.2 The \"Any Error\" Equivalence

Swift 6 maintains full backward compatibility. A naked throws
declaration is now syntactic sugar for throws(any Error). This ensures
that existing codebases do not break. Furthermore, typed errors can
always be upcast to any Error, allowing typed functions to satisfy
protocol requirements that use untyped throws.^26^

### 4.3 Result Type Interoperability

The interplay between Typed Throws and the Result type has been
significantly improved. In previous versions, initializing a Result from
a throwing closure erased the error type to any Error. In Swift 6, the
compiler can infer the typed error generic parameter Failure from the
closure\'s throws clause.

**Example: Inference in Action**

> Swift

// Swift 6 automatically infers Result\<User, DatabaseError\>\
let result = Result {\
try fetchUser(id: 123)\
}

This seamless bridging allows developers to move between functional
patterns (Result) and imperative patterns (do/catch) without losing type
precision.^28^

### 4.4 Implications for Embedded Systems

While Typed Throws improve safety for application developers, they are
*essential* for Embedded Swift. In constrained environments, the runtime
support required to box arbitrary errors into an existential any Error
container (which requires heap allocation) may not exist. Typed throws
allow errors to be passed efficiently on the stack or in registers,
similar to return values, enabling the use of Swift\'s native error
handling syntax in bare-metal contexts.^2^

## 5. The Swift 6 Concurrency Model: Strict Isolation

The centerpiece of Swift 6 is its **Strict Concurrency** model. This is
not merely a set of new APIs but a fundamental change in how the
compiler analyzes data flow. The goal is **Data Race Safety**: a
guarantee that shared mutable state is never accessed concurrently. In
Swift 6, data races are elevated from runtime hazards to compile-time
errors.^30^

### 5.1 The Actor Model and Isolation Domains

The primary mechanism for safety is the **Actor**. An actor is a
reference type that protects its mutable state by forcing all external
access to go through an asynchronous \"mailbox.\"

- **Isolation Domains**: Each actor instance forms an \"isolation
  domain.\" Code running within this domain can access the actor\'s
  state synchronously. Code outside the domain must await access.

- **Reentrancy**: A critical nuance is that Swift actors are reentrant.
  When an actor function suspends (awaits another operation), the actor
  unlocks. Other tasks can be scheduled on the actor during this
  suspension. This design prevents deadlocks but means that actor state
  can change across an await point. Developers must assume that
  invariants hold only between suspension points.^31^

### 5.2 Global Actors and The Singleton Problem

Classic Singletons (e.g., static let shared = Manager()) are inherently
unsafe in a concurrent world because they can be accessed from any
thread. Swift 6 solves this with **Global Actors**.

- **\@MainActor**: This is a special global actor representing the main
  thread. It is strictly enforced for all UI code.

- **Custom Global Actors**: Developers can define their own global
  actors to protect subsystems.

**Example: Thread-Safe Database Singleton**

> Swift

\@globalActor actor DatabaseActor {\
static let shared = DatabaseActor()\
}\
\
\@DatabaseActor\
class DatabaseManager {\
// All properties and methods here are isolated to the DatabaseActor\
// Access from outside requires \'await\'\
func save() {\... }\
}

This pattern provides the convenience of a singleton with the safety of
an actor.^33^

### 5.3 The Sendable Protocol

Sendable is the thread-safety passport of Swift. A type is Sendable if
it is safe to pass its values across isolation domains (e.g., from a
background task to the Main Actor).

- **Value Types**: Structs and enums are implicitly Sendable if their
  members are Sendable.

- **Classes**: Classes are generally *not* Sendable because they have
  mutable reference semantics. To be Sendable, a class must be final and
  contain only immutable (let) properties of Sendable types.

- **\@unchecked Sendable**: This attribute allows developers to bypass
  compiler checks for types that manage their own internal
  synchronization (e.g., using OSAllocatedUnfairLock). It is an
  \"unsafe\" escape hatch that should be used with extreme caution.^35^

## 6. Advanced Concurrency: Region-Based Isolation and Transferring

While Sendable types are safe to share, requiring all shared data to be
Sendable is restrictive. It often forces unnecessary copying or prevents
the use of mutable patterns. Swift 6 introduces **Region-Based Isolation
(RBI)** to allow non-Sendable data to be passed safely between
domains.^3^

### 6.1 The Mechanics of Flow-Sensitive Analysis

RBI relies on the compiler\'s ability to analyze the control flow of a
program. It determines the \"region\" (scope of access) for a variable.
If the compiler can prove that a non-Sendable value is
**disconnected**---meaning there are no other active references to it in
the current isolation domain---it allows that value to be transferred to
a new domain.

**The \"Island\" Metaphor**: Imagine data as an object on an island
(Isolation Domain A). If you construct a boat (a non-Sendable object),
put it in the water, and push it to another island (Isolation Domain B),
there is no risk of conflict *provided you do not keep a rope attached
to it*. If Domain A retains a reference (a rope), a race condition is
possible. If Domain A abandons all references, the transfer is safe.

### 6.2 The sending Keyword

To formalize this transfer, Swift 6 introduces the sending keyword
(which evolved from transferring during the proposal phase). It marks
function parameters or results as crossing isolation boundaries.^4^

**Usage in Function Signatures:**

> Swift

class Report { var content = \"\" } // Not Sendable\
\
actor Archiver {\
var store: =\
\
// \'sending\' indicates the caller must give up ownership of
\'report\'\
func archive(\_ report: sending Report) {\
self.store.append(report)\
}\
}\
\
func process() async {\
let report = Report()\
report.content = \"Financials\"\
\
let archiver = Archiver()\
\
// Safe in Swift 6 because \'report\' is not used after this line\
await archiver.archive(report)\
}

If the developer attempts to access report after the await call, the
compiler will flag a \"use after sending\" error. This feature is
critical for performance, as it allows mutable objects to be built
efficiently in a single thread and then handed off for processing
without deep copying or synchronization locks.^4^

## 7. Architectural Migration Patterns

Migrating a large codebase to Swift 6 is a significant engineering
undertaking. The \"Strict Concurrency\" checks often reveal thousands of
latent race conditions. A strategic, pattern-based approach is required.

### 7.1 From Delegates to AsyncStream

The Delegate pattern, pervasive in Apple\'s SDKs, is inherently
difficult to secure in a strictly concurrent world. Delegate methods are
often synchronous and triggered by legacy Objective-C runtimes, making
actor isolation guarantees difficult to enforce.

**Recommendation**: Refactor delegate-based APIs to expose AsyncStream.
An AsyncStream buffers events and allows the consumer to iterate over
them using for await, which naturally respects the consumer\'s isolation
context.^40^

**Migration Example:**

*Legacy Delegate:*

> Swift

protocol LocationDelegate: AnyObject {\
func didUpdateLocations(\_ locations: \[CLLocation\])\
}

*Modern AsyncStream Wrapper:*

> Swift

extension LocationManager {\
var locations: AsyncStream\<\[CLLocation\]\> {\
AsyncStream { continuation in\
let listener = DelegateWrapper { locations in\
continuation.yield(locations)\
}\
// Retain listener and setup termination cleanup\
continuation.onTermination = { \_ in listener.stop() }\
listener.start()\
}\
}\
}

This converts an unpredictable \"push\" model (delegate) into a
controlled \"pull\" model (stream) that integrates cleanly with Swift
concurrency.

### 7.2 Handling Preconcurrency

It is impossible to migrate the entire world at once. Swift 6 provides
the \@preconcurrency attribute to manage interoperability with modules
that have not yet adopted strict checking.

- **\@preconcurrency import**: Downgrades concurrency errors from the
  imported module to warnings. This protects your strict code from the
  \"viral\" nature of the imported module\'s lack of safety
  annotations.^42^

- **\@preconcurrency on Protocols**: Allows a protocol to accept
  non-Sendable conformances from legacy clients while enforcing Sendable
  conformances for new code.

### 7.3 Closure Isolation Strategies

A common friction point is closures captured by functions (e.g., Timer
or completion handlers) that are inferred to be non-isolated.

- **Explicit Isolation**: Swift 6 allows closures to explicitly state
  their isolation.

- **Sending Closures**: If you are writing a utility function that
  executes a closure on a background queue, mark the closure parameter
  as sending (or \@Sendable). This forces the caller to ensure captured
  values are safe to share.^35^

## 8. Platform and Tooling Enhancements

Swift 6 is not just a language update; it is a tooling overhaul designed
to improve developer velocity and platform reach.

### 8.1 Debugger Performance

A major bottleneck in previous versions was the LLDB debugger\'s startup
time, which often required compiling implicit Clang modules to resolve
types. Swift 6 introduces **Explicit Module Builds** for the debugger.
LLDB can now import the pre-compiled Swift and Clang modules directly
from the project\'s build artifacts. This dramatically reduces the
\"Spinning Beachball\" delay when first attaching the debugger or
printing variables (po).^2^

### 8.2 Windows and Linux Maturity

Swift 6 treats non-Apple platforms as first-class targets.

- **Static Linking**: On Linux, Swift 6 supports fully static
  executables. This means a Swift binary can be deployed to a server
  without installing the Swift runtime libraries or worrying about glibc
  version mismatches (\"dependency hell\").

- **Windows Performance**: The Windows implementation of the Swift
  Package Manager now supports parallel builds, resulting in up to 10x
  faster compilation on multi-core ARM64 and x64 Windows machines. This
  is critical for adoption in enterprise environments where Windows dev
  boxes are standard.^1^

### 8.3 Swift Testing Framework

Swift 6 introduces a new, macro-based testing framework (Swift Testing)
that runs alongside XCTest. It uses Swift macros to generate test
metadata at compile time, improving discovery speed and enabling richer
inline diagnostics. Because it is built on standard Swift features, it
works seamlessly across all platforms, including Linux and Windows.^1^

## 9. Conclusion

Swift 6 completes the language\'s decade-long evolution from a safer
alternative to Objective-C into a premier systems language capable of
powering the next generation of computing infrastructure. By enforcing
strict isolation and providing tools for explicit ownership management
(\~Copyable), it eliminates entire categories of heisenbugs related to
memory corruption and race conditions.

The transition to Swift 6 is demanding. It requires engineers to abandon
the \"shared mutable state\" habits of the past and embrace a world of
isolated actors, explicit data transfer, and static verification.
However, the dividends are substantial: software that is verifiable,
robust, and capable of running efficiently on everything from a \$2
microcontroller to a distributed cloud cluster. The era of \"safe by
default\" has evolved into \"safe by design,\" and Swift 6 is the
blueprint for that future.

## 10. Examples

### Example A: Region-Based Isolation with sending

This example demonstrates how a non-Sendable class instance can be
safely transferred to an actor without triggering a concurrency warning,
thanks to Swift 6\'s Region-Based Isolation analysis.

> Swift

// A typical non-Sendable class (mutable, reference semantics)\
class UserReport {\
var data: String = \"\"\
var timestamp: Date = Date()\
}\
\
actor ReportArchiver {\
private var archive: =\
\
// The \'sending\' keyword declares that this function assumes full\
// ownership of the passed parameter. The caller implies a transfer.\
func store(\_ report: sending UserReport) {\
self.archive.append(report)\
print(\"Report archived.\")\
}\
}\
\
func generateReport() async {\
// 1. Create a non-Sendable object in the current isolation domain
(Task)\
let report = UserReport()\
report.data = \"Q3 Financials\"\
\
let archiver = ReportArchiver()\
\
// 2. Transfer ownership to the actor.\
// Swift 6 analyzes the flow: \'report\' is passed as \'sending\'.\
// It checks: Is \'report\' used after this line?\
await archiver.store(report)\
\
// 3. No subsequent use.\
// The transfer is valid. The \'island\' (Task) has disconnected from
the boat.\
\
// UNCOMMENTING THE LINE BELOW WOULD CAUSE A COMPILE ERROR:\
// print(report.data)\
// Error: \'report\' used after being sent to isolation domain
\'ReportArchiver\'.\
}

### Example B: Noncopyable Resource Wrapper (RAII)

This example shows how \~Copyable allows for safe, low-level resource
management without class allocation overhead.

> Swift

struct UnixPointer: \~Copyable {\
private let ptr: UnsafeMutableRawPointer\
\
init(size: Int) {\
self.ptr = malloc(size)\
print(\"Allocated \\(size) bytes at \\(ptr)\")\
}\
\
// Deinit in a struct! Guaranteed to run exactly once.\
deinit {\
free(ptr)\
print(\"Freed memory at \\(ptr)\")\
}\
\
func write(byte: UInt8) {\
ptr.storeBytes(of: byte, as: UInt8.self)\
}\
}\
\
func processBuffer() {\
let buffer = UnixPointer(size: 1024)\
buffer.write(byte: 0xFF)\
\
// \'buffer\' is deinitialized here automatically when scope ends.\
// No memory leaks, no manual cleanup required.\
}\
\
func transferBuffer() {\
let buffer = UnixPointer(size: 512)\
consumeAndDestroy(buffer)\
// \'buffer\' is no longer valid here. The deinit happened inside the
called function.\
}\
\
func consumeAndDestroy(\_ b: consuming UnixPointer) {\
print(\"Buffer received and will be destroyed.\")\
// b deinitializes at the end of this function.\
}
