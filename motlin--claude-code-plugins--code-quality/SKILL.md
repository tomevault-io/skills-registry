# Code Quality Guidelines

## Don't write forgiving code

- Don't permit multiple input formats
    - In TypeScript, this means avoiding Union Type (the `|` in types)
- Use preconditions
    - Use schema libraries
    - Assert that inputs match expected formats
    - When expectations are violated, throw, don't log
- Don't add defensive try/catch blocks
    - Usually we let exceptions propagate out
- Don't keep legacy code paths as fallbacks
    - Remove old code instead of keeping it around for compatibility

## Naming Conventions

- Don't use abbreviations or acronyms
    - Choose `number` instead of `num` and `greaterThan` instead of `gt`

## File Management

- Prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one
- Confirm with the user before creating any new markdown files

## Style

- Emoji and unicode characters are welcome
    - Use them at the beginning of comments, commit messages, and in headers in docs
