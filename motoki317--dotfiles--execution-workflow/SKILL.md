# Task Execution and Code Review Patterns

## Delegation Principles

### Parallel vs Sequential
- **Parallel**: Independent tasks (quality + security, test + docs when independent)
- **Sequential**: Tasks with data dependencies; verify outputs before dependent tasks start

### Delegation Context
Sub-agents need:
- Specific scope and expected deliverables
- Target file paths
- MCP tool usage instructions
- Reference implementations
- Relevant memory patterns

## Code Review Phases

### Phase 1: Initial Scan
- Syntax errors and typos
- Missing imports/dependencies
- Obvious logic errors
- Code style violations

### Phase 2: Deep Analysis
- Algorithm correctness
- Edge case handling
- Error handling completeness
- Resource management

### Phase 3: Context Evaluation
- Breaking changes to public APIs
- Side effects on existing functionality
- Dependency compatibility

### Phase 4: Standards Compliance
- Naming conventions
- Documentation requirements
- Test coverage

## Feedback Categories

| Priority | Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Critical | Must fix | Security vulnerabilities, data corruption, breaking changes |
| Important | Should fix | Logic errors, missing error handling, performance issues |
| Suggestion | Nice to have | Code style, refactoring, documentation |
| Positive | Done well | Good patterns, clever solutions, thorough testing |

## Review Output Format
```
Summary: [overall assessment]
Critical Issues: [must-fix with file:line refs]
Important Issues: [should-fix items]
Suggestions: [optional improvements]
Positive Feedback: [good practices observed]
```

## Critical Rules
- Execute independent tasks in parallel
- Never parallelize tasks with data dependencies
- Verify sub-agent outputs before integration
- Balance critical feedback with positive observations
- Provide file:line references for all issues
