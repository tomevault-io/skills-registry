# Technical Documentation

Patterns for README, design documents, API specifications, and user guides.

## Document Types

| Type | Audience | When to Use |
|------|----------|-------------|
| README | Developers, contributors | Main project entry point |
| API Spec | API integrators | REST/GraphQL endpoints |
| Design Doc | Team, reviewers | Major features, architecture |
| User Guide | End users, admins | Help, tutorials, product guides |

## Core Concepts

- **Progressive disclosure**: Quick start -> common cases -> advanced -> edge cases
- **Audience-first**: Match depth to reader's knowledge level
- **Example-driven**: Show working code, not just descriptions

## README Structure

```markdown
# Project Name
[![Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/...)]

Brief one-line description.

## Features
- Feature 1
- Feature 2

## Quick Start
npm install package-name

## Basic Usage
import { example } from "package-name";
const result = example();

## Documentation
See [full documentation](link).

## Contributing / License
```

## API Documentation Structure

```markdown
# API Reference

## Authentication
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY

## Base URL
https://api.example.com/v1

## Endpoints

### GET /users
**Parameters:** limit (int), offset (int)
**Response:** { "users": [...], "total": 100 }
**Errors:** 401 Unauthorized, 429 Rate limited
```

## Design Document Structure

```markdown
# Feature Name Design Document

## Summary
**Problem:** [description]
**Solution:** [approach]
**Scope:** [included/excluded]

## Goals / Non-Goals

## Technical Design
- Architecture
- Data flow
- Components

## Alternatives Considered

## Security Considerations

## Testing Strategy

## Rollout Plan
```

## User Guide Structure

```markdown
# User Guide

## Getting Started
## Core Concepts
## Step-by-Step Tutorials
## Feature Reference
## Troubleshooting / FAQ
## Glossary
```

## Best Practices

**Critical:**
- Write for specific audience's knowledge level
- Start with essentials, reveal complexity gradually
- Verify all code examples compile and run

**High:**
- Make content scannable (headings, bullets, code blocks)
- Include working, copy-pasteable examples
- Use active voice: "Run this command" not "The command can be run"

## Language Guidelines

**English:**
- Active voice, present tense
- Professional but approachable
- Avoid idioms that don't translate

**Japanese:**
- User docs: です・ます調
- Technical specs: である調
- Avoid excessive katakana, ambiguous expressions

## Anti-Patterns

| Avoid | Instead |
|-------|---------|
| Wall of text | Bullets, headings, code blocks |
| Outdated info | Document current state |
| Assuming context | Define terms, link prerequisites |
| Untested examples | Verify code compiles/runs |
| Passive voice | Active voice for clarity |
| Jargon overload | Define terms or use simpler language |

## Constraints

**Must:**
- Verify accuracy against implementation
- Include runnable code examples
- Follow project documentation style

**Avoid:**
- Documenting without reading code
- Adding timestamps to documents
- Duplicating information
