# Technical Writing

Patterns for technical blogs and articles for external audiences.

## Article Types

| Type | Audience | Length | Structure |
|------|----------|--------|-----------|
| Tutorial | Learners | 1500-3000 | Problem -> Steps -> Example -> Troubleshooting |
| Concept | Understanding seekers | 1000-2500 | Hook -> Core -> Examples -> Misconceptions |
| Comparison | Decision makers | 1500-2500 | Criteria -> Options -> Features -> Recommendation |
| Case Study | Leaders | 1500-3000 | Challenge -> Solution -> Results -> Lessons |
| Opinion | Experienced devs | 800-1500 | Thesis -> Arguments -> Counterarguments -> Action |

## Core Principles

- **Hook early**: Problem statement, surprising fact, or relatable story in first paragraph
- **Inverted pyramid**: Lead with conclusion, most important info first
- **Show don't tell**: Working code, diagrams, before/after comparisons
- **One idea per section**: Split if covering multiple ideas
- **Respect reader time**: Be concise, provide TL;DR for long articles

## Title Patterns

- **How-to**: "How to Implement Rate Limiting with Redis"
- **Number list**: "5 Things Every Developer Should Know About TypeScript Generics"
- **Comparison**: "REST vs GraphQL: Which Should You Choose in 2025?"
- **Problem-solution**: "Solving N+1 Queries with DataLoader"
- **Deep dive**: "Understanding React Reconciliation: A Deep Dive"
- **Lessons**: "What I Learned Building a Real-Time Collaboration System"

## Language Guidelines

**English:**
- Conversational but professional
- First person ("I found...") or second person ("You can...")
- Vary sentence length

**Japanese:**
- Technical articles: です・ます調
- Personal blogs: flexible
- English technical terms as katakana where appropriate

## Writing Workflow

1. **Ideation**: Core message (one sentence), audience, article type
2. **Outline**: Section headings, key points, examples needed
3. **Draft**: Body first (not intro), include tested code, transitions
4. **Edit**: Read aloud, cut 20%, verify claims, check code
5. **Polish**: Proofread, optimize title/headings, add meta description

## Best Practices

**Critical:**
- Start with compelling hook, never "In this article..."
- Test all code examples before publishing
- Verify all technical claims

**High:**
- Explain code context before/after snippets
- Support claims with evidence (benchmarks, examples)
- Each section has one clear purpose

## Anti-Patterns

| Avoid | Instead |
|-------|---------|
| Burying the lede | Most important point first |
| Assuming motivation | Explain why reader should care |
| Code without context | Explain purpose before/after |
| Unsubstantiated claims | Benchmarks or reasoned arguments |
| Clickbait title | Title matches content scope |
| Wall of code | Break up with explanations |
| Generic intro | Hook that captures attention |

## Constraints

**Must:**
- Verify all technical claims
- Test all code examples
- Write for target audience level

**Avoid:**
- Jargon without explanation
- Untested code examples
- Overly complex explanations
