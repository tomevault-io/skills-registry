# Pavlok Stimulus

Use `scripts/pavlok.py` to send a stimulus to the Pavlok API.

## Run

```bash
uv run scripts/pavlok.py zap 30 "reason for trigger"
```

## Inputs

- `stimulusType` is a string such as `vibe`, `beep`, or `zap`.
- `stimulusValue` is an integer.
- `reason` is required by the CLI parser but is not currently sent to the API.

## Notes

- Requires `PAVLOK_API_KEY` in `.env` or the environment.
- For `zap`, `LIMIT_DAY_PAVLOK_COUNTS` and `LIMIT_PAVLOK_ZAP_VALUE` are required. If the daily zap limit is exceeded, the script returns a JSON object with `skipped: true` and `reason: "limit_reached"`. If the value is above the limit, it is clamped to `LIMIT_PAVLOK_ZAP_VALUE`.
