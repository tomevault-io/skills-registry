# Auto-Audit Skill

## When to Trigger

- Before making ANY code changes to existing files
- When user says "refactor", "optimize", "fix", or "update"
- Before implementing new features that touch existing code

## What to Do

### Step 1: Analyze Impact

Before changing any file, check:

1. What components import this file?
2. What API routes depend on this?
3. Are there any database queries that will be affected?
4. Does this change affect authentication/authorization?
5. Will this break existing features?

### Step 2: Create Audit Report

Before making changes, output:

```markdown
## Impact Analysis for [filename]

### Files That Will Be Affected:

- [ ] file1.ts (imports this)
- [ ] file2.tsx (uses this function)

### Database Changes Required:

- [ ] None
- [ ] Migration needed: [describe]

### API Changes:

- [ ] Breaking change: Yes/No
- [ ] Backwards compatible: Yes/No

### Security Implications:

- [ ] Authentication affected: Yes/No
- [ ] Authorization affected: Yes/No
- [ ] New permissions needed: Yes/No

### Testing Required:

- [ ] Unit tests to update
- [ ] Integration tests needed
- [ ] Manual testing steps

### Rollback Plan:

[Describe how to undo if this breaks]
```

### Step 3: Get Confirmation

Ask user: "I've identified [X] potential impacts. Proceed with changes? (yes/no)"

## Example Usage

**User:** "Update the booking status enum"

**Agent:**

🔍 Auto-Audit Activated

Analyzing impact of changing BookingStatus enum...

## Impact Analysis

### Files Affected (12):

- src/app/api/bookings/route.ts (status checks)
- src/components/booking-card.tsx (status display)
- src/lib/services/booking.service.ts (business logic)
  ... [9 more]

### Database Migration:

⚠️ WARNING: This is a breaking change

- Need migration to update existing booking records
- Estimated 500+ records will be affected

### Breaking Changes:

❌ API responses will change
❌ Frontend components expect old values

### Recommendation:

1. Create migration script first
2. Add backwards compatibility layer
3. Deprecate old values gradually

Proceed? (yes/no)
