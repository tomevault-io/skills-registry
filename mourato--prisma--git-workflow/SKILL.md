# Git Workflow

## Role

Use this skill as the canonical owner for day-to-day Git operations in Prisma.

- Own branch setup, branch naming, commit structure, PR hygiene, and cleanup.
- Own safe GitHub CLI body patterns.
- Delegate lane policy, verification commands, and review output to their specialist owners.

## Scope Boundary

- Use `../task-lifecycle/SKILL.md` for risk classification and lifecycle sequencing.
- Use `../quality-assurance/SKILL.md` for concrete validation commands and merge gates.
- Use `../code-review/SKILL.md` for findings format and semáforo review output.

## When to Use

Activate this skill whenever you are:
- Creating or switching branches for a task
- Structuring commits or preparing a PR
- Cleaning up branches after merge
- Sending rich GitHub issue/PR text through `gh`

## Core Standards

Before merge, apply the lane policy from `../task-lifecycle/SKILL.md` and the command mapping from `../quality-assurance/SKILL.md`.

### 1. Atomic Commits
Break your work into small, self-contained units.
- **One task = One (or more) Commits**: Do not combine refactoring, bug fixes, and new features.
- **Commit Early & Often**: Capture each logical step (e.g., "add view model", "implement view").
- **Safe State**: Do not commit knowingly broken code.

### 2. Pre-Push / Pre-Merge Code Review
Before the final push/merge, perform a local review using **[code-review](../code-review/SKILL.md)**.

- Fast lane: lightweight checklist review is acceptable.
- Full lane: create a semáforo report (🔴/🟡/🟢).
- Fix **🔴 Critical** and **🟡 Medium** findings.
- Re-verify lane hard gate and commit fixes atomically.

### 3. PR Hygiene

- Keep feature, refactor, cleanup, and review-fix commits separate when possible.
- Ensure documentation changes travel with behavior or contract changes.
- Use `--body-file` with `gh` for multiline content.

## Key Concepts

### Branch Naming Convention

```bash
# Features
feature/audio-recording
feature/settings-persistence

# Bug fixes
fix/transcription-timeout
fix/menubar-crash

# Experiments
experiment/new-transcription-engine

# Issue-bound
fix/123-audio-dropout
feature/456-cloud-sync
```

### Commit Messages (Conventional Commits)

Follow the standard `[type](scope): description` pattern:

```text
[type](scope): short description (max 50 chars)

Optional body explaining the "why" behind the change.
Use complete sentences and reference issues: #123.

Types: feat, fix, refactor, docs, test, chore, style, perf
```

**Examples:**
- `feat(audio): add noise cancellation filter`
- `fix(settings): resolve API key persistence issue`
- `refactor(transcription): simplify buffer management`

### Proactive Commit Suggestions

Suggest committing changes automatically when:
1. **Task Completed**: After finishing a significant unit of work.
2. **Multiple Modifications**: After modifying 5 or more files in a session.
3. **Context Shift**: Before starting a fundamental change or a new task.
4. **Config/API Changes**: After updating critical configuration files or public APIs.

## Practical Workflows

### Standard Task Initialization

```bash
git checkout main
git pull --ff-only
git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
```

### Pull Requests

If the repository has a PR template, use it.

Before opening a PR (or before merging locally), ensure:
- [ ] Lane hard gate from `task-lifecycle` + `quality-assurance` passed
- [ ] Review findings fixed (all 🔴/🟡)
- [ ] Lint completed when required by scope
- [ ] Documentation updated when behavior/contracts changed

### GitHub CLI Body Safety

When sending multiline or formatted text to GitHub via `gh`, prefer `--body-file` over inline `--body`.
This avoids shell parsing/interpolation issues (especially with backticks and mixed-language text).

```bash
# Issue comment
cat <<'EOF' >/tmp/gh-comment.md
Implemented transcript quality alignment end-to-end.
- Added ASR confidence propagation
- Added transcript quality persistence
EOF
gh issue comment 103 --body-file /tmp/gh-comment.md

# Create or edit issue/PR body
cat <<'EOF' >/tmp/gh-body.md
## Summary
Detailed multiline content here.
EOF
gh issue edit 103 --body-file /tmp/gh-body.md
gh pr edit 456 --body-file /tmp/gh-body.md
```

### Branch Cleanup (After Merge)

After merging into `main`, remove temporary branches (never delete `main`).

```bash
# Local branch
git branch -D <branch-name>

# Remote branch (if pushed)
git push origin --delete <branch-name>
```

## Advanced Techniques

For complex Git operations, see the **[git-advanced-workflows](../git-advanced-workflows/SKILL.md)** skill:
- Interactive rebase (squashing, reordering)
- Cherry-picking specific commits
- Troubleshooting with `git bisect`
- History recovery with `reflog`
