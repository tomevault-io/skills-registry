# Model Requirements Gatherer

**Composable:** Works before query-writer (provides requirements), references metadata-manager patterns (DAG/scheduling), uses bigquery-etl-core conventions
**When to use:**
- Before writing SQL for new models
- Before modifying existing queries in bqetl (to understand impact and gather change requirements)
- When gathering requirements from data scientists/stakeholders
- When planning data model architecture

## Overview

This skill guides requirements gathering for building and modifying BigQuery tables. It:

1. **For new models:** Structured requirements interview where user provides source tables, grain, and business logic
2. **For existing queries:** Understands current model from local files, identifies downstream dependencies, gathers requirements for changes
3. **Validates dependencies:** Uses local schema/metadata files first, then Glean Dictionary, then DataHub as last resort
4. **Warns about downstream impact:** When modifying existing tables, identifies and warns about affected downstream models
5. **Suggests useful columns:** Based on requirements and available source data
6. **Produces dual outputs:** Requirements doc (for stakeholders) + condensed working notes (for SQL development)

## When to Use This Skill

**Use this skill when:**
- Starting a new data model from scratch
- A data scientist or stakeholder requests a new table/view
- User asks to modify/edit an existing query in bqetl
- Planning architecture for a new ETL pipeline
- You need to understand downstream impact before making changes

**Do NOT use this skill for:**
- Ad-hoc analysis queries (not part of bqetl)
- Questions about what data exists (that's exploration, not construction)

## Discovery Priority for Construction

When validating dependencies or checking schemas:

1. **Local `/sql` directory** - ALWAYS check first (schema.yaml, metadata.yaml, query.sql files)
2. **Glean Dictionary** - For `_live`/`_stable` tables via https://dictionary.telemetry.mozilla.org/
3. **DataHub** - Last resort or to validate what you've found

**Key principle:** User provides source tables. You validate they exist and understand downstream impact.

## Requirements Interview Process

### Step 1: Understand the Business Need

Ask the user these key questions (don't ask all at once - follow conversational flow):

**Core questions:**
1. **What business activity does this model represent?** (e.g., "install attribution", "user retention", "revenue reporting")
2. **Who will use this model and what decisions will they make with it?** (data scientists, dashboards, ML models)
3. **What are 3-5 key questions this model should answer?** (be specific, e.g., "How many installs per campaign per day?")

**Capture:**
- Business purpose in 1-2 sentences
- Primary stakeholders/consumers
- Core use cases and questions

### Step 2: Define the Grain

This is THE most critical decision - everything else flows from grain.

**Ask:** "What should one row represent?"

**Good examples:**
- "One row per client per day"
- "One row per install event"
- "One row per search interaction"
- "One row per subscription, aggregated monthly"

**Bad/vague examples:**
- "User data" (what grain? per day? per event? lifetime?)
- "Search metrics" (per query? per day? per client?)

**If grain is unclear, help clarify:**
- "Will this be daily aggregates or event-level data?"
- "Should this track changes over time or snapshot state?"
- "How will downstream consumers typically filter/join this?"

**Capture:**
- Exact grain statement
- Time dimension (daily, hourly, event-level, lifetime)

### Step 3: Get Source Tables from User

**Ask:** "What source tables should this model use?"

**User provides table names** - they tell you what upstream models/tables to use.

#### For Each Source Table

**Capture from user:**
- Full table name (project.dataset.table)
- Why this table is needed (what fields/data it provides)
- Join keys (how it connects to other sources)
- Any filter logic (WHERE clauses, date ranges)

#### Validate Source Tables Exist

After user provides source tables, validate they exist using discovery priority:

1. **Check local `/sql` directory:**
   ```bash
   find sql/ -path "*/<dataset>/<table>"
   ```
   - Read schema.yaml and metadata.yaml if found
   - Understand available columns for later column suggestions

2. **For `_live`/`_stable` tables, check Glean Dictionary:**
   - URL: `https://dictionary.telemetry.mozilla.org/apps/<app_id>/tables/<table_name>`
   - Use WebFetch to get schema

3. **If not found in local files or Glean, use DataHub as last resort:**
   - Validate table exists
   - Get schema for join key validation

**Capture:**
- Table description (from metadata.yaml or Glean Dictionary)
- Owner (from metadata.yaml)
- Available columns (for later column suggestions)

### Step 4: Understand Transformations

**Ask:** "What transformations or calculations are needed?"

**Listen for:**
- Aggregations (SUM, COUNT, AVG, etc.)
- Filtering logic (active users, specific countries, etc.)
- Derived fields (calculations, CASE statements, etc.)
- Deduplication logic
- Window functions

**Capture:**
- High-level transformation logic (don't write SQL yet!)
- Key derived fields and their business definitions
- Any complex business rules or edge cases

### Step 5: Determine Scheduling and Partitioning

**Ask scheduling questions:**
1. **How fresh does this data need to be?** (daily, hourly, real-time)
2. **How much history do we need?** (30 days, 1 year, all time)
3. **Will this run incrementally or full refresh?** (usually incremental for large tables)

**Infer partitioning:**
- Daily grain → daily partitioning
- Hourly grain → hourly partitioning
- Event-level → usually daily partitioning on submission_date

**Reference metadata-manager patterns:**
- Check similar tables in same product area for DAG patterns
- Suggest existing DAGs when appropriate

**Capture:**
- Refresh frequency
- Partitioning strategy
- Retention policy
- Candidate DAG (or note: "new DAG needed")

### Step 6: Identify Dependencies and Blockers

**Ask:** "Are there any blockers or dependencies we should know about?"

**Common blockers:**
- Upstream tables don't exist yet
- Need access to specific datasets
- Waiting for new metrics to be added to Glean schema
- Need to coordinate with another team

**Capture:**
- Upstream dependencies (what must exist first)
- Downstream consumers (what will use this)
- Blockers (with owners/timelines if known)

## After Gathering Requirements: Validate and Suggest

After gathering full requirements from user:

### 1. Check Downstream Dependencies (if modifying existing table)

**CRITICAL:** If user is modifying an existing query, warn about downstream impact.

1. **Check local files first** - Look for tables that reference this one in their query.sql:
   ```bash
   grep -r "project.dataset.table_name" sql/ --include="query.sql"
   ```

2. **Check metadata.yaml files** for explicit dependencies in `depends_on` fields

3. **If needed, use DataHub lineage to validate:**
   ```bash
   python .claude/skills/metadata-manager/scripts/datahub_lineage.py <table_name> --direction downstream
   ```

**Warn user:** "⚠️ This table is used by X downstream models: [list]. Changes may impact these."

### 2. Suggest Useful Columns

Based on requirements and available source columns:

1. **Review source table schemas** (from local files, Glean Dictionary, or DataHub)
2. **Identify useful columns** that match the stated requirements
3. **Suggest fields for:**
   - Join keys
   - Dimensions for grouping (country, channel, version, etc.)
   - Metrics for calculations (counts, sums, etc.)
   - Timestamps for partitioning/filtering

**Example:** "Based on your requirements to track installs by campaign, these columns from adjust_derived.installs_v1 would be useful: campaign_id, campaign_name, install_date, install_count"

## Output Format

Generate TWO artifacts:

### 1. Requirements Document (Full)

Use the template from `assets/requirements_template.md` and populate with:

**Include these sections:**
- Overview (business purpose, 1-2 sentences)
- Grain (exact row definition)
- Source Data (table with join keys, filters, notes)
- Field Summary (key derived fields and their business logic)
- Questions This Model Should Answer (3-5 specific questions)
- Dependencies (upstream, downstream, blockers)
- Validation & QA (row count checks, null thresholds, freshness)
- Owner & Status (primary owner, reviewers, target date)

**Optional sections (include if relevant):**
- Useful Links (if user provided notebooks, dashboards, prior work)
- Lineage Diagram (if DataHub lineage available)
- Data Governance (if PII, retention policies, or classification discussed)

**Minimize busywork:**
- Skip sections not relevant to this model
- Keep descriptions concise
- Focus on what helps with SQL development

### 2. Working Notes (Condensed)

Create a condensed version for SQL development:

```markdown
## <Model Name> - Working Notes

**Grain:** <one row per ...>

**Source Tables:**
- `project.dataset.table1` - <why needed>
- `project.dataset.table2` - <why needed>

**Key Transformations:**
- <transformation 1>
- <transformation 2>

**Derived Fields:**
- `field_name` - <business logic>

**Partitioning:** <daily/hourly on field>

**Scheduling:** <DAG name or "new DAG needed">

**Blockers:** <any blockers or "None">
```

## Integration with Other Skills

### Before query-writer

This skill runs **before** query-writer to gather requirements. After generating requirements doc and working notes:

1. Ask user: "Ready to start writing SQL based on these requirements?"
2. If yes, pass working notes to query-writer skill
3. query-writer uses requirements as context for SQL development

### References metadata-manager

Use metadata-manager patterns for:
- Schema validation (priority: /sql → Glean Dictionary → DataHub)
- Partitioning strategies (daily vs hourly)
- DAG configuration patterns

### Uses datahub_lineage.py (when needed)

For impact analysis and validation:
- Check downstream dependencies when modifying existing tables
- Validate upstream dependencies if user is unsure
- Last resort after checking local files and Glean Dictionary

## Best Practices

### For Requirements Interviews

- **Don't ask all questions at once** - follow conversational flow
- **Clarify vague grain** - grain is the foundation, must be precise
- **User provides source tables** - don't suggest alternatives unless they're unsure
- **Focus on business logic** - not SQL syntax yet
- **Capture decisions and rationale** - why we chose X over Y

### For Modifying Existing Queries

- **ALWAYS check downstream dependencies first** - warn about impact
- **Read existing query.sql** - understand current logic before planning changes
- **Check for schema changes** - schema changes require coordination with downstream consumers
- **Document impact analysis** - include in requirements doc

### For Validation and Column Suggestions

- **Follow discovery priority** - local files → Glean Dictionary → DataHub
- **Validate sources exist** - don't assume tables are available
- **Review source schemas** - understand available columns before suggesting
- **Match requirements to columns** - suggest fields that directly support stated needs

### For Output Quality

- **Make requirements doc useful for SQL development** - not just paperwork
- **Working notes should be quick reference** - condense to essentials
- **Skip irrelevant sections** - don't force every template field
- **Include downstream impact** - critical for modification scenarios

## Key Commands Reference

```bash
# Check downstream dependencies when modifying existing table
grep -r "project.dataset.table_name" sql/ --include="query.sql"

# Find schema for source table
find sql/ -path "*/<dataset>/<table>/schema.yaml"

# Check metadata.yaml for dependencies
find sql/ -path "*/<dataset>/<table>/metadata.yaml"

# Validate downstream impact with DataHub (if needed)
python .claude/skills/metadata-manager/scripts/datahub_lineage.py <table_name> --direction downstream

# Find tables by keyword
find sql/ -path "*/*keyword*" -name "schema.yaml"
```

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New Model - Install Attribution

**User says:** "I need to track install attribution from Adjust using adjust_derived.installs_v1"

**Workflow:**
1. **Gather requirements:** Grain (one row per install), business questions, transformations needed
2. **User provides source:** `adjust_derived.installs_v1`
3. **Validate source exists:** Check local schema.yaml or DataHub
4. **Review source columns:** campaign_id, campaign_name, install_date, install_count
5. **Suggest useful columns:** Based on requirements about attribution
6. **Output:** Requirements doc + working notes for query-writer

### Scenario 2: Modify Existing Query

**User says:** "Add country dimension to telemetry_derived.clients_daily_v1"

**Workflow:**
1. **Read existing query.sql** to understand current logic
2. **Check downstream dependencies:**
   ```bash
   grep -r "clients_daily_v1" sql/ --include="query.sql"
   ```
3. **Warn about impact:** "⚠️ This table is used by 47 downstream models. Schema change will require coordination."
4. **Gather requirements:** Why country is needed, how it affects downstream
5. **Validate country exists in source:** Check normalized_country column availability
6. **Output:** Requirements doc with impact analysis + working notes

### Scenario 3: Understanding Upstream Dependencies

**User says:** "Create revenue dashboard model" but unsure what upstream tables exist

**Workflow:**
1. **Gather what user knows:** Grain, business questions, general data needs
2. **User says:** "I think there's a revenue table somewhere?"
3. **Help find it:**
   ```bash
   find sql/ -path "*/revenue*" -name "schema.yaml"
   ```
4. **Show options:** revenue_derived.revenue_data_v1 found
5. **User confirms:** "Yes, use that one"
6. **Continue with validation and column suggestions**
