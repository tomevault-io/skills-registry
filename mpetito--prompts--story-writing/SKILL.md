# Story Writing Skill

## Overview

This skill provides guidelines for creating well-structured Azure DevOps work items including User Stories, Issues, and Bugs. It covers work item type selection, required fields, description formats, story point estimation, and acceptance criteria best practices.

---

## Work Item Type Selection

| Type           | When to Use                                                               |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **User Story** | Default for new functionality, features, or user-facing changes           |
| **Issue**      | Technical debt, infrastructure work, or non-functional improvements       |
| **Bug**        | Defects, broken functionality, or behavior that doesn't match expectation |

**Default to User Story** unless the request clearly describes an issue or bug.

---

## Required Fields by Work Item Type

### User Story Fields

| Field               | Description                                             |

## Description Formats

### User Story Format

For user-facing functionality:

```markdown
As a [type of user], I want to [action] so that [benefit].

## Additional Context

[Implementation constraints, dependencies, non-functional requirements, edge cases]
```

### Technical Requirement Format

For infrastructure, refactoring, or backend work (Issues):

```markdown
We need [technical capability] to [purpose/benefit].

## Additional Context

[Implementation constraints, dependencies, non-functional requirements, edge cases]
```

### Bug Description Format

```markdown
## Expected Behavior

[What should happen]

## Actual Behavior

[What actually happens]

## Reproduction Steps

1. [First step]
2. [Second step]
3. [Step where bug occurs]

## Environment

- OS: [Operating system]
- Browser: [Browser and version]
- Version: [Application version]
```

## Story Points Estimation (Fibonacci Scale)

| Points | Complexity                                 | Time Indication              |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| 1      | Trivial task, can be done in minutes       | Less than half a day         |
| 2      | Small task, straightforward implementation | Half day to one day          |
| 3      | Medium task, some complexity               | One to two days              |
| 5      | Larger task, moderate complexity           | Two to three days            |
| 8      | Complex task, requires significant effort  | Three to five days           |
| 13     | Very complex, should consider splitting    | One week or more - split it! |

### Estimation Guidelines

- **Maximum is 13 points** - If larger, split into multiple stories
- **Relative sizing** - Compare to previously completed stories
- **Include all work** - Development, testing, code review, documentation
- **Account for unknowns** - Add buffer for research or exploration

### When to Split Stories

Split a story when:

- Estimate exceeds 13 points
- Multiple distinct user outcomes exist
- Different technical components can be delivered independently
- Story spans multiple sprints

---

## Acceptance Criteria Guidelines

Each criterion must be **specific, measurable, and verifiable**.

### Good Patterns

| Pattern                                            | Example                                            |
| -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| User can [action] and sees [result]                | User can upload a file and sees a success message  |
| System returns [response] when [condition]         | System returns 404 when resource not found         |
| API responds within [X]ms for [Y] concurrent users | API responds within 200ms for 100 concurrent users |
| Error message '[text]' displays when [condition]   | Error "File too large" displays when file > 10MB   |
| [Feature] supports [specific formats/values]       | Upload accepts JPG, PNG, and GIF files up to 10MB  |

### Good Examples

- ✅ "Upload accepts JPG, PNG, and GIF files up to 10MB"
- ✅ "Error message displays when file exceeds 10MB"
- ✅ "Thumbnail generates at 150x150 pixels"
- ✅ "Page loads in under 2 seconds on 3G connection"
- ✅ "User receives email confirmation within 5 minutes"
- ✅ "Form validates email format before submission"
- ✅ "Search returns results within 500ms for up to 10,000 records"

### Bad Examples (Avoid)

- ❌ "Performance is good"
- ❌ "User experience is intuitive"
- ❌ "System handles errors gracefully"
- ❌ "Code is clean"
- ❌ "Application is fast"
- ❌ "Design looks nice"
- ❌ "It works correctly"

### Acceptance Criteria Structure Template

```markdown
### 1. Functional Requirements

- [ ] User can [specific action]
- [ ] System [specific behavior] when [condition]

### 2. Validation

- [ ] Input validates [specific rules]
- [ ] Error message "[text]" displays when [condition]

### 3. Performance

- [ ] [Action] completes within [X] seconds
- [ ] System supports [Y] concurrent users

### 4. Edge Cases

- [ ] System handles [edge case] by [behavior]
```

## Markdown Formatting for Azure DevOps

### Formatting Rules

1. **Use Markdown format** for all rich text fields
2. **No bold fragments** - Avoid `**bold**` within sentences; use headers instead
3. **Use numbered section headers** with checklists for acceptance criteria
4. **Use plain paragraphs** with markdown headers for descriptions

### Description Structure

```markdown
As a [user], I want [action] so that [benefit].

#### Additional Context

- Bullet point context
- Another point

#### Dependencies

Related items or references.
```

### Acceptance Criteria Structure

```markdown
### 1. Category Name

- [ ] First criterion
- [ ] Second criterion

### 2. Another Category

- [ ] Third criterion
- [ ] Fourth criterion
```
