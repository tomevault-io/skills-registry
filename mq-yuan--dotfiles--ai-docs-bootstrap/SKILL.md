# AI Docs Bootstrap

## Overview

Create or update a grep-friendly `ai-docs/` tree that helps agents find canonical code paths quickly and follow consistent workflow contracts. Keep content hierarchical and pointer-based instead of duplicating implementation details. Enforce a default per-file template profile so every repository starts from the same document shape.

## Core Rules

- Reuse existing `ai-docs/` content; merge and extend instead of deleting.
- Prefer path pointers and key symbols over copied code blocks.
- Keep docs concise and split by hierarchy; avoid giant single files.
- Standardize file-level templates, not only directory layout.
- Preserve project-specific facts while normalizing section skeletons.
- Use stable grep tokens:
  - `AI-MAP:`
  - `AI-CONTRACT:`
  - `AI-PLAYBOOK:`
  - `AI-HOTSPOT:`
  - `AI-DOCS-BASELINE-COMMIT:`
  - `AI-DOCS-TEMPLATE-PROFILE:`
- Use consistent entry fields where relevant:
  - `Path:`
  - `Purpose:`
  - `Key symbols:`
  - `Pitfalls:`

## Required Deliverables

Create or update the following structure:

```text
ai-docs/
  00-START-HERE.md
  commands.md
  glossary.md
  checklists.md
  _meta/
    git-baseline.md
    template-profile.md
  map/
    _index.md
    ... hierarchical sub-indexes for real source roots
  contracts/
    _index.md
    io.md
    datasets.md
    interfaces.md
  playbooks/
    _index.md
    write-unit-tests.md
    add-dataset.md
    modify-encoder-input.md
  tasks/
    task_template.md
    in-progress/
    done/
  adr/
    adr_template.md
```

Also update repository `AGENTS.md` to require reading `ai-docs/00-START-HERE.md` before work.

## Bundled Template Asset

Use the bundled starter template as an internal seed. Apply it automatically when the skill runs.

- Asset path: `assets/ai-docs-template/`
- Source style: generic ai-docs skeleton with placeholders only (no project-specific modules/datasets/naming)
- Intended use: initialize or normalize `ai-docs/`, then specialize with repository facts

Execution rule:
- Do not ask the user to run `cp` or `rsync` for normal bootstrap requests.
- Perform scaffold creation and updates directly as part of skill execution.

Post-apply required edits:
- Refresh `ai-docs/_meta/git-baseline.md` with real current `HEAD`.
- Refresh `ai-docs/_meta/template-profile.md` timestamp and notes.
- Replace project-specific placeholders in map/contracts/glossary/commands.

## Template Profile Rules

Always create or refresh `ai-docs/_meta/template-profile.md` during bootstrap or full refresh.

Required fields (single-line key-value format):
- `AI-DOCS-TEMPLATE-PROFILE: ai-docs-v1`
- `AI-DOCS-TEMPLATE-SOURCE: ai-docs-bootstrap`
- `AI-DOCS-TEMPLATE-BASE: current-project-ai-docs`
- `AI-DOCS-TEMPLATE-RECORDED-AT: <UTC ISO-8601>`
- `AI-DOCS-TEMPLATE-NOTES: <short note or n/a>`

Generation rules:
- Use `ai-docs-v1` unless user requests another profile.
- Keep this file machine-parseable; avoid prose between fields.
- Link this file from `ai-docs/00-START-HERE.md` for discoverability.

## Git Baseline Label Rules

Always create or refresh `ai-docs/_meta/git-baseline.md` during bootstrap or full refresh.

Required fields (single-line key-value format):
- `AI-DOCS-BASELINE-COMMIT: <40-char sha>`
- `AI-DOCS-BASELINE-SHORT: <short sha>`
- `AI-DOCS-BASELINE-SUBJECT: <commit subject>`
- `AI-DOCS-BASELINE-DATE: <ISO-8601 commit date>`
- `AI-DOCS-BASELINE-BRANCH: <branch-or-detached>`
- `AI-DOCS-BASELINE-WORKTREE: clean|dirty`
- `AI-DOCS-BASELINE-RECORDED-AT: <UTC ISO-8601>`

Generation rules:
- Use current `HEAD` as the baseline commit.
- Set worktree status to `dirty` if staged or unstaged tracked changes exist, else `clean`.
- Keep the file machine-parseable; avoid prose between fields.
- Link this file from `ai-docs/00-START-HERE.md` for discoverability.

## Standard File Templates (ai-docs-v1)

Use these skeleton constraints when creating or normalizing files.

### `00-START-HERE.md`
- Keep header `# AI Start Here`.
- Include `AI-MAP: START`.
- Keep sections in this order:
  1. `## Workflow (required)` with four numbered workflow steps.
  2. `## Fast lookup commands` fenced shell block.
  3. `## Default guardrails` bullet list.
- Add links to `ai-docs/_meta/template-profile.md` and `ai-docs/_meta/git-baseline.md`.

### `map/_index.md` and map sub-indexes
- Keep one `AI-MAP:` token per file near the top.
- Keep a `## Key files` section with curated entries.
- Use this entry template for each key file:

```markdown
### Path: `path/to/file`
Purpose: One-line role of this file in the architecture.
Key symbols: Core classes/functions/constants for navigation.
Pitfalls: High-risk assumptions or common break points.
```

- Keep `## Related` links at the end.

### `contracts/_index.md`
- Keep header `# Contracts Index`.
- Include `AI-CONTRACT: INDEX`.
- Keep `## Contract files` and `## Contract usage rules` sections.

### `contracts/io.md`, `contracts/datasets.md`, `contracts/interfaces.md`
- Include one `AI-CONTRACT:` token near the top.
- Keep `## Rules` section with numbered defaults.
- Add `## AI-HOTSPOT: <name>` blocks for canonical paths.
- End with `## Related` cross-links.

### `playbooks/_index.md`
- Keep header `# Playbooks Index`.
- Include `AI-PLAYBOOK: INDEX`.
- Keep `## Available playbooks` and `## Related` sections.

### `playbooks/*.md`
- Include one `AI-PLAYBOOK:` token near the top.
- Keep `## SOP` section with numbered steps.
- Add repo-specific placement and exit checklist sections when relevant.
- End with `## Related` links.

### `commands.md`
- Keep header `# Commands`.
- Include `AI-MAP: COMMANDS`.
- Keep these section names when possible: `## Tests`, `## Lint`, `## Training`, `## Inference / Tools`.

### `glossary.md`
- Keep header `# Glossary`.
- Include `AI-MAP: GLOSSARY`.
- Use this per-term block shape:

```markdown
## <Term>
Definition: ...
Canonical type/location: ...
Common aliases: ...
```

### `checklists.md`
- Keep header `# Checklists`.
- Include `AI-PLAYBOOK: CHECKLISTS`.
- Maintain at least two checklist sections:
  - Interface or type change checklist.
  - IO or dataset change checklist.

### `tasks/task_template.md`
- Keep YAML frontmatter keys in this order:
  - `id`, `title`, `status`, `owner`, `created`, `updated`.
- Keep section order:
  - `# Context`
  - `# Goal`
  - `# Constraints`
  - `# Scope`
  - `# Relevant Map / Contracts / Playbooks`
  - `# Plan`
  - `# Progress Log`
  - `# Files Touched`
  - `# Commands Run`
  - `# Decisions`
  - `# Risks / Gotchas`
  - `# Next Steps`
  - `# Completion Notes`

### `adr/adr_template.md`
- Keep section order:
  - `## Status`
  - `## Context`
  - `## Decision`
  - `## Consequences`
  - `## Alternatives Considered`
  - `## References`

## Workflow

1. Discover repository layout and tooling.
2. Identify source roots, canonical IO utilities, datasets, encoder modules, and key interfaces.
3. Build map indexes from top-level to deeper package indexes.
4. Write contracts for IO, datasets, and interfaces with concrete hotspots.
5. Write task-focused playbooks and concise checklists.
6. Add task and ADR templates.
7. Normalize all required files to `ai-docs-v1` skeletons while preserving project-specific facts.
8. Insert an AI workflow pointer section into `AGENTS.md`.
9. Write or refresh `ai-docs/_meta/template-profile.md` using the required fields.
10. Write or refresh `ai-docs/_meta/git-baseline.md` using the required fields.
11. Run quick verification commands and report gaps or TODOs.

## Discovery Checklist

- Confirm top-level layout and config files (`pyproject.toml`, `README*`, `Makefile`, `tox.ini`, `noxfile.py`, `justfile`).
- Confirm source roots and key package tree.
- Locate canonical IO paths (for example `utils/io.py`, `load_*`, `save_*`, `read_*`, `write_*`).
- Locate dataset readers, collate, and dataloader paths.
- Locate encoder modules and input/output type definitions.
- Detect test and lint commands from repository config.

## Map Construction Rules

- Start at `ai-docs/map/_index.md` and link to deeper `_index.md` files.
- Cover at least the primary source root and major subpackages.
- In each index, include a short overview, curated key files, and related links.
- Limit each index to important files; prefer deeper index links over exhaustive dumps.

## Contract Rules

- `contracts/io.md`: enforce reuse of canonical IO utilities and list `AI-HOTSPOT` paths.
- `contracts/datasets.md`: document non-standard dataset formats, loaders, gotchas, and sanity checks.
- `contracts/interfaces.md`: define core typed boundaries and include impact-analysis reminders.

## Playbook Rules

- `write-unit-tests.md`: locate canonical loaders first, choose test placement, run minimal checks.
- `add-dataset.md`: include where dataset code, config, and registration live and what must be updated.
- `modify-encoder-input.md`: track upstream producers, downstream consumers, config, and tests.

## AGENTS.md Update Rule

Add a small AI workflow section near the top. Require:

- Read `ai-docs/00-START-HERE.md` first.
- Use `ai-docs/map/` indexes.
- Consult contracts for IO, datasets, and interfaces.
- Track work with `tasks/task_template.md` in `in-progress/` then move to `done/`.

## Verification Commands

Use repository-compatible commands. Prefer equivalents when tools are missing.

```bash
tree ai-docs -L 4
rg -n "AI-MAP:|AI-CONTRACT:|AI-PLAYBOOK:|AI-HOTSPOT:" ai-docs
rg -n "AI-DOCS-TEMPLATE-" ai-docs/_meta/template-profile.md
rg -n "AI-DOCS-BASELINE-" ai-docs/_meta/git-baseline.md
rg -n "^id: task-YYYYMMDD-<slug>|^# Context|^# Completion Notes" ai-docs/tasks/task_template.md
rg -n "^## Status|^## Context|^## Decision|^## Consequences|^## Alternatives Considered|^## References" ai-docs/adr/adr_template.md
```

## Completion Output Checklist

- Summarize created or modified files.
- Provide short usage guidance.
- Include verification snippet output.
- Report the template profile recorded in `ai-docs/_meta/template-profile.md`.
- Report the baseline commit recorded in `ai-docs/_meta/git-baseline.md`.
- Call out unresolved TODOs and follow-up files.
