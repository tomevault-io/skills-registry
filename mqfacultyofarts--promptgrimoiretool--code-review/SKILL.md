# Code Review Skill

Perform a professional code review following the standards in `prompts/CODE_REVIEW.md`.

## When to Use

- Before committing significant code changes
- After completing a spike or feature
- When the Stop hook reminds you
- When explicitly requested by user

## Process

1. **Identify scope** - Determine what code needs review:
   - Check `git status` and `git diff` for uncommitted changes
   - Check `git log` to find commits since last review
   - Look for any existing code review documents to find the last review point

2. **Read the review template** - Load `prompts/CODE_REVIEW.md` for the full criteria

3. **Perform the review** - Apply all criteria from the template:
   - MANDATORY: No Quick Hacks policy
   - Race Condition Audit Checklist
   - Critical issues (thread safety, async safety, security, data integrity)
   - High priority (type hints, input validation, logging, test coverage)
   - Medium priority (magic numbers, hard-coded config, duplication)
   - Test quality (primary use cases tested, no anti-patterns)

4. **Write the review document** - Save to `.claude/plans/` with:
   - Executive summary
   - Issues grouped by severity with file:line references
   - Specific code fixes (before/after)
   - Checklist of items to fix
   - Verification steps
   - Notes for future work

5. **Report the path** - Tell the user where to find the review document

## Key Principles

- Be specific and critical
- Every issue needs a file:line reference
- Provide concrete fixes, not just descriptions
- Consider whether code enables future architectural goals
- Quick hacks are absolutely forbidden
