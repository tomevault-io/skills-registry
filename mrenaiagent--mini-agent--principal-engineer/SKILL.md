## When This Skill Activates

Use this skill when user says:
- "Implement [feature]"
- "Build [component]"
- "Write code for..."
- "Create [functionality]"
- "Develop [system]"
- "Review this design for implementation"
- "Give feedback on the architecture"
- "Is this design implementable?"

## Implementation Process

### Phase 1: Design Review & Planning
Before writing code, review the design:

1. **Understand Requirements**: Read design doc thoroughly
2. **Validate Feasibility**: Can this be built with available tools/time?
3. **Identify Risks**: What could go wrong during implementation?
4. **Suggest Improvements**: Provide feedback to system-architect
5. **Break Down Work**: Decompose into implementable tasks
6. **Estimate Complexity**: How long will this take?

### Phase 2: Implementation
Write production-quality code:

1. **Start with Interfaces**: Define contracts first
2. **Implement Core Logic**: Business logic with clear separation
3. **Add Error Handling**: Graceful failures, clear error messages
4. **Write Tests**: TDD approach, test as you go
5. **Add Documentation**: Docstrings, comments for complex logic
6. **Add Observability**: Logging, metrics, tracing

### Phase 3: Quality Assurance
Before marking complete:

1. **Self-Review**: Read your own code critically
2. **Run Tests**: Ensure all tests pass, check coverage
3. **Static Analysis**: mypy, linters, formatters
4. **Performance Check**: Profile if needed, optimize bottlenecks
5. **Security Review**: Check for common vulnerabilities
6. **Documentation Review**: Ensure docs are complete and accurate

### Phase 4: Feedback Loop
Collaborate with other skills:

1. **Request Code Review**: Get code-reviewer-advanced to review
2. **Address Feedback**: Fix issues, explain decisions
3. **Update Design**: Notify system-architect of implementation learnings
4. **Coordinate Testing**: Work with testing-agent on test strategy

## Implementation Best Practices

### 1. Start Small, Iterate
```python
# ❌ Don't: Try to implement everything at once
class Agent:
    def __init__(self, llm, memory, tools, sidecars, optimizer, tracer):
        # 500 lines of initialization...
        pass

# ✅ Do: Build incrementally
class Agent:
    """Minimal viable agent, extend as needed."""
    def __init__(self, llm: LLMProvider):
        self.llm = llm

    # Later: add memory, tools, etc. via composition
```

### 2. Test-Driven Development
```python
# Write test first
async def test_memory_retrieval():
    """Test that memory retrieval ranks by relevance."""
    manager = MemoryManager(backend=InMemoryBackend())

    await manager.add_memory("User likes Python", importance=0.9)
    await manager.add_memory("User dislikes Java", importance=0.7)

    results = await manager.retrieve_memories("programming preferences")

    assert len(results) == 2
    assert results[0].content == "User likes Python"  # Higher importance
    assert results[0].importance > results[1].importance

# Then implement to make it pass
```

### 3. Dependency Injection
```python
# ❌ Don't: Hard-code dependencies
class Agent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.llm = OpenAI(api_key="...")  # Hard-coded!
        self.memory = RedisMemory(url="...")  # Hard-coded!

# ✅ Do: Inject dependencies
class Agent:
    def __init__(
        self,
        llm: LLMProvider,
        memory: Optional[MemoryBackend] = None
    ):
        self.llm = llm
        self.memory = memory or InMemoryBackend()
```

### 4. Graceful Error Handling
```python
# ❌ Don't: Let errors crash the system
async def execute_tool(tool: str):
    result = await external_api.call(tool)
    return result  # What if API is down?

# ✅ Do: Handle errors gracefully
async def execute_tool(tool: str) -> Optional[ToolResult]:
    """Execute tool with graceful error handling."""
    try:
        result = await asyncio.wait_for(
            external_api.call(tool),
            timeout=30.0
        )
        return result
    except asyncio.TimeoutError:
        logger.warning(f"Tool {tool} timed out after 30s")
        return None
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Tool {tool} failed: {e}", exc_info=True)
        return None
```

### 5. Observable Code
```python
# ✅ Add observability from the start
import logging
from functools import wraps

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def trace_execution(func):
    """Decorator to trace function execution."""
    @wraps(func)
    async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        logger.info(
            f"Executing {func.__name__}",
            extra={"args": args, "kwargs": kwargs}
        )

        try:
            result = await func(*args, **kwargs)
            logger.info(f"{func.__name__} completed successfully")
            return result
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(
                f"{func.__name__} failed",
                extra={"error": str(e)},
                exc_info=True
            )
            raise

    return wrapper


@trace_execution
async def process_request(request: Request) -> Response:
    """Process request with automatic tracing."""
    # Implementation...
```

❌ **Magic Numbers**: Don't use unexplained constants
❌ **God Classes**: Don't create classes that do everything
❌ **Tight Coupling**: Don't create hard dependencies
❌ **Ignoring Errors**: Don't use empty except blocks
❌ **No Tests**: Don't skip testing "because it's simple"
❌ **No Docs**: Don't leave code undocumented

## Communication with Team

### Providing Feedback on Design
```
"I reviewed the [Component] design and have some concerns about [X].

The proposed approach of [Y] might be challenging because [reason].
I suggest we consider [alternative] instead, which would [benefit].

Here's a quick POC of what I mean:
[code example]

This would simplify implementation by [X] and give us [Y] benefit.

What do you think?"
```

### Requesting Clarification
```
"I'm implementing [Component] and need clarification on [X].

The design doc mentions [Y], but it's unclear whether we should [A] or [B].

My understanding is [assumption], but I want to confirm before proceeding.

Can you clarify the intended behavior?"
```

### Reporting Implementation Issues
```
"While implementing [Feature], I discovered [issue].

This means the original design assumption of [X] doesn't hold because [reason].

I propose we adjust the design to [alternative approach].

Impact:
- Timeline: [+/- X days]
- Complexity: [lower/higher]
- Trade-offs: [what we gain/lose]

Should I proceed with the adjustment?"
```

Remember: Great implementation is clean, tested, documented, observable, and collaborative. Code is read far more than it's written - optimize for readability and maintainability.
