## ORCHESTRATION OVERVIEW

This skill runs in phases. Complete each phase fully before moving to the next. At phase gates, present results to the user and confirm before proceeding.

**Phase 1: Paper Analysis & Reviewer Assembly**
**Phase 2: Independent Peer Reviews** (parallel subagents)
**Phase 3: Review Compilation Report**
**Phase 4: Response Document Generation**
**Phase 5: Working Through Responses** (interactive with author)
**Phase 6: Revised Paper Generation**
**Phase 7: Re-submission to Ensemble** (repeat Phase 2-3)

---

## PHASE 1: PAPER ANALYSIS & REVIEWER ASSEMBLY

Read the paper thoroughly. Then produce:

### 1.1 Paper Profile

- **Title**
- **Domain / subfield**
- **Study type** (empirical, theoretical, review, meta-analysis, computational, mixed-methods, etc.)
- **Core claims** (list each distinct claim or contribution)
- **Methodology** (brief characterization)
- **Applicable reporting guidelines** (CONSORT, PRISMA, STROBE, STARD, or none)
- **Estimated word count**
- **Number of citations**

### 1.2 Reviewer Ensemble Design

Based on the paper's domain, methods, and claims, assemble **3-5 reviewers**. Each reviewer is a distinct role with specific expertise and a defined evaluation focus. The ensemble must collectively cover all critical dimensions of the paper.

**Always include:**
- **Reviewer 1: Domain Expert** — Deep knowledge of the paper's specific subfield. Evaluates novelty, significance, positioning within the literature, and whether claims advance the field.
- **Reviewer 2: Methodologist** — Expert in the research methods used. Evaluates study design, controls, validity, reproducibility, and whether methods support the conclusions drawn.

**Select additional reviewers based on the paper (choose 1-3):**
- **Statistician** — For papers with quantitative analysis. Evaluates statistical methods, power, effect sizes, p-value reporting, appropriate tests, and common errors (unit of analysis confusion, SD/SE confusion, causation from correlation, subgroup analysis issues).
- **Writing & Communication Specialist** — Evaluates clarity, structure, argumentation flow, abstract accuracy, figure/table quality, and adherence to reporting guidelines.
- **Ethics & Integrity Reviewer** — For papers involving human subjects, sensitive data, or potential conflicts of interest. Evaluates IRB compliance, consent, data privacy, COI disclosure, and authorship appropriateness.
- **Computational/Reproducibility Reviewer** — For papers with code, algorithms, or computational methods. Evaluates code availability, documentation, reproducibility, and computational rigor.
- **Interdisciplinary Reviewer** — When the paper bridges fields. Evaluates whether cross-domain claims are warranted and whether the paper communicates effectively across disciplines.
- **Architectural Coherence Reviewer** — For papers proposing systems, frameworks, or designs with multiple interacting components. Evaluates whether claims made in the introduction are consistent with descriptions in the body, whether component relationships (required vs. optional, core vs. peripheral) are described consistently across all sections, and whether the paper's terminology remains stable throughout. Traces each core claim through every section where it appears.

Present the proposed ensemble to the user with justification for each role before proceeding.

## PHASE 2: INDEPENDENT PEER REVIEWS

Launch each reviewer as an **independent subagent** using the Task tool. Each subagent receives:
1. The full paper text
2. Their specific reviewer role and focus area
3. The review template below

**CRITICAL:** Each reviewer must operate independently. Do not share one reviewer's findings with another. Each subagent should have no knowledge of other reviewers' assessments.

**Launch all reviewer subagents in parallel.**

### Review Template (provided to each subagent)

Each reviewer must produce a report with this structure:

```
## Peer Review Report

**Reviewer Role:** [role name]
**Expertise Focus:** [specific focus area]

### Summary (2-3 paragraphs)
- Restate the paper's main claims in your own words
- Identify the key objectives and findings
- State your overall assessment: strengths and weaknesses
- Provide a clear recommendation: ACCEPT / MINOR REVISIONS / MAJOR REVISIONS / REJECT

### Major Issues (numbered)
Fundamental problems affecting validity, soundness, or conclusions.
Each issue must include:
- **Location:** specific section, paragraph, page, figure, or table
- **Issue:** clear description of the problem
- **Impact:** why this matters for the paper's conclusions
- **Suggestion:** constructive recommendation for addressing it

### Minor Issues (numbered)
Quality improvements that do not affect main conclusions.
Same format: Location, Issue, Suggestion.

### Strengths (numbered)
What the paper does well. Be specific.

### Questions for the Author (numbered)
Specific questions the author must answer to address concerns.
Each question should be:
- Pointed and specific (not "can you clarify?")
- Tied to a major or minor issue
- Answerable — the author should be able to respond concretely

### Cross-Section Consistency (all reviewers)
Within your area of expertise, check:
- Do claims made in the introduction/abstract match how they are described in the methods/design/results?
- Are key terms used with consistent meaning and scope throughout the paper?
- If a component or capability is described as "required" or "foundational" in one section, is it described as "optional" or "not needed" elsewhere?
- Are there dependency chain breaks — where Conclusion A depends on Component B, but Component B is described as optional or unvalidated?
Flag any contradictions found, even if they fall outside your primary review focus.

### Confidence Assessment
- **Expertise match:** [High/Medium/Low] — how well does your assigned expertise match this paper?
- **Review thoroughness:** [High/Medium/Low] — did you have sufficient information to evaluate fully?
- **Limitations of this review:** [what you couldn't assess and why]
```

### Reviewer-Specific Instructions

In addition to the general template, provide each reviewer with focus-specific guidance:

**Domain Expert additional focus:**
- Is the literature review comprehensive and current?
- Are key works cited? Are any major omissions?
- Does the contribution genuinely advance the field, or is it incremental?
- How does this compare to the state of the art?
- Are the authors aware of competing or contradictory findings?

**Methodologist additional focus:**
- Is the study design appropriate for the research question?
- Are methods described with enough detail to replicate?
- Are controls adequate?
- Are there threats to internal or external validity?
- Are there unexplained deviations from standard practice?
- Does the design actually test what the authors claim it tests?

**Statistician additional focus:**
- Are statistical tests appropriate for the data type and study design?
- Is sample size / statistical power adequate?
- Check for: unit of analysis errors, SD/SE confusion, p-value reporting accuracy, inappropriate subgroup analyses, causation-from-correlation claims, multiple comparison corrections
- Are effect sizes reported alongside p-values?
- Are confidence intervals provided where appropriate?
- Are assumptions of statistical tests met?

**Writing & Communication Specialist additional focus:**
- Is the abstract an accurate summary of the paper?
- Is the argument logically structured?
- Are figures and tables necessary, clear, and well-labeled?
- Does the paper follow applicable reporting guidelines?
- Is jargon appropriately managed for the target audience?
- Are limitations presented honestly and specifically?

**Ethics & Integrity Reviewer additional focus:**
- Is IRB/ethics approval documented?
- Is informed consent addressed?
- Are conflicts of interest disclosed?
- Are there data integrity concerns?
- Is authorship appropriate (CRediT taxonomy)?
- Are there privacy or data protection issues?

**Computational/Reproducibility Reviewer additional focus:**
- Is code available and documented?
- Are computational methods described sufficiently to reproduce?
- Are software versions and dependencies specified?
- Is there a Data Availability Statement?
- Could an independent researcher reproduce the results?

**Architectural Coherence Reviewer additional focus:**
- For each core claim or design principle stated in the introduction, trace it through the body: is it described consistently in every section where it appears?
- Are component relationships (required vs. optional, core vs. peripheral) stable across all sections? Flag any component that is "foundational" in one section and "optional" in another.
- Does terminology shift meaning between sections? (e.g., a term used as a design principle in §1 but as a feature in §3)
- Are there broken dependency chains — where the paper's conclusions depend on components or capabilities it elsewhere describes as unnecessary or unimplemented?
- Does the abstract's framing match the body's framing for every major claim?
- If the paper proposes an architecture, does the architecture diagram match the textual descriptions? Do labels, arrows, and groupings align with how components are described in prose?

## PHASE 3: REVIEW COMPILATION REPORT

After all reviewer subagents return, compile their reports into a single **Review Compilation Report**:

### Structure

```
# Peer Review Compilation Report

**Paper:** [title]
**Date:** [date]
**Ensemble:** [list of reviewer roles]

## Recommendation Summary

| Reviewer | Role | Recommendation | Confidence |
|----------|------|---------------|------------|
| 1 | ... | ... | ... |
| 2 | ... | ... | ... |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Consensus Recommendation:** [synthesize — what would an editor decide?]

## Convergent Findings
Issues raised by multiple reviewers independently. These carry highest weight.

## Individual Review Reports
[Include each full report, clearly separated]

## Consolidated Issue Tracker

| # | Issue | Severity | Raised By | Location | Category |
|---|-------|----------|-----------|----------|----------|
| 1 | ... | Major/Minor | Reviewer(s) | ... | Methodology/Statistics/Writing/etc. |

## Key Questions for Author
[Deduplicated and prioritized list of all questions from all reviewers]
```

Present this report to the user before proceeding.

---

## PHASE 4: RESPONSE DOCUMENT GENERATION

Generate a **Response Document** that weaves together:
1. The original paper content (relevant excerpts)
2. The reviewer feedback (organized thematically)
3. Specific questions and issues the author must address

### Structure

```
# Response Document: [Paper Title]

## How to Use This Document
This document presents each issue raised during peer review alongside the relevant
paper content and specific questions you must address. Work through each section,
drafting your response. Your responses will form the basis of the revised manuscript
and the formal response letter to reviewers.

---

## Issue 1: [Descriptive Title]

**Severity:** Major / Minor
**Raised by:** [Reviewer role(s)]
**Category:** [Methodology / Statistics / Writing / Literature / Ethics / etc.]

### What the Reviewers Said
[Direct quotes from reviewer reports]

### Relevant Paper Content
[Excerpt from the paper that this issue concerns]

### Questions to Address
1. [Specific question]
2. [Specific question]

### Author Response
[BLANK — for the author to fill in]

### Proposed Revision
[BLANK — for the author to describe what they will change]

---

[Repeat for each issue, ordered by severity then category]

---

## Summary Checklist

| # | Issue | Response Status | Revision Status |
|---|-------|----------------|-----------------|
| 1 | ... | ☐ Drafted | ☐ Implemented |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
```

Write this document to a file and present it to the user.

---

## PHASE 5: WORKING THROUGH RESPONSES

This is interactive. Work with the user (the author) to:

1. Go through each issue in the Response Document sequentially
2. Help the author draft responses to reviewer questions
3. Help the author formulate concrete revisions
4. Fill in the "Author Response" and "Proposed Revision" sections
5. Update the summary checklist as items are addressed

**Guidelines for this phase:**
- Challenge the author if their response doesn't adequately address the reviewer's concern
- Suggest specific text revisions where possible
- Flag when a response requires new analysis, data, or experiments that can't be done in revision
- Note when reviewers may be wrong or unreasonable — not all feedback must be accepted, but it must be addressed
- Help craft diplomatic but substantive responses

When all issues are addressed, confirm with the user before proceeding.

---

## PHASE 6: REVISED PAPER GENERATION

Using the completed Response Document:

1. Apply all agreed revisions to produce a new version of the paper
2. Track changes: for each modification, note which reviewer issue it addresses
3. Generate a **Response Letter** for the reviewers:

```
# Response to Reviewers

**Paper:** [title]
**Revision round:** [1, 2, etc.]

Dear Reviewers,

Thank you for your thorough and constructive review of our manuscript. Below we
address each point raised. Reviewer comments are in **bold**, our responses in
regular text, and changes to the manuscript are noted in *italics*.

---

## Response to Reviewer 1 ([Role])

**[Comment/Question]**

[Author's response]

*[Description of changes made, with location in revised manuscript]*

---

[Repeat for each reviewer and each issue]
```

Write both the revised paper and the response letter to files. Present to the user.

---

## PHASE 7: RE-SUBMISSION TO ENSEMBLE

If the user requests re-review:

1. Provide each reviewer subagent with:
   - The **original paper**
   - Their **original review**
   - The **revised paper**
   - The **response letter** (only the section responding to their review)
2. Each reviewer evaluates whether their concerns have been adequately addressed
3. Each reviewer produces a **second-round review** using a shortened template:

```
## Second-Round Review

**Reviewer Role:** [role]

### Overall Assessment
[Has the revision adequately addressed your concerns?]
**Recommendation:** ACCEPT / MINOR REVISIONS / MAJOR REVISIONS / REJECT

### Previously Raised Issues

| # | Original Issue | Adequately Addressed? | Comments |
|---|---------------|----------------------|----------|
| 1 | ... | Yes / Partially / No | ... |

### New Issues (if any)
[Only issues arising from the revision itself — not new criticisms of the original work]

### Final Recommendation
[Brief justification]
```

4. Compile second-round reviews into an updated compilation report
5. If further revision is needed, return to Phase 4

---

## IMPORTANT PRINCIPLES

- **Independence:** Reviewers must not influence each other. Launch subagents in parallel with no shared context.
- **Constructiveness:** Reviews must be constructive. The goal is to improve the paper, not gatekeep.
- **Specificity:** Every criticism must reference a specific location and include a suggestion. "This is unclear" is insufficient.
- **Honesty:** If a reviewer lacks expertise to evaluate something, they must say so explicitly.
- **Completeness:** Do not skip phases. Do not abbreviate reviews. The user expects thorough, journal-quality feedback.
- **Author agency:** In Phase 5, the author decides what to change. Help them make informed decisions, but don't override their judgment.
