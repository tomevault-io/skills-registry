# Code Review Standards

> **IMPORTANT**: ASSUME the code has already passed tsc and eslint. Do not waste tokens checking for missing semicolons or any types. Focus on logic, user experience, and architecture.

## 1. The "North Star" Check
- **Verification**: Does the code actually fulfill the requirements in `specs/issue_*.md` (or `specs/active_PRD.md`)?
- **Premium Polish**: Does the code include the required premium indicators (Haptics, Skeletons, Loading states) mentioned in the PRD or Project Rules?
- **Visual Uniformity**: Check for inconsistent design tokens (e.g., mismatched backgrounds or fonts across screens). A visual refactor is only complete when applied globally.
- **Scope Creep**: Did the code add unnecessary features not requested in the PRD?

## 2. Technical Compliance
- **Stack Alignment**: Does the code match the tools defined in `specs/tech-stack.md`? (e.g., Don't use `axios` if we decided on `fetch`).
- **Testing**:
  - Do tests exist for the new code?
  - Do the tests follow the `testing-standards` skill?
- **Types/Safety**:
  - Are errors handled gracefully (try/catch)?

## 3. Security & Cleanliness
- **Secrets**: Are there any hardcoded API keys or passwords? (FLAG IMMEDIATELY).
- **Console Logs**: Are there leftover `console.log` statements?
- **Comments**: Are complex logic blocks explained with comments?

## 4. Logic & Architecture
- **DRY Types (The "Single Source" Rule)**: Never duplicate complex type or interface definitions. If a data structure is used in more than one layer (e.g., Service AND Hook), it MUST be defined in `types/schema.ts` and imported.
- **Error Handling**: Every network or DB call MUST have a `try/catch` block or a defined error state in a TanStack query.

## How to Report (Tiered Verification Standard)

**1. Create the Artifact**
- Save the review to `specs/reviews/YYYY-MM-DD-[feature_name].md`.

**2. Categorize Findings**
Group all issues by their Priority Tier (Color Coded):

### 🔴 Critical (Red)
*Blocking Issues. Immediate Fix Required.*
- **Safety Violations**: Missing allergen checks, data leaks between households.
- **Security**: Hardcoded secrets, unvalidated inputs.
- **Crash Risks**: Unhandled errors, infinite loops.

### 🟠 Major (Orange)
*Functional Defects. Must Fix before Merge.*
- **Logic Deviations**: Code does not match the Logic in the Gap Analysis Engine.
- **Failed AC**: Feature does not meet the Binary Acceptance Criteria in the PRD.
- **Performance**: N+1 queries, unoptimized re-renders.

### 🔵 Minor (Cyan)
*Polish & Aesthetics. Fix for v1.0 Quality.*
- **Emerald UI**: Deviations from Design System (spacing, colors, typography).
- **Polish**: Missing haptics, skeleton loaders, or micro-animations.
- **Consistency**: Variable naming, file structure quirks.

**3. Verdict**
- **PASS**: No Critical or Major issues.
- **FAIL**: Any Critical or Major issues present.
