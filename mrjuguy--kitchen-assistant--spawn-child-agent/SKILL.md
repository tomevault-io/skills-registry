description: Spawns a new, independent Claude Code agent process to handle a complex sub-task. This child agent is a full "Main" session and CAN spawn its own sub-agents. Use when this capability is needed.

# `spawn-child-agent`

Use this skill when you have a complex, isolated task that would benefit from a dedicated agent loop, or when you need to delegate work to a specialized sub-agent (like a QA bot or Researcher) in a way that allows *that* sub-agent to further delegate.

## Usage

Execute via the `Bash` tool (run_command). You MUST use the `-p` (headless) flag.

> **CRITICAL**: Do NOT attempt to spawn an agent using the `browser_subagent` tool. That tool is for browser automation only and cannot spawn child agents. You MUST use the `claude` CLI via `run_command`. If you are about to use `browser_subagent` to spawn a child agent, STOP and use `run_command` instead.

```bash
claude -p "Your detailed instructions for the child agent here" \
  --allowedTools "Bash,Read,Grep,Glob,find_by_name,view_file,write_to_file,replace_file_content" \
  --model "sonnet" \
  --output-format json
```

## Critical Flags

*   **`-p` / `--print`**: Runs non-interactive. Required.
*   **`--allowedTools`**: Pre-authorizes tools. **CRITICAL**: Use the exact internal tool names (e.g., `write_to_file`, NOT `Edit`). If you do not include this, the child agent will hang.
*   **`--output-format json`**: Allows you (the parent agent) to parse the result programmatically.

## Sub-Agent Permission & Reliability Rules
1. **The Write Wall**: Sub-agents running with `-p` may still fail to write files if they encounter a confirmation prompt they cannot bypass. 
2. **Verification (Mandatory)**: After a sub-agent completes a task that involves writing files (like `scribe` or `qa-bot`), the parent agent **MUST** run `git status` or `view_file` to verify the changes were actually applied.
3. **Takeover Protocol**: If the sub-agent reports that it "prepared content" but "couldn't write due to permissions", the parent agent **MUST** immediately read that prepared content from the sub-agent's output and apply the changes manually using its own tools. Do not ask the user for help unless the parent also fails.

## Example: Spawning a Specialized Worker

If you want the child to use a specific sub-agent (e.g., `qa-bot`):

```bash
claude -p "Use the qa-bot subagent to verify the recent changes in src/utils.ts" \
  --allowedTools "Bash,Read" \
  --agent "qa-bot"
```
*(Note: Agents MUST be located in `.claude/agents/` to be discoverable by the CLI. Do not put them in `.agent/agents/`.)*
