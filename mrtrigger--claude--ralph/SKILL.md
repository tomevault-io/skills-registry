# Ralph Feature Setup

Interactive feature planning that creates task lists with dependencies for autonomous execution.

---

## The Job

**Three modes:**

### Mode 1: From PRD
1. Read the PRD file (user stories become tasks)
2. Convert user stories to executable tasks with dependencies
3. Create progress.txt
4. Hand off to build-feature skill for execution

### Mode 2: New Feature (no PRD)
1. Chat through the feature - Ask clarifying questions
2. Break into small tasks - Each completable in one iteration
3. Create progress.txt - With tasks and dependencies
4. Hand off to build-feature skill for execution

### Mode 3: Existing Tasks
1. Load existing progress.txt
2. Verify structure - Check tasks have proper dependencies
3. Show status - Which tasks are ready, completed, blocked
4. Hand off to build-feature skill for execution

**Ask the user which mode they need:**
```
Are you:
1. Using a PRD (give me the path, e.g., /tasks/prd-feature-name.md)
2. Starting fresh (I'll ask questions to plan the feature)
3. Continuing existing tasks (I'll load progress.txt)
```

---

## Mode 1: From PRD

If the user provides a PRD path (or is coming from the prd skill):

### Read and parse the PRD:
```bash
cat /tasks/prd-[feature-name].md
```

### Convert user stories to tasks:

Each **User Story** in the PRD becomes one or more tasks:
- US-001 → Task(s) for that story
- The acceptance criteria become the task's `Acceptance:` field
- Order tasks by dependency (schema → backend → UI → tests)

**Example conversion:**
```
PRD User Story:
### US-002: Display priority indicator on task cards
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Each task card shows colored priority badge
- [ ] npm run typecheck passes
- [ ] Verify in browser

Becomes task:
- [ ] Display priority indicator on task cards
  Description: Add colored priority badge to task cards (red=high, yellow=medium, gray=low)
  Files: src/components/TaskCard.tsx
  Depends: Add priority field to database
  Acceptance: npm run typecheck passes, verify badge renders in browser
```

### Skip the clarifying questions
The PRD already has the answers. Go directly to creating progress.txt with the converted tasks.

---

## Mode 2: New Feature (No PRD)

If no PRD exists, gather requirements through conversation.

### Step 1: Understand the Feature

Start by asking the user about their feature. Don't assume - ASK:

```
What feature are you building?
```

Then ask clarifying questions:
- What's the user-facing goal?
- What parts of the codebase will this touch? (database, UI, API, etc.)
- Are there any existing patterns to follow?
- What should it look like when done?

**Keep asking until you have enough detail to break it into tasks.**

---

## Step 2: Break Into Tasks

**Each task must be completable in ONE iteration (~one context window).**

Each iteration spawns a fresh subagent with no memory of previous work. If a task is too big, the agent runs out of context before finishing.

### Right-sized tasks:
- Add a database column + migration
- Create a single UI component
- Implement one server action
- Add a filter to an existing list
- Write tests for one module

### Too big (split these):
- "Build the entire dashboard" → Split into: schema, queries, components, filters
- "Add authentication" → Split into: schema, middleware, login UI, session handling
- "Refactor the API" → Split into one task per endpoint

**Rule of thumb:** If you can't describe the change in 2-3 sentences, it's too big.

---

## Step 3: Order by Dependencies

Tasks execute based on `Depends:` field. Earlier tasks must complete before dependent ones start.

**Typical order:**
1. Schema/database changes (migrations)
2. Server actions / backend logic
3. UI components that use the backend
4. Integration / E2E tests

Express dependencies like this:
```
Task 1: Schema (Depends: none)
Task 2: Server action (Depends: Schema task)
Task 3: UI component (Depends: Server action task)
Task 4: Tests (Depends: UI component task)
```

Parallel tasks that don't depend on each other can share the same dependency.

---

## Step 4: Create progress.txt

Create the file at `scripts/build-feature-loop/progress.txt`:

```markdown
# Build Progress Log
Started: [today's date]
Feature: [feature name]

## Codebase Patterns
(Patterns discovered during this feature build)

---

## Tasks

- [ ] Task 1 title
  Description: Detailed description of what to do
  Files: path/to/file1.ts, path/to/file2.ts
  Depends: none
  Acceptance: npm run typecheck passes

- [ ] Task 2 title
  Description: What to implement
  Files: src/components/Thing.tsx
  Depends: Task 1 title
  Acceptance: npm run typecheck passes, component renders

- [ ] Task 3 title
  Description: What to do
  Files: src/api/endpoint.ts
  Depends: Task 1 title
  Acceptance: npm run typecheck passes, npm test passes

- [ ] Task 4 title
  Description: What to implement
  Files: src/tests/feature.test.ts
  Depends: Task 2 title, Task 3 title
  Acceptance: npm test passes

---

## Completed Work
(Entries added as tasks complete)
```

### Task format:

```markdown
- [ ] Short descriptive title
  Description: Detailed description with what to implement
  Files: comma-separated list of files to create or modify
  Depends: none | Task title | Task A, Task B (comma-separated)
  Acceptance: Specific verifiable criteria
```

**Dependency rules:**
- `Depends: none` - Can start immediately
- `Depends: Task A` - Blocked until Task A is `[x]`
- `Depends: Task A, Task B` - Blocked until ALL listed tasks are `[x]`

---

## Step 5: Archive Previous Progress (if needed)

Before creating new progress.txt, check if one exists:

```bash
cat scripts/build-feature-loop/progress.txt
```

**Archive if:**
- It has completed tasks from a previous feature
- The previous feature is different from the current one

**Archive command:**
```bash
DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
FEATURE="previous-feature-name"
mkdir -p scripts/build-feature-loop/archive/$DATE-$FEATURE
mv scripts/build-feature-loop/progress.txt scripts/build-feature-loop/archive/$DATE-$FEATURE/
```

**Preserve useful Codebase Patterns** - Copy any relevant patterns to the new progress.txt.

---

## Step 6: Confirm Setup & Sync TodoWrite

After creating progress.txt:

1. **Update TodoWrite** to show the user the task list
2. **Show summary:**

```
Feature ready for autonomous execution!

**Feature:** [name]

**Tasks:**
1. [ ] Task 1 - no dependencies (READY)
2. [ ] Task 2 - depends on #1
3. [ ] Task 3 - depends on #1
4. [ ] Task 4 - depends on #2, #3
...

**Ready to start:** [count] tasks
**Blocked:** [count] tasks (waiting on dependencies)

**To run:** Invoke the build-feature skill to start the execution loop.
```

---

## Mode 2: Continuing Existing Tasks

If the user has an existing progress.txt:

### Load and parse:

```bash
cat scripts/build-feature-loop/progress.txt
```

### Show status:

Count tasks by status:
- `[ ]` with `Depends: none` or all dependencies `[x]` → Ready
- `[ ]` with unmet dependencies → Blocked
- `[x]` → Completed

```
**Current Status:**
- Completed: 3 tasks
- Ready to work: 2 tasks
- Blocked: 5 tasks (waiting on dependencies)

**Next task to execute:**
[Task title] - [brief description]

**To continue:** Invoke the build-feature skill.
```

### Fix issues if needed:

If tasks are missing dependencies or have circular dependencies, offer to fix:
```
These tasks don't have dependencies set. Should I:
1. Add dependencies based on logical order?
2. Leave them parallel (any ready task can be picked)?
```

---

## Task Description Guidelines

Write descriptions that a future iteration can pick up without context:

```markdown
- [ ] Create expense upsert tool skeleton
  Description: Create upsert-expense.ts with Zod schema matching upsert-income.ts pattern. Include action enum (create/update/delete/list), expense fields (description, amount, category, date).
  Files: workflows/tools/upsert-expense.ts
  Depends: none
  Acceptance: npm run typecheck passes, file exports tool definition
```

### Good acceptance criteria (verifiable):
- "Add `investorType` column to investor table with default 'cold'"
- "Filter dropdown has options: All, Cold, Friend"
- "npm run typecheck passes"
- "npm test -- path/to/test.ts passes"

### Bad acceptance criteria (vague):
- "Works correctly"
- "Good UX"
- "Handles edge cases"

### Always include:
```
npm run typecheck passes
```

### For tasks with testable logic:
```
npm test passes
```

### For UI/browser tasks:

**For functional testing** (checking behavior):
```
Use browser_snapshot to verify page content
```

**For visual testing** (checking appearance):
```
Use browser_take_screenshot to verify visual appearance
```

## Example Conversation

**User:** set up ralph for adding expense tracking to the legal agent

**Assistant:** What feature are you building?

**User:** I want Grace (our legal chat agent) to be able to create, update, and delete expenses when users mention them in conversation.

**Assistant:** Got it - an expense upsert tool for the legal agent. A few questions:

1. Are there existing tools in the legal agent I should follow as a pattern?
2. Do expenses have different types (family vs child)?
3. Should it also list expenses or just CRUD?
4. Any task completion logic needed?

**User:** Follow upsert-income.ts. Yes family and child expenses (different tables). Yes list too. Mark APP_EXPENSES_ENTERED task complete.

**Assistant:** Perfect. Here's my proposed breakdown:

1. **Create tool skeleton** - Zod schema, basic structure (no deps)
2. **Category mapping** - Map names to category IDs (depends: #1)
3. **Amount parsing** - Handle currency formats (depends: #1)
4. **Duplicate detection** - Check before creating (depends: #1)
5. **Create family expenses** - Insert into expense table (depends: #2, #3, #4)
6. **Create child expenses** - Insert into child_expense (depends: #5)
7. **Update action** - Modify existing expenses (depends: #6)
8. **Delete action** - Remove expenses (depends: #6)
9. **List action** - Show all expenses with totals (depends: #6)
10. **Task completion** - Mark APP_EXPENSES_ENTERED done (depends: #9)
11. **Register tool** - Add to legal chat workflow (depends: #10)
12. **Unit tests** - Test helper functions (depends: #11)
13. **E2E tests** - Test via chat interface (depends: #12)

Does this look right? Any tasks to add or remove?

**User:** Looks good, create the tasks

**Assistant:** [Creates progress.txt with all tasks, updates TodoWrite]

Feature ready for autonomous execution!

**Feature:** Legal Agent Expense Upsert Tool

**Tasks:** 13 tasks created
**Ready to start:** 1 task (Create tool skeleton)
**Blocked:** 12 tasks (waiting on dependencies)

**To run:** Invoke the build-feature skill to start the loop.
