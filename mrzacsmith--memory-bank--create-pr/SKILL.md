# Create PR Skill

Create well-documented pull requests that are easy to review and merge.

## Process

### 1. Verify Branch State

```bash
# Check current branch
git branch --show-current

# Ensure all changes are committed
git status

# View commits that will be in the PR
git log main..HEAD --oneline
```

### 2. Push to Remote

```bash
# Push and set upstream
git push -u origin feature/my-feature
```

### 3. Review Changes

Before creating the PR, understand what you're submitting:

```bash
# See all changes vs main branch
git diff main...HEAD

# List changed files
git diff main...HEAD --name-only

# View commit history
git log main..HEAD
```

### 4. Create the Pull Request

```bash
gh pr create --title "feat: add user authentication" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'

- Split large features into multiple PRs
- One logical change per PR

### Title Format
Follow conventional commit style:
- `feat: add user dashboard`
- `fix: resolve cart duplication bug`
- `refactor: extract payment logic to service`

### Description Quality
- Explain WHY, not just WHAT
- Link to related issues/discussions
- Include testing instructions
- Add screenshots for UI changes

### Before Requesting Review
- Self-review your own diff first
- Ensure CI passes
- Resolve any merge conflicts
- Remove WIP commits (squash if needed)
