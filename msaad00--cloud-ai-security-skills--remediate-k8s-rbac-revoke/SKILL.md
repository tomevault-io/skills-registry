# remediate-k8s-rbac-revoke

## What this closes

Pair skill for [`detect-privilege-escalation-k8s`](../../detection/detect-privilege-escalation-k8s/) — specifically rule **`r3-rbac-self-grant`** (T1098: Account Manipulation). That rule is the only one in the detection bundle that hands the responder an unambiguous binding to revoke; the others identify an actor and an effect (token grant, pod exec, secret enum) but not a single binding the operator can safely delete.

This is the second Kubernetes **detect → act → audit → re-verify** loop in the repo, after [`remediate-container-escape-k8s`](../remediate-container-escape-k8s/). It lifts the same dual-audit, dry-run-default, deny-list, and incident-ID-gated `--apply` harness.

## Scope honesty

| Source finding | Coverage |
|---|---|
| `detect-privilege-escalation-k8s` rule `r3-rbac-self-grant` | **Direct revocation** — detector emits `binding.type` + `binding.name`; we revoke that binding |
| `detect-privilege-escalation-k8s` rules `r1-secret-enum`, `r2-pod-exec`, `r4-token-self-grant` | **Skipped with pointer** — no specific binding in the finding; we emit `skipped_no_binding_pointer` and tell the operator to triage manually |
| `detect-sensitive-secret-read-k8s` (any rule) | **Skipped with pointer** — same reason; this skill does not consume that producer at all (`ACCEPTED_PRODUCERS` enforces it) |

A future PR can add a discovery mode (`--discover-bindings-for-actor=NAME`) that lists all RoleBindings + ClusterRoleBindings whose `subjects[]` reference an actor and emits a triage manifest. Discovery mode is intentionally out of scope here because it adds a large API surface (cluster-wide LIST + filter) and needs its own design pass on least-privilege scoping.

## Inputs

Reads one or more OCSF 1.8 Detection Finding (class 2004) JSONL records from stdin or a file path. Required observables:

- `actor.name` (used for audit context only)
- `binding.type` — must be `rolebindings` or `clusterrolebindings`
- `binding.name`
- `namespace` — required for `rolebindings`; ignored for `clusterrolebindings`
- `rule` (used for audit context only)

Findings missing `binding.type` or `binding.name` are emitted as skip records with `status: skipped_no_binding_pointer`.

## Outputs

JSONL records on stdout. Three record types:

- `remediation_plan` — under dry-run (default); shows the exact `DELETE` endpoint and the deny-list outcome
- `remediation_action` — under `--apply`; carries `audit.row_uid` + `audit.s3_evidence_uri` from the dual write
- `remediation_verification` — under `--reverify`; reports `verified` (binding gone) or `drift` (binding still present)

## Guardrails (enforced in code — not just docs)

| Layer | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| Source check | `ACCEPTED_PRODUCERS = {"detect-privilege-escalation-k8s"}` — any finding from a different producer is logged and skipped |
| Protected namespaces | Default deny-list: `kube-system`, `kube-public`, `istio-system`, `linkerd*` (see `DEFAULT_DENY_NAMESPACES`); applies to `rolebindings` only (ClusterRoleBindings are namespace-less) |
| Protected binding names | Any binding whose name starts with `system:` is denied (`DEFAULT_DENY_BINDING_PREFIXES`) — keeps `system:masters`, `system:basic-user`, `system:public-info-viewer`, etc. out of revocation scope |
| Apply gate | `--apply` requires `K8S_RBAC_REVOKE_INCIDENT_ID` + `K8S_RBAC_REVOKE_APPROVER` env vars — set out-of-band by the responder, not by the agent |
| Cluster boundary | `--apply` also requires `K8S_CLUSTER_NAME` and `K8S_RBAC_REVOKE_ALLOWED_CLUSTERS`; the active cluster must be allow-listed explicitly before a delete can run |
| Audit | Dual write (DynamoDB + KMS-encrypted S3) BEFORE and AFTER the delete; failure paths still write the failure audit row |
| Re-verify | `--reverify` confirms the binding is no longer present; emits `drift` if the binding came back |

## Run

```bash
# Dry-run plan (default)
python skills/remediation/remediate-k8s-rbac-revoke/src/handler.py findings.ocsf.jsonl

# Apply (after out-of-band approval)
export K8S_RBAC_REVOKE_INCIDENT_ID=INC-2026-04-19-001
export K8S_RBAC_REVOKE_APPROVER=alice@security
export K8S_CLUSTER_NAME=prod-eks-us-east-1
export K8S_RBAC_REVOKE_ALLOWED_CLUSTERS=prod-eks-us-east-1
export K8S_REMEDIATION_AUDIT_DYNAMODB_TABLE=k8s-remediation-audit
export K8S_REMEDIATION_AUDIT_BUCKET=acme-k8s-audit
export KMS_KEY_ARN=arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:111122223333:key/...
python skills/remediation/remediate-k8s-rbac-revoke/src/handler.py findings.ocsf.jsonl --apply

# Re-verify (read-only)
python skills/remediation/remediate-k8s-rbac-revoke/src/handler.py findings.ocsf.jsonl --reverify
```

## Non-goals

- Discover bindings for an arbitrary actor (planned, separate issue)
- Edit binding subjects in place (delete-only — partial edits introduce more failure modes)
- Recreate the binding after a window — this skill is a one-way revocation
- Cross-cluster propagation — operates on a single API server target
- Acting against whichever cluster ambient kubeconfig happens to point at — `--apply` now fails closed unless the active cluster name is allow-listed explicitly
