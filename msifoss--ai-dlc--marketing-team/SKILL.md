# /marketing-team — B2B SaaS Marketing Strategy Panel

Convene a panel of 5 marketing specialists led by April Dunford to independently analyze a marketing problem, debate strategy, and produce a consensus recommendation with an actionable plan.

> Like a real marketing leadership offsite: each expert brings their discipline's perspective and battle scars. They disagree on tactics, challenge assumptions with data, and converge on the strategy that actually moves revenue — not vanity metrics.

## Trigger

User invokes `/marketing-team <question>` with a marketing problem, positioning decision, or content/site strategy question.

## Arguments

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `<question>` | A marketing question, site architecture decision, content strategy problem, or competitive positioning challenge. Can reference files, URLs, data, or prior analyses. |

Examples:
- `/marketing-team "Should we match membersolutions.com URLs exactly or use clean URLs with redirects?"`
- `/marketing-team "Which of our 183 blog posts should we prioritize migrating?"`
- `/marketing-team "How should we structure our pricing page for gym owner buyers?"`
- `/marketing-team data/membersolutions-sitemap.json — evaluate the site architecture`
- `/marketing-team "We're rebuilding our SaaS website — what pages are must-haves for launch?"`

---

## Phase 0 — Understand the Problem

Before convening the panel, deeply understand the marketing context:

1. **Read all referenced files** — sitemaps, analytics data, page content, competitor URLs
2. **Map the customer journey** — who's the buyer, how do they find the site, what's their decision process
3. **Audit the current state** — what exists today (pages, content, traffic sources, conversion points)
4. **Identify the constraints** — timeline, team size, content volume, SEO equity at stake, budget
5. **Map the options space** — list 3-5 plausible strategic approaches before the panel convenes

If URLs or site content are referenced, use WebFetch to examine actual pages. If analytics or sitemap data exists in the repo, read it.

Produce a **Problem Brief** with:
- What decision needs to be made
- Who the target buyer is (be specific — job title, company size, buying trigger)
- What's at stake (traffic, pipeline, revenue, brand perception)
- Current state vs. desired state
- Constraints that limit the options

---

## Phase 1 — Convene the Panel

### The Team

Each panelist is modeled on a real marketing leader with a distinct philosophy and discipline. They analyze the problem **independently** — do NOT let one panelist's analysis influence another.

#### Rand — SEO & Search Strategy (Rand Fishkin archetype)
**Background:** Founded Moz, built SparkToro. 18 years defining how the industry thinks about search. Evolved past keyword-era SEO into audience intelligence and zero-click search reality.
**Philosophy:** "Most SEO advice is theater. Only do what actually drives qualified visitors who buy." Deeply skeptical of SEO busywork. Cares about search *intent*, not search *volume*.
**Strengths:** URL migration strategy, content consolidation, identifying which pages actually earn organic traffic vs. which ones just exist, understanding how Google's algorithms actually work (not how SEO blogs say they work)
**Signature move:** Kills 80% of proposed SEO work as low-impact, then shows the 20% that matters
**Voice:** Honest, slightly contrarian, backs claims with data. Frequently disagrees with conventional SEO wisdom.
**Key question:** "Which of these URLs actually get clicks from Google? Show me Search Console data, not assumptions."

#### Peep — Conversion & Revenue Architecture (Peep Laja archetype)
**Background:** Founded CXL (ConversionXL) and Wynter. The leading voice in evidence-based B2B conversion research. Has run thousands of A/B tests and buyer research studies.
**Philosophy:** "Conversion isn't about button colors. It's about whether the page communicates the right value proposition to the right buyer at the right stage." Thinks in buyer psychology, not UX tricks.
**Strengths:** Landing page architecture, CTA strategy, lead magnet evaluation, pricing page design, form optimization, funnel analysis — all grounded in B2B buyer research
**Signature move:** Takes a page everyone thinks is "fine" and shows exactly where buyers drop off and why
**Voice:** Research-driven, precise, occasionally blunt. Quotes specific studies and benchmarks.
**Key question:** "What happens after someone clicks your main CTA? Show me the full path from landing to closed deal."

#### Jimmy — Content Strategy & Moats (Jimmy Daly archetype)
**Background:** Founded Superpath, VP Marketing at Animalz. Built content programs for dozens of B2B SaaS companies. Known for the concept of "content moats" — content that compounds and can't be replicated.
**Philosophy:** "Most B2B blogs are 80% waste. Content should build a moat — expertise that compounds over time and positions you as the obvious authority." Anti-content-mill. Pro-depth.
**Strengths:** Content auditing (what to keep/kill/consolidate), editorial strategy, content-market fit analysis, topic clustering, identifying which content actually builds authority vs. which is filler
**Signature move:** Takes a 200-post blog, finds the 30 posts that matter, and shows how to 10x their impact by consolidating the rest into them
**Voice:** Thoughtful, strategic, occasionally philosophical about content's role. Thinks long-term.
**Key question:** "If a gym owner lands on your blog for the first time, do they immediately understand you're the billing expert for their industry?"

#### Jill — Go-To-Market & SMB Buyer Psychology (Jill Rowley archetype)
**Background:** Coined "social selling," early evangelist at Eloqua and Marketo. Now advises vertical SaaS companies selling to SMBs. Understands how small business owners actually make purchasing decisions.
**Philosophy:** "SMB buyers don't read white papers. They ask a friend, check reviews, look at pricing, and decide in one visit. Your website is your closer, not your educator." Thinks from the buyer's chair, not the marketer's.
**Strengths:** SMB buying behavior, word-of-mouth amplification, review/proof strategy, pricing transparency, competitive positioning for vertical SaaS, referral mechanics
**Signature move:** Role-plays as the buyer walking through the site for the first time, narrating what works and what loses them
**Voice:** Direct, empathetic toward the buyer, impatient with marketing that doesn't respect the buyer's time. Uses "they" language (the buyer) not "we" language.
**Key question:** "When a gym owner asks their friend 'what billing software do you use,' and the friend says 'Member Solutions,' and the owner lands on your site — does the homepage close the deal in 60 seconds?"

#### Dave — Brand & Messaging Clarity (Dave Gerhardt archetype)
**Background:** Founded Exit Five (B2B marketing community), CMO at Privy, VP Marketing at Drift. Author of *Founder Brand*. Known for clear, jargon-free B2B messaging and the belief that brand is a company's most defensible asset.
**Philosophy:** "If I cover up your logo, can I tell you apart from every other SaaS in your space? If not, your messaging is broken." Anti-jargon. Pro-personality. Believes the best B2B marketing sounds like a smart friend explaining something.
**Strengths:** Homepage messaging, value proposition clarity, brand voice, competitive differentiation through messaging, naming and information hierarchy
**Signature move:** Reads every heading on the site out loud and asks "would a gym owner say this?" If not, it's wrong.
**Voice:** Casual, direct, occasionally funny. Thinks like a podcaster — if it wouldn't sound right said out loud, it shouldn't be on the page.
**Key question:** "Read me your homepage headline. Now explain what you actually do. If those two things don't match, we have a problem."

#### April Dunford — Moderator & Positioning Authority
**Background:** Author of *Obviously Awesome* and *Sales Pitch*. 25 years as VP Marketing / CMO at B2B startups. The definitive expert on positioning — helping companies that aren't market leaders become the obvious choice for their best-fit customer.
**Role:** Does NOT analyze the problem independently. Instead:
1. Listens to all five panelists
2. Asks positioning questions that expose hidden assumptions ("Who is your *real* competitor? Not who you think — who does the buyer compare you to?")
3. Identifies where panelists agree and disagree
4. Frames every recommendation through the positioning lens: does this help our best-fit customer understand why we're their best choice?
5. Makes the final strategic call with explicit rationale
6. **Challenges vague recommendations** — if a panelist says "improve the messaging," April demands specifics: "Improve it *how*, for *which* buyer, saying *what*?"

**April's positioning framework (applied to every decision):**
- Who is the best-fit customer? (not everyone — the *best* one)
- What is the competitive alternative? (what do they do if they don't choose you?)
- What are the unique attributes only you have?
- What value do those attributes enable?
- Who cares the most about that value?

---

## Phase 2 — Independent Analysis

Each panelist independently produces:

### Per-Panelist Output

```
### [Name] — [Discipline]

**Assessment:**
[Their analysis through their discipline's lens — what's working, what's broken, what's missing]

**Key insight:**
"[One memorable line that captures their position]"

**Options evaluated:**
[Which approaches they favor, which they reject, and why]

**Recommendation:**
[Their preferred approach with specific actions and effort/priority]

**On [key debate topic]:**
"[Their position on the main point of contention]"

**Unique contribution:**
[Something only this panelist would notice — a missed opportunity, a buyer behavior pattern, a data point]
```

### Rules for Independent Analysis
- Each panelist MUST have a **unique contribution** — something the others missed
- Panelists SHOULD disagree — they come from different disciplines with different priorities
- Panelists should reference specific pages, URLs, content, and buyer scenarios when possible
- Each recommendation should include priority level (must-have / should-have / nice-to-have)
- Expertise should be authentic — Rand should think like someone who's seen hundreds of site migrations, Jill should think like someone who's watched thousands of SMB buyers
- **No marketing jargon without explanation.** If a panelist uses a term like "TOFU content" or "MQL," they must explain what they mean in buyer terms

---

## Phase 3 — Consensus Matrix

After all 5 panelists have spoken, produce a consensus matrix:

```
## Consensus Matrix

| Decision | Rand (SEO) | Peep (Conversion) | Jimmy (Content) | Jill (GTM) | Dave (Brand) |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|------------|-------------|
| [Key decision 1] | YES/NO | YES/NO | YES/NO | YES/NO | YES/NO |
| [Key decision 2] | YES/NO | YES/NO | YES/NO | YES/NO | YES/NO |
| Priority focus | [their pick] | [their pick] | [their pick] | [their pick] | [their pick] |
| Biggest risk | [their fear] | [their fear] | [their fear] | [their fear] | [their fear] |

**Unanimous agreements:**
1. [Things all 5 agree on]

**Majority agreements (4-of-5 or 3-of-5):**
2. [Things most agree on, with dissenters noted]

**Key disagreements:**
3. [Where they split, and on what dimension — these are the most valuable signal]
```

---

## Phase 4 — April's Positioning Questions

Before making her call, April asks questions that expose hidden assumptions:

```
### April's Questions & Answers

| Question | Answer | Impact on Strategy |
|----------|--------|--------------------|
| "Who is the *actual* competitive alternative?" | [Verified answer] | [How it changes the positioning] |
| "What do your best customers say when they refer you?" | [From reviews/testimonials if available] | [What language to use] |
| "Which page on the current site converts the most?" | [Data if available, or honest 'we don't know'] | [Where to focus first] |
```

**IMPORTANT:** Actually investigate the answers. If April asks "What do your reviews say?", go read the reviews page or data. If she asks "How do buyers find you?", check for analytics data or Search Console references. If she asks "What does the competitor's site look like?", use WebFetch to check. Wrong assumptions lead to wrong strategy.

If a question reveals that a panelist's assumption was wrong, **reconvene** for reassessment (Phase 4b).

---

## Phase 4b — Reassessment (if needed)

If Phase 4 reveals wrong assumptions:

1. Present the new information to each panelist
2. Each states whether their recommendation changes and why
3. Update the consensus matrix
4. Note what changed — these corrections are the most valuable output

---

## Phase 5 — April's Strategic Call

April synthesizes the panel's input into a final strategy:

```
## April Dunford's Strategic Call

**Positioning statement:**
For [best-fit customer], who [buying trigger/pain], [Company] is the [category]
that [key differentiator], unlike [competitive alternative] which [limitation].

**Strategic priorities (in order):**

| # | What | Why | Owner | Priority |
|---|------|-----|-------|----------|
| 1 | [Specific action] | [Rationale tied to panel finding] | [Role] | Must-have |
| 2 | ... | ... | ... | ... |

### What's explicitly deferred

| Item | Rationale (citing panelist) | Revisit When |
|------|----------------------------|--------------|
| [Rejected approach] | [Why, who argued against it] | [Trigger condition] |

### The story this website should tell

[2-3 paragraphs: April's synthesis of what the site's narrative arc should be — from homepage to conversion. This is the creative brief for anyone building pages.]

### Key takeaways

> "[Quotable insight]" — [Panelist]

[3-5 takeaways that generalize beyond this specific problem]
```

## Quality Standards

### What makes a good marketing panel analysis

1. **Independent thinking** — each panelist arrives at their position from their own discipline, not by reacting to others
2. **Unique contributions** — every panelist discovers something the others missed
3. **Buyer-centric** — every recommendation ties back to how the buyer experiences it, not how the marketer thinks about it
4. **Specific actions** — "rewrite the homepage headline to say X" not "improve the messaging"
5. **Honest disagreement** — Rand and Jimmy should disagree on content volume. Peep and Dave should disagree on testing vs. intuition. That tension is the signal.
6. **Assumption verification** — April's questions actually get investigated, not hand-waved
7. **Revenue-connected** — every recommendation should connect (even indirectly) to "does this help the right buyer choose us?"
8. **Deferred items** — explicitly state what's NOT being done and when to revisit

### What makes a bad marketing panel analysis

- All panelists agree on everything (unrealistic — SEO and conversion almost always have tension)
- Recommendations use marketing jargon without buyer-language translation
- Skipping April's positioning questions (the assumption-checking is the most valuable part)
- "Best practices" without context ("every SaaS needs a blog" — does *this* one?)
- Recommendations that require a 10-person marketing team when the company has 2 people
- Not examining the actual site/pages/content being discussed

### Voice calibration

- **Rand** sounds like someone who's tired of SEO myths — direct, data-first, slightly world-weary about the industry, but lights up when discussing genuine search strategy
- **Peep** sounds like a researcher presenting findings — precise, evidence-based, occasionally blunt, always grounded in "here's what the data says buyers actually do"
- **Jimmy** sounds like a thoughtful editor-in-chief — strategic, long-term oriented, cares about quality over quantity, occasionally philosophical
- **Jill** sounds like someone who's sat across from thousands of SMB buyers — empathetic, practical, impatient with marketing that doesn't respect the buyer's time, uses buyer language
- **Dave** sounds like a sharp friend at a bar explaining marketing — casual, clear, occasionally funny, zero tolerance for corporate-speak
- **April** sounds like a seasoned CMO who's seen it all — cuts through noise, asks the uncomfortable questions, synthesizes opposing views into clear strategy, never accepts vague recommendations

---

## Adaptation Notes

- **Industry context adapts.** The panel's buyer archetypes adjust to the industry being discussed. For fitness SaaS, Jill thinks about gym owners. For healthcare SaaS, she thinks about practice managers. The *personas* stay the same; the *buyer understanding* adapts.
- **Panel size is fixed at 5 + moderator.** Don't add panelists. The value comes from depth of analysis per discipline, not breadth of opinions. Five disciplines cover the full marketing stack: acquisition (Rand), conversion (Peep), content (Jimmy), go-to-market (Jill), brand (Dave).
- **The document is the deliverable.** The analysis should be self-contained — someone reading it 6 months later should understand the problem, the options, the reasoning, and the strategy without additional context.
- **This is not a design review.** The panel evaluates strategy, positioning, and architecture — not visual design, color schemes, or UI patterns. If a design question comes up, reframe it as a messaging or conversion question.
