# Jujutsu Commit and Push

Commit and push workflow for Jujutsu version control.

## Workflow

When user requests to commit and push:

1. Review changes with `jj status` and `jj diff`
2. Draft one-sentence commit message describing changes
3. Use AskUserQuestion to confirm commit message
4. Get current bookmark with `bash ~/dotfiles/skills/jj/scripts/get-bookmark.sh`
5. Run `bash ~/dotfiles/skills/jj/scripts/commit-and-push.sh "<message>" "<bookmark>"`
6. Script will commit, set bookmark on @-, and prompt for push confirmation

## Scripts

### get-bookmark.sh

Find bookmark on current or parent revisions.

```bash
bash ~/dotfiles/skills/jj/scripts/get-bookmark.sh
```

Returns bookmark name or exits with error if none found.

### commit-and-push.sh

Commit, set bookmark, and push.

```bash
bash ~/dotfiles/skills/jj/scripts/commit-and-push.sh "commit message" "bookmark-name"
```

Workflow:
1. Commits with provided message
2. Sets bookmark to @- (parent revision)
3. Prompts user to confirm push
4. Pushes bookmark to remote if confirmed

## Notes

Per user preferences:
- Bookmark names prefix with `mt/`
- Include issue number if available: `mt/7446/fix-bugs`
- Do not add "Generated with Claude" or "Co-Authored-By Claude" to commits
