Random fixes waste time and create new bugs. Quick patches mask underlying issues.

**Core principle:** ALWAYS find root cause before attempting fixes. Symptom fixes are failure.

# The Iron Law

```
NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST
```

If you haven't completed Phase 1, you cannot propose fixes.

# The Four Phases

## Phase 1: Root Cause Investigation

**BEFORE attempting ANY fix:**

1. **Read Error Messages Carefully**
   - Read stack traces completely
   - Note line numbers, file paths, error codes
   - They often contain the exact solution

2. **Reproduce Consistently**
   - Can you trigger it reliably?
   - Exact steps? Every time?
   - If not reproducible → gather more data, don't guess

3. **Check Recent Changes**
   - Git diff, recent commits
   - New dependencies, config changes
   - Environmental differences

4. **Gather Evidence in Multi-Component Systems**

   For each component boundary:
   - Log what data enters component
   - Log what data exits component
   - Verify environment/config propagation
   - Check state at each layer

   Run once to gather evidence showing WHERE it breaks
   THEN analyze evidence to identify failing component

5. **Trace Data Flow**
   - Where does bad value originate?
   - What called this with bad value?
   - Keep tracing up until you find the source
   - Fix at source, not at symptom

## Phase 2: Pattern Analysis

1. **Find Working Examples**
   - Locate similar working code in same codebase
   - What works that's similar to what's broken?

2. **Compare Against References**
   - If implementing pattern, read reference implementation COMPLETELY
   - Don't skim - understand the pattern fully

3. **Identify Differences**
   - What's different between working and broken?
   - Don't assume "that can't matter"

## Phase 3: Hypothesis and Testing

1. **Form Single Hypothesis**
   - State clearly: "I think X is the root cause because Y"
   - Be specific, not vague

2. **Test Minimally**
   - SMALLEST possible change to test hypothesis
   - One variable at a time
   - Don't fix multiple things at once

3. **Verify Before Continuing**
   - Did it work? Yes → Phase 4
   - Didn't work? Form NEW hypothesis
   - DON'T add more fixes on top

## Phase 4: Implementation

1. **Create Failing Test Case**
   - Use the autonome:use-tdd skill
   - Simplest possible reproduction
   - MUST have before fixing

2. **Implement Single Fix**
   - Address the root cause identified
   - ONE change at a time
   - No "while I'm here" improvements

3. **Verify Fix**
   - Test passes now?
   - No other tests broken?
   - Issue actually resolved?

4. **If Fix Doesn't Work**
   - STOP
   - Count: How many fixes have you tried?
   - If < 3: Return to Phase 1, re-analyze
   - **If ≥ 3: STOP and question the architecture**
   - DON'T attempt Fix #4 without discussion

5. **If 3+ Fixes Failed: Question Architecture**

   Pattern indicating architectural problem:
   - Each fix reveals new shared state/coupling in different place
   - Fixes require "massive refactoring"
   - Each fix creates new symptoms elsewhere

   **STOP and question fundamentals:**
   - Is this pattern fundamentally sound?
   - Should we refactor architecture vs. continue fixing symptoms?

   Discuss before attempting more fixes.

# Red Flags - STOP

If you catch yourself thinking:
- "Quick fix for now, investigate later"
- "Just try changing X and see if it works"
- "Add multiple changes, run tests"
- "Skip the test, I'll manually verify"
- "It's probably X, let me fix that"
- "I don't fully understand but this might work"
- "Here are the main problems: [lists fixes without investigation]"
- Proposing solutions before tracing data flow
- **"One more fix attempt" (when already tried 2+)**
- **Each fix reveals new problem in different place**

**ALL of these mean: STOP. Return to Phase 1.**

**If 3+ fixes failed:** Question the architecture.

# Common Rationalizations

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Issue is simple, don't need process" | Simple issues have root causes too. |
| "Emergency, no time for process" | Systematic debugging is FASTER than guess-and-check. |
| "Just try this first, then investigate" | First fix sets the pattern. Do it right from start. |
| "I'll write test after confirming fix works" | Untested fixes don't stick. Test first proves it. |
| "I see the problem, let me fix it" | Seeing symptoms ≠ understanding root cause. |
| "One more fix attempt" (after 2+ failures) | 3+ failures = architectural problem. |
