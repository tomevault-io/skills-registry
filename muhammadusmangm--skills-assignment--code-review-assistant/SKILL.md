# Code Review Assistant

## Overview
This skill provides comprehensive code review capabilities to evaluate code quality, identify issues, and suggest improvements across multiple programming languages.

## When to Use This Skill
- Performing systematic code reviews
- Assessing code quality and maintainability
- Identifying potential security vulnerabilities
- Evaluating performance implications
- Ensuring adherence to coding standards
- Providing constructive feedback to developers

## Review Categories

### Code Quality
- Readability and maintainability
- Proper function/method length
- Meaningful variable and function names
- Appropriate level of abstraction
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles

### Security Considerations
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) protection
- Authentication and authorization
- Data encryption and privacy
- Dependency security

### Performance
- Algorithmic complexity
- Memory usage optimization
- Database query efficiency
- Caching strategies
- Resource management
- Asynchronous operations

### Best Practices
- Error handling and logging
- Proper exception management
- Code documentation and comments
- Testing coverage and quality
- Configuration management

## Review Process

### 1. Architecture & Design
- Evaluate overall structure
- Check for separation of concerns
- Assess scalability considerations
- Verify design pattern usage

### 2. Code Implementation
- Review logic correctness
- Check for edge cases
- Validate error handling
- Assess resource management

### 3. Security Assessment
- Identify potential vulnerabilities
- Check authentication/authorization
- Verify data validation
- Review dependency security

### 4. Performance Analysis
- Evaluate algorithm efficiency
- Check for memory leaks
- Assess database queries
- Review caching strategies

### 5. Maintainability
- Check code readability
- Assess documentation quality
- Verify test coverage
- Review naming conventions

## Feedback Guidelines
- Be specific and actionable
- Provide positive reinforcement
- Suggest alternatives when appropriate
- Prioritize issues by severity
- Reference relevant documentation

## Severity Levels
- Critical: Security vulnerability, data loss risk
- High: Functional defect, major performance issue
- Medium: Potential bug, maintainability concern
- Low: Style issue, minor improvement suggestion

## Scripts Available
- `scripts/run-security-check.js` - Security vulnerability scan
- `scripts/performance-analyzer.js` - Performance assessment
- `scripts/style-checker.js` - Coding style verification
- `scripts/test-coverage.js` - Coverage analysis
