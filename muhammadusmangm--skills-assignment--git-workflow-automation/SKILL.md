# Git Workflow Automation

## Overview
This skill automates common Git workflows and provides expert guidance on best practices for version control.

## When to Use This Skill
- Creating feature branches with proper naming conventions
- Managing merge conflicts and resolution strategies
- Following Git Flow or GitHub Flow methodologies
- Creating and reviewing pull requests
- Performing release and hotfix operations
- Automating repetitive Git tasks

## Branching Strategies

### Git Flow
```
main (production-ready code)
├── develop (integration branch)
│   ├── feature/* (feature branches)
│   └── release/* (release preparation)
└── hotfix/* (urgent fixes)
```

### GitHub Flow
```
main (always deployable)
└── feature/* (short-lived branches)
```

## Common Operations

### Creating a Feature Branch
```bash
git checkout -b feature/user-authentication
```

### Syncing with Upstream
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout feature/user-authentication
git rebase main
```

### Resolving Merge Conflicts
1. Identify conflicted files: `git status`
2. Open files and look for conflict markers: `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`
3. Manually resolve conflicts by keeping desired changes
4. Stage resolved files: `git add .`
5. Complete the merge: `git rebase --continue` or `git merge --continue`

## Pull Request Best Practices
- Write clear, descriptive titles and descriptions
- Link to related issues
- Include testing instructions
- Specify reviewers
- Follow conventional commit messages

## Release Management
- Tag releases with semantic versioning (v1.2.3)
- Create release notes highlighting changes
- Verify CI/CD pipelines pass before merging
- Coordinate with stakeholders for deployment timing

## Scripts Available
- `scripts/create-feature-branch.sh` - Automated feature branch creation
- `scripts/sync-with-main.sh` - Sync current branch with main
- `scripts/prepare-release.sh` - Prepare a new release branch
