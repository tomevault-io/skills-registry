# Test Coverage Analyzer

## Overview
This skill provides comprehensive test coverage analysis to ensure code quality and identify areas requiring additional testing across multiple programming languages and testing frameworks.

## When to Use This Skill
- Analyzing current test coverage metrics
- Identifying untested code paths
- Generating detailed coverage reports
- Setting up quality gates for coverage thresholds
- Comparing coverage between code versions
- Identifying high-risk areas with low coverage

## Supported Testing Frameworks
- JavaScript: Jest, Mocha, Jasmine, Cypress
- Python: pytest, unittest, nose
- Java: JUnit, TestNG
- C#: NUnit, xUnit, MSTest
- Ruby: RSpec, minitest
- Go: built-in testing package
- Node.js: various testing libraries

## Coverage Metrics

### Line Coverage
- Percentage of executable lines covered
- Identification of uncovered lines
- Branch coverage analysis
- Function/method coverage

### Branch Coverage
- Conditional statement coverage
- Loop coverage analysis
- Decision point coverage
- Path coverage evaluation

### Advanced Metrics
- Statement coverage
- Condition coverage
- Modified condition/decision coverage (MCDC)
- Cyclomatic complexity correlation

## Analysis Process

### 1. Coverage Collection
- Execute tests with coverage instrumentation
- Collect coverage data from all test suites
- Aggregate coverage from multiple test runs
- Generate coverage reports in standard formats

### 2. Gap Identification
- Identify untested code blocks
- Highlight complex functions with low coverage
- Find unused code paths
- Detect dead code

### 3. Risk Assessment
- Calculate risk scores based on coverage gaps
- Prioritize areas needing attention
- Identify critical functionality with insufficient testing
- Assess change impact on test coverage

## Quality Gates
- Minimum coverage thresholds (e.g., 80% line coverage)
- Per-file coverage requirements
- New code coverage requirements (e.g., 90% for new code)
- Critical module coverage requirements

## Reporting Capabilities
- Detailed coverage reports with file-by-file breakdown
- Interactive HTML reports with clickable source code
- Coverage trend analysis over time
- Comparison reports showing coverage changes
- Risk assessment summaries

## Recommendations
- Suggest specific test cases for uncovered code
- Identify areas where mocking might improve testability
- Recommend test strategy improvements
- Highlight code that should be refactored for better testability

## Integration Points
- CI/CD pipeline integration
- Pull request status checks
- Code quality dashboards
- Team notification systems

## Standards and Best Practices
- Industry-standard coverage targets
- Framework-specific best practices
- Performance considerations for coverage tools
- Handling of generated/boilerplate code

## Scripts Available
- `scripts/run-coverage-analysis.js` - Execute coverage analysis
- `scripts/generate-report.js` - Generate detailed coverage reports
- `scripts/check-thresholds.js` - Validate coverage meets quality gates
- `scripts/compare-coverage.js` - Compare coverage between versions
