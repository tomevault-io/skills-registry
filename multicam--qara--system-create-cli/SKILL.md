# system-create-cli

**Automated CLI Generation System**

Generate production-ready TypeScript CLIs with comprehensive documentation, type safety, error handling, and PAI's CLI-First Architecture principles.

---

## WORKFLOW ROUTING (SYSTEM PROMPT)

**When user requests CLI creation, follow this routing:**

### Primary Workflow: Create New CLI
**Triggers:** "create CLI", "build command-line tool", "make CLI for X", "generate CLI"
**Route to:** `workflows/create-cli.md`
**Action:** Generate complete CLI from requirements

### Extension Workflow: Add Command
**Triggers:** "add command to CLI", "extend CLI with", "add feature to existing CLI"
**Route to:** `workflows/add-command.md`
**Action:** Add new command to existing CLI

### Migration Workflow: Upgrade Complexity Tier
**Triggers:** "upgrade CLI", "migrate to Commander", "CLI needs more complexity"
**Route to:** `workflows/upgrade-tier.md`
**Action:** Migrate Tier 1 → Tier 2 (manual → Commander.js)

### Testing Workflow: Add Test Suite
**Triggers:** "add tests to CLI", "test scaffolding", "need CLI tests"
**Route to:** `workflows/add-testing.md`
**Action:** Generate comprehensive test suite

### Distribution Workflow: Setup Publishing
**Triggers:** "publish CLI", "distribute CLI", "make standalone binary"
**Route to:** `workflows/setup-distribution.md`
**Action:** Configure npm publishing or binary distribution

## WHEN TO ACTIVATE THIS SKILL

Activate when you see these patterns:

### Direct Requests
- "Create a CLI for [API/service/tool]"
- "Build a command-line interface for X"
- "Make a CLI that does Y"
- "Generate a TypeScript CLI"
- "I need a CLI tool for Z"

### Context Clues
- User describes repetitive API calls → Suggest CLI
- User mentions "I keep typing this command" → Suggest CLI wrapper
- User has bash script doing complex work → Suggest TypeScript CLI replacement
- User working with API that lacks official CLI → Suggest creating one

### Examples
- ✅ "Create a CLI for the GitHub API"
- ✅ "Build a command-line tool to process CSV files"
- ✅ "Make a CLI for my database migrations"
- ✅ "Generate a CLI that wraps this API"
- ✅ "I need a tool like llcli but for Notion API"

---

## CORE CAPABILITIES

### Three-Tier Template System

**Tier 1: llcli-Style (DEFAULT - 80% of use cases)**
- Manual argument parsing (process.argv)
- Zero framework dependencies
- Bun + TypeScript
- Type-safe interfaces
- ~300-400 lines total
- **Perfect for:** API clients, data transformers, simple automation

**When to use Tier 1:**
- ✅ 2-10 commands
- ✅ Simple arguments (flags, values)
- ✅ JSON output
- ✅ No subcommands
- ✅ Fast development

**Tier 2: Commander.js (ESCALATION - 15% of use cases)**
- Framework-based parsing
- Subcommands + nested options
- Auto-generated help
- Plugin-ready
- **Perfect for:** Complex multi-command tools

**When to use Tier 2:**
- ❌ 10+ commands needing grouping
- ❌ Complex nested options
- ❌ Plugin architecture
- ❌ Multiple output formats

**Tier 3: oclif (REFERENCE ONLY - 5% of use cases)**
- Documentation only (no templates)
- Enterprise-grade plugin systems
- **Perfect for:** Heroku CLI, Salesforce CLI scale (rare)

**READ:** `references/tier-comparison.md` for detailed framework comparison, performance metrics, and migration paths

### What Every Generated CLI Includes

**1. Complete Implementation**
- TypeScript source with full type safety
- All commands functional and tested
- Error handling with proper exit codes
- Configuration management

**2. Comprehensive Documentation**
- README.md with philosophy, usage, examples
- QUICKSTART.md for common patterns
- Inline help text (--help)
- API response documentation

**3. Development Setup**
- package.json (Bun configuration)
- tsconfig.json (strict mode)
- .env.example (configuration template)
- File permissions configured

**4. Quality Standards**
- Type-safe throughout
- Deterministic output (JSON)
- Composable (pipes to jq, grep)
- Error messages with context
- Exit code compliance

---

## INTEGRATION WITH QARA

### Technology Stack Alignment

Generated CLIs follow PAI's standards:
- ✅ **Runtime:** Bun (NOT Node.js)
- ✅ **Language:** TypeScript (NOT JavaScript or Python)
- ✅ **Package Manager:** Bun (NOT npm/yarn/pnpm)
- ✅ **Testing:** `bun test` (when tests added)
- ✅ **Output:** Deterministic JSON (composable)
- ✅ **Documentation:** README + QUICKSTART (llcli pattern)

### Repository Placement

Generated CLIs go to:
- `${PAI_DIR}/bin/[cli-name]/` - Personal CLIs (like llcli)
- `~/Projects/[project-name]/` - Project-specific CLIs
- `~/Projects/PAI/examples/clis/` - Example CLIs (PUBLIC repo)

**SAFETY:** Always verify repository location before git operations

### CLI-First Architecture Principles

Every generated CLI follows:
1. **Deterministic** - Same input → Same output
2. **Clean** - Single responsibility
3. **Composable** - JSON output pipes to other tools
4. **Documented** - Comprehensive help and examples
5. **Testable** - Predictable behavior

## EXTENDED CONTEXT

**For detailed information, read these files:**

### Workflow Documentation
- `workflows/create-cli.md` - Main CLI generation workflow (decision tree, 10-step process)

- `workflows/upgrade-tier.md` - Migrate simple → complex
- `workflows/add-testing.md` - Test suite generation
- `workflows/setup-distribution.md` - Publishing configuration

### Reference Documentation

**READ:** `references/tier-comparison.md` for comprehensive framework comparison including:
- Detailed feature comparison (Tier 1 vs 2 vs 3)
- Performance metrics (startup time, memory usage)
- Migration paths between tiers
- Decision algorithm for tier selection
- Real-world examples and recommendations

**READ:** `references/cli-examples-basic.md` and `references/cli-examples-advanced.md` for 6 complete examples covering:
- API clients (GitHub, Notion)
- File processors (markdown, CSV)
- Data pipelines (complex workflows)
- Database operations (PostgreSQL)
- Common patterns and testing approaches
- Documentation templates

## PHILOSOPHY

### Why This Skill Exists

User repeatedly creates CLIs for APIs and tools. Each time:
1. Starts with bash script
2. Realizes it needs error handling
3. Realizes it needs help text
4. Realizes it needs type safety
5. Rewrites in TypeScript
6. Adds documentation
7. Now has production CLI

**This skill automates steps 1-7.**

### The llcli Pattern

The `llcli` CLI (Limitless.ai API) proves this pattern works:
- 327 lines of TypeScript
- Zero dependencies (no framework)
- Complete error handling
- Comprehensive documentation
- Production-ready immediately

**This skill replicates that success.**

### Design Principles

1. **Start Simple** - Default to Tier 1 (llcli-style)
2. **Escalate When Needed** - Tier 2 only when justified
3. **Complete, Not Scaffold** - Every CLI is production-ready
4. **Documentation First** - README explains "why" not just "how"
5. **Type Safety** - TypeScript strict mode always

---

## QUALITY STANDARDS

Every generated CLI must pass these gates:

### 1. Compilation
- ✅ TypeScript compiles with zero errors
- ✅ Strict mode enabled
- ✅ No `any` types except justified

### 2. Functionality
- ✅ All commands work as specified
- ✅ Error handling comprehensive
- ✅ Exit codes correct (0 success, 1 error)

### 3. Documentation
- ✅ README explains philosophy and usage
- ✅ QUICKSTART has common examples
- ✅ --help text comprehensive
- ✅ All flags/options documented

### 4. Code Quality
- ✅ Type-safe throughout
- ✅ Clean function separation
- ✅ Error messages actionable
- ✅ Configuration externalized

### 5. Integration
- ✅ Follows PAI tech stack (Bun, TypeScript)
- ✅ CLI-First Architecture principles
- ✅ Deterministic output (JSON)
- ✅ Composable with other tools

**This skill turns "I need a CLI for X" into production-ready tools in minutes, following proven patterns from llcli and PAI's CLI-First Architecture.**
