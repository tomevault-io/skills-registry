# Refinery Agent Pattern

## File Paths & Versioning

**Input:**
- `project-idea/index.md` — Primary idea file (source of truth)
- `project-idea/amendments/*.md` — Additional idea files (optional)

**Output:**
- `project-docs/prd/prd-v{N}.md` — Versioned PRD (e.g., `prd-v1.md`, `prd-v2.md`)
- `project-docs/prd/prd-latest.md` — Copy of the latest version

**Workflow:**
1. Read all files in `project-idea/`
2. Detect next version number (check existing `prd-v*.md` files)
3. Generate `prd-v{N}.md`
4. Update `prd-latest.md` to match

**Version Header:** Each PRD includes:
```markdown
---
version: 1
date: 2025-12-18
input_files:
  - project-idea/index.md
changes_from_previous: null | "Summary of changes"
---
```

## Purpose

The Refinery Agent is the first stage in a multi-agent software factory workflow. It transforms unstructured ideas (text, images, audio, sketches) into well-structured Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) that can be consumed by downstream agents.

## When to Use This Pattern

Use the Refinery Agent pattern when:
- Starting a new feature or project from a rough idea
- Converting user feedback into structured requirements
- Transforming brainstorming sessions into actionable specifications
- Processing multi-modal inputs (text, images, diagrams) into unified requirements

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. Input Processing
**Accept diverse input formats:**
- Plain text descriptions
- Markdown documents
- Images (mockups, wireframes, diagrams)
- Audio recordings or transcriptions
- Links to reference materials

**Key principle:** Be input-agnostic. The Refinery should normalize any format into structured data.

### 2. PRD Generation

**A complete PRD includes:**

**Project Overview:**
- Title and brief description
- Target users and use cases
- Success criteria and goals

**Feature Breakdown:**
- Core features (must-haves)
- Secondary features (nice-to-haves)
- Out of scope (explicitly excluded)

**User Stories:**
- Format: "As a [user type], I want [goal] so that [benefit]"
- Acceptance criteria for each story
- Priority levels (P0/P1/P2)

**Technical Context:**
- Existing system constraints
- Integration requirements
- Technology preferences
- Performance requirements

**UI/UX Considerations:**
- User workflows and journeys
- Key interaction patterns
- Visual mockups or references
- Accessibility requirements

### 3. Validation & Completeness Checks

Before finalizing a PRD, verify:
- [ ] All user types are identified
- [ ] Core user workflows are described
- [ ] Success metrics are measurable
- [ ] Constraints and dependencies are documented
- [ ] Ambiguities are resolved or flagged

## Implementation Approach

### Step 1: Parse and Extract
```
Input → Structured Data Extraction → Key Entities
```

**Extract:**
- Who: User types, personas, stakeholders
- What: Features, capabilities, requirements
- Why: Goals, problems being solved
- How: Interaction patterns, workflows
- When: Timelines, dependencies, priorities

### Step 2: Organize and Structure
```
Raw Data → Categorization → PRD Sections
```

**Organization strategy:**
1. Group related features together
2. Sequence by user journey or workflow
3. Prioritize by impact and effort
4. Identify dependencies and prerequisites

### Step 3: Enrich with AI Analysis
```
Basic PRD → AI Enhancement → Comprehensive PRD
```

**AI can help with:**
- Suggesting missing requirements based on similar projects
- Identifying edge cases and error scenarios
- Generating mockups from text descriptions
- Creating user stories from feature lists
- Proposing success metrics

### Step 4: Generate Visual Aids
```
Text Requirements → Visual Representation → Mockups/Diagrams
```

**Create:**
- UI mockups (low to high fidelity)
- System architecture diagrams
- User flow diagrams
- Data model sketches

### Step 5: Extract Feature Nodes
```
Complete PRD → Feature Graph → Structured Nodes
```

**Each feature node contains:**
- Feature ID and name
- Description and rationale
- Dependencies (what must exist first)
- Success criteria
- Estimated complexity

## Output Format

### PRD Document Structure

```markdown
# [Project Title]

## Overview
- **Description**: [One paragraph summary]
- **Target Users**: [Primary user types]
- **Success Criteria**: [Measurable outcomes]

## Core Features

### Feature 1: [Name]
**Priority**: P0
**User Story**: As a [user], I want [goal] so that [benefit]
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2

**Dependencies**: None | [Feature IDs]
**Estimated Complexity**: Low | Medium | High

### Feature 2: [Name]
...

## User Workflows

### Workflow 1: [Primary Task]
1. User does X
2. System responds with Y
3. User confirms Z

**Edge Cases**:
- What if X fails?
- What if user cancels at step 2?

## Technical Requirements
- **Performance**: [Specific metrics]
- **Security**: [Requirements]
- **Integrations**: [External systems]
- **Constraints**: [Limitations]

## UI/UX Considerations
- [Key interaction patterns]
- [Visual mockup references]

## Out of Scope
- [Explicitly excluded features]

## Open Questions
- [Unresolved ambiguities requiring stakeholder input]
```

### Feature Graph Format (JSON)

```json
{
  "features": [
    {
      "id": "f1",
      "name": "User Authentication",
      "description": "Basic login/logout functionality",
      "priority": "P0",
      "dependencies": [],
      "complexity": "medium",
      "acceptance_criteria": [
        "Users can register with email/password",
        "Users can log in and log out",
        "Sessions persist across page reloads"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "f2",
      "name": "Dashboard View",
      "description": "Main user landing page after login",
      "priority": "P0",
      "dependencies": ["f1"],
      "complexity": "medium"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Best Practices

### DO:
- **Ask clarifying questions** when the input is ambiguous
- **Propose multiple options** when there are different valid approaches
- **Document assumptions** explicitly in the PRD
- **Include both happy path and edge cases** in user stories
- **Make requirements testable** with specific acceptance criteria

### DON'T:
- **Assume technical implementation details** (that's for Foundry Agent)
- **Skip validation** of completeness before finalizing
- **Ignore constraints** mentioned in the input
- **Make the PRD too prescriptive** about implementation
- **Leave open questions untracked**

## Integration with Other Agents

### Output → Foundry Agent
The PRD becomes the input for the Foundry Agent, which will:
- Design technical architecture
- Choose implementation technologies
- Create detailed blueprints

**Handoff criteria:**
- PRD is complete and validated
- All ambiguities are resolved or documented
- Feature dependencies are mapped
- Success criteria are measurable

### Feedback Loop ← Validator Agent
The Validator Agent may send feedback indicating:
- Missing requirements discovered during testing
- User feedback requiring PRD updates
- New features requested

**Incorporate feedback by:**
- Adding new features to PRD
- Refining existing user stories
- Updating priorities based on learnings

## Example Usage

### Input
```
"I want to build a collaborative task manager for small teams. 
Users should be able to create tasks, assign them to team members, 
and track progress. It should have a clean, simple interface."
```

### Refinery Process
1. **Extract entities**: Users (team members), Tasks (create, assign, track), Teams (small groups)
2. **Identify workflows**: Task creation, Assignment, Progress tracking
3. **Generate user stories**: 
   - "As a team member, I want to create tasks so that work can be tracked"
   - "As a team lead, I want to assign tasks so that workload is distributed"
4. **Define features**: Task CRUD, User management, Team setup, Progress dashboard
5. **Create mockups**: Sketch main dashboard, task detail view
6. **Map dependencies**: User auth → Team setup → Task management

### Output PRD
```markdown
# Collaborative Task Manager

## Overview
A lightweight task management tool for small teams (2-10 people)...

## Core Features

### F1: User Authentication (P0)
User Story: As a team member, I want to sign up and log in...

### F2: Team Workspace (P0)
User Story: As a team lead, I want to create a team workspace...

```

## Tips for Effective Refinement

1. **Start broad, then narrow**: Begin with high-level goals, then drill into details
2. **Use templates**: Have standard PRD templates for common project types (web app, API, CLI tool, etc.)
3. **Iterate with stakeholders**: Share draft PRDs for feedback before finalizing
4. **Track changes**: Version PRDs and document what changed and why
5. **Link to research**: Include links to competitor analysis, user research, or design inspiration

## Common Pitfalls

- **Over-specification**: Don't dictate technical solutions (use React vs Vue) - leave that to Foundry
- **Under-specification**: Don't be too vague ("should be fast") - quantify when possible ("< 200ms response time")
- **Scope creep during refinement**: Stay focused on the initial idea; capture additional ideas as "future enhancements"
- **Ignoring feasibility**: Consider technical constraints early, even if not designing the solution yet

## Summary

The Refinery Agent transforms chaos into clarity. It's the bridge between human creativity and machine execution, ensuring that downstream agents have well-defined, complete requirements to work with.

**Remember**: A good PRD is:
- **Complete**: All necessary information is present
- **Clear**: No ambiguous language
- **Testable**: Success can be measured
- **Scoped**: Boundaries are well-defined
- **User-focused**: Written from the user's perspective
