# MultiversX Code Analysis

Toolkit for analyzing MultiversX smart contract code changes, verifying fixes, and finding bug variants across codebases.

## When to Use

- Reviewing pull requests with contract changes
- Auditing upgrade proposals before deployment
- Verifying security patches and bug fixes
- Finding similar vulnerabilities across the codebase
- Creating comprehensive vulnerability reports

---

## Section 1: Differential Review

Analyze differences between two versions of a MultiversX codebase, focusing on security implications of changes, storage layout compatibility, and upgrade safety.

### 1.1 Upgradeability Checks (MultiversX-Specific)

#### Storage Layout Compatibility

**CRITICAL**: Storage layout changes can corrupt existing data.

##### Struct Field Ordering
```rust
// v1 - Original struct
#[derive(TopEncode, TopDecode, TypeAbi)]
pub struct UserData {
    pub balance: BigUint,      // Offset 0
    pub last_claim: u64,       // Offset 1
}

// v2 - DANGEROUS: Reordered fields
pub struct UserData {
    pub last_claim: u64,       // Now at Offset 0 - BREAKS EXISTING DATA
    pub balance: BigUint,      // Now at Offset 1 - CORRUPTED
}

// v2 - SAFE: Append new fields only
pub struct UserData {
    pub balance: BigUint,      // Offset 0 - unchanged
    pub last_claim: u64,       // Offset 1 - unchanged
    pub new_field: bool,       // Offset 2 - NEW (safe)
}
```

##### Storage Mapper Key Changes
```rust
// v1
#[storage_mapper("user_balance")]
fn user_balance(&self, user: &ManagedAddress) -> SingleValueMapper<BigUint>;

// v2 - DANGEROUS: Changed storage key
#[storage_mapper("userBalance")]  // Different key = new empty storage!
fn user_balance(&self, user: &ManagedAddress) -> SingleValueMapper<BigUint>;
```

#### Initialization on Upgrade

**CRITICAL**: `#[init]` is NOT called on upgrade. Only `#[upgrade]` runs.

```rust
// v2 - Added new storage mapper
#[storage_mapper("newFeatureEnabled")]
fn new_feature_enabled(&self) -> SingleValueMapper<bool>;

// WRONG: Assuming init runs
#[init]
fn init(&self) {
    self.config().set(DefaultConfig::new());
    self.new_feature_enabled().set(true);  // Never runs on upgrade!
}

// CORRECT: Initialize in upgrade
#[upgrade]
fn upgrade(&self) {
    self.new_feature_enabled().set(true);  // Properly initializes
}
```

#### Breaking Changes Checklist

| Change Type | Risk | Mitigation |
|------------|------|------------|
| Struct field reorder | Critical | Never reorder, only append |
| Storage key rename | Critical | Keep old key, migrate data |
| New required storage | High | Initialize in `#[upgrade]` |
| Removed endpoint | Medium | Ensure no external dependencies |
| Changed endpoint signature | Medium | Version API or maintain compatibility |
| New validation rules | Medium | Consider existing state validity |

### 1.2 Regression Analysis

#### New Features Impact
- Do new features break existing invariants?
- Are there new attack vectors introduced?
- Do gas costs change significantly?

#### Deleted Code Analysis
When code is removed, verify:
- Was this an intentional security fix?
- Was a validation check removed (potential vulnerability)?
- Are there other code paths that depended on this?

```rust
// v1 - Had balance check
fn withdraw(&self, amount: BigUint) {
    require!(amount <= self.balance().get(), "Insufficient balance");
    // ... withdrawal logic
}

// v2 - Check removed - WHY?
fn withdraw(&self, amount: BigUint) {
    // Missing balance check! Was this intentional?
    // ... withdrawal logic
}
```

#### Modified Logic Analysis
For changed code, verify:
- Edge cases still handled correctly
- Error messages updated appropriately
- Related code paths updated consistently

### 1.3 Review Workflow

#### Step 1: Generate Clean Diff
```bash
# Between git tags/commits
git diff v1.0.0..v2.0.0 -- src/

# Ignore formatting changes
git diff -w v1.0.0..v2.0.0 -- src/

# Focus on specific file
git diff v1.0.0..v2.0.0 -- src/lib.rs
```

#### Step 2: Categorize Changes

```markdown
## Change Summary

### Storage Changes
- [ ] user_data struct: Added `reward_multiplier` field (SAFE - appended)
- [ ] New mapper: `feature_flags` (VERIFY: initialized in upgrade)

### Endpoint Changes
- [ ] deposit(): Added token validation (SECURITY FIX)
- [ ] withdraw(): Changed gas calculation (VERIFY: no DoS vector)

### Removed Code
- [ ] legacy_claim(): Removed entire endpoint (VERIFY: no external callers)

### New Code
- [ ] batch_transfer(): New endpoint (FULL REVIEW NEEDED)
```

#### Step 3: Trace Data Flow

For each changed data structure:
1. Find all read locations
2. Find all write locations
3. Verify consistency across changes

#### Step 4: Verify Test Coverage

```bash
# Check if new code paths are tested
sc-meta test

# Generate test coverage report
cargo tarpaulin --out Html
```

### 1.4 Security-Specific Diff Checks

#### Access Control Changes
```rust
// v1 - Owner only
#[only_owner]
#[endpoint]
fn sensitive_action(&self) { }

// v2 - DANGEROUS: Removed access control
#[endpoint]  // Now public! Was this intentional?
fn sensitive_action(&self) { }
```

#### Payment Handling Changes
```rust
// v1 - Validated token
#[payable]
fn deposit(&self) {
    let payment = self.call_value().single();
    require!(payment.token_identifier == self.accepted_token().get(), "Wrong token");
}

// v2 - DANGEROUS: Removed validation
#[payable]
fn deposit(&self) {
    let payment = self.call_value().single();
    // Missing token validation! Accepts any token now
}
```

#### Arithmetic Changes
```rust
// v1 - Safe arithmetic
let result = a.checked_add(&b).unwrap_or_else(|| sc_panic!("Overflow"));

// v2 - DANGEROUS: Removed overflow protection
let result = a + b;  // Can overflow!
```

### 1.5 Differential Review Output Template

```markdown
# Differential Review Report

**Versions Compared**: v1.0.0 → v2.0.0
**Reviewer**: [Name]
**Date**: [Date]

## Summary
[One paragraph overview of changes]

## Critical Findings
1. [Finding with severity and recommendation]

## Storage Compatibility
- [ ] No struct field reordering
- [ ] New mappers initialized in #[upgrade]
- [ ] Storage keys unchanged

## Breaking Changes
| Change | Impact | Migration Required |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| ... | ... | ... |

## Recommendations
1. [Specific actionable recommendation]
```

### Common Pitfalls

- **Assuming init runs on upgrade**: Always check `#[upgrade]` function
- **Missing storage migration**: Renamed keys lose existing data
- **Removed validations**: Could be intentional security fix or accidental vulnerability
- **Changed math precision**: Can affect existing calculations
- **Modified access control**: Could expose sensitive functions

---

## Section 2: Fix Verification

Rigorously verify that a reported vulnerability has been eliminated without introducing regressions or new issues.

### 2.1 The Verification Loop

#### Step 1: Reproduce the Bug
Create a test scenario that demonstrates the vulnerability:

```json
// scenarios/exploit_before_fix.scen.json
{
    "name": "Demonstrate vulnerability - should fail before fix",
    "steps": [
        {
            "step": "scCall",
            "comment": "Attacker exploits the vulnerability",
            "tx": {
                "from": "address:attacker",
                "to": "sc:vulnerable_contract",
                "function": "vulnerable_endpoint",
                "arguments": ["...exploit_payload..."],
                "gasLimit": "5,000,000"
            },
            "expect": {
                "status": "0",
                "message": "*"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

#### Step 2: Apply the Fix
Review the code modification that addresses the vulnerability.

#### Step 3: Verify Fix Effectiveness
Run the exploit scenario — it MUST now fail (or behave correctly):

```bash
# The exploit scenario should now pass (exploit blocked)
sc-meta test --scenario scenarios/exploit_before_fix.scen.json
```

#### Step 4: Run Regression Suite
ALL existing tests must still pass:

```bash
# Full test suite
sc-meta test

# Or with cargo
cargo test
```

### 2.2 Common Fix Failures

#### Partial Fix
The fix addresses one path but misses variants:

```rust
// VULNERABILITY: Missing amount validation
#[endpoint]
fn deposit(&self) {
    let amount = self.call_value().egld();
    // No check for amount > 0
}

// PARTIAL FIX: Only fixed deposit, not transfer
#[endpoint]
fn deposit(&self) {
    let amount = self.call_value().egld();
    require!(amount > 0, "Amount must be positive");  // Fixed!
}

#[endpoint]
fn transfer(&self, amount: BigUint) {
    // Still missing amount > 0 check!  <- VARIANT NOT FIXED
}
```

**Verification**: Use variant analysis (Section 3) to find all similar code paths.

#### Moved Bug (Fix Creates New Issue)

```rust
// VULNERABILITY: Reentrancy
#[endpoint]
fn withdraw(&self) {
    let balance = self.balance().get();
    self.tx().to(&caller).egld(&balance).transfer();  // External call before state update
    self.balance().clear();
}

// BAD FIX: Prevents reentrancy but creates DoS
#[endpoint]
fn withdraw(&self) {
    self.locked().set(true);  // Lock added
    let balance = self.balance().get();
    self.tx().to(&caller).egld(&balance).transfer();
    self.balance().clear();
    // Missing: self.locked().set(false);  <- LOCK NEVER RELEASED!
}

// CORRECT FIX: Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern
#[endpoint]
fn withdraw(&self) {
    let balance = self.balance().get();
    self.balance().clear();  // State update BEFORE external call
    self.tx().to(&caller).egld(&balance).transfer();
}
```

#### Incomplete Validation

```rust
// VULNERABILITY: Integer overflow
let total = amount1 + amount2;  // Can overflow

// INCOMPLETE FIX: Checks one but not both
require!(amount1 < MAX_AMOUNT, "Amount1 too large");
let total = amount1 + amount2;  // Still overflows if amount2 is large!

// CORRECT FIX: BigUint is arbitrary precision (no overflow), but validate bounds
let total = &amount1 + &amount2;
require!(total <= BigUint::from(MAX_ALLOWED), "Amount exceeds maximum");
```

---

## Section 3: Variant Analysis

Multiply the value of a single vulnerability finding by systematically locating similar issues elsewhere in the codebase.

### 3.1 The Variant Analysis Process

```
1. Find Initial Bug → Specific vulnerability instance
2. Abstract Pattern → What makes this a bug?
3. Create Search    → Grep/Semgrep queries
4. Find Variants    → All similar occurrences
5. Verify Each      → Confirm true positives
6. Report All       → Document the bug class
```

### 3.2 Common MultiversX Variant Patterns

#### Pattern: Missing Payment Validation

**Variant Search:**
```bash
# Find all payable endpoints
grep -rn "#\[payable" src/

# Check for missing token validation
grep -A 30 "#\[payable" src/*.rs > payable_endpoints.txt
# Manually review each for token_identifier validation
```

**Semgrep Rule:**
```yaml
rules:
  - id: mvx-payable-no-token-check
    patterns:
      - pattern: |
          #[payable]
          $ANNOTATIONS
          fn $FUNC(&self, $...PARAMS) {
              $...BODY
          }
      - pattern-not: |
          #[payable]
          $ANNOTATIONS
          fn $FUNC(&self, $...PARAMS) {
              <... token_identifier ...>
          }
```

#### Pattern: Unbounded Iteration

```bash
# Find all .iter() calls on storage mappers
grep -rn "\.iter()" src/

# Find all for loops over storage
grep -rn "for.*in.*self\." src/
```

**Checklist for Each:**
- [ ] Is iteration bounded?
- [ ] Can a user grow the collection?
- [ ] Is there pagination?

#### Pattern: Callback State Assumptions

```bash
# Find all callbacks
grep -rn "#\[callback\]" src/

# Check for proper result handling
grep -A 20 "#\[callback\]" src/*.rs | grep -c "ManagedAsyncCallResult"
```

**All Callbacks Need:**
```rust
#[callback]
fn any_callback(&self, #[call_result] result: ManagedAsyncCallResult<T>) {
    match result {
        ManagedAsyncCallResult::Ok(_) => { /* success */ },
        ManagedAsyncCallResult::Err(_) => { /* handle failure! */ }
    }
}
```

#### Pattern: Missing Access Control

```bash
# Find functions that modify admin-like storage
grep -rn "admin\|owner\|config\|fee" src/ | grep "\.set("

# Cross-reference with access control
grep -B 10 "admin.*\.set\|config.*\.set" src/*.rs | grep -v "only_owner"
```

#### Pattern: Arithmetic Without Checks

```bash
# Find all arithmetic operations
grep -rn " + \| - \| \* " src/*.rs

# Exclude test files and comments
grep -rn " + \| - \| \* " src/*.rs | grep -v "test\|//"
```

### 3.3 Systematic Variant Hunting

#### Step 1: Characterize the Bug

Answer these questions:
1. What is the vulnerable code pattern?
2. What makes it exploitable?
3. What would a fix look like?

#### Step 2: Create Detection Queries

**Grep-based:**
```bash
# Pattern: [specific code pattern]
grep -rn "[pattern]" src/

# Negative pattern (should be present but isn't)
grep -L "[expected_pattern]" src/*.rs
```

**Semgrep-based:**
```yaml
rules:
  - id: variant-pattern
    patterns:
      - pattern: <vulnerable pattern>
      - pattern-not: <fixed pattern>
```

#### Step 3: Triage Results

| Result | Classification | Action |
|--------|----------------|--------|
| Clearly vulnerable | True Positive | Report |
| Needs context | Investigate | Manual review |
| Has mitigation | False Positive | Document why |
| Different pattern | Not a variant | Skip |

#### Step 4: Document Findings

```markdown
## Variant Analysis: [Bug Class Name]

### Initial Finding
- Location: [file:line]
- Description: [what's wrong]

### Pattern Description
[Abstract description of what makes this a bug]

### Search Method
```bash
[grep/semgrep commands used]
```

### Variants Found

| Location | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| file1.rs:23 | Confirmed | Same pattern |
| file2.rs:45 | Confirmed | Slight variation |
| file3.rs:67 | FP | Has validation elsewhere |

### Remediation
[How to fix all instances]
```

### 3.4 Automation for Future Prevention

#### Convert to CI/CD Check

```yaml
# .github/workflows/security.yml
- name: Check for vulnerability patterns
  run: |
    # Run semgrep with custom rules
    semgrep --config rules/mvx-security.yaml src/

    # Grep-based checks
    if grep -rn "unsafe_pattern" src/; then
      echo "Found potential vulnerability"
      exit 1
    fi
```

### 3.5 Variant Analysis Checklist

After finding any bug:

- [ ] Abstract the pattern (what makes it a bug?)
- [ ] Create search queries (grep, semgrep)
- [ ] Search entire codebase
- [ ] Triage each result (TP/FP/needs investigation)
- [ ] Verify true positives are exploitable
- [ ] Document all variants
- [ ] Create prevention rule for CI/CD
- [ ] Recommend fix for all instances

### 3.6 Common Variant Categories

#### Input Validation Variants
- Missing in one endpoint → Check ALL endpoints
- Missing for one parameter → Check ALL parameters

#### Access Control Variants
- Missing on one admin function → Check ALL admin functions
- Inconsistent role checks → Audit entire role system

#### State Management Variants
- Reentrancy in one function → Check ALL external calls
- Missing callback handling → Check ALL callbacks

#### Arithmetic Variants
- Overflow in one calculation → Check ALL math operations
- Precision loss in one formula → Check ALL division operations

### 3.7 Reporting Multiple Variants

#### Consolidated Report

#### Severity Aggregation

| Individual Severity | Count | Aggregate Severity |
|---------------------|-------|-------------------|
| Critical | 3+ | Critical |
| High | 5+ | Critical |
| Medium | 10+ | High |
| Low | Any | Low |

### 3.8 Example: Complete Variant Analysis

**Initial Bug: Missing amount validation in stake()**

```rust
// Found in stake.rs:45
#[payable("EGLD")]
fn stake(&self) {
    let payment = self.call_value().egld();
    // Bug: No check for amount > 0
    self.staked().update(|s| *s += payment.amount.as_big_uint());
}
```

**Pattern: Missing amount > 0 check on payable endpoint**

> **Note**: With SDK v0.64+ Payment type, `amount` is `NonZeroBigUint` — the `> 0` check is redundant for typed payments. The pattern below applies to older SDK versions or raw `call_value()` usage.

**Search:**
```bash
grep -rn "#\[payable" src/ | cut -d: -f1 | sort -u | while read file; do
    echo "=== $file ==="
    grep -A 30 "#\[payable" "$file" | head -40
done > payable_review.txt
```

**Variants Found:**
1. `stake.rs:45` - stake() - CONFIRMED
2. `stake.rs:78` - add_stake() - CONFIRMED
3. `rewards.rs:23` - deposit_rewards() - CONFIRMED
4. `fees.rs:12` - pay_fee() - FALSE POSITIVE (has check on line 15)

**Fix Applied to All:**
```rust
#[payable("EGLD")]
fn stake(&self) {
    let payment = self.call_value().egld();
    require!(payment.amount.as_big_uint() > 0, "Amount must be positive");
    self.staked().update(|s| *s += payment.amount.as_big_uint());
}
```

**CI Rule Created:** `rules/mvx-amount-validation.yaml`
