# Project Culture & Code Maturity Assessment

Evaluate the quality and reliability of a MultiversX codebase based on documentation presence, testing culture, code hygiene, and development practices. This assessment helps calibrate audit depth and identify areas of concern.

## When to Use

- Starting engagement with a new project
- Estimating audit scope and effort
- Evaluating investment or integration risk
- Providing feedback on development practices
- Prioritizing review focus areas

## 1. Documentation Quality

### Documentation Presence Checklist

| Item | Location | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| README.md | Project root | [ ] Present [ ] Useful |
| Build instructions | README or BUILDING.md | [ ] Present [ ] Tested |
| API documentation | docs/ or inline | [ ] Present [ ] Complete |
| Architecture overview | docs/ or specs/ | [ ] Present |
| Deployment guide | README or DEPLOY.md | [ ] Present |

### MultiversX-Specific Documentation

| Item | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| `multiversx.json` | Standard build configuration | [ ] Present |
| `sc-config.toml` | Contract configuration | [ ] Present |
| `multiversx.yaml` | Additional config | [ ] Optional |
| `snippets.sh` | Interaction scripts | [ ] Helpful |
| `interaction/` | Deployment/call scripts | [ ] Very helpful |

### Specification Documents

| Document | Quality Indicator |
|----------|-------------------|
| Whitepaper | Formal specification of behavior |
| `specs/` directory | Detailed technical specs |
| MIP compliance docs | Standard adherence documentation |
| Security considerations | Threat model awareness |

### Documentation Quality Scoring

```
HIGH QUALITY:
- README explains purpose, build, test, deploy
- Architecture diagrams present
- API fully documented with examples
- Security model documented

MEDIUM QUALITY:
- README with basic instructions
- Some inline documentation
- Partial API coverage

LOW QUALITY:
- Minimal or no README
- No inline comments
- No architectural documentation
```

## 2. Testing Culture Assessment

### Test Presence

```bash
# Check for Rust unit tests
grep -r "#\[test\]" src/

# Check for scenario tests
ls -la scenarios/

# Check for integration tests
ls -la tests/
```

### Scenario Test Coverage

| Coverage Level | Indicators |
|----------------|------------|
| **Excellent** | Every endpoint has scenario, edge cases tested, failure paths covered |
| **Good** | All endpoints have basic scenarios, some edge cases |
| **Minimal** | Only `deploy.scen.json` or few scenarios |
| **None** | No `scenarios/` directory |

### Test Quality Indicators

```rust
// HIGH QUALITY: Tests cover edge cases
#[test]
fn test_deposit_zero_amount() { }  // Boundary
#[test]
fn test_deposit_max_amount() { }   // Boundary
#[test]
fn test_deposit_wrong_token() { }  // Error case
#[test]
fn test_deposit_unauthorized() { } // Access control

// LOW QUALITY: Only happy path
#[test]
fn test_deposit() { }  // Basic only
```

### Continuous Integration

| CI Feature | Status |
|------------|--------|
| Automated builds | [ ] Present |
| Test execution | [ ] Present |
| Coverage reporting | [ ] Present |
| Lint/format checks | [ ] Present |
| Security scanning | [ ] Present |

### Simulation Testing

Look for:
- `mx-chain-simulator-go` usage
- Docker-based test environments
- Integration test scripts

## 3. Code Hygiene Assessment

### Linter Compliance

```bash
# Run Clippy
cargo clippy -- -W clippy::all

# Check formatting
cargo fmt --check
```

| Clippy Status | Interpretation |
|---------------|----------------|
| 0 warnings | Excellent hygiene |
| < 10 warnings | Good, minor issues |
| 10-50 warnings | Needs attention |
| > 50 warnings | Poor hygiene |

### Magic Numbers

```bash
# Find raw numeric literals
grep -rn "[^a-zA-Z_][0-9]\{2,\}[^a-zA-Z0-9_]" src/
```

**Bad:**
```rust
let seconds = 86400;  // What is this?
let fee = amount * 3 / 100;  // Magic 3%
```

**Good:**
```rust
const SECONDS_PER_DAY: u64 = 86400;
const FEE_PERCENT: u64 = 3;
const FEE_DENOMINATOR: u64 = 100;

let seconds = SECONDS_PER_DAY;
let fee = amount * FEE_PERCENT / FEE_DENOMINATOR;
```

### Error Handling

```bash
# Count unwrap usage
grep -c "\.unwrap()" src/*.rs

# Count expect usage
grep -c "\.expect(" src/*.rs

# Count proper error handling
grep -c "sc_panic!\|require!" src/*.rs
```

| Pattern | Quality Indicator |
|---------|-------------------|
| Mostly `require!` with messages | Good |
| Mixed `require!` and `unwrap()` | Needs review |
| Mostly `unwrap()` | Poor |

### Code Comments

| Aspect | Good Practice |
|--------|---------------|
| Complex logic | Has explanatory comments |
| Public APIs | Has doc comments |
| Assumptions | Documented inline |
| TODOs | Tracked, not ignored |

```rust
// GOOD: Complex logic explained
/// Calculates rewards using compound interest formula.
/// Formula: P * (1 + r/n)^(nt) where:
/// - P: principal
/// - r: annual rate (in basis points)
/// - n: compounding frequency
/// - t: time in years
fn calculate_rewards(&self, principal: BigUint, time: u64) -> BigUint {
    // ...
}

// BAD: No explanation for complex logic
fn calc(&self, p: BigUint, t: u64) -> BigUint {
    // Dense, unexplained calculation
}
```

## 4. Dependency Management

### Cargo.lock Presence

```bash
ls -la Cargo.lock
```

| Status | Interpretation |
|--------|----------------|
| Committed | Reproducible builds |
| Not committed | Version drift risk |

### Version Pinning

```toml
# GOOD: Specific versions
[dependencies.multiversx-sc]
version = "0.64.1"  # edition = "2024" recommended

# BAD: Wildcard versions
[dependencies.multiversx-sc]
version = "*"

# ACCEPTABLE: Caret (minor updates)
[dependencies.multiversx-sc]
version = "^0.54"
```

### Dependency Audit

```bash
# Check for known vulnerabilities
cargo audit
```

## 5. Maturity Scoring Matrix

### Score Calculation

| Category | Weight | High (3) | Medium (2) | Low (1) |
|----------|--------|----------|------------|---------|
| Documentation | 20% | Complete | Partial | Minimal |
| Testing | 30% | Full coverage | Basic coverage | Minimal |
| Code hygiene | 20% | Clean Clippy | Few warnings | Many issues |
| Dependencies | 15% | Pinned, audited | Pinned | Wildcards |
| CI/CD | 15% | Full pipeline | Basic | None |

### Interpretation

| Score | Maturity | Audit Focus |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| 2.5-3.0 | High | Business logic, edge cases |
| 1.5-2.4 | Medium | Broad review, verify basics |
| 1.0-1.4 | Low | Everything, assume issues exist |

## 6. Red Flags

### Immediate Concerns

| Red Flag | Risk |
|----------|------|
| No tests at all | Logic likely untested |
| Wildcard dependencies | Supply chain vulnerability |
| `unsafe` blocks without justification | Memory safety issues |
| Excessive `unwrap()` | Panic vulnerabilities |
| No README | Maintenance abandoned? |
| Outdated framework version | Known vulnerabilities |

### Yellow Flags

| Yellow Flag | Concern |
|-------------|---------|
| Few scenario tests | Limited coverage |
| Some Clippy warnings | Technical debt |
| Incomplete documentation | Knowledge silos |
| No CI/CD | Regression risk |
