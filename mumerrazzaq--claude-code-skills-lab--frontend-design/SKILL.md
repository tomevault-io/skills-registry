# Frontend Design Skill

Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces using systematic UI/UX principles.

## Quick Answers

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| **What matters here?** | User needs FIRST, then accessibility, conventions, visual hierarchy |
| **What can go wrong?** | Designing without understanding users, poor accessibility, inconsistent states |
| **Fastest correct path?** | Think (understand) → Plan (decide) → Build (implement) → Validate (test) |
| **How do I know I'm done?** | User problem solved, WCAG compliant, conventions followed, states complete |

---

## PHASE 1: THINK (Mandatory Discovery)

**STOP. Do NOT write any code until these questions are answered.**

### 1.1 User Understanding

Ask or determine these BEFORE designing:

```
WHO is the user?
├── Demographics (age, tech proficiency, device usage)
├── Goals (what are they trying to accomplish?)
├── Context (where/when will they use this?)
└── Pain points (what frustrates them currently?)

WHAT problem does this solve?
├── Primary user task (the main job-to-be-done)
├── Secondary tasks (supporting actions)
├── Success criteria (how does user know they succeeded?)
└── Failure modes (what happens when things go wrong?)

WHY would users choose this over alternatives?
├── Unique value proposition
├── Competitive advantage
└── User motivation (convenience, speed, trust, delight?)
```

### 1.2 Technical Context

```
CONSTRAINTS:
├── Framework: React / Vue / Vanilla / Other?
├── Existing design system: Yes / No / Partial?
├── Performance budget: Critical / Normal / Flexible?
├── Browser support: Modern only / Legacy required?
└── Accessibility level: WCAG A / AA / AAA?

INTEGRATION:
├── Does this fit into existing UI?
├── What patterns already exist in the codebase?
├── What components can be reused?
└── What's the deployment target?
```

### 1.3 User Psychology Checkpoint

Before proceeding, consider:

| Mental Model | Question |
|--------------|----------|
| **Expectations** | What does the user expect to see based on similar products? |
| **Cognitive Load** | How much information can they process at once? |
| **Decision Fatigue** | How many choices are we asking them to make? |
| **Trust Signals** | What makes them feel safe/confident? |
| **Error Recovery** | How do they fix mistakes? |

**Output from Phase 1:** Document answers to these questions. If answers are unknown, ASK THE USER before proceeding.

### 1.4 If User Cannot Answer Discovery Questions

When user lacks context for Phase 1 questions:

```
FALLBACK APPROACH:
1. Document assumptions explicitly in component plan
2. Default to conservative choices:
   ├── WCAG 2.2 AA compliance
   ├── Mobile-first approach
   ├── Standard industry conventions
   └── 44px touch targets (exceeds WCAG 2.2 AA minimum)
3. Mark assumptions for later validation
4. Proceed with clearly stated caveats
```

---

## PHASE 2: PLAN (Design Decisions)

### 2.1 Information Architecture

Before visual design, structure the information:

```
CONTENT HIERARCHY:
├── What's the #1 thing users must see/do? → Make it PRIMARY
├── What supports the primary action? → Make it SECONDARY
├── What's rarely needed? → Make it TERTIARY or hide
└── What can be removed entirely? → DELETE IT

NAVIGATION MENTAL MODEL:
├── How does user expect to move through this?
├── What's the mental map they'll build?
├── Where might they get lost?
└── How do they return to safety?
```

### 2.2 Aesthetic Direction Selection

Choose ONE direction based on user psychology:

| Direction | Best For | User Psychology |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| **Brutally Minimal** | Pro tools, dashboards | Users value efficiency, hate clutter |
| **Maximalist** | Creative, entertainment | Users seek inspiration, exploration |
| **Retro-Futuristic** | Tech products, gaming | Users want to feel cutting-edge |
| **Organic/Natural** | Wellness, sustainability | Users value calm, authenticity |
| **Luxury/Refined** | Premium products | Users expect exclusivity, quality |
| **Editorial/Magazine** | Content-heavy, media | Users want to browse, discover |
| **Brutalist/Raw** | Dev tools, tech-forward | Users appreciate honesty, function |
| **Playful/Toy-like** | Consumer apps, games | Users want delight, fun |

**Decision Documentation:**
```
AESTHETIC CHOICE: [Selected Direction]
RATIONALE: [Why this fits the user/context]
KEY CHARACTERISTICS: [3-5 specific traits to implement]
```

### 2.3 Component Planning

For each component, decide BEFORE building:

```
COMPONENT: [Name]
├── PURPOSE: What job does this do?
├── USER EXPECTATION: What do they expect it to look like/behave?
├── STATES NEEDED: [default, hover, focus, active, disabled, loading, error, success]
├── RESPONSIVE BEHAVIOR: How does it adapt?
├── ACCESSIBILITY: How do screen readers announce it?
└── CONVENTION CHECK: What do GitHub/Stripe/Google do?
```

**Output from Phase 2:** Component plan with rationale for each decision.

## PHASE 3: BUILD (Implementation)

### 3.1 Design Tokens First

Before writing component code, establish tokens for:

| Category | Examples | Count |
|----------|----------|-------|
| **Typography** | `--font-size-xs` to `--font-size-3xl`, line heights | ~12 tokens |
| **Spacing** | 8-point grid: 4px, 8px, 12px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px, 64px | ~8 tokens |
| **Colors** | Primary, secondary, success, warning, error, text, background, border | ~15 tokens |
| **Effects** | `--focus-ring`, `--transition-fast`, shadows | ~6 tokens |

**For complete token system with examples: See references/design-system.md**

### 3.2 Component States Implementation

**EVERY interactive element MUST have these states:**

| State | CSS Selector | Visual Change | Purpose |
|-------|--------------|---------------|---------|
| Default | `.btn` | Base appearance | Normal state |
| Hover | `.btn:hover` | Lighten/darken 10% | Mouse feedback |
| Focus | `.btn:focus-visible` | Focus ring (REQUIRED) | Keyboard navigation |
| Active | `.btn:active` | Scale down slightly | Click feedback |
| Disabled | `.btn:disabled` | 50% opacity, no pointer | Unavailable |
| Loading | `.btn.loading` | Spinner, disabled | Processing |

**Key implementation points:**
- `min-height: 44px; min-width: 44px` for touch targets
- `:focus-visible` with `box-shadow: var(--focus-ring)` for accessibility
- `transition: var(--transition-fast)` for smooth state changes

**For complete CSS implementations: See references/component-states.md**

### 3.3 Layout Conventions

**Button Order (CRITICAL - Industry Standard):** Secondary LEFT, Primary RIGHT

Evidence: GitHub, Stripe, Google, Notion, Figma all follow this pattern.

**For complete conventions with evidence: See references/industry-conventions.md**

### 3.4 Responsive Implementation

**Breakpoints (mobile-first):** 640px (sm) → 768px (md) → 1024px (lg) → 1280px (xl) → 1536px (2xl)

**Touch Targets (MANDATORY):** 44×44px minimum on all interactive elements (exceeds WCAG 2.2 AA 24px requirement)

**For complete responsive patterns: See references/mobile-responsive.md**

## PHASE 4: VALIDATE (Quality Assurance)

### 4.1 Accessibility Checklist

| Check | Standard | How to Test |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Color contrast | 4.5:1 normal, 3:1 large | Browser DevTools or WebAIM checker |
| Focus visible | All interactive elements | Tab through entire page |
| Labels present | All inputs have labels | Inspect form elements |
| Alt text | All meaningful images | Check img tags |
| Keyboard navigation | Everything accessible | Unplug mouse, use only keyboard |
| Screen reader | Logical reading order | Use VoiceOver/NVDA |

For complete accessibility guide: See references/accessibility.md

### 4.2 3-Dimension UI Evaluation

For ANY component, evaluate:

| Dimension | What to Check | Pass Criteria |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| **Position** | Location relative to other elements | Follows conventions, discoverable |
| **Visual Weight** | Prominence vs other elements | Clear hierarchy, primary stands out |
| **Spacing** | Gap from adjacent elements | Consistent, adequate separation |

**Evaluation Output Format:**
```markdown
## [Component] Evaluation

### Current State
- Position: [Description]
- Visual Weight: [Description]
- Spacing: [Measurements]

### Verdict: [CORRECT / NEEDS CHANGES]

### Issues (if any)
| Priority | Issue | Fix |
|----------|-------|-----|
| P1 | [Critical UX break] | [Specific fix] |
| P2 | [Suboptimal] | [Specific fix] |
| P3 | [Polish] | [Specific fix] |
```

For complete evaluation framework: See references/evaluation-framework.md

|--------------|---------|-----|
| Designing before understanding users | Solves wrong problem | Complete Phase 1 first |
| Icon-only buttons | Not understandable | Add labels |
| Primary LEFT, Secondary RIGHT | Breaks convention | Reverse order |
| Touch targets < 44px | Unusable on mobile | Increase size |
| No focus states | Fails accessibility | Add focus-visible |
| Placeholder as label | Disappears on input | Use real labels |
| Same styling primary/secondary | No hierarchy | Differentiate visually |
| Generic fonts (Inter/Roboto) | AI slop aesthetic | Choose distinctive fonts |
