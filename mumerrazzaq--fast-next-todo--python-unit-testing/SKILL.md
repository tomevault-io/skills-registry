# Python Unit Testing with Pytest

This skill provides a structured workflow and resources for writing effective unit tests in Python using the `pytest` framework.

## Core Workflow

1.  **Setup (`pytest.ini`, `conftest.py`)**: If the project doesn't have a testing setup, copy the templates from the `assets/` directory.
    -   `assets/pytest.ini`: Standard pytest and coverage configuration.
    -   `assets/conftest.py`: Reusable fixtures, including mocks for a database and an API client.
2.  **Create Test File**: For a given source file `path/to/module.py`, create a corresponding test file `tests/path/to/test_module.py`.
    -   For guidance, read `references/01_organization.md`.
    -   Follow the naming conventions in `references/02_naming_conventions.md`.
3.  **Write Tests**: Write test functions using the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern.
    -   Start with a template from `assets/templates/`.
        -   `simple_test.py`: For basic tests.
        -   `parameterized_test.py`: For testing with multiple inputs.
        -   `mocking_test.py`: For testing code with external dependencies.
4.  **Run and Iterate**: Run `pytest` and use the output to refine tests. If coverage is configured, use the report to find untested code.

## Reference Guides

When you need to implement a specific pattern, consult the relevant reference guide. Read them as needed.

-   **`references/01_organization.md`**: How to structure your `tests` directory.
-   **`references/02_naming_conventions.md`**: How to name test files and functions.
-   **`references/03_fixtures.md`**: How to use `pytest` fixtures for setup and teardown.
-   **`references/04_mocking.md`**: How to mock external dependencies like APIs and databases.
-   **`references/05_parameterization.md`**: How to run one test with multiple different inputs.
-   **`references/06_assertions.md`**: Best practices for `assert` statements and checking for exceptions.
-   **`references/07_coverage.md`**: How to measure and interpret test coverage.

Always start by using the templates in `assets/` as a base for new test files.
