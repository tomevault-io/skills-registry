# Doc Sync Skill

> **Purpose**: Automate document sync across agents so plan changes, progress, and open questions update in real time
> **When to use**: After Codex Validator completes, after Requirements Completion Check, before Documentation Finalize
> **Outputs**: `{tasksRoot}/{feature-name}/context.md`, `pending-questions.md`, `flow-report.md`

---

## Goals

### Problems
- **Previous system**: docs updated only by Documentation Agent
- **No mid-step sync**: Validator plan edits not reflected immediately
- **Delayed feedback loop**: Implementation Agent references stale context.md

### Solution
- Update context.md immediately after Codex Validator
- Track real-time progress (flow-report.md)
- Centralize open questions (pending-questions.md)

---

## Auto-trigger points

### 1. After Codex Validator completes
- Apply Validator auto_apply items to context.md
- Add new recommendations to pending-questions.md
- Mark "Planning complete" in flow-report.md

### 2. After Requirements Completion Check
- Add incomplete items to pending-questions.md
- Record "Implementation re-run" in flow-report.md

### 3. Before Documentation Finalize
- Final sync (ensure all docs are current)
- Clear pending-questions.md or mark as Resolved
- Mark flow-report.md as complete

---

## Input format

### YAML (recommended)

```yaml
feature_name: batch-management
updates:
  - file: context.md
    section: Phase 1
    action: append
    content: "Strengthen date input validation: limit to past 30 days"
  - file: pending-questions.md
    action: add_question
    priority: MEDIUM
    content: "Should error messages use Toast?"
    context: "Improve user experience"
  - file: flow-report.md
    action: update_phase
    phase: Planning
    status: completed
```

### Manual trigger (user direct)

```
doc-sync start: batch-management
  - context.md: update Phase 1
  - pending-questions.md: add 1 item
  - flow-report.md: Planning complete
```

---

## Supported files and actions

### 1. context.md

#### Action: `append` (add to end of section)
```yaml
file: context.md

## Action required
- Check context.md section structure
- Create flow-report.md manually

## Partial success
1/3 files updated
```

## Usage scenarios

### Scenario 1: Apply Codex Validator feedback automatically

**Validator output**:
```yaml
status: pass_with_changes
auto_apply:
  - priority: HIGH
    target: context.md
    section: Phase 1
    content: "Strengthen date input validation: limit to past 30 days"
user_confirm:
  - priority: MEDIUM
    content: "Recommend changing error messages to Toast"
```

**Doc Sync run**:
```yaml
feature_name: batch-management
updates:
  - file: context.md
    section: Phase 1
    action: append
    content: "### Validator Feedback (HIGH)
- Strengthen date input validation: limit to past 30 days"
  - file: pending-questions.md
    action: add_question
    priority: MEDIUM
    content: "Should we change error messages to Toast?"
    context: "Validator recommendation"
  - file: flow-report.md
    action: add_event
    event: "Validator feedback applied"
    description: "context.md updated + 1 pending question added"
```

**Result**:
- Implementation Agent reads latest context.md and applies date validation
- User answers pending-questions about Toast

---

### Scenario 2: Re-run after Requirements Completion Check

**Moonshot Agent Completion Check result**:
```yaml
status: incomplete
incomplete_items:
  - "Add error alert"
  - "Configure menu/permissions"
```

**Doc Sync run**:
```yaml
feature_name: batch-management
updates:
  - file: pending-questions.md
    action: add_question
    priority: HIGH
    content: "Implement error alert handling"
    context: "Completion Check: missing in preliminary agreement"
  - file: pending-questions.md
    action: add_question
    priority: HIGH
    content: "Configure menu/permissions"
    context: "context.md Phase 3 checkpoint incomplete"
  - file: flow-report.md
    action: update_phase
    phase: Implementation
    status: "re-run required"
```

**Result**:
- Re-run Implementation Agent (only incomplete items)
- flow-report.md records the re-run

---

### Scenario 3: Final sync before Documentation Finalize

**Documentation Agent request**:
```yaml
feature_name: batch-management
updates:
  - file: context.md
    section: "Final State"
    action: append
    content: "- [x] All phases complete
- [x] Verification passed
- [x] Documentation complete"
  - file: pending-questions.md
    action: clear
    archive: true
  - file: flow-report.md
    action: update_phase
    phase: Documentation
    status: completed
```

**Result**:
- pending-questions.md cleared (resolved items moved to archives)
- flow-report.md marked complete
- context.md updated with final state

---

## Tips

### 1. Avoid conflicts
- Detect simultaneous updates by comparing timestamps
- Notify user and resolve manually on conflict

### 2. Versioning (optional)
- Backup prior versions for important changes
- Store as context-v1.md, context-v2.md

### 3. Rollback support
- Save snapshot before last change
- Restore immediately on failure

### 4. Verification automation
- Validate file structure after updates
- Check required sections are present

---

## Expected impact

### Qualitative impact
1. **Real-time feedback loop**: Validator -> Doc Sync -> Implementation (immediate reflection)
2. **Document consistency**: all agents reference the latest docs
3. **Centralized open questions**: pending-questions.md as the source of truth
4. **Progress transparency**: real-time tracking via flow-report.md

### Quantitative impact
- **Feedback turnaround**: manual 10m -> instant (100% reduction)
- **Doc mismatch errors**: 30% -> 0% (eliminated)
- **Rework prevention**: instant feedback saves ~15m on average

---

## Implementation details

### Quality bar
- Preserve existing content (do not change section structure)
- Prevent conflicts (detect concurrent updates)
- Ensure atomicity (rollback on partial failure)
- Automate validation (check structure after updates)

### Error handling
1. **Missing file**: auto-create (use template)
2. **Missing section**: warn and append to end
3. **Concurrent update conflict**: compare timestamps and notify user
4. **Format error**: validation fails -> rollback

### Logging
- Record all updates in flow-report.md automatically
- Include timestamp, changed files, change details
- Store detailed logs on failure

**Enabling this skill keeps all docs in real-time sync.**
