# Mux Video Platform

Comprehensive guide to building video applications with Mux, the developer-first video infrastructure platform. This skill covers video streaming, live streaming, player integrations, analytics with Mux Data, and AI-powered workflows. Whether you are building a video-on-demand platform, live streaming application, or integrating video into an existing product, this documentation provides the patterns and code examples needed to ship quickly.

## Key Capabilities

- **Video Hosting and Streaming**: Upload, transcode, and deliver video content globally via adaptive bitrate streaming (HLS)
- **Live Streaming**: Real-time video broadcasting with RTMP/SRT ingest, low-latency options, and automatic recording
- **Mux Player**: Drop-in video player components for web (React, vanilla JS), iOS, and Android with built-in analytics
- **Mux Data**: Quality of experience analytics, engagement metrics, and real-time monitoring
- **Content Security**: Signed playback URLs, DRM protection (Widevine/FairPlay), and domain restrictions
- **AI Workflows**: Automatic chapter generation, video summarization, content moderation, and audio dubbing

## Quick Start

Get streaming in five minutes:

1. **Create an API Access Token** in the [Mux Dashboard](https://dashboard.mux.com/settings/access-tokens) with Video Read and Write permissions

2. **Create a video asset** from a URL:
```bash
curl https://api.mux.com/video/v1/assets \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -X POST \
  -d '{ "input": [{ "url": "https://muxed.s3.amazonaws.com/leds.mp4" }], "playback_policy": ["public"] }' \
  -u ${MUX_TOKEN_ID}:${MUX_TOKEN_SECRET}
```

3. **Play the video** using the returned playback ID:
```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@mux/mux-player"></script>
<mux-player playback-id="YOUR_PLAYBACK_ID"></mux-player>
```

See [examples/quickstart-stream-video.md](examples/quickstart-stream-video.md) for the complete walkthrough with SDK examples in Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, and PHP.

## Important Notes

### API Authentication

All Mux API requests require authentication using a Token ID and Token Secret. API requests must be made from a server environment - the API does not support CORS and credentials should never be exposed in client-side code.

### Playback IDs vs Asset IDs

- **Asset IDs** are used to manage content via the API (`api.mux.com`)
- **Playback IDs** are used to stream content to viewers (`stream.mux.com`)
- An asset can have multiple playback IDs with different policies (public vs signed)

### Webhooks vs Polling

Always prefer webhooks over polling to track asset status. Webhooks provide real-time notifications when assets are ready, live streams change state, or uploads complete. Configure webhooks per environment in the Mux Dashboard.

### Video Quality Tiers

Mux offers different video quality tiers (basic, plus, premium) that affect encoding quality and pricing. Choose the appropriate tier based on your content type and quality requirements.

### Stream Key Security

Live stream keys should be treated as secrets. Anyone with the stream key can broadcast to your live stream. Reset keys immediately if compromised.
