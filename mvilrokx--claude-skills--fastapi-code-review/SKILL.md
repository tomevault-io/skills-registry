# FastAPI Code Review

Perform comprehensive code reviews of FastAPI projects against industry best practices, identifying violations and generating actionable refactor plans.

## Review Process

### 1. Gather Project Context

Before reviewing, collect information about the project:

```
- Project structure (list_dir on root and key directories)
- Main application entry point (typically main.py or app.py)
- Router definitions and API endpoints
- Pydantic models/schemas
- Database models and connections
- Dependencies and middleware
- Configuration management
- Test files
```

### 2. Execute Review Checklist

Evaluate each category against the best practices in [references/best-practices.md](references/best-practices.md).

**Review Categories:**

1. Project Structure
2. Async/Sync Patterns
3. Pydantic Usage
4. Dependency Injection
5. API Design (REST)
6. Database Patterns
7. Testing Patterns
8. Configuration Management
9. Performance Optimizations
10. Documentation

### 3. Generate Refactor Plan

For each violation found, document:

```markdown
## Refactor Plan

### Critical Issues (Fix Immediately)
| Issue | Location | Best Practice Violated | Refactor Action |
|-------|----------|------------------------|-----------------|
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

### High Priority (Fix Soon)
| Issue | Location | Best Practice Violated | Refactor Action |
|-------|----------|------------------------|-----------------|
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Medium Priority (Plan for Refactor)
| Issue | Location | Best Practice Violated | Refactor Action |
|-------|----------|------------------------|-----------------|
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)
| Issue | Location | Best Practice Violated | Refactor Action |
|-------|----------|------------------------|-----------------|
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
```

## Quick Reference: Common Violations

### Critical (Blocking Event Loop)

- `time.sleep()` in async routes → Use `asyncio.sleep()` or make route sync
- Sync database calls in async routes → Use async database drivers
- Sync HTTP calls in async routes → Use `httpx.AsyncClient`

### High Priority (Performance/Security)

- Missing indexes on frequently queried columns
- N+1 query patterns
- Hardcoded secrets → Use environment variables
- Missing rate limiting on public endpoints
- `SELECT *` queries → Select only needed columns

### Medium Priority (Maintainability)

- God routers with too many endpoints → Split by domain
- Missing dependency injection for validation
- Sync dependencies in async context
- No custom base Pydantic model
- Missing type hints

### Low Priority (Polish)

- Missing OpenAPI documentation
- Inconsistent naming conventions
- Missing pre-commit hooks with ruff

## Output Format

Generate a comprehensive review report:

```markdown
# FastAPI Code Review Report

## Executive Summary
- **Project**: [name]
- **Review Date**: [date]
- **Overall Health**: [Critical/Needs Work/Good/Excellent]
- **Total Issues Found**: [count]
