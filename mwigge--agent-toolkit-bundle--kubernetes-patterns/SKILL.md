# Container Orchestration Patterns

## When to activate
- Designing pod configurations and sidecar patterns
- Setting resource requests, limits, and QoS classes
- Configuring RBAC roles and bindings
- Writing or reviewing network policies
- Setting up GitOps deployment pipelines
- Implementing progressive delivery (canary, blue-green)
- Configuring health checks and probes
- Designing autoscaling strategies
- Managing secrets and configuration
- Planning namespace and multi-tenancy strategy

---

## Pod Design Patterns

### Sidecar

A helper container that extends the main container's functionality without modifying it:

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
    - name: app
      image: myapp:1.2.0
      ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
    - name: log-forwarder
      image: fluentbit:2.1
      volumeMounts:
        - name: app-logs
          mountPath: /var/log/app
  volumes:
    - name: app-logs
      emptyDir: {}
```

**Use cases**: log forwarding, metrics collection, TLS termination, service mesh proxies.

**Rules**:
- Sidecar must not depend on the main container's startup order (use init containers for sequencing)
- Sidecar should have independent resource requests/limits
- Sidecar failures should not crash the main container unless the sidecar is critical

### Init Container

Runs to completion before app containers start. Use for setup tasks:

```yaml
spec:
  initContainers:
    - name: db-migration
      image: migrate:latest
      command: ["migrate", "-path", "/migrations", "-database", "$(DB_URL)", "up"]
      env:
        - name: DB_URL
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: db-credentials
              key: url
  containers:
    - name: app
      image: myapp:1.2.0
```

**Use cases**: database migrations, config file generation, dependency health checks, permission setup.

### Ambassador

A proxy container that simplifies access to external services:

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
    - name: app
      image: myapp:1.2.0
      # App connects to localhost:6379 — ambassador handles routing
    - name: redis-proxy
      image: redis-proxy:1.0
      ports:
        - containerPort: 6379
      env:
        - name: REDIS_CLUSTER
          value: "redis-cluster.prod.svc.cluster.local:6379"
```

**Use cases**: connection pooling, protocol translation, service discovery abstraction.

---

## Resource Management

### Requests and Limits

```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: 100m        # Guaranteed minimum — used for scheduling
    memory: 128Mi    # Guaranteed minimum — OOM killed if node is overcommitted
  limits:
    cpu: 500m        # Throttled above this — never OOM killed for CPU
    memory: 256Mi    # OOM killed if exceeded
```

### QoS Classes

| Class | Condition | Behaviour |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| **Guaranteed** | requests == limits for all containers | Last to be evicted; most predictable |
| **Burstable** | At least one container has requests < limits | Evicted after BestEffort |
| **BestEffort** | No requests or limits set | First to be evicted; never use in production |

**Rules**:
- Always set both requests and limits for production workloads — never deploy BestEffort
- Set memory limits close to requests (1.5-2x) — large gaps waste node capacity
- CPU limits are optional for non-latency-sensitive workloads — CPU is compressible
- Use vertical pod autoscaler (VPA) recommendations to right-size after initial deployment
- Monitor actual usage vs. requests to identify over-provisioning

---

## RBAC Design

### Least Privilege Principle

```yaml
# ✅ Namespace-scoped Role — preferred
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: payment-api
  name: deployment-manager
rules:
  - apiGroups: ["apps"]
    resources: ["deployments"]
    verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "update", "patch"]
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["pods"]
    verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["pods/log"]
    verbs: ["get"]

---
# Bind to a service account
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  namespace: payment-api
  name: ci-deployment-manager
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: ci-deployer
    namespace: payment-api
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: deployment-manager
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

**Rules**:
- Prefer namespace-scoped `Role` over cluster-wide `ClusterRole`
- Use `ClusterRole` only for resources that are cluster-scoped (nodes, namespaces, PVs)
- Never grant `*` (wildcard) verbs or resources in production
- Use separate service accounts per workload — never use the `default` service account
- Audit RBAC bindings quarterly — remove stale bindings
- CI/CD service accounts should only have deploy permissions, not cluster-admin

---

## Network Policies

### Default Deny + Explicit Allow

```yaml
# Step 1: Default deny all ingress and egress in the namespace
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: default-deny-all
  namespace: payment-api
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
    - Ingress
    - Egress

---
# Step 2: Allow specific traffic
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-api-ingress
  namespace: payment-api
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: payment-api
  policyTypes:
    - Ingress
    - Egress
  ingress:
    - from:
        - namespaceSelector:
            matchLabels:
              name: api-gateway
        - podSelector:
            matchLabels:
              app: api-gateway
      ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 8080
  egress:
    - to:
        - namespaceSelector:
            matchLabels:
              name: payment-api
        - podSelector:
            matchLabels:
              app: postgres
      ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 5432
    - to:  # Allow DNS resolution
        - namespaceSelector: {}
          podSelector:
            matchLabels:
              k8s-app: kube-dns
      ports:
        - protocol: UDP
          port: 53
```

**Rules**:
- Start with default-deny in every namespace — then allowlist
- Always allow DNS egress (port 53 UDP) or pods cannot resolve service names
- Test network policies in staging before applying to production
- Network policies are additive — multiple policies are OR'd together
- Verify your CNI plugin supports NetworkPolicy (not all do)

---

## GitOps Deployment

Manage cluster state declaratively through version control:

**Principles**:
- The Git repository is the single source of truth for desired cluster state
- All changes go through pull/merge requests with review
- An operator continuously reconciles cluster state with the repository
- Manual `kubectl apply` is prohibited in production

**Repository structure**:
```
gitops-repo/
  base/                    # Shared manifests
    payment-api/
      deployment.yaml
      service.yaml
      kustomization.yaml
  overlays/
    dev/
      kustomization.yaml   # Dev-specific patches (replicas, resources)
    staging/
      kustomization.yaml
    prod/
      kustomization.yaml
```

**Rules**:
- Use Kustomize overlays or Helm values files for environment-specific differences
- Never use `kubectl apply` directly in production — all changes go through Git
- Image tags must be immutable (use digests or semver tags, never `latest`)
- Separate application repositories from GitOps configuration repositories

---

## Progressive Delivery

### Canary Deployment

Route a small percentage of traffic to the new version before full rollout:

```
v1 (95% traffic) ◄──── Load Balancer ────► v2 (5% traffic)
        │                                         │
        └── Monitor error rate, latency ──────────┘
            If healthy → increase to 25%, 50%, 100%
            If unhealthy → rollback to 100% v1
```

**Promotion criteria**:
- Error rate < baseline + 0.5%
- p99 latency < baseline + 20%
- No increase in 5xx responses

### Blue-Green Deployment

Run two identical environments; switch traffic atomically:

```
Blue (v1) ◄──── Active traffic
Green (v2) ◄── Idle (pre-validated)

Switch: Blue becomes idle, Green becomes active
Rollback: Reverse the switch (instant)
```

### Rolling Update (Default)

```yaml
spec:
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxUnavailable: 0       # Never reduce below desired count
      maxSurge: 1             # Add one new pod at a time
  minReadySeconds: 30         # Wait 30s after ready before continuing
```

**Rules**:
- Use `maxUnavailable: 0` for zero-downtime deployments
- Set `minReadySeconds` to allow the new pod to warm up before continuing
- Always have readiness probes configured — rolling updates depend on them

---

## Health Checks

### Probe Types

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
    - name: app
      livenessProbe:
        httpGet:
          path: /healthz
          port: 8080
        initialDelaySeconds: 15
        periodSeconds: 10
        failureThreshold: 3      # 3 failures → restart container
      readinessProbe:
        httpGet:
          path: /ready
          port: 8080
        initialDelaySeconds: 5
        periodSeconds: 5
        failureThreshold: 2      # 2 failures → remove from service
      startupProbe:
        httpGet:
          path: /healthz
          port: 8080
        initialDelaySeconds: 0
        periodSeconds: 5
        failureThreshold: 30     # 30 * 5s = 150s max startup time
```

| Probe | Purpose | On failure |
|-------|---------|------------|
| **Startup** | Slow-starting apps; protects liveness probe during startup | Restart after `failureThreshold * periodSeconds` |
| **Liveness** | Detect deadlocks and unrecoverable states | Restart the container |
| **Readiness** | Determine if pod can accept traffic | Remove from Service endpoints |

**Rules**:
- Liveness checks should test only if the process is alive — not downstream dependencies
- Readiness checks should test if the pod can serve traffic — including critical dependencies
- Use startup probes for applications with variable startup times (JVM, ML model loading)
- Never make liveness probes depend on external services — a database outage should not restart all pods
- Set `initialDelaySeconds` based on actual startup time; use startup probes instead of long delays

---

## Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)

```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: payment-api
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: payment-api
  minReplicas: 2
  maxReplicas: 10
  metrics:
    - type: Resource
      resource:
        name: cpu
        target:
          type: Utilization
          averageUtilization: 70
    - type: Resource
      resource:
        name: memory
        target:
          type: Utilization
          averageUtilization: 80
  behavior:
    scaleDown:
      stabilizationWindowSeconds: 300    # Wait 5 min before scaling down
      policies:
        - type: Percent
          value: 25                      # Remove max 25% of pods per period
          periodSeconds: 60
    scaleUp:
      stabilizationWindowSeconds: 30
      policies:
        - type: Pods
          value: 2                       # Add max 2 pods per period
          periodSeconds: 60
```

**Rules**:
- Always set `minReplicas >= 2` for production workloads (high availability)
- Scale down slowly (5 min stabilisation) to avoid flapping
- Scale up quickly (30s stabilisation) to handle traffic spikes
- Use custom metrics (requests per second, queue depth) when CPU/memory is not the bottleneck
- HPA and VPA should not target the same resource — use one or the other

---

## ConfigMap and Secret Management

### External Secrets Pattern

Sync secrets from an external store into Kubernetes Secrets:

```yaml
apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1beta1
kind: ExternalSecret
metadata:
  name: db-credentials
  namespace: payment-api
spec:
  refreshInterval: 1h
  secretStoreRef:
    name: vault-backend
    kind: ClusterSecretStore
  target:
    name: db-credentials
    creationPolicy: Owner
  data:
    - secretKey: username
      remoteRef:
        key: secret/data/payment-api/db
        property: username
    - secretKey: password
      remoteRef:
        key: secret/data/payment-api/db
        property: password
```

**Rules**:
- Never store secrets in Git — use external secret stores synced via operators
- Use `refreshInterval` to rotate secrets automatically
- Mount secrets as files, not environment variables, when the secret may contain special characters
- Use separate secrets per application — never share a secret across namespaces
- ConfigMaps are for non-sensitive configuration — never put credentials in ConfigMaps

---

## Namespace Strategy

| Strategy | When to use | Trade-off |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| Per-team | Teams manage their own resources | Simple RBAC, potential resource contention |
| Per-environment | dev/staging/prod in same cluster | Clear separation, but cluster-wide failures affect all |
| Per-service | One namespace per microservice | Fine-grained isolation, many namespaces to manage |
| Hybrid | Per-team + per-environment | Most common in production; team-dev, team-staging, team-prod |

**Rules**:
- Apply resource quotas to every namespace to prevent one team from starving others
- Apply limit ranges to set default resource requests/limits for pods without explicit settings
- Use namespace labels for network policy selectors
- Production and non-production workloads should run on separate clusters, not just separate namespaces

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: team-quota
  namespace: payment-team-prod
spec:
  hard:
    requests.cpu: "8"
    requests.memory: 16Gi
    limits.cpu: "16"
    limits.memory: 32Gi
    pods: "50"
```

---

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-pattern | Problem | Fix |
|-------------|---------|-----|
| Privileged containers | Full host access; container escape = root on node | Set `securityContext.privileged: false`, use `securityContext.capabilities.drop: ["ALL"]` |
| `latest` image tag | Non-deterministic deployments; rollbacks impossible | Use immutable tags (semver or digest) |
| No resource limits | Pods can consume unbounded resources; OOM kills neighbours | Set requests and limits on every container |
| Running as root | Compromise of container = root access | Set `runAsNonRoot: true`, `runAsUser: 1000` |
| No network policies | All pods can communicate with all other pods | Default-deny per namespace, explicit allow rules |
| Secrets in ConfigMaps | Plaintext credentials visible to anyone with namespace access | Use Kubernetes Secrets (encrypted at rest) or external secret stores |
| Single replica in production | No high availability; any failure causes downtime | `minReplicas: 2` minimum, with pod anti-affinity |
| No pod disruption budget | Cluster upgrades or node drains take down all replicas | Set PDB with `minAvailable` or `maxUnavailable` |
| Hardcoded image registry | Cannot migrate to different registry; vendor lock-in | Use variables or Kustomize for registry prefix |
| No liveness/readiness probes | Orchestrator cannot detect unhealthy pods | Configure appropriate probes for every container |
