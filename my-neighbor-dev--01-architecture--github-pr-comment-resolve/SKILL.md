# Resolve PR Comments

Systematically address code review comments.

## Steps

1.  **Fetch Comments**
    -   Get PR number: `gh pr view --json number`
    -   Get unresolved comments:
        ```bash
        gh api /repos/:owner/:repo/pulls/<PR_NUM>/comments --jq '.[] | select(.position != null) | {id: .id, path: .path, body: .body}'
        ```

2.  **Analyze & Plan**
    -   List comments and propose actions (Accept/Question/Refuse).

3.  **Fix & Verify**
    -   Apply code changes.
    -   Run verification: `./scripts/check-all.sh`.

4.  **Push**
    -   `git push origin HEAD`

5.  **Reply & Resolve**
    -   Reply to comments using `gh api`.
    -   Resolve threads using GraphQL (advanced) or manual verification.

## Tip
-   Always verify before pushing.
-   Write replies in Korean.
