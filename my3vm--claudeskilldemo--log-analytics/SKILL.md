# Log Analytics Skill

**Purpose**: Generate and execute Python code to analyze large log datasets, detect patterns, and extract actionable insights.

**When to Use**: When you need to analyze 500+ log entries, detect error patterns, calculate statistics, or perform time-series analysis on log data.

**🚨 CRITICAL SECURITY RULE:**
**ALL file paths MUST be relative to project directory and start with `analytics/`**
**NEVER use `/tmp/`, `/private/tmp/`, or any paths outside the project workspace**

---

## 🎯 Skill Overview

This skill guides you through:
1. **Fetching** raw log data (1000+ entries)
2. **Generating** Python analysis code tailored to the data structure
3. **Executing** the code and interpreting results

**CRITICAL**: This skill uses progressive disclosure. You MUST read phase files in order.

---

## 🚀 Workflow

**MANDATORY FIRST STEP:**

Before using any tools, use the Read tool to read:

`.claude/skills/log-analytics/phases/data-fetch.md`

This file contains Phase 1 instructions and tells you which file to read next.

**DO NOT proceed with tool calls until you've read Phase 1.**

The complete workflow consists of 3 phases:

1. **Data Fetch** (1-2 min) → `phases/data-fetch.md`
2. **Code Generation** (2-3 min) → `phases/code-generation.md`
3. **Analysis Execution** (1-2 min) → `phases/analysis-execution.md`

Each phase file contains a "Next Step" section directing you to the next phase.

---

## 🔑 Key Principles

**Progressive Disclosure**: Phase files reveal detailed instructions progressively. Read each phase file in sequence - do not skip ahead or assume you know what to do.

**Dynamic Code Generation**: Generate Python code based on the ACTUAL log structure returned. Don't use generic templates.

**Structured Output**: Always provide analysis results in JSON format with counts, percentages, and trends.

**Save Your Work**: Save generated scripts to `analytics/` directory for reuse and auditing.

---

## 📊 Expected Outputs

By the end of this skill execution, you will have:

1. **Raw log data** saved to `analytics/incident_logs.json`
2. **Python analysis script** saved to `analytics/parse_logs_[timestamp].py`
3. **Analysis results** in JSON format showing:
   - Error counts by type
   - Time-based error distribution
   - Service-level breakdown
   - Performance metrics (p95, p99)
   - Detected anomalies

---

## 🔗 Integration

This skill can be invoked by other skills (e.g., `incident-analysis`) when they need deep log analysis.

**From incident-analysis skill:**
```
When log data exceeds 500 entries, invoke the log-analytics skill:
Use Skill tool → "log-analytics"
```

---

## 📁 MCP Tools Used

This skill requires the **log-analytics-server** MCP server, which provides:

- `get_raw_logs(incident_id, timeframe)` - Fetch large log datasets
- `execute_analysis_script(script_path)` - Run generated Python code
