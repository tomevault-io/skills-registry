# Healthcare UX Standards

Comprehensive user experience standards ensuring accessibility, patient safety, and usability for healthcare management applications including Hospital Information Systems (HIS), Electronic Medical Records (EMR/EHR), clinic management software, patient portals, and telehealth platforms.

## When This Skill Activates

- Designing healthcare application interfaces (HIS, EMR, clinic management)
- Creating patient portal experiences
- Building telehealth platforms
- Implementing healthcare forms and workflows
- Conducting accessibility audits for healthcare apps
- Writing error messages, notifications, or system feedback
- Reviewing mobile health applications
- Implementing healthcare AI/chatbot interfaces

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Accessibility is Patient Safety

**WCAG 2.2 Level AA compliance is MANDATORY** for all healthcare interfaces.

**Why it matters:**
- Healthcare access is a right, not a privilege
- Patients with disabilities must have equal access to health services
- Inaccessible interfaces create barriers to care
- Legal requirements: HHS Section 504, ADA Title III, Section 508
- Compliance deadline: May 11, 2026 (entities with 15+ employees)

### 2. Language Shapes Patient Experience

**Error messages must not alarm or undermine trust.**

**Why it matters:**
- Patients may be anxious about their health
- Healthcare professionals rely on system confidence
- Alarming language increases stress and reduces compliance
- Calm, professional tone maintains therapeutic relationship

### 3. Design for Diverse Users

**Healthcare applications serve users with varying abilities and contexts.**

**Consider:**
- Visual impairments (screen readers, magnification)
- Motor impairments (keyboard navigation, touch targets)
- Cognitive disabilities (clear language, consistent patterns)
- Auditory impairments (captions, visual alerts)
- Low health literacy (plain language, clear instructions)

---

## Quick Reference: Critical Requirements

### MUST DO (P0 Priority)

1. **Color Contrast**: 4.5:1 minimum for normal text, 3:1 for large text
2. **Focus Indicators**: Visible 3px outline on all interactive elements
3. **Touch Targets**: Minimum 24x24px (WCAG 2.2), recommended 44x44px
4. **Keyboard Navigation**: All functionality accessible via keyboard
5. **Alt Text**: All images and icons have descriptive alt attributes
6. **Form Labels**: All inputs have visible, associated labels
7. **Patient Safety Language**: NO "Error", "Failed", "Broken", "Denied"
8. **Semantic HTML**: Proper heading hierarchy, list tags, button elements
9. **Accessible Authentication**: Support password managers, biometrics (WCAG 2.2)
10. **Redundant Entry**: Auto-populate previously entered patient information (WCAG 2.2)

### NEVER DO (Critical Violations)

1. **Remove focus indicators** (`outline: none` without replacement)
2. **Use placeholder as label** (placeholders disappear on focus)
3. **Rely on color alone** for status or information
4. **Use alarming terminology** ("Fatal error", "Critical failure")
5. **Make buttons from divs** without proper ARIA roles
6. **Use images of text** instead of actual text
7. **Block keyboard navigation** (keyboard traps)
8. **Require cognitive tests for authentication** (CAPTCHAs without alternatives)
9. **Force re-entry of patient data** across form steps

## US Regulatory Framework

### Important Clarification: HIPAA Does NOT Require Accessibility

**HIPAA** (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) covers **privacy and security** of Protected Health Information (PHI) only. It does NOT address accessibility for people with disabilities.

| <15 employees | **May 10, 2027** |

**Who Must Comply:**
- Healthcare providers participating in Medicare/Medicaid
- Hospitals (Medicare Part A)
- Medical services (Medicare Part B)
- Medicare Advantage Plans
- Prescription Drug Plan sponsors
- Insurers in Healthcare.gov Marketplaces

**Covered Digital Assets:**
- Public-facing websites

**Enforcement**: DOJ enforcement + private lawsuits (2,500+ filed in 2024)

### Section 508

**Applies to**: Federal agencies, federal contractors, federally-funded programs

**Standard**: WCAG 2.0 Level AA (expected to update)

**Coverage:**
- Federal healthcare agencies (VA, NIH, CDC)
- Healthcare contractors to federal agencies
- Medicare/Medicaid systems

### 21st Century Cures Act

**Patient Portal Requirements:**
- Patients must access Electronic Health Information (EHI) "without delay" and without charge
- Information blocking is illegal
- Penalties: Up to $1,252,992 per violation (effective July 31, 2024)

**Accessibility Implication**: Patient portals must be accessible to comply with patient access rights.

### Section 1557 of the ACA

  </ul>
</div>
```

### WCAG 2.2 New Success Criteria

#### 3.3.7 Redundant Entry (Level A)

**Requirement**: Information previously entered must auto-populate or be selectable.

**Healthcare Impact**: Critical for patient registration, insurance forms, appointment scheduling.

```html
<!-- Good: Auto-populate from previous step -->
<label for="confirm-address">Confirm Address</label>
<input
  type="text"
  id="confirm-address"
  value="123 Main St, Anytown, USA 12345"
  aria-describedby="address-hint"
>
<span id="address-hint">Address from Step 1. Edit if needed.</span>
```

#### 3.3.8 Accessible Authentication (Level AA)

**Requirement**: Authentication cannot rely solely on cognitive function tests.

**Must Support:**
- Password managers (paste allowed)
- Biometric login (fingerprint, face recognition)
- Object recognition (identify photo from your photos)
- Cannot require memorization only

```html
<!-- Good: Allows paste for password managers -->
<input type="password" id="password" autocomplete="current-password">

<!-- Good: Offer biometric alternative -->
<button aria-label="Sign in with fingerprint">
  <svg aria-hidden="true"><!-- Fingerprint icon --></svg>
  Sign in with Fingerprint
</button>
```

#### 2.4.11 Focus Not Obscured (Minimum) (Level AA)

**Requirement**: Keyboard focus must not be entirely hidden by sticky headers, footers, or modals.

**Healthcare Impact**: EHR systems often have sticky navigation that can obscure focus.

```css
/* Good: Account for sticky header height */
:target {
  scroll-margin-top: 80px; /* Height of sticky header */
}

/* Good: Ensure modal doesn't obscure focus */
.modal {
  position: fixed;
  /* Trap focus within modal */
}
```

#### 3.2.6 Consistent Help (Level A)

**Requirement**: Help mechanisms must appear in consistent locations across pages.

```html
<!-- Good: Consistent help placement (e.g., bottom-right) -->
<footer class="help-footer">
  <a href="/help">Help Center</a>
  <button aria-label="Open chat support">Chat with Support</button>
  <a href="tel:+18005551234">Call: 1-800-555-1234</a>
</footer>
```

## Patient Safety Language

### Core Principle: Calm, Professional Communication

**Healthcare software must not alarm patients or undermine trust.**

### Word Substitutions

| Avoid | Use Instead |
|-------|-------------|
| Error, Failed, Broken | Unable to process, Not completed |
| Invalid, Illegal | Please check, Please verify |
| Denied, Rejected | Unable to access, Needs review |
| Crashed, Down | Temporarily unavailable |
| Fatal error, Critical failure | Please contact support, Needs immediate attention |
| Alert!, Warning! | Please note, Important |

### Message Templates

#### Form Validation

```
Bad: Error: Field required
Good: Please enter patient name

Bad: Invalid email address
Good: Please enter a valid email address (e.g., name@example.com)

Bad: Error: Value too high
Good: Quantity cannot exceed 500 (available stock)
```

#### Data Not Found

```
Bad: Fatal error: Patient record not found
Good: This patient record is not currently available.
      Please verify the patient ID or contact support if the issue persists.
```

#### Permission Issues

```
Bad: Access denied - forbidden
Good: You don't have permission to access this section.
      Please contact your administrator for assistance.
```

#### Network/System Issues

```
Bad: Server down - error 500
Good: We're experiencing technical difficulties.
      Your data is safe. Please try again in a few moments.
```

### Critical Patient Safety Alerts

**When there IS an actual safety concern, be direct:**

```
ALLERGY ALERT: Patient is allergic to Penicillin.

This medication (Amoxicillin) contains Penicillin.

Action required: Do not dispense. Select alternative medication.

[View Alternatives] [Cancel Order]
```

**Use "WARNING" or "ALERT" only for:**
- Actual patient safety risks (allergies, drug interactions)
- Regulatory compliance issues (expired medications)
- Critical system failures affecting patient care
- Data integrity issues impacting treatment decisions
