# Product Mascot Character Sheet Generator

Generate professional, magazine-style character reference sheets for product mascots with consistent layout and typography.

## Overview

This skill generates comprehensive character reference sheets with a specific layout optimized for product mascots and brand characters:

- **Left Panel (40% width, full height):** Large isometric view (3/4 angle) as the main showcase
- **Right Top Row (60% width):** Front, back, and side orthographic views
- **Right Bottom Row (60% width):** Five distinct emotion/pose variations
- **Typography:** Libre Baskerville font for professional label presentation
- **Integration:** Uses gemini-imagegen skill with quota fallback support

Perfect for brand guidelines, design documentation, animation references, and maintaining character consistency across marketing materials.

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

To generate a mascot character sheet, provide:
1. **Character description** (what they are, personality)
2. **Art style** (flat vector, 3D, illustrated, etc.)
3. **Color palette** (brand colors)
4. **Product context** (what product/brand they represent)

**Example request:**
> "Create a character sheet for a friendly penguin mascot for our ice cream brand. Flat vector style, blue and white colors with pink accents."

The skill will generate an optimized prompt following the standard layout format.

## Best Practices

### Character Consistency

1. **Establish core features first:** Define key identifying features (shape, color, props) that remain constant across all views
2. **Maintain proportions:** Keep body proportions consistent between views
3. **Color consistency:** Use exact color values across all panels
4. **Personality alignment:** Ensure all emotion poses reflect the character's core personality

### Art Style Guidelines

**For Product Mascots:**
- **Flat vector:** Best for logos, icons, simple brand characters
  - No gradients, solid colors only
  - Bold outlines (3-5px)
  - Geometric, simplified shapes

- **Cel-shaded:** Good for playful, cartoon characters
  - Limited shading (2-3 tones per color)
  - Bold outlines
  - Some depth without complexity

- **Illustrated:** For detailed, personality-rich characters
  - Textures and subtle shading allowed
  - More anatomical detail
  - Character depth and dimension

### Emotion Pose Tips

- **Make poses distinct:** Each emotion should be immediately recognizable from silhouette alone
- **Use props meaningfully:** If character holds objects, vary how they interact with them
- **Exaggerate expressions:** Especially for small-scale usage (icons, avatars)
- **Consider brand context:**
  - B2B/Professional: Subtle, friendly expressions
  - B2C/Playful: More animated, energetic poses

## Integration with Gemini-Imagegen

This skill uses the `gemini-imagegen` skill under the hood. When API quota is exhausted, the system will provide your optimized prompt for manual generation at [gemini.google.com](https://gemini.google.com).

### Recommended Settings

- **Model:** `gemini-2.5-flash-image` for speed, `gemini-3-pro-image-preview` for complex characters with text
- **Aspect Ratio:** `16:9` (optimal for the horizontal layout)
- **Resolution:** Default (1K sufficient for reference sheets)

### Command Example

```bash
python .claude/skills/_branding/gemini-imagegen/scripts/generate_image.py \
  "Your optimized prompt here..." \
  output_character_sheet.png \
  --model gemini-2.5-flash-image \
  --aspect 16:9
```

## Typography: Libre Baskerville

**Font:** Libre Baskerville - A webfont optimized for body text and display

**Why this font:**
- Professional, legible serif typeface
- Excellent for labels and documentation
- Web-safe and widely available
- Works well at small and large sizes

**Usage in prompts:**
Always specify: `"Typography: Libre Baskerville font for all panel labels"`

The AI will render text labels in this style for a cohesive, professional appearance.

## Troubleshooting

### API Quota Issues

If you encounter quota exhaustion errors, the skill automatically provides your optimized prompt. Simply:
1. Copy the prompt from the error message
2. Visit [gemini.google.com](https://gemini.google.com)
3. Paste and generate
4. The web interface has a separate quota from the API

See the [gemini-imagegen Troubleshooting section](../gemini-imagegen/SKILL.md#troubleshooting) for more details.

### Character Consistency Issues

If views don't match:
- Use the `multi_turn_chat.py` script for iterative refinement
- Establish the isometric view first, then generate other views referencing it
- Be more specific about distinctive features (colors, shapes, props)

### Layout Problems

If the layout doesn't match the specification:
- Add more explicit layout instructions
- Specify panel sizes in percentages
- Use terms like "magazine layout", "reference sheet", "character turnaround"
- Try the pro model (`gemini-3-pro-image-preview`) for better instruction following
