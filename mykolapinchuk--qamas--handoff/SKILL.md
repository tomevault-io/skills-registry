description: Prepare handoff: update HANDOFF/REPO_MAP, rotate logs, and create a safe handoff git commit. Use when this capability is needed.

When invoked, do this in order.

A) Documentation and state (must do)
1) Update `HANDOFF.md`:
- Fill/refresh every section.
- Include concrete evidence: file paths and (if a commit is created) the commit hash.

2) Update `REPO_MAP.md` only if needed:
- new important file/dir/entrypoint created
- important file moved/renamed
- canonical commands/entrypoints changed
- focus area ("hot paths") changed

3) Ensure `.gitignore` stays strict for runtime artifacts and secrets.

B) Log rotation (must do)
1) Determine next log filename:
- `agent_logs/YYYY-MM-DD_agentNN.md`, where NN is 00, 01, 02, ... chosen as the next unused number for today.
2) Move `agent_logs/current.md` -> that filename.
3) Append a one-line entry to `agent_logs/INDEX.md`:
- `- YYYY-MM-DD_agentNN.md — <short summary> (optional: commit <hash>)`
4) Create a fresh `agent_logs/current.md`.

C) Safe handoff commit (must do, unless safety checks fail)
Before committing, always show:
- `git status`
- `git diff --stat`

Never commit runtime artifacts, caches, or secrets (see `.gitignore`).

Commit message:
- `agentNN: handoff(<area>): <short description>`
- Derive `agentNN` from `agent_logs/current.md` (field `id:`). If missing, stop and ask the human.
- Choose `<area>` from: `workflow`, `docs`, `core`, `browse`, `persist`, `ci`, `misc`.
