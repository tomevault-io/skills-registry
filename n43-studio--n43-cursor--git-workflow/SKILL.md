# Git Workflow Conventions

## Quick Start

### Commit Format

All commits follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/):

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types**: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `chore`, `build`, `ci`

**Scopes**: Define project-specific scopes in `AGENTS.md`. Common examples: `api`, `ui`, `db`, `auth`, `build`, `cursor`

**Agentic workflow commits**: Use `chore(cursor):` for commands/rules/plans, `docs(cursor):` for reference docs.

### Branch Naming

Default model: personal dev branch (e.g., `ryan`, `erik`).

- Feature branches are optional for exceptional isolation needs.
- Issue association is done through commit footer links, not branch naming.

### PR Review Prefixes

| Prefix        | Meaning           | Blocking |
| ------------- | ----------------- | -------- |
| `major:`      | Must fix          | Yes      |
| `minor:`      | Should fix        | No       |
| `nit:`        | Tiny improvement  | No       |
| `suggestion:` | Loose idea        | No       |
| `question:`   | Clarification     | No       |
| `praise:`     | Positive feedback | No       |

Use "we"/"the code" instead of "you" in review comments.

### Issue Tracker Integration

Configure your issue tracker in `AGENTS.md`:

- Magic words auto-close on merge: `Closes {PREFIX}-XXX`, `Fixes {PREFIX}-XXX`, `Resolves {PREFIX}-XXX`
- Link without closing: `Refs {PREFIX}-XXX`

Examples:

- Linear: branch `ryan`, footer `Closes N43-123`
- Jira: branch `erik`, footer `Closes PROJ-456`
- GitHub: branch `ryan`, footer `Closes #789`

### PR Workflow

1. Squash commits into logical chunks
2. Rebase onto `main` (never merge)
3. Use `--force-with-lease` when pushing after rebase
