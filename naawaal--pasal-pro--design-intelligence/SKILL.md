## 📚 Asset Management Tips

### Organizing Screenshots

**Naming Convention:**

```
[app-name]-[screen-type]-[variant].png

Examples:
- stocky-dashboard-main.png
- stocky-dashboard-dark-mode.png
- inventory-pro-product-list-grid.png
- inventory-pro-product-list-table.png
```

### Version Control

**Research Sessions:**

```
assets/design-research/
└── wholesale-app/
    ├── [current research - latest]/
    └── archives/
        ├── 2025-01-15/  # Previous research
        └── 2024-12-20/  # Initial research
```

### Gitignore Recommendations

```gitignore
# Keep research structure but ignore large files if needed
# assets/design-research/**/screenshots/*.png  # Uncomment if repo size is concern

# Keep these files (they're small and valuable):
!assets/design-research/**/*.md
!assets/design-research/**/*.json
!assets/design-research/**/*.html
```
