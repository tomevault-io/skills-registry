## Purpose
Defines the shared conventions, contracts, safety posture, and telemetry used by all Run-Smart AI skills. This index allows Cursor Agent to discover available skills and the rules they follow.

## When Cursor should use this skill
- Before invoking any Run-Smart skill to understand shared schemas, safety guidance, and telemetry
- When onboarding a new skill to ensure compliance with common contracts
- When working with running coach features and need to understand data schemas or safety patterns
- When user asks about available AI capabilities or skill documentation

## Invocation guidance
1. Load shared references in `running-coach-index/references/` (contracts, telemetry, conventions, smoke-tests)
2. Select the appropriate skill directory based on the user's need (plan generation, adjustment, insights, etc.)
3. Validate request/response payloads against the schemas in `contracts.md` and skill-specific schemas
4. Always follow safety guardrails and emit SafetyFlags when thresholds are crossed
5. Log telemetry events via `v0/lib/analytics.ts` for monitoring and improvement

## Shared components
- **Contracts:** `running-coach-index/references/contracts.md` - TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- **Telemetry:** `running-coach-index/references/telemetry.md` - Standard event logging patterns
- **Conventions:** `running-coach-index/references/conventions.md` - Naming, formatting, and design patterns
- **Smoke tests:** `running-coach-index/references/smoke-tests.md` - Quick validation scenarios

## Available Skills Catalog

### Planning & Generation
- **plan-generator** - Generates 14-21 day personalized training plans with safe load progression
- **plan-adjuster** - Recomputes upcoming workouts based on recent runs and feedback
- **conversational-goal-discovery** - Chat-based goal classification with constraint clarification

### Pre-Run Assessment
- **readiness-check** - Pre-run safety gate evaluating readiness (proceed/modify/skip decisions)
- **workout-explainer** - Translates planned workouts into execution cues and purpose explanations

### Post-Run Analysis
- **post-run-debrief** - Converts run telemetry into structured reflections with confidence scores
- **run-insights-recovery** - Analyzes completed runs for effort assessment and recovery recommendations

### Safety & Monitoring
- **load-anomaly-guard** - Detects unsafe training load spikes (>20-30% week-over-week)
- **adherence-coach** - Identifies missed sessions and proposes plan reshuffles with motivational support

### Advanced Features
- **race-strategy-builder** - Generates race-day pacing and fueling strategies
- **route-builder** - Generates route specifications with distance and elevation constraints

## Safety & guardrails

### Universal Safety Rules
1. **No Medical Diagnosis**: Never provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment recommendations
2. **Conservative Under Uncertainty**: When data is missing or uncertain, prefer safer, more conservative options
3. **Pain/Injury Signals**: If user reports pain, dizziness, chest discomfort, or severe symptoms:
   - Recommend stopping activity immediately
   - Advise consulting a qualified healthcare professional
   - Emit `SafetyFlag` with severity `high`
4. **Load Management**: Enforce hard caps on training load increases:
   - Weekly volume: max +20-30% increase
   - Long run: max +10-15% increase
   - Use `plan-complexity-engine.ts` for deterministic caps
5. **SafetyFlag Emission**: Emit structured `SafetyFlag` objects when:
   - Load thresholds exceeded
   - Critical data missing
   - Injury signals detected
   - Heat/weather risks present
   - Model confidence low (<50%)

### Data Handling
- Redact PII before logging telemetry
- Validate all inputs against schemas
- Handle missing data gracefully with appropriate defaults
- Never assume user state - always verify from database

### Model Behavior
- Prefer deterministic rules over probabilistic when safety is involved
- Fall back to template-based plans if AI generation fails
- Log all fallbacks and failures for monitoring
- Maintain consistent tone: supportive, evidence-based, non-alarmist

## Integration points

### API Routes
- **Chat**: `v0/app/api/chat/route.ts` - Conversational AI interactions
- **Plan Generation**: `v0/app/api/generate-plan/route.ts` - Training plan creation
- **Adjustments**: Background jobs (plan adjustment logic)
- **Insights**: Post-run screens (run analysis and recovery)

### Core Libraries
- **Enhanced AI Coach**: `v0/lib/enhanced-ai-coach.ts` - Skill orchestration and routing
- **Plan Generator**: `v0/lib/planGenerator.ts` - Plan creation logic
- **Plan Templates**: `v0/lib/plan-templates.ts` - Fallback templates
- **Recovery Engine**: `v0/lib/recoveryEngine.ts` - Recovery score calculations
- **Periodization**: `v0/lib/periodization.ts` - Training load management
- **Plan Complexity**: `v0/lib/plan-complexity-engine.ts` - Safety caps and thresholds

### Data Layer
- **Database**: `v0/lib/db.ts` - Dexie IndexedDB schema
- **DB Utils**: `v0/lib/dbUtils.ts` - Common database operations
- **Analytics**: `v0/lib/analytics.ts` - PostHog event tracking
- **Monitoring**: `v0/lib/backendMonitoring.ts` - Performance and error tracking

### UI Components
- **Today Screen**: Main dashboard with readiness check
- **Plan Screen**: Training calendar and workout details
- **Record Screen**: GPS tracking and run recording
- **Chat Screen**: Conversational AI interface
- **Profile Screen**: User settings and history

## Telemetry events (standard)

All skills should emit these standard events via `v0/lib/analytics.ts`:

- `ai_skill_invoked` - Every skill invocation with context
- `ai_plan_generated` - Training plan creation
- `ai_adjustment_applied` - Plan modifications
- `ai_insight_created` - Run analysis
- `ai_safety_flag_raised` - Safety warnings
- `ai_user_feedback` - User ratings and comments

See `references/telemetry.md` for detailed event schemas.

## Development workflow

### Adding a New Skill
1. Create skill directory: `.cursor/skills/skill-name/`
2. Write `SKILL.md` with metadata, description, and guidance
3. Create `references/` subdirectory
4. Add JSON schemas: `input-schema.json`, `output-schema.json`
5. Document examples in `examples.md`
6. Document edge cases in `edge-cases.md`
7. Update this index to include the new skill
8. Add integration code in relevant API routes/libraries
9. Add tests for the skill
10. Update CURSOR.md with skill description

### Testing Skills
- Use smoke tests from `references/smoke-tests.md`
- Verify safety guardrails with edge case inputs
- Test fallback behavior when data is missing
- Validate telemetry event emission
- Check SafetyFlag generation for risky scenarios

### Monitoring Skills
- Check `v0/lib/backendMonitoring.ts` for error rates
- Review PostHog analytics for usage patterns
- Monitor SafetyFlag frequency and severity
- Track user feedback ratings
- Analyze model latency and performance

## Version History
