# Database Migration Deployment Pattern

## Overview

Deploy database-backed services to Kubernetes using the **Migration Job + Init Container** pattern. This ensures database migrations complete successfully before application pods start, preventing schema mismatches and data corruption.

## When to Use

Use this pattern when:
- Service requires database schema migrations before startup
- Deploying to Kubernetes with FluxCD
- Using Prisma, Alembic, Liquibase, or similar migration tools
- Running multiple replicas (horizontal scaling)
- Need atomic, fail-fast deployments

Don't use when:
- Database is external/managed and migrations run separately
- Using schema-less databases (Redis, MongoDB without schemas)
- Application handles migrations internally with locking

## Core Pattern

```
Migration Job (runs once) → Init Container (waits) → Service Pods (start)
```

**Key principle:** Migrations are a **separate Job**, not part of the Deployment lifecycle.

## Why This Pattern

| Approach | Problem | This Pattern Solves |
|----------|---------|---------------------|
| Migration in Deployment command | Multiple replicas race, conflicts | Single Job runs once |
| No coordination | Pods start before migration completes | Init container blocks startup |
| CI/CD runs migration | Outside K8s, harder to debug | Job logs in cluster |
| Init container only | Hard to debug, no job status | Separate Job with clear status |

## Implementation

### 1. Migration Job

```yaml
# migration-job.yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: myapp-migration-${IMAGE_TAG}  # ← Include version
  annotations:
    kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/force: Enabled  # ← Force recreation
spec:
  backoffLimit: 0           # ← Fail fast, no retries
  ttlSecondsAfterFinished: 3600  # ← Auto-cleanup after 1 hour
  template:
    spec:
      restartPolicy: Never
      containers:
        - name: migrate
          image: registry.example.com/myapp-migration:${IMAGE_TAG}
          command: ["npm", "run", "db:migrate:deploy"]  # Or: npx prisma migrate deploy
          envFrom:
            - configMapRef:
                name: myapp-config
            - secretRef:
                name: myapp-secrets  # DATABASE_URL here
```

**Critical details:**
- **Job name includes version tag** - ensures new Job per deployment
- **Force annotation** - tells FluxCD to recreate even if spec unchanged
- **backoffLimit: 0** - fail immediately on error, don't retry
- **ttlSecondsAfterFinished** - cleanup old jobs automatically
- **Same env as service** - DATABASE_URL, credentials identical

### 2. Deployment with Init Container

```yaml
# deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: myapp
spec:
  replicas: 2  # ← Safe with multiple replicas
  template:
    spec:
      initContainers:
        - name: wait-for-migration
          image: groundnuty/k8s-wait-for:v2.0
          args:
            - "job-wr"  # ← Wait for job completion (with readiness)
            - "myapp-migration-${IMAGE_TAG}"  # ← Must match Job name
      containers:
        - name: service
          image: registry.example.com/myapp:${IMAGE_TAG}
          # ... rest of config
```

**Critical details:**
- **job-wr argument** - waits for Job to complete successfully
- **Same version tag** - init waits for SAME version migration
- **All replicas wait** - every pod blocked until migration succeeds

### 3. Variable Substitution

```yaml
# deployment-variables.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: deployment-variables
data:
  IMAGE_TAG: "v1.2286938253.0"  # ← Updated by CI/CD
```

```yaml
# kustomization.yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1
kind: Kustomization
resources:
  - deployment-variables.yaml
  - migration-job.yaml  # ← Before deployment
  - deployment.yaml
replacements:
  - source:
      kind: ConfigMap
      name: deployment-variables
      fieldPath: data.IMAGE_TAG
    targets:
      - select:
          kind: Job
          name: myapp-migration-.*
        fieldPaths:
          - metadata.name
        options:
          delimiter: '-'
          index: 2
      - select:
          kind: Deployment
        fieldPaths:
          - spec.template.spec.initContainers.[name=wait-for-migration].args.[1]
```

**Critical details:**
- **Kustomize replacements** - substitute ${IMAGE_TAG} everywhere
- **Resource order** - migration-job BEFORE deployment in list
- **Same tag everywhere** - migration, init container, service all match

### 4. GitLab CI Integration

```yaml
# Build two images
build:docker:service:
  script:
    - /kaniko/executor
      --destination ${CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE}/service:${IMAGE_TAG}

build:docker:migration:
  script:
    - /kaniko/executor
      --context ./
      --dockerfile ./Dockerfile.migration  # ← Same code, different command
      --destination ${CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE}/migration:${IMAGE_TAG}

# Update deployment variables
commit:image-tag:
  script:
    - sed -i "s/IMAGE_TAG: .*/IMAGE_TAG: \"${IMAGE_TAG}\"/"
        k8s/deployment-variables.yaml
    - git add k8s/deployment-variables.yaml
    - git commit -m "ci: update service image tag to ${IMAGE_TAG} [skip ci]"
    - git push origin ${CI_COMMIT_BRANCH}

# Package manifests with Flux
deploy:service-manifests:
  script:
    - flux push artifact oci://${CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE}/manifests:${IMAGE_TAG}
        --path="./k8s"
    - flux reconcile source oci -n myapp myapp-service
```

**Critical details:**
- **Two images, same version** - service and migration always in sync
- **Commit tag back** - deployment-variables.yaml updated in git
- **[skip ci] flag** - prevent infinite CI loop

### 5. Dockerfile.migration

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile.migration - Identical to service Dockerfile
FROM node:20-alpine AS base
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production

COPY prisma ./prisma
RUN npx prisma generate

COPY . .

# ← No CMD/ENTRYPOINT - Job specifies command
```

**Critical details:**
- **Same as service Dockerfile** - ensures identical dependencies
- **No entrypoint** - Job manifest specifies command
- **Include prisma client** - npx prisma generate step

## Deployment Flow

```
1. Push to main branch
   ↓
2. GitLab CI: Build service + migration images (same tag)
   ↓
3. GitLab CI: Update deployment-variables.yaml, commit, push
   ↓
4. FluxCD: Detect change, reconcile
   ↓
5. Create Migration Job (myapp-migration-v1.123.0)
   ├─ Runs: npm run db:migrate:deploy
   ├─ Success → Job status: Complete
   └─ Failure → Job status: Failed
   ↓
6. Create Deployment pods
   ├─ Init container: wait-for-migration
   ├─ Waits for Job myapp-migration-v1.123.0
   ├─ Job Complete → Init exits → Service starts
   └─ Job Failed → Init blocks forever → Pods stay Pending
```

## Troubleshooting

Use the Flux MCP tools to:

- Check Job status
- Check logs

### Pods stuck in "Init:0/1"

Common causes:
- DATABASE_URL incorrect or unreachable
- Migration syntax error
- Database locked or busy

### Job completes but pods still waiting

Common causes:
- Job name mismatch (typo in args)
- Namespace mismatch
- RBAC permissions missing

### Multiple Jobs with same name

This shouldn't happen due to force annotation
If it does, manually delete old jobs

### Migration succeeds but service fails

Migration and service are separate concerns:
- Migration: database schema
- Service: application code

Check if app code matches schema version

## RBAC Requirements

ServiceAccount needs permissions to read Job status:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: myapp-role
rules:
  - apiGroups: ["batch"]
    resources: ["jobs"]
    verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: myapp-rolebinding
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: myapp-service
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: myapp-role
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Symptom | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Job name without version | Jobs collide, FluxCD confused | Include ${IMAGE_TAG} in name |
| Missing force annotation | Job doesn't recreate | Add kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/force |
| backoffLimit > 0 | Failed migration retries, wastes time | Set backoffLimit: 0 |
| Different DATABASE_URL | Migration succeeds, service fails | Use same ConfigMap/Secret |
| Init waits for wrong job | Pods stuck forever | Match job name exactly in args |
| Migration in deployment order AFTER service | Race condition | List migration-job.yaml BEFORE deployment.yaml |

## Real-World Example

See ralph-wiggum-service for complete working implementation:
- `ralph-wiggum-service/k8s/migration-job.yaml` - Job definition
- `ralph-wiggum-service/k8s/deployment.yaml` - Init container (line 29-40)
- `ralph-wiggum-service/k8s/deployment-variables.yaml` - Version tracking
- `.gitlab/ci/service-build.yaml` - Two-image build (line 42-135)
- `.gitlab/ci/service-deploy.yaml` - FluxCD packaging

## Quick Reference

**Essential Job settings:**
- `backoffLimit: 0` - fail fast
- `ttlSecondsAfterFinished: 3600` - auto-cleanup
- `restartPolicy: Never` - no pod restarts
- `kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/force: Enabled` - force recreate

**Essential Init container:**
- Image: `groundnuty/k8s-wait-for:v2.0`
- Args: `["job-wr", "migration-job-name"]`
- Name must match Job name exactly

**Version synchronization:**
- Same ${IMAGE_TAG} in Job name, init args, images
- CI/CD updates deployment-variables.yaml
- Kustomize substitutes everywhere
