# Daily Steering Report

You are generating a concise daily steering report for the NBA prediction system. This is a **read-only** diagnostic — no writes, no deployments.

## Your Mission

Produce a single, actionable morning report that answers:
1. Is the model healthy enough to bet today?
2. Are signals working or degraded?
3. How are best bets performing recently?
4. What action (if any) should the user take?
5. Are there any upcoming risk factors (trade deadline, All-Star break, schedule gaps)?

## Step 1: Model Health State

Query `model_performance_daily` for the latest date. Show each model's decay state, rolling HR, and staleness.

```bash
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false --format=pretty "
SELECT
  game_date,
  model_id,
  state,
  ROUND(rolling_hr_7d, 1) AS hr_7d,
  ROUND(rolling_hr_14d, 1) AS hr_14d,
  rolling_n_7d AS n_7d,
  -- Session 366: Directional splits
  ROUND(rolling_hr_over_7d, 1) AS over_7d,
  rolling_n_over_7d AS n_over,
  ROUND(rolling_hr_under_7d, 1) AS under_7d,
  rolling_n_under_7d AS n_under,
  -- Session 366: Best-bets post-filter HR
  ROUND(best_bets_hr_21d, 1) AS bb_hr_21d,
  best_bets_n_21d AS bb_n,
  days_since_training,
  consecutive_days_below_watch AS days_below_watch,
  consecutive_days_below_alert AS days_below_alert
FROM \`nba-props-platform.nba_predictions.model_performance_daily\`
WHERE game_date = (
  SELECT MAX(game_date) FROM \`nba-props-platform.nba_predictions.model_performance_daily\`
)
ORDER BY rolling_hr_7d DESC
"
```

Also check which model is currently driving best bets:

```bash
gcloud run services describe prediction-worker --region=us-west2 \
  --format="value(spec.template.spec.containers[0].env)" 2>/dev/null | tr ',' '\n' | grep -E 'BEST_BETS|MODEL'
```

**Present this as:**

```
MODEL HEALTH (as of YYYY-MM-DD):
  <model_id>: <STATE>  <hr_7d>% HR 7d (N=<n_7d>, <days_since_training> days stale) <icon>
    OVER: <over_7d>% (N=<n_over>), UNDER: <under_7d>% (N=<n_under>)
    Best Bets: <bb_hr_21d>% (N=<bb_n>) [if available]
  ...
  Best Bets Model: <current_best_bets_model>
```

State icons: HEALTHY -> OK, WATCH -> eye, DEGRADING -> warning, BLOCKED -> stop, INSUFFICIENT_DATA -> question

## Step 1.5: Edge 5+ Model Health — Best Bets Eligible (Session 335)

Overall model health (edge 3+ HR) can diverge from high-edge performance. A model may be BLOCKED overall but still profitable at edge 5+, or vice versa. This check specifically monitors the best-bets-eligible population.

```bash
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false --format=pretty "
WITH edge5_health AS (
  SELECT
    system_id,
    COUNTIF(prediction_correct) AS wins,
    COUNTIF(NOT prediction_correct) AS losses,
    COUNT(*) AS total,
    ROUND(100.0 * COUNTIF(prediction_correct) / NULLIF(COUNT(*), 0), 1) AS hr_edge5_14d,
    ROUND(AVG(ABS(predicted_points - line_value)), 2) AS avg_edge
  FROM \`nba-props-platform.nba_predictions.prediction_accuracy\`
  WHERE game_date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 14 DAY)
    AND ABS(predicted_points - line_value) >= 5.0
    AND prediction_correct IS NOT NULL
    AND is_voided IS NOT TRUE
    AND (system_id LIKE 'catboost_v9%' OR system_id LIKE 'catboost_v12%')
  GROUP BY 1
  HAVING COUNT(*) >= 5
),
model_state AS (
  SELECT model_id, state, ROUND(rolling_hr_7d, 1) AS overall_hr_7d
  FROM \`nba-props-platform.nba_predictions.model_performance_daily\`
  WHERE game_date = (
    SELECT MAX(game_date) FROM \`nba-props-platform.nba_predictions.model_performance_daily\`
  )
  QUALIFY ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY model_id ORDER BY rolling_n_7d DESC) = 1
),
replacements AS (
  SELECT model_family, COUNT(*) AS family_models,
    MAX(created_at) AS newest_created
  FROM \`nba-props-platform.nba_predictions.model_registry\`
  WHERE enabled = TRUE AND model_family IS NOT NULL
  GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT
  e.system_id,
  ms.state AS overall_state,
  ms.overall_hr_7d,
  e.hr_edge5_14d,
  ROUND(e.hr_edge5_14d - COALESCE(ms.overall_hr_7d, 0), 1) AS edge5_premium,
  e.total AS edge5_n,
  e.avg_edge,
  CASE
    WHEN e.hr_edge5_14d >= 60 THEN 'PROFITABLE'
    WHEN e.hr_edge5_14d >= 52.4 THEN 'MARGINAL'
    ELSE 'LOSING'
  END AS edge5_status
FROM edge5_health e
LEFT JOIN model_state ms ON e.system_id = ms.model_id
ORDER BY e.hr_edge5_14d DESC
"
```

**Present as:**

```
EDGE 5+ MODEL HEALTH (14d, best-bets eligible):
  <system_id>: <edge5_status> <hr_edge5_14d>% (N=<n>, avg edge <avg_edge>) | Overall: <overall_state> <overall_hr_7d>% | Premium: <+/- edge5_premium>pp
  ...
  [If any model is LOSING at edge 5+:]
    WARNING: <model> edge 5+ HR below breakeven — high-edge picks are actively losing money
  [If edge5_premium is negative by 5+ points:]
    NOTE: <model> performs WORSE at high edge than overall — edge magnitude is not a quality signal for this model
```

**Thresholds:**

| Edge 5+ HR | Status | Interpretation |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| >= 60% | PROFITABLE | High-edge picks making money, model safe for best bets |
| 52.4-60% | MARGINAL | Barely profitable, monitor closely |
| < 52.4% | LOSING | High-edge picks losing money, consider excluding from multi-model selection |

**Key insight:** If a model is BLOCKED overall but PROFITABLE at edge 5+, the best-bets filters are working. If a model is LOSING at edge 5+, no amount of filtering will save it — it should be excluded from multi-model selection once a replacement exists.

## Step 2: Signal Health Summary

Query `signal_health_daily` for the latest date. Count regimes and flag COLD model-dependent signals (these are zeroed to 0.0x weight).

```bash
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false --format=pretty "
SELECT
  signal_tag,
  regime,
  ROUND(hr_7d, 1) AS hr_7d,
  ROUND(hr_30d, 1) AS hr_30d,
  ROUND(hr_season, 1) AS hr_season,
  ROUND(divergence_7d_vs_season, 1) AS divergence,
  picks_7d,
  -- Directional splits (Session 398)
  ROUND(hr_over_7d, 1) AS over_7d,
  picks_over_7d AS n_over_7d,
  ROUND(hr_under_7d, 1) AS under_7d,
  picks_under_7d AS n_under_7d,
  ROUND(hr_over_30d, 1) AS over_30d,
  picks_over_30d AS n_over_30d,
  ROUND(hr_under_30d, 1) AS under_30d,
  picks_under_30d AS n_under_30d,
  is_model_dependent,
  days_in_current_regime,
  status
FROM \`nba-props-platform.nba_predictions.signal_health_daily\`
WHERE game_date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 3 DAY)
ORDER BY game_date DESC, regime DESC, signal_tag
"
```

Note: Use `game_date >= DATE_SUB(...)` not a subquery — `signal_health_daily` requires a literal partition filter. Results will include multiple dates; use only the most recent game_date rows.

**Present as:**

```
SIGNAL HEALTH:
  N signals tracked: X HOT, Y NORMAL, Z COLD
  COLD: <signal_tag> (model-dependent, zeroed at 0.0x) [if any]
  HOT: <signal_tag> (1.2x), ... [if any]

  Per-Signal 30d HR (ranked, with OVER/UNDER split):
    <signal_tag>: <hr_30d>% (N=<picks_30d>) | OVER: <over_30d>% (N=<n_over_30d>) | UNDER: <under_30d>% (N=<n_under_30d>)
    ...
  [Flag any signal with directional HR < 50% on 15+ picks:]
    WARNING: <signal_tag> <direction> HR below breakeven (<hr>% on N=<n>) — investigate
```

Flag COLD model-dependent signals specifically since they're effectively disabled (0.0x weight per Session 264).

## Step 2.25: Signal Firing Audit (Session 397)

Check which signals actually fire and appear in best bets picks. Signals can die silently when supplemental data goes NULL or thresholds don't match.

```bash
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false --format=pretty "
WITH signal_firings AS (
  SELECT
    signal_tag,
    COUNTIF(game_date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 7 DAY)) as fires_7d,
    COUNTIF(game_date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 30 DAY)) as fires_30d,
    COUNT(*) as fires_total
  FROM \`nba-props-platform.nba_predictions.signal_best_bets_picks\`,
  UNNEST(signal_tags) as signal_tag
  WHERE game_date >= '2025-12-01'
  GROUP BY 1
),
-- All registered signals (expected to fire)
expected_signals AS (
  SELECT signal_tag FROM UNNEST([
    'model_health', 'high_edge', 'edge_spread_optimal',
    'combo_he_ms', 'combo_3way', '3pt_bounce',
    'bench_under', 'book_disagreement', 'ft_rate_bench_over',
    'home_under', 'scoring_cold_streak_over',
    'extended_rest_under', 'starter_under',
    'high_scoring_environment_over', 'fast_pace_over',
    'low_line_over', 'line_rising_over',
    'self_creation_over', 'sharp_line_move_over',
    'sharp_line_drop_under', 'b2b_boost_over', 'q4_scorer_over'
  ]) as signal_tag
)
SELECT
  e.signal_tag,
  COALESCE(s.fires_7d, 0) as fires_7d,
  COALESCE(s.fires_30d, 0) as fires_30d,
  COALESCE(s.fires_total, 0) as fires_total,
  CASE
    WHEN s.fires_total IS NULL OR s.fires_total = 0 THEN 'NEVER_FIRED'
    WHEN COALESCE(s.fires_7d, 0) = 0 AND s.fires_total > 0 THEN 'DEAD'
    WHEN COALESCE(s.fires_7d, 0) > 0 THEN 'ACTIVE'
    ELSE 'UNKNOWN'
  END as signal_status
FROM expected_signals e
LEFT JOIN signal_firings s ON e.signal_tag = s.signal_tag
ORDER BY fires_7d DESC, fires_total DESC
"
```

**Present as:**

```
SIGNAL FIRING AUDIT:
  ACTIVE (7d): <list of signals with fires_7d > 0>
  DEAD (0 fires 7d, but fired before): <list>
  NEVER_FIRED (0 fires all-time): <list>
  [If any DEAD or NEVER_FIRED:]
    WARNING: <count> signals not contributing. Common causes:
    - NULL supplemental data (dk_line_move, self_creation_rate)
    - Narrow thresholds (implied_team_total >= 120)
    - Upstream filters killing qualifying picks
```

**Known silent signals (Session 397 analysis):** starter_under, high_scoring_environment_over, fast_pace_over, self_creation_over, sharp_line_move_over, sharp_line_drop_under, line_rising_over. These fail due to NULL data or narrow conditions, NOT signal_density filter.

## Step 2.5b: Signal Rescue Performance (Session 398)

Picks below edge 3.0 (or OVER below 5.0) can bypass edge floors via validated high-HR signals. Track their performance separately.

```bash
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false --format=pretty "
WITH rescued AS (
  SELECT
    bb.rescue_signal,
    bb.recommendation,
    COUNT(*) as picks,
    COUNTIF(pa.prediction_correct) as wins,
    COUNTIF(NOT pa.prediction_correct) as losses,
    ROUND(100.0 * SAFE_DIVIDE(COUNTIF(pa.prediction_correct), COUNTIF(pa.prediction_correct IS NOT NULL)), 1) as hr,
    ROUND(AVG(ABS(bb.edge)), 1) as avg_edge
  FROM \`nba-props-platform.nba_predictions.signal_best_bets_picks\` bb
  LEFT JOIN \`nba-props-platform.nba_predictions.prediction_accuracy\` pa
    ON bb.player_lookup = pa.player_lookup
    AND bb.game_date = pa.game_date
    AND bb.system_id = pa.system_id
  WHERE bb.game_date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 14 DAY)
    AND bb.signal_rescued = TRUE
    AND pa.prediction_correct IS NOT NULL
  GROUP BY 1, 2
),
summary AS (
  SELECT
    COUNTIF(bb.signal_rescued = TRUE) as rescued_total,
    COUNTIF(bb.signal_rescued IS NOT TRUE) as normal_total,
    ROUND(100.0 * SAFE_DIVIDE(
      COUNTIF(bb.signal_rescued = TRUE AND pa.prediction_correct),
      NULLIF(COUNTIF(bb.signal_rescued = TRUE AND pa.prediction_correct IS NOT NULL), 0)
    ), 1) as rescued_hr,
    ROUND(100.0 * SAFE_DIVIDE(
      COUNTIF(bb.signal_rescued IS NOT TRUE AND pa.prediction_correct),
      NULLIF(COUNTIF(bb.signal_rescued IS NOT TRUE AND pa.prediction_correct IS NOT NULL), 0)
    ), 1) as normal_hr
  FROM \`nba-props-platform.nba_predictions.signal_best_bets_picks\` bb
  LEFT JOIN \`nba-props-platform.nba_predictions.prediction_accuracy\` pa
    ON bb.player_lookup = pa.player_lookup
    AND bb.game_date = pa.game_date
    AND bb.system_id = pa.system_id
  WHERE bb.game_date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 14 DAY)
    AND pa.prediction_correct IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT * FROM rescued
UNION ALL
SELECT 'TOTAL_RESCUED' as rescue_signal, '' as recommendation,
  rescued_total as picks, NULL as wins, NULL as losses, rescued_hr as hr, NULL as avg_edge
FROM summary
UNION ALL
SELECT 'TOTAL_NORMAL' as rescue_signal, '' as recommendation,
  normal_total as picks, NULL as wins, NULL as losses, normal_hr as hr, NULL as avg_edge
FROM summary
ORDER BY rescue_signal
"
```

**Present as:**

```
SIGNAL RESCUE PERFORMANCE (14d):
  Rescued: W-L (HR%) | Normal: W-L (HR%)
  [Per rescue signal:]
    <rescue_signal>: <direction> W-L (<hr>%) avg edge <avg_edge>
  [If rescued HR < 50% on N >= 5:]
    WARNING: Signal rescue underperforming — consider disabling <rescue_signal>
  [If rescued_total = 0 for 7+ days:]
    WARNING: Signal rescue not firing — check aggregator rescue_tags
```

## Step 2.5a: League Macro Trends (Session 435)

Check league-level macro trends from `league_macro_daily`. These are leading indicators — tightening lines or scoring shifts show up here before they affect BB HR.

```bash
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false --format=pretty "
SELECT
  game_date,
  ROUND(vegas_mae_7d, 2) AS vegas_mae_7d,
  ROUND(model_mae_7d, 2) AS model_mae_7d,
  ROUND(mae_gap_7d, 2) AS mae_gap_7d,
  ROUND(league_avg_ppg_7d, 1) AS scoring_7d,
  ROUND(avg_edge_7d, 2) AS edge_7d,
  ROUND(bb_hr_7d, 1) AS bb_hr_7d,
  bb_n_7d,
  market_regime
FROM \`nba-props-platform.nba_predictions.league_macro_daily\`
WHERE game_date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 10 DAY)
ORDER BY game_date DESC
"
```

**Present as:**

```
LEAGUE MACRO TRENDS:
  Vegas MAE (7d): <val> (<TIGHT/NORMAL/LOOSE>) — <lower = harder to beat>
  Model MAE (7d): <val> — MAE gap: <val> (<positive = model worse>)
  Scoring env:    <val> ppg (7d avg) — <trend vs prior week>
  Edge supply:    <val> avg edge (7d) — <shrinking/stable/growing>
  BB HR (7d):     <val>% (N=<n>)

  [If vegas_mae_7d < 4.5:]
    WARNING: Market TIGHT — Vegas very accurate, edge harder to find
  [If mae_gap_7d > 0.5:]
    WARNING: Model falling behind Vegas — consider retrain
  [If league_avg_ppg_7d drops >0.5 from prior week:]
    NOTE: Scoring environment cooling — bench_under may improve, combo signals may weaken
```

**Thresholds:**

| Metric | TIGHT/Concern | NORMAL | LOOSE/Good |
|--------|---------------|--------|------------|
| Vegas MAE 7d | < 4.5 | 4.5-5.5 | > 5.5 |
| MAE gap 7d | > 0.5 | -0.3 to 0.5 | < -0.3 |
| League PPG 7d | N/A (directional) | 9.5-11.0 | N/A |

## Step 2.5: Market Regime Early Warning (Session 318)

Detect market compression, edge distribution shifts, and directional imbalances BEFORE they show up in W-L record. This is the leading indicator; best bets HR is the lagging indicator.

```bash

**Thresholds:**

|--------|-------|--------|-----|
| Market compression | >= 0.85 | 0.65-0.85 | < 0.65 |
| 7d avg max edge | >= 7.0 | 5.0-7.0 | < 5.0 |

| Daily pick count (7d avg) | >= 3 | 1-3 | < 1 |
| OVER/UNDER HR divergence | <= 15pp | 15-25pp | > 25pp |

**Interpretation:**
- Multiple RED = market is compressed, consider pausing or reducing activity
- Compression RED + HR still GREEN = leading indicator, prepare for downturn
- Direction divergence RED = one direction carrying all the weight, fragile
- Residual bias > +2 or < -2 = model systematically over/under-predicting, may need retrain

## Step 3: Best Bets Performance

Check recent best bets results from `signal_best_bets_picks` joined with `prediction_accuracy`.

```bash
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false --format=pretty "
WITH best_bets AS (
  SELECT game_date, player_lookup, system_id
  FROM \`nba-props-platform.nba_predictions.signal_best_bets_picks\`
  WHERE game_date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 14 DAY)
)
SELECT
  bb.game_date,
  COUNT(*) AS picks,
  COUNTIF(pa.prediction_correct) AS wins,
  COUNTIF(NOT pa.prediction_correct) AS losses,
  ROUND(100.0 * COUNTIF(pa.prediction_correct) / NULLIF(COUNT(*), 0), 1) AS hr
FROM best_bets bb
LEFT JOIN \`nba-props-platform.nba_predictions.prediction_accuracy\` pa
  ON bb.player_lookup = pa.player_lookup
  AND bb.game_date = pa.game_date
  AND bb.system_id = pa.system_id
WHERE pa.prediction_correct IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1 DESC
"
```

Also get a rolling summary:

```bash

If no data, note "No best bets data yet — backfill needed or data not graded yet."

## Step 4: Decision Recommendation

Based on the data gathered, recommend ONE of these actions. Reference the steering playbook at `docs/02-operations/runbooks/model-steering-playbook.md` for full decision logic.

### Decision Tree

1. **Is the best bets model BLOCKED?**
   - Yes: Is there a HEALTHY challenger with 56%+ HR 7d and N >= 30?
     - Yes -> **SWITCH** recommendation + command
     - No -> **BLOCKED** — all picks auto-blocked, consider retrain

2. **Is the best bets model DEGRADING?**
   - Yes: Is there a viable challenger?
     - Yes -> **SWITCH** recommendation
     - No -> **RETRAIN** if 30+ days stale, else **WATCH**

3. **Is the best bets model in WATCH?**
   - Yes -> **WATCH** — monitor 2-3 more days, WATCH often self-corrects

4. **Is the best bets model HEALTHY?**
   - Yes, but 30+ days stale -> **RETRAIN** recommended (monthly freshness)
   - Yes, fresh -> **ALL CLEAR**

5. **Cross-model crash?** (2+ models below 40% on same day)
   - Yes -> **MARKET DISRUPTION** — do NOT switch, pause 1 day

### Output Format

```
RECOMMENDATION: <icon> <ACTION>
  <1-2 sentence explanation>
  [If SWITCH:]
    gcloud run services update prediction-worker --region=us-west2 \
      --update-env-vars="BEST_BETS_MODEL_ID=<challenger_id>"
    To validate first: /replay --compare (last 30 days)
  [If RETRAIN:]
    PYTHONPATH=. python ml/experiments/quick_retrain.py \
      --name "V9_<MONTH>_RETRAIN" \
      --train-start 2025-11-02 \
      --train-end <today>
```

## Step 5: Upcoming Risk Factors

Check for schedule gaps, All-Star break, or trade deadline proximity.

```bash
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false --format=pretty "
-- Check upcoming game schedule (next 7 days)
SELECT
  game_date,
  COUNT(*) AS games
FROM \`nba-props-platform.nba_reference.nba_schedule\`
WHERE game_date BETWEEN CURRENT_DATE() AND DATE_ADD(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 7 DAY)
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
"
```

**Risk factors to flag:**
- No games scheduled for 2+ consecutive days -> break/off-day
- Games resuming after break -> first-day variance may be higher
- Trade deadline proximity (check if within 5 days of mid-February)
- Model staleness approaching 30 days

**Present as:**

```
RISK FACTORS:
  <risk description or "None detected">
  Games schedule: <next 7 days summary>
```

## Step 5.5: MLB League Macro (if in-season: Apr-Oct)

If MLB season is active (April through October), check MLB macro trends from `mlb_predictions.league_macro_daily`.

```bash
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false --format=pretty "
SELECT
  game_date,
  ROUND(vegas_mae_7d, 2) AS vegas_mae_7d,
  ROUND(model_mae_7d, 2) AS model_mae_7d,
  ROUND(mae_gap_7d, 2) AS mae_gap_7d,
  ROUND(avg_k_per_game_7d, 1) AS avg_k_7d,
  ROUND(vegas_bias_7d, 2) AS vegas_bias_7d,
  ROUND(model_hr_7d, 1) AS model_hr_7d,
  ROUND(bb_hr_7d, 1) AS bb_hr_7d,
  bb_n_7d,
  market_regime
FROM \`nba-props-platform.mlb_predictions.league_macro_daily\`
WHERE game_date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 10 DAY)
ORDER BY game_date DESC
"
```

**Present as:**

```
MLB LEAGUE MACRO (K props):
  Vegas MAE (7d): <val> (<TIGHT/NORMAL/LOOSE>) — books accuracy on K lines
  Model MAE (7d): <val> — MAE gap: <val> (<positive = model worse>)
  K environment: <val> K/game (7d avg)
  Vegas bias:    <val> (7d) — positive = books underestimate Ks
  Model HR (7d): <val>%
  BB HR (7d):    <val>% (N=<n>)

  [If vegas_mae_7d < 1.7:]
    WARNING: K market TIGHT — Vegas very accurate on strikeout lines
  [If mae_gap_7d > 0.3:]
    WARNING: Model falling behind Vegas on K props
  [If bb_hr_7d < 52.4 on N >= 10:]
    WARNING: MLB best bets below breakeven
```

**Thresholds (K props — narrower than NBA points):**

| Metric | TIGHT/Concern | NORMAL | LOOSE/Good |
|--------|---------------|--------|------------|
| Vegas MAE 7d | < 1.7 | 1.7-2.0 | > 2.0 |
| MAE gap 7d | > 0.3 | -0.2 to 0.3 | < -0.2 |
| K/game 7d | N/A (directional) | 5.0-7.0 | N/A |

Skip this section outside MLB season (Nov-Mar).

## Step 6: Assemble Final Report

Combine all sections into a clean, scannable report:

```
=== Daily Steering Report ===

MODEL HEALTH (as of YYYY-MM-DD):
  <model lines>
  Best Bets Model: <model_id>

EDGE 5+ MODEL HEALTH (14d):
  <per-model edge-5+ status, premium, warnings>

MARKET REGIME:
  <compression, edge supply, direction split, bias>

RECOMMENDATION: <icon> <ACTION>
  <explanation>
  <commands if applicable>

SIGNAL HEALTH:
  <summary>

BEST BETS TRACK RECORD:
  <W-L summary>

RISK FACTORS:
  <risks or "None detected">

MLB LEAGUE MACRO (if in-season):
  <K environment, Vegas accuracy, BB HR, or "Off-season">

NEXT STEPS:
  1. <primary action>
  2. Run /validate-daily for full pipeline check
  3. <additional context-specific step>
```
