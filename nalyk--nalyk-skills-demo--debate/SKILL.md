# Debate System

## What This Does

Claude forms a position, then external AI models (Gemini, Codex, Qwen) challenge it through structured adversarial debate. Claude must defend, update, or synthesize based on valid critiques.

**This is NOT Claude debating itself.** Different models = different training = different blind spots = genuine value.

## Requirements

**Minimum: 1 external CLI installed and authenticated.**

Run `/debate:doctor` to check system health.

Supported CLIs:
- `gemini` - @google/gemini-cli (free: 1000 req/day)
- `codex` - @openai/codex (requires ChatGPT Plus)
- `qwen` - @qwen-code/qwen-code (free: 2000 req/day)

**Refuses to run with Claude-only.** Claude debating itself is theater, not debate.

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/debate <topic>` | Full adversarial debate on any topic |
| `/debate:doctor` | Check CLI health and authentication |
| `/debate:adr <topic>` | Debate with formal ADR output for important decisions |

## The Hybrid Protocol

1. **Claude forms position** on the topic
2. **Parallel challenge** - All external models critique simultaneously
3. **Consensus check** - If all agree → fast exit
4. **Sequential confrontation** - If disagreement, models respond to each other
5. **Iterate** until consensus OR max rounds
6. **Assumption extraction** - Surface WHY positions differ
7. **Output** - Consensus OR structured tradeoff document

## When To Use

- Complex decisions with no obvious answer
- Suspecting blind spots in your thinking
- Needing documented reasoning for team/future reference
- Wanting genuine pushback, not "yes-man" AI
- Architecture decisions, strategy, any high-stakes choice

## The Core Value

**Disagreement is signal, not failure.**

When models can't agree, the output isn't "we failed" - it's a structured tradeoff document exposing:
- What each option assumes
- When each option is correct
- The hidden assumptions causing the split

This transforms "who's right?" into "what would have to be true for each to be right?"

## Settings

Configure in `~/.claude/debate.local.md`:

```yaml
---
max_rounds: 5
timeout_per_cli: 120
save_debate_logs: true
debate_log_path: "./debate-logs"
adr_path: "./docs/decisions"
skeptical_of_early_agreement: true
---
```

## Universal Application

Works for ANY decision:
- Code architecture
- Business strategy
- Product features
- Technical tradeoffs
- Writing and content
- Life decisions

The protocol adapts to domain automatically.
