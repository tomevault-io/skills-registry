# Pytest Coverage

Use this skill only for Python code that is tested with pytest.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need to:
- measure coverage for backend Python modules
- inspect uncovered lines before adding tests
- improve targeted coverage for a specific file or package
- close coverage gaps without adding low-value tests

## Repo-Specific Defaults

- Run commands from the repository root.
- Use `uv run` for Python commands.
- Prefer `src` as the default coverage target unless the user asks for a narrower scope.

## Recommended Commands

Full backend coverage:

```bash
uv run pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing --cov-report=annotate:cov_annotate
```

Targeted module coverage:

```bash
uv run pytest tests/test_health.py --cov=src.api.health --cov-report=term-missing --cov-report=annotate:cov_annotate
```

Package coverage:

```bash
uv run pytest tests/ --cov=src.agents --cov-report=term-missing --cov-report=annotate:cov_annotate
```

## Workflow

1. Identify the exact Python module or package that needs better coverage.
2. Run pytest with `--cov` and `--cov-report=annotate:cov_annotate`.
3. Review `term-missing` output first for a quick signal.
4. Inspect files in `cov_annotate/` when you need exact uncovered lines.
5. Add focused tests for real behavior:
   - happy path
   - edge cases
   - error handling
6. Re-run coverage until the uncovered lines are explained or covered.

## Coverage Rules

- Prefer meaningful assertions over coverage theater.
- Do not add tests that only exercise language built-ins or trivial getters.
- Mock network and Azure dependencies where possible.
- Reuse existing pytest style, fixtures, and test naming patterns.
- If 100% is impractical because of external integration boundaries, explain the blocker clearly.

## Output Expectations

When you finish, report:
- the command you ran
- the coverage target
- the main uncovered areas you found
- the tests you added or changed
- the final coverage result
