description: Update LLM prices in the repo: Use this skill to snapshot live LLM pricing into a checked-in file so billing or cost math can run offline with deterministic rates. Use for any language or stack (TypeScript, Python, Go, JSON registries, etc.) — not only typescript. Use when the user wants pinned prices, wants to remove a runtime dependency on the Narev API, wants to refresh a committed pricing file, or mentions "snapshot pricing", "freeze prices", "pin model rates", "regenerate pricing file", "update pricing in the repo", or "sync token pricing from Narev". Use when this capability is needed.

# Update LLM pricing in the local repo

This skill is **not** a second API spec — it describes **what you can implement** using the **listing** API that `lookup-llm-pricing` documents (`GET https://www.narev.ai/api/models/pricing`): paginate, map each row to **your** schema, and write a committed file. For path/query/body contracts, `402`/`404`, and **`POST` calculate**, use `lookup-llm-pricing`. You do **not** need the Narev SDK or Vercel AI SDK — any HTTP client and file I/O in the repo's language is enough.

## When to use this skill

- "Update LLM model price snapshot present in your project"
- "Refresh committed pricing registry with the latest rates (find where the project stores rates, or add a file or script if nothing exists yet)."

If the user only needs **how the API works** or **cost for one call** (`POST` calculate), point them at `lookup-llm-pricing`.

## Inputs you need

The Narev pricing API is public. No API key or bearer token is required.

- **Target file path** and **format** (TypeScript object, JSON, YAML, Python module, etc.). Confirm before overwriting.
- **Scope**: which `provider` values to refresh (API slugs), or the full catalog. Use the `provider` query parameter; omit it to fetch everything (paginate until `page > meta.total_pages`).
- **Local units**: the API returns **USD per token**. Some codebases store **USD per million tokens** — multiply by `1_000_000` only when writing that shape, and document it in the script.

## API response shape (what you read)

Paginate with `page`, `limit` (max `1000`), and optional `provider`, `model_id`, `search`, `subprovider`. Response: `{ data: ModelPricingEntry[], meta: { total_pages, ... } }`.

Each row has `model_id`, `provider`, `subprovider`, and `pricing`. When `pricing` is `null`, skip the row (enterprise-only or unavailable).

Useful `pricing` fields (snake_case, USD per unit unless noted):

| Field                                                | Meaning                         |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `price_prompt`                                       | Input token                     |
| `price_completion`                                   | Output token                    |
| `price_input_cache_read` / `price_input_cache_write` | Cached input tokens             |
| `price_internal_reasoning`                           | Reasoning tokens                |
| `pricing_request`                                    | Flat per request                |
| `price_web_search`                                   | Per web-search invocation       |
| `pricing_discount`                                   | Fraction `0`–`1`, not a percent |

`price_image`, `price_audio`, `price_input_audio_cache`, etc. may appear — carry them through only if your local registry supports them.

## Mapping to **your** registry (default path)

1. Inspect the repo: find the existing pricing map or config and match **key style** (`model_id` only vs `provider/model_id`), **units** (per token vs per 1M tokens), and **which fields** the app reads.
2. Implement a script in the project's language (`scripts/update-pricing.ts`, `scripts/update_pricing.py`, etc.) that:
   - Loops pages until done.
   - Optionally filters by one or more `provider` query values per run (or omit for full catalog).
   - **Merges** or **replaces** according to product needs: common pattern is merge — keep unrelated providers in file, overwrite keys returned by this fetch.
   - Writes a generated-file banner when the format allows.
   - Exits non-zero on HTTP errors so CI can fail visibly.

3. Document the run command in a comment or README snippet (`pnpm tsx scripts/...`, `uv run python scripts/...`, etc.).

### Reference pattern: merge into an existing TS registry (strip + regenerate block)

Repos like Mission Control sometimes keep `MODEL_PRICING` in TypeScript with `inputPerMTok` / `outputPerMTok`. Adapt paths and regex to the real file:

- Fetch with `provider` repeated per catalog you care about, or no `provider` for full catalog.
- Convert API per-token rates to per-million: `inputPerMTok = price_prompt * 1_000_000`, same for completion.
- Key both `'model_id'` and `'provider/model_id'` if the app resolves either style.
- Parse the existing block, merge new rows into the dict, sort keys if you want stable diffs, replace the block with `String.replace`, write the file.

This is illustrative — match the project's exact types and formatting.

### Reference pattern: `@ai-billing/core` offline resolver (optional)

If the user **already** uses the Narev SDK, `createObjectPriceResolver` expects **`ModelPricing` in USD per token** (do not multiply to per-million for the SDK map). Map API → SDK like this:

| Narev API (`PricingData`)  | SDK (`ModelPricing`)      |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `price_prompt`             | `promptTokens`            |
| `price_completion`         | `completionTokens`        |
| `price_input_cache_read`   | `inputCacheReadTokens`    |
| `price_input_cache_write`  | `inputCacheWriteTokens`   |
| `price_internal_reasoning` | `internalReasoningTokens` |
| `pricing_request`          | `request`                 |
| `price_web_search`         | `webSearch`               |
| `pricing_discount`         | `discount`                |

Output `Record<string, ModelPricing>` keyed by how the app resolves models (see multi-provider note below). Then:

```ts
import { createObjectPriceResolver } from "@ai-billing/core";
import { pricing } from "./pricing";

export const priceResolver = createObjectPriceResolver(pricing);
```

## Workflow (agent checklist)

### 1. Confirm scope and target file

Providers, model subset (if any), output path, and whether units are per token or per 1M in the file.

### 2. Add or update a snapshot script

Use the repo's language and dependencies (`fetch` / `httpx` / `requests` / `urllib`). Paginate `GET https://www.narev.ai/api/models/pricing`. Transform into the local schema. Prefer idempotent writes and small, reviewable diffs.

### 3. Run it

Use the project's package runner. Do not assume `pnpm` or `tsx` — check `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, etc. Inspect the diff before committing.

### 4. Wire into the app (only if applicable)

For custom registries, point the app at the updated file or import. For `@ai-billing/core`, swap `createNarevPriceResolver` for `createObjectPriceResolver` as above.

### 5. Schedule refreshes (optional)

CI on a schedule that runs the script and opens a PR keeps rates fresh with human review.

## Constraints and edge cases

- **Multi-provider models share a `model_id`.** If you need per-provider rates, key with `provider/model_id` (and align lookup). Otherwise last write wins for bare `model_id`.
- **Skip `pricing: null`.**
- **`pricing_discount` is a fraction** (`0.1` = 10% off). Pass through if your registry supports it; many simple token maps ignore it.
- **API = USD per token.** Scale to per-1M (or per-1K) only in your script when the destination format requires it — do not double-scale.
- **Snapshot drift.** Re-run before releases that depend on accurate math.
- **Generated files.** Banner comment + formatter ignore if needed.
