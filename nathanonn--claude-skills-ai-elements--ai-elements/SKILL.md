# AI Elements Documentation

## Overview

Provide intelligent documentation retrieval for the AI Elements component library when building AI-native applications. AI Elements is a component library built on shadcn/ui that provides pre-built components like conversations, messages, prompts, workflows, and more - all designed to integrate with the AI SDK.

This skill automatically fetches relevant documentation from the bundled markdown files and provides context-aware routing to ensure users get the right information format for their query.

## Activation

### Automatically Activate When:

1. **AI Elements Component Names Mentioned:**
   - Chat & Messaging: Message, Conversation, Response, Loader, Prompt Input, Suggestion, Actions
   - AI-Specific: Tool, Reasoning, Chain of Thought, Plan, Task, Queue, Artifact
   - Workflow: Canvas, Node, Edge, Connection, Toolbar, Panel, Controls
   - UI Enhancements: Code Block, Image, Sources, Inline Citation, Confirmation, etc.

2. **AI Elements Library Terms:**
   - "ai-elements", "AI Elements library"
   - "ai-native app", "AI native application"
   - "shadcn AI components"
   - "@ai-elements/..." (component installation syntax)

3. **File Context Detection:**
   - Imports from `@/components/ai-elements/`
   - Component usage matching AI Elements component names
   - AI Elements commands in package.json

4. **AI-Native Development Queries:**
   - Building chat interfaces with AI responses
   - Creating workflow visualizations for AI agents
   - Displaying AI reasoning or chain-of-thought
   - Implementing AI artifact containers

### Do NOT Activate For:

- Generic chat/messaging apps without AI context
- General React Flow usage without AI workflow context
- Standard UI components unless specifically AI Elements components
- Generic "conversation" mentions without AI/component context

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Context-Aware Documentation Routing

Route queries intelligently based on intent to provide the most useful documentation format:

#### Route 1: Implementation Queries → Examples + Components

**Triggers:**
- "how to build...", "create a...", "implement a..."
- "building a chatbot", "creating a workflow visualization"
- "I want to make...", "I need to develop..."

**Action:**
1. Identify the most relevant example from INDEX.md
2. Read the example file using Read tool: `.claude/skills/ai-elements/docs/examples/[example].md`
3. Identify 2-3 key components mentioned in the example
4. Read those component files: `.claude/skills/ai-elements/docs/components/[component].md`
5. Present with integration pattern explanation

**Example Query:** "How do I build a chatbot with reasoning?"
**Fetch:**
- `docs/examples/chatbot.md`
- `docs/components/reasoning.md`
- `docs/components/conversation.md`

#### Route 2: API Reference Queries → Component Only

**Triggers:**
- "what is...", "what does... do", "what props..."
- "how does X component work"
- "show me the API for..."
- "what properties does... accept"

**Action:**
1. Look up component in INDEX.md
2. Read single component file: `.claude/skills/ai-elements/docs/components/[component].md`
3. Suggest 2-3 category-related components from INDEX.md

**Example Query:** "What props does Message accept?"
**Fetch:**
- `docs/components/message.md`
**Suggest:** Conversation, Response, Actions (same category)

#### Route 3: General Guidance Queries → Overview Docs

**Triggers:**
- "getting started with AI Elements"
- "how to install...", "setup..."
- "troubleshooting...", "common issues..."
- "best practices for..."

**Action:**
1. Read appropriate general documentation:
   - `docs/introduction.md` for getting started
   - `docs/usage.md` for implementation patterns
   - `docs/troubleshooting.md` for issues
   - `docs/README.md` for overview

**Example Query:** "I'm new to AI Elements, how do I get started?"
**Fetch:**
- `docs/introduction.md`
- `docs/usage.md`

#### Route 4: Category/Use Case Queries → README + Components

**Triggers:**
- "components for building chat interfaces"
- "workflow visualization components"
- "what components help with..."
- "show me all... components"

**Action:**
1. Read `docs/README.md` (contains categorized component lists)
2. Optionally read 1-2 key components in that category
3. List all relevant components with brief descriptions from INDEX.md

**Example Query:** "What components help with workflow visualization?"
**Fetch:**
- `docs/README.md`
- Optionally: `docs/components/canvas.md`

### 2. Smart Multi-Page Fetching

**Fetch Multiple Pages (2-4 total) When:**
- Implementation queries ("how to build...")
- Query mentions multiple components ("chat with reasoning")
- Component docs reference other required components
- Related component sets (Canvas + Node + Edge, Message + Conversation + Response)

**Fetch Single Page When:**
- Simple reference queries ("what props...")
- Troubleshooting lookups
- General overview requests

**Stop Fetching When:**
- Already fetched 3-4 pages
- Query is answered sufficiently
- Additional pages would be tangential

### 3. Category-Aware Suggestions

After fetching documentation, always suggest 2-3 related components using these category groupings:

**Chat & Messaging:**
- Message, Conversation, Response, Loader, Prompt Input, Suggestion, Actions

**AI-Specific Features:**
- Tool, Reasoning, Chain of Thought, Plan, Task, Queue, Artifact

**Workflow & Canvas:**
- Canvas, Node, Edge, Connection, Toolbar, Panel, Controls

**UI Enhancements:**
- Code Block, Image, Sources, Inline Citation, Web Preview, Shimmer, Open in Chat, Confirmation, Context, Branch

**Common Pairings:**
- Message → Conversation, Response, Actions
- Reasoning → Chain of Thought, Plan, Task
- Canvas → Node, Edge, Toolbar, Panel
- Prompt Input → Suggestion, Confirmation
- Tool → Artifact, Code Block
- Sources → Inline Citation

Suggest components from:
1. Same category (highest priority)
2. Commonly used together
3. Next implementation step

### 4. Installation Command Generation

Always include installation commands in responses:

**Single component:**
```
**Installation:**
`npx ai-elements add [component-name]`
```

**Multiple components:**
```
**Installation:**
`npx ai-elements add message conversation response`
```

**All components:**
```
**Installation (all components):**
`npx ai-elements add @ai-elements/all`
```

**For workflow components (Canvas, Node, Edge, etc.):**
```
**Installation:**
`npx ai-elements add canvas` (requires React Flow)
```

## Response Formats

### Single-Page Response Format

```markdown

   - "Prompt Input includes built-in file attachment handling"

4. **Common Pitfall Warnings**
   - "Note: Canvas requires React Flow to be installed separately"
   - "Response component uses Streamdown for markdown rendering"

5. **Installation Guidance**
   - "Install all chat components: `npx ai-elements add message conversation response`"
   - "Prerequisites: Next.js with AI SDK and shadcn/ui"

### ❌ DON'T Provide:

1. **Complete Custom Implementations** - Reference examples instead of generating new code
2. **Customization Beyond Docs** - Only suggest what's documented
3. **Debugging User Code** - Can reference troubleshooting docs only
4. **Undocumented Features** - Only describe documented capabilities
5. **Framework Integration** (unless documented) - Stick to documented Next.js + AI SDK patterns
