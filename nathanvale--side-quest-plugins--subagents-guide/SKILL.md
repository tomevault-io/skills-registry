# Claude Code Sub-agents Guide -- Knowledge Bank

Authoritative guidance for configuring and using Claude Code sub-agents, extracted from
Anthropic's official documentation. Covers built-in agents, custom agents, agent teams,
cost management, and troubleshooting.

## Source Authority

This skill draws from:
- Official Claude Code documentation at code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents
- Official Claude Code documentation at code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-teams
- Official Claude Code documentation at code.claude.com/docs/en/costs
- Official Claude Code documentation at code.claude.com/docs/en/model-config

Reference files are the primary source. Community intel is opt-in via
`/newsroom:investigate` -- see Community Perspective below.

## Community Perspective (Opt-In)

This skill does NOT maintain a community intel cache. It can hand off to
`/newsroom:investigate` for live community signal when the user wants real-world examples.

**Auto-detect these signals** -- if the user's question contains any of these, offer to
run community research:
- "what are people doing with subagents", "how are others using agents"
- "has anyone", "examples in the wild", "inspiration"
- "community", "Reddit", "what's trending"
- "real-world examples", "cool agent setups"
- "best agents", "popular agents"

**When detected**:
1. Answer from reference files first (the official answer)
2. Then invoke `/newsroom:investigate` with a tailored query
3. Present both: "Here's what the docs say" followed by "Here's what the community is doing"

**Do NOT auto-invoke research** for standard doc questions.

## Step 1: Classify the Question

Parse the user's question into one or more intent categories.

| Intent | Trigger Signals | Reference File |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| **Getting Started** | what is a subagent, how do subagents work, Task tool, built-in agents, Explore agent, Plan agent, general-purpose agent, when to use subagent | [fundamentals.md](references/fundamentals.md) |
| **Configuration** | create agent, custom agent, agent frontmatter, agent YAML, tools field, disallowedTools, permissionMode, maxTurns, agent hooks, persistent memory, memory scope, preload skills, mcpServers, agent file, .claude/agents/, --agents flag | [configuration.md](references/configuration.md) |
| **Agent Teams** | agent team, teammate, delegate mode, shared task list, team lead, spawn teammate, parallel sessions, team coordination, in-process mode, split panes, tmux | [agent-teams.md](references/agent-teams.md) |
| **Costs & Models** | agent cost, agent tokens, pricing, model selection, haiku, sonnet, opus, CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL, prompt caching, auto-compaction, reduce cost, token usage, context window | [costs-and-models.md](references/costs-and-models.md) |
| **Patterns** | best practices, when to use, subagent vs skill, subagent vs agent team, parallel research, chain agents, isolate output, permission scoping, foreground, background, resume agent | [patterns-and-best-practices.md](references/patterns-and-best-practices.md) |
| **Troubleshooting** | agent not working, agent not spawning, subagent error, permission denied, MCP not available, background agent failed, agent stuck, orphaned session, team not appearing | [troubleshooting.md](references/troubleshooting.md) |

## Step 2: Read Reference Files

Read the relevant reference file(s) based on the classification. For multi-intent
questions, read all relevant files.

## Step 3: Synthesize Answer

### Response Structure

Every response should follow this structure:

1. **Direct answer** -- one-line answer, no preamble
2. **Minimal example** -- copy-paste ready YAML config, agent file, or command
3. **Why it works** -- brief explanation of the design decision
4. **Verify step** -- how to test it ("run /agents", "check agent appears")
5. **Common failure** -- what goes wrong and how to fix it
6. **Source** -- reference file cited

### For Getting Started Questions

1. Show the three execution models (subagents, agent teams, skills)
2. List the built-in agents with model/tools/purpose
3. Show a minimal custom agent file
4. Link to configuration.md for full setup

### For Configuration Questions

1. Show the exact YAML field and its purpose
2. Show a minimal agent file with the field in context
3. Note constraints (scope priority, naming rules)
4. Cross-reference related fields

### For Agent Teams Questions

1. Compare with subagents (communication, context, coordination, cost)
2. Show how to enable and start a team
3. Include display mode options
4. Note experimental status and limitations

### For Cost Questions

1. Show official cost numbers ($6/dev/day average)
2. Present model selection guidance (haiku/sonnet/opus)
3. Show CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL env var
4. Note agent team cost multiplier (~7x)

### For Pattern Questions

1. Show the decision matrix (when to use what)
2. Provide the complete pattern with example
3. Explain trade-offs (cost, latency, context)
4. Include gotchas

### For Troubleshooting Questions

1. Match symptoms to common causes
2. Provide debug steps in order of likelihood
3. Include exact commands or settings to verify
4. Note known limitations

## Response Guidelines

- **Always cite the reference file** you draw from
- **Provide copy-paste agent configs** -- users should be able to use them immediately
- **Show YAML frontmatter** for agent definitions
- **Be direct** -- answer first, then context
- **Tables for comparisons** -- subagent vs team vs skill, built-in agents, model costs
- **Warn about limitations** -- no nesting, no MCP in background, experimental features
- **Link to sibling skills** when the question crosses into hooks, skills, or MCP territory

## Examples

### Example 1: Getting Started

```text
User: What are subagents in Claude Code?

Skill: [Reads fundamentals.md]

Subagents are isolated AI workers that run in their own 200k context window.
They handle a task and return a summary to your main conversation.

Three built-in subagents:

| Agent | Model | Tools | Purpose |
|-------|-------|-------|---------|
| Explore | Haiku | Read-only | Codebase search |
| Plan | Inherits | Read-only | Research during plan mode |
| General-purpose | Inherits | All | Complex multi-step tasks |

You can also create custom agents as Markdown files in .claude/agents/:

  ---
  name: code-reviewer
  description: Reviews code for quality. Use proactively after code changes.
  tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash
  model: sonnet
  ---
  You are a code reviewer. Analyze code for quality, security, and best practices.

Test: ask "What agents are available?" or invoke /agents.

Source: fundamentals.md
```

### Example 2: Configuration

```text
User: How do I restrict which tools a subagent can use?

Skill: [Reads configuration.md]

Use the `tools` field (allowlist) or `disallowedTools` field (denylist):

  ---
  name: safe-researcher
  description: Research agent with restricted capabilities
  tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash
  disallowedTools: Write, Edit
  ---

For finer control, use PreToolUse hooks to validate operations conditionally
(e.g., allow Bash but only for SELECT queries).

Verify: run /agents and check the agent's tool list.

Common failure: omitting the tools field entirely means the agent inherits ALL
tools from the main conversation.

Source: configuration.md
```

### Example 3: Cross-Domain

```text
User: Should I use a subagent or a skill for my code review workflow?

Skill: [Reads patterns-and-best-practices.md]

Use a subagent if the review reads many files and you want to keep verbose
output out of your main context. Use a skill if the review is quick and you
want results inline with your conversation.

| | Subagent | Skill |
|---|---------|-------|
| Context | Isolated 200k window | Main conversation |
| Output | Summary returned | Full output inline |
| Best for | Verbose, self-contained tasks | Reference knowledge, quick workflows |
| Cost | Higher (separate context) | Lower (shared context) |

For a comprehensive code review across many files, a subagent with
model: sonnet and read-only tools is the better choice.

Source: patterns-and-best-practices.md
```

### Example 4: Community Perspective

```text
User: What are people building with custom agents?

Skill: [Detects community signal -> "what are people building"]
Skill: [Reads patterns-and-best-practices.md for official patterns first]

Here's what the official docs cover for agent patterns:
[brief summary of patterns from patterns-and-best-practices.md]

Let me check what the community is building...

Skill: [Invokes /newsroom:investigate "Claude Code custom agents subagents examples"]
