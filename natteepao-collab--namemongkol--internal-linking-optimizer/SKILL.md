## Instructions

When a user requests internal linking optimization:

1. **Analyze Current Internal Link Structure**

   ```markdown
   ## Internal Link Structure Analysis
   
   ### Overview
   
   **Domain**: [domain]
   **Total Pages Analyzed**: [X]
   **Total Internal Links**: [X]
   **Average Links per Page**: [X]
   
   ### Link Distribution
   
   | Links per Page | Page Count | Percentage |
   |----------------|------------|------------|
   | 0 (Orphan) | [X] | [X]% |
   | 1-5 | [X] | [X]% |
   | 6-10 | [X] | [X]% |
   | 11-20 | [X] | [X]% |
   | 20+ | [X] | [X]% |
   
   ### Top Linked Pages
   
   | Page | Internal Links | Authority | Notes |
   |------|----------------|-----------|-------|
   | [URL 1] | [X] | High | [notes] |
   | [URL 2] | [X] | High | [notes] |
   | [URL 3] | [X] | Medium | [notes] |
   
   ### Under-Linked Important Pages
   
   | Page | Current Links | Traffic | Recommended Links |
   |------|---------------|---------|-------------------|
   | [URL 1] | [X] | [X]/mo | [X]+ |
   | [URL 2] | [X] | [X]/mo | [X]+ |
   
   **Structure Score**: [X]/10
   ```

2. **Identify Orphan Pages**

   ```markdown
   ## Orphan Page Analysis
   
   ### Definition
   Orphan pages have no internal links pointing to them, making them 
   hard for users and search engines to discover.
   
   ### Orphan Pages Found: [X]
   
   | Page | Traffic | Priority | Recommended Action |
   |------|---------|----------|-------------------|
   | [URL 1] | [X]/mo | High | Link from [pages] |
   | [URL 2] | [X]/mo | Medium | Add to navigation |
   | [URL 3] | 0 | Low | Consider deleting/redirecting |
   
   ### Fix Strategy
   
   **High Priority Orphans** (have traffic/rankings):
   1. [URL] - Add links from: [relevant pages]
   2. [URL] - Add links from: [relevant pages]
   
   **Medium Priority Orphans** (potentially valuable):
   1. [URL] - Add to category/tag page
   2. [URL] - Link from related content
   
   **Low Priority Orphans** (consider removing):
   1. [URL] - Redirect to [better page]
   2. [URL] - Delete or noindex
   ```

3. **Analyze Anchor Text Distribution**

   ```markdown
   ## Anchor Text Analysis
   
   ### Current Anchor Text Patterns
   
   **Most Used Anchors**:
   
   | Anchor Text | Count | Target Pages | Assessment |
   |-------------|-------|--------------|------------|
   | "click here" | [X] | [X] pages | ❌ Not descriptive |
   | "read more" | [X] | [X] pages | ❌ Not descriptive |
   | "[exact keyword]" | [X] | [page] | ⚠️ May be over-optimized |
   | "[descriptive phrase]" | [X] | [page] | ✅ Good |
   
   ### Anchor Text Distribution by Page
   
   **Page: [Important URL]**
   
   | Anchor Text | Source Page | Status |
   |-------------|-------------|--------|
   | "[anchor 1]" | [source URL] | ✅/⚠️/❌ |
   | "[anchor 2]" | [source URL] | ✅/⚠️/❌ |
   
   **Issues Found**:
   - Over-optimized anchors: [X] instances
   - Generic anchors: [X] instances
   - Same anchor to multiple pages: [X] instances
   
   ### Anchor Text Recommendations
   
   **For Page: [URL]**
   
   Current: "[current anchor]" used [X] times
   
   Recommended variety:
   - "[variation 1]" - Use from [page type]
   - "[variation 2]" - Use from [page type]
   - "[variation 3]" - Use from [page type]
   
   **Anchor Score**: [X]/10
   ```

4. **Create Topic Cluster Link Strategy**

   ```markdown
   ## Topic Cluster Internal Linking
   
   ### Cluster: [Main Topic]
   
   **Pillar Page**: [URL]
   **Cluster Articles**: [X]
   
   ### Current Link Map
   
   ```
   [Pillar Page]

      ├── [Cluster Article 2] ←→ [linked?]
      ├── [Cluster Article 3] ←→ [linked?]

   ```
   
   ### Recommended Link Structure
   
   ```

   ```

## Project Context: NameMongkol

### Internal Linking Rules

1. **Golden Rule**: Every article MUST link to the Name Analysis Tool.
   - **Target**: `/name-analysis` (or the relevant tool page)
   - **Anchor**: "วิเคราะห์ชื่อฟรี", "เช็คชื่อมงคล", "ตรวจสอบชื่อของคุณ"
   - **Location**: Intro, Relevant Sections, and Conclusion CTA.

2. **Pillar Strategy**:
   - **Pillar Pages** (e.g., "คู่มือตั้งชื่อมงคล") must link to all sub-topics (Days/Numbers).
   - **Cluster Pages** (e.g., "ชื่อมงคลวันจันทร์") must link back to the Pillar and to related "Forbidden Letters" or "Meaning of Numbers" pages.

3. **Cross-Linking**:
   - Articles about specific numbers (e.g., Sum 45) should link to "Finance/Wealth" articles if the number promotes wealth.
   - Use `relatedSlugs` in `src/data/articles.ts` to identify and implement these links programmatically if possible, or manually in content.

## Example

**User**: "Find internal linking opportunities for my blog post about 'email marketing best practices'"

**Output**:

```markdown
## Internal Linking Opportunities

**Page**: /blog/email-marketing-best-practices/
**Current Internal Links**: 2

### Recommended Links to Add

| CTA section | "marketing automation" | /services/email-automation/ | "email automation services" |
| Conclusion | "email marketing tools" | /blog/best-email-tools/ | "top email marketing tools" |
