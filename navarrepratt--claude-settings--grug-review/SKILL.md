# Grug Code Review

Review code changes through the grug-brain lens. Complexity is the enemy.

## Review Checklist

For each change, ask:

1. **Complexity check**: Does this add complexity? Is it truly necessary?
2. **Abstraction smell**: Is there premature abstraction? Are patterns forced before they emerge?
3. **Cut points**: If refactoring, are the cut points natural or artificial?
4. **Locality**: Is related code kept together or scattered across files?
5. **Cleverness alert**: Is there clever code that should be dumb code?
6. **YAGNI**: Is anything here that is not needed right now?
7. **Chesterton's Fence**: If removing code, do we understand why it existed?

## Output Format

Structure your review as:

### Complexity Concerns
- List issues where complexity demon has crept in
- Explain why simpler alternative exists

### Suggested Simplifications
- Concrete suggestions to reduce complexity
- Show before/after when helpful

### Acceptable Complexity
- Acknowledge when complexity is genuinely necessary
- Note tradeoffs that justify the approach

## Review Principles

- Three similar lines of code > premature abstraction
- Explicit readable code > compact clever code
- Working code today > perfect code someday
- Integration tests > unit test theater
- Measure before optimizing

## Example Feedback

```
### Complexity Concerns

**Premature abstraction in `DataHandler`**: This abstract base class has only one implementation. Grug say: delete the ABC, keep the concrete class. Abstract when second implementation actually needed.

**Over-engineered error handling**: The retry decorator with exponential backoff handles errors that cannot happen in this context. Grug say: remove decorator, add simple try/except only if error is possible.

### Suggested Simplifications

The `validate_and_transform_and_persist` method does three things. But grug note: these three things always happen together, in this order, nowhere else. Splitting into three methods adds indirection without benefit. Keep as one method, maybe rename to `save_validated`.

### Acceptable Complexity

The caching layer adds complexity but profiler shows 40% latency reduction. Complexity justified by measurement. Grug approve.
