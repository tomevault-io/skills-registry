name: issue-plan-user
description: Plan issues by interviewing the user with probing questions - no AI review, purely human-driven planning. Best when the user has strong opinions about implementation, wants full control over requirements, or when the domain knowledge lives with the user rather than in the codebase. Use for subjective decisions, product direction, or when Codex review would add noise rather than value. Use when this capability is needed.

# User Interview Planning

Plan work by interviewing the user in-depth about their plans using probing, non-obvious questions.

## Context Sources

This command receives context from two sources:
1. **Conversation history** - All messages above inform requirements, decisions, and scope
2. **Arguments** - Additional instructions passed when invoking the command (see $ARGUMENTS at end)

## Tools Used

- **AskUserQuestion** - Primary tool for in-depth user interviews
- **Task (Explore subagent)** - Codebase exploration to inform questions
- **br CLI** - Issue creation after planning is complete

---

## Overview

This is an interactive planning process where you interview the user to fully flesh out their plan before creating beads. Unlike issue-plan and issue-plan-codex which use AI-to-AI debate, this command uses direct user dialogue to refine requirements.

## Step 1: Understand the Plan

Review the entire conversation to understand what plan is being discussed. Identify:
- The core goal or feature being planned
- Any constraints or requirements already mentioned
- Technical context from prior discussion
- Open questions or unclear areas

## Step 2: Initial Exploration (Optional)

If the plan involves code changes and you need context to ask better questions, run a **quick** Explore query (model: "haiku") to understand:
- Relevant existing code and patterns
- How similar features are implemented
- Potential integration points

Skip this step if the conversation already provides sufficient technical context.

## Step 3: Interview the User

Interview the user about this plan in detail using the AskUserQuestion tool. Probe across multiple dimensions:

**Technical implementation:**
- How should this integrate with existing code?
- What patterns or conventions should it follow?
- Are there performance considerations?

**UI and UX (if applicable):**
- How should users interact with this?
- What feedback should the system provide?
- What happens in error states?

**Scope and boundaries:**
- What is explicitly out of scope?
- Are there phases or increments to consider?
- What is the minimum viable implementation?

**Edge cases and assumptions:**
- What inputs or states could cause problems?
- What assumptions are we making about the environment?
- How should the system behave in unexpected situations?

**Risks and dependencies:**
- What could go wrong?
- What does this depend on?
- What other work might be affected?

**Testing and verification:**
- How will we know this works correctly?
- What should be tested manually vs automatically?
- Are there integration concerns?

### Interview Guidelines

- **Skip answered questions** - Do not re-ask what the conversation already clarifies
- **Ask non-obvious questions** - Probe deeper into things the user might not have considered
- **Challenge assumptions** - Question unstated beliefs about how things should work
- **Ask about the hard parts** - Focus on areas that seem complex or risky
- **Use multiple rounds** - Continue interviewing until the plan is fully fleshed out
- **Be very in-depth** - This is not a superficial checklist; dig into specifics

### Using AskUserQuestion Effectively

Structure questions with clear options when possible:
```
questions:
  - question: "How should errors be surfaced to the user?"
    header: "Error UX"
    options:
      - label: "Toast notification"
        description: "Non-blocking notification that auto-dismisses"
      - label: "Modal dialog"
        description: "Blocking dialog requiring user acknowledgment"
      - label: "Inline error"
        description: "Error displayed next to the relevant input"
      - label: "Status bar"
        description: "Persistent status area showing current state"
    multiSelect: false
```

For open-ended questions, provide example answers as options with "Other" for custom input.

## Step 4: Synthesize the Plan

After the interview is complete, synthesize everything discussed into a comprehensive plan:

1. **Summary** - What we are building and why
2. **Scope** - What is included and excluded
3. **Technical approach** - How it will be implemented
4. **Key decisions** - Important choices made during the interview
5. **Edge cases addressed** - How we handle unusual situations
6. **Testing strategy** - How we verify correctness
7. **Risks and mitigations** - What could go wrong and how we prevent it

Present this synthesis to the user and confirm it accurately captures the plan.

## Step 5: Create Beads

Read and follow the bead creation process in `../shared/bead-workflow.md`. This covers:
1. **Verification Command Discovery** - Find exact lint, test, and e2e commands for the project
2. **Create Issues (Deferred)** - Create implementation beads with acceptance criteria
3. **Final Verification Issue** - Create a gating issue that depends on all implementation beads
4. **Create Epic** - Summarize the planned work as an epic with all children linked
5. **Publish All Beads** - Transition from deferred to open once the dependency graph is complete

## Step 6: Output Summary

After creating and publishing beads, output a clear summary:

```
Created X bead(s) from user interview:

- bd-xxx: [title] (P2, open)
- bd-xxx: [title] (P2, open, blocked by bd-xxx)
- bd-xxx: [title] - final verification (P2, open, blocked by all above)

Epic: bd-xxx - [epic title]

Key decisions from interview:
- [Decision 1]
- [Decision 2]

Ready for implementation.
```

## Handling Failures

When the user interview reveals blocking issues or fundamental unknowns:
1. Create a P0 meta issue titled: "Create plan for [blocker-topic]"
2. Description must include:
   - What was blocking and why it matters
   - Instruction to use Explore subagent for discovery
   - Instruction to design a fix
   - Instruction to create implementation issues via issue-tracking skill
3. Any implementation issues spawned from meta issues are also P0
