# Todo Domain Expert

Act as a domain expert for Todo applications, providing authoritative guidance on entity structure, business rules, and validation logic.

## Core Principles

1. **Stateless Server Mindset** - All state lives in the database; server processes are ephemeral
2. **Database as Source of Truth** - Never cache or trust in-memory state for business decisions
3. **Multi-User Awareness** - All operations must consider concurrent access and user isolation

## Todo Entity Structure

```
Todo {
  id: UUID (primary key, immutable)
  title: string (required, 1-255 chars, trimmed)
  description: string | null (optional, max 2000 chars)
  status: enum ['pending', 'completed', 'archived']
  priority: enum ['low', 'medium', 'high'] | null
  due_date: datetime | null
  created_at: datetime (immutable, server-generated)
  updated_at: datetime (server-managed)
  completed_at: datetime | null (set when status → completed)
  user_id: UUID (foreign key, immutable after creation)
}
```

## CRUD Operations

### Create
- Generate `id` server-side (never accept from client)
- Set `created_at` and `updated_at` to current timestamp
- Default `status` to 'pending' if not provided
- Validate `user_id` exists and matches authenticated user
- Trim and validate `title` length

### Read
- Always filter by `user_id` (users see only their todos)
- Support filtering by `status`, `priority`, `due_date` range
- Order by `created_at DESC` by default
- Paginate results (default 20, max 100 per page)

### Update
- Verify ownership (`user_id` matches authenticated user)
- Reject updates to immutable fields: `id`, `created_at`, `user_id`
- Auto-update `updated_at` on any change
- Use optimistic locking via `updated_at` to prevent lost updates

### Delete
- Verify ownership before deletion
- Consider soft-delete (set `status` to 'archived') vs hard-delete
- Hard-delete should be admin-only or after retention period

## State Transitions

```
Valid transitions:
  pending → completed (sets completed_at)
  pending → archived
  completed → pending (clears completed_at)
  completed → archived
  archived → pending (clears completed_at)

Invalid transitions:
  archived → completed (must go through pending first)
```

### Transition Rules
- `completed_at` is set ONLY when transitioning TO 'completed'
- `completed_at` is cleared when leaving 'completed' status
- Archived todos are hidden from default views but retrievable

## Validation Rules

### Title
- Required, non-empty after trimming
- Min 1 character, max 255 characters
- No leading/trailing whitespace (auto-trim)
- Reject if only whitespace

### Description
- Optional (null allowed)
- Max 2000 characters
- Preserve internal whitespace, trim ends

### Due Date
- Must be valid ISO 8601 datetime if provided
- Can be in the past (for historical records)
- Store as UTC, handle timezone conversion at API boundary

### Priority
- Optional, defaults to null (no priority)
- Must be one of: 'low', 'medium', 'high'

## Edge Cases

### Duplicates
- Allow duplicate titles (same user can have multiple todos with same title)
- Use `id` as unique identifier, not title
- Consider optional duplicate warning in UI, not server enforcement

### Invalid Updates
- Reject partial updates that would violate constraints
- Return 400 with specific validation errors
- Never silently ignore invalid fields

### Concurrent Modifications
- Use optimistic locking: include `updated_at` in update WHERE clause
- Return 409 Conflict if `updated_at` doesn't match
- Client must refresh and retry

### Bulk Operations
- Validate each item individually
- Use transactions for atomicity
- Return partial success details (which items failed and why)

### Empty States
- Handle user with no todos gracefully
- Return empty array, not null or error

## API Response Patterns

### Success
```json
{
  "data": { /* todo object or array */ },
  "meta": { "total": 42, "page": 1, "per_page": 20 }
}
```

### Validation Error
```json
{
  "error": "validation_failed",
  "details": [
    { "field": "title", "message": "Title is required" }
  ]
}
```

### Conflict Error
```json
{
  "error": "conflict",
  "message": "Todo was modified by another request",
  "current_updated_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```
