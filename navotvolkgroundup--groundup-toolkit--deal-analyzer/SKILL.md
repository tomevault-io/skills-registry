# Deal Analyzer v2

AI-powered investment evaluation that transforms a pitch deck into a comprehensive 12-section VC analysis. Combines deck extraction, web research, and Claude analysis to deliver investment-grade due diligence in 3-5 minutes.

## Conversational Flow

**Via WhatsApp:**
1. User sends a deck URL → `analyze` runs quick extraction, sends summary, asks "Want the full 12-section investment report?"
2. User replies "full report" → `full-report` runs deep analysis from saved state, sends TL;DR + memo via WhatsApp + email, asks "Want me to log this to HubSpot?"
3. User replies "log to hubspot" → `log` searches HubSpot for the company and adds the analysis as a note

**Via Email (automatic):**
1. Team member emails a deck to the assistant's email → email pipeline extracts deck, creates company + deal in HubSpot
2. Sender receives WhatsApp with quick analysis + "Want the full 12-section investment report?"
3. Sender replies "full report" → same deep analysis flow as above

## When to Use This Skill

**WhatsApp triggers:**
- "analyze this deck: [URL]" → quick extraction
- "evaluate this deal: [URL]" → full 12-section analysis
- "review this pitch deck: [URL]"
- "run due diligence on [URL]"
- "full report" → runs full 12-section analysis from last extraction
- "log to hubspot" → logs last evaluation to HubSpot

## Actions

### analyze (quick — 5-15 seconds)
Extract key data from a pitch deck. Sends WhatsApp summary and asks about full report.

```bash
deal-analyzer analyze <deck-url> [phone] [sender-email]
```

### evaluate (deep — 3-5 minutes)
Full 12-section investment analysis with web research. Delivers TL;DR + WhatsApp summary + email report. Asks about HubSpot logging.

```bash
deal-analyzer evaluate <deck-url> <phone> [email]
```

### full-report (deep — 3-5 minutes)
Run full evaluation using saved state from a prior analyze or email extraction. No URL needed.

```bash
deal-analyzer full-report [phone] [email]
```

### log
Log the last analysis to HubSpot as a company note.

```bash
deal-analyzer log [phone]
```

### demo (LP meeting — one command)
Activate demo mode with two pre-cached deals: Konko AI (STRONG INVEST) and Noovox (PASS). Run once from console, then the entire flow happens via WhatsApp.

```bash
deal-analyzer demo <phone> [email]
```

After activating, the demo has two phases:

**Phase 1 — Konko AI (STRONG INVEST):**
1. User sends a deck URL → `analyze` uses cached Konko AI data, creates HubSpot records, sends quick summary
2. User replies "full report" → progress + TL;DR + Google Doc link + auto-logs to HubSpot
3. After completion, demo automatically advances to Phase 2

**Phase 2 — Noovox (PASS):**
4. User sends another deck URL (e.g. "David sent me this deck...") → `analyze` uses cached Noovox data, creates HubSpot records, sends quick summary
5. User replies "full report" → progress + TL;DR (PASS recommendation) + Google Doc link + auto-logs to HubSpot
6. User replies "end demo" → demo mode deactivated

**IMPORTANT**: When output starts with "DELIVERED:", the skill has already sent messages directly to WhatsApp. Do NOT send any additional messages or summaries — just acknowledge silently or say nothing.

### end-demo
Deactivate demo mode. Returns to normal deal analysis behavior.

```bash
deal-analyzer end-demo
```

**WhatsApp triggers:**
- "end demo", "stop demo", "demo over" → `end-demo`

### test
Run test evaluation with sample deck data (FleetPulse).

```bash
deal-analyzer test
```

## Pipeline

```

Phase 3: ANALYZE  (Claude Sonnet x12, ~3m) — Sequential section analysis
Phase 4: TL;DR    (Claude Haiku, ~5s)      — Executive summary paragraph
Phase 5: DELIVER  (~10s)                   — WhatsApp + email + HubSpot prompt
```

## Delivery

- **WhatsApp**: TL;DR + executive summary + investment recommendation
- **Email**: Full ~15-page investment memo with TL;DR and all 12 sections
- **HubSpot**: Company note with TL;DR + investment memo (on user confirmation)

**IMPORTANT**: This skill sends WhatsApp messages directly. When the output starts with "DELIVERED:", all messages have already been sent. Do NOT send duplicate messages, summaries, or paraphrased versions. Just acknowledge briefly or say nothing.
