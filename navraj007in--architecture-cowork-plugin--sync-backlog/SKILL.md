## How It Works

### Step 1: Parse Sprint Backlog from Blueprint

Extract from **Section 15: Sprint Backlog**:

```markdown
## Sprint 0: Project Setup & Infrastructure (Week 1)

**Goal**: Production-ready foundation

### User Stories

#### US-0.1: Developer can deploy to production
**Priority**: High
**Story Points**: 5

**Description**: Set up CI/CD pipeline so any developer can deploy code to production with a single command.

```

### Step 2: Structure Data for Target Platform

**Linear Format**:
```json
{
  "title": "US-0.1: Developer can deploy to production",
  "description": "Set up CI/CD pipeline so any developer can deploy code to production with a single command.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria**:\n- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow configured\n- [ ] Deploys on push to `main` branch\n- [ ] Automated tests run before deploy\n- [ ] Deploy to Vercel (frontend) and Railway (backend)\n- [ ] Environment variables configured\n- [ ] Can rollback to previous version\n\n**Technical Notes**:\n- Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD\n- Vercel for frontend (auto-deploy)\n- Railway for backend workers\n- Store secrets in GitHub Secrets",
  "priority": 1,
  "estimate": 5,
  "labelIds": ["<high-priority-label-id>", "<infrastructure-label-id>"],
  "projectId": "<sprint-0-project-id>",
  "teamId": "<team-id>"
}
```

**GitHub Issues Format**:
```json
{
  "title": "US-0.1: Developer can deploy to production",
  "body": "**Priority**: High\n**Story Points**: 5\n\n**Description**: Set up CI/CD pipeline so any developer can deploy code to production with a single command.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria**:\n- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow configured\n- [ ] Deploys on push to `main` branch\n- [ ] Automated tests run before deploy\n- [ ] Deploy to Vercel (frontend) and Railway (backend)\n- [ ] Environment variables configured\n- [ ] Can rollback to previous version\n\n**Technical Notes**:\n- Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD\n- Vercel for frontend (auto-deploy)\n- Railway for backend workers\n- Store secrets in GitHub Secrets",
  "labels": ["Sprint 0", "Priority: High", "Type: Infrastructure"],
  "milestone": "Sprint 0",
  "assignees": []
}
```

**Jira Format**:
```json
{
  "fields": {
    "project": { "key": "PROJ" },
    "summary": "US-0.1: Developer can deploy to production",
    "description": "Set up CI/CD pipeline so any developer can deploy code to production with a single command.\n\nh3. Acceptance Criteria\n* GitHub Actions workflow configured\n* Deploys on push to main branch\n* Automated tests run before deploy\n* Deploy to Vercel (frontend) and Railway (backend)\n* Environment variables configured\n* Can rollback to previous version\n\nh3. Technical Notes\n* Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD\n* Vercel for frontend (auto-deploy)\n* Railway for backend workers\n* Store secrets in GitHub Secrets",
    "issuetype": { "name": "Story" },
    "priority": { "name": "High" },
    "customfield_10016": 5,
    "labels": ["sprint-0", "infrastructure"],
    "sprint": "<sprint-id>"
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Create Projects/Milestones/Sprints

Before creating issues, set up organizational structure:

**Linear**:
```typescript
// Create projects for each sprint
const sprint0 = await linear.createProject({
  name: "Sprint 0: Project Setup & Infrastructure",
  description: "Production-ready foundation",
  startDate: "2026-02-07",
  targetDate: "2026-02-14",
  teamId: teamId,
});

const sprint1 = await linear.createProject({
  name: "Sprint 1: Authentication & User Management",
  description: "User signup, login, workspace creation",
  startDate: "2026-02-14",
  targetDate: "2026-02-28",
  teamId: teamId,
});
```

**GitHub**:
```bash
# Create milestones
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/milestones \
  -f title="Sprint 0: Project Setup & Infrastructure" \
  -f description="Production-ready foundation" \
  -f due_on="2026-02-14T00:00:00Z"

gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/milestones \
  -f title="Sprint 1: Authentication & User Management" \
  -f description="User signup, login, workspace creation" \
  -f due_on="2026-02-28T00:00:00Z"
```

**Jira**:
```bash
# Create sprints
curl -X POST https://yourcompany.atlassian.net/rest/agile/1.0/sprint \
  -H "Authorization: Basic $(echo -n email:token | base64)" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Sprint 0",
    "startDate": "2026-02-07T08:00:00.000Z",
    "endDate": "2026-02-14T17:00:00.000Z",
    "originBoardId": <board-id>
  }'
```

### Step 4: Create Issues/Tasks

For each user story:

**Linear**:
```typescript
const issue = await linear.createIssue({
  teamId: teamId,
  projectId: sprint0.id,
  title: "US-0.1: Developer can deploy to production",
  description: descriptionMarkdown,
  priority: 1, // 0=No priority, 1=Urgent, 2=High, 3=Medium, 4=Low
  estimate: 5, // Story points
  labelIds: [highPriorityLabelId, infrastructureLabelId],
});
```

**GitHub**:
```bash
gh issue create \
  --repo owner/repo \
  --title "US-0.1: Developer can deploy to production" \
  --body "$DESCRIPTION" \
  --label "Sprint 0,Priority: High,Type: Infrastructure" \
  --milestone "Sprint 0"
```

**Jira**:
```bash
curl -X POST https://yourcompany.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/issue \
  -H "Authorization: Basic $(echo -n email:token | base64)" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @issue-payload.json
```

### Step 5: Link Related Issues

If blueprint specifies dependencies:

**Linear** (blocking relationships):
```typescript
await linear.createIssueRelation({
  issueId: issue1.id,
  relatedIssueId: issue2.id,
  type: "blocks", // issue1 blocks issue2
});
```

**GitHub** (task lists in description):
```markdown
## Dependencies
- Blocked by #12 (Database setup)
- Blocks #15 (User authentication)
```

**Jira** (issue links):
```json
{
  "type": { "name": "Blocks" },
  "inwardIssue": { "key": "PROJ-1" },
  "outwardIssue": { "key": "PROJ-2" }
}
```

### Step 6: Set Labels/Tags

Create and apply labels:

**Priority Labels**:
- 🔴 Priority: High (Urgent)
- 🟠 Priority: Medium
- 🟢 Priority: Low

**Type Labels**:
- Feature (new functionality)
- Bug (defects)
- Tech Debt (refactoring, infrastructure)
- Documentation

**Sprint Labels**:
- Sprint 0
- Sprint 1
- Sprint 2
- ...

**Component Labels** (from feature areas):
- Authentication
- Database
- Frontend
- Backend
- DevOps
- Security

```

---

## Sync Modes

### 1. One-Time Push (Default)
Create all issues once, no ongoing sync.

**Use when**: Initial project setup, blueprint is final.

```bash
/architect:sync-backlog --platform=linear
```

### 2. Two-Way Sync
Keep blueprint and Linear in sync.

**Use when**: Blueprint evolves, need to track changes.

**Features**:
- Detect new user stories in blueprint → Create issues
- Detect completed issues in Linear → Mark in blueprint
- Detect priority changes → Update both sides

```bash
/architect:sync-backlog --platform=linear --mode=two-way
```

### 3. Export Only (No API)
Generate CSV/JSON for manual import.

**Use when**: No API access, need manual review before import.

```bash
/architect:sync-backlog --platform=csv
# Output: backlog-export.csv
```

---

**Optional parameters**:

1. **Platform**: linear, github, jira, asana, clickup, csv
2. **Team ID**: Specific team within workspace
3. **Assignees**: Auto-assign to specific users
4. **Start date**: Sprint 0 start date (defaults to today)
5. **Sprint duration**: 1-week, 2-week (default), 3-week, 4-week
6. **Include completed**: Yes/No (sync already-completed sprints)
7. **Dry run**: Preview changes without creating issues

**Examples**:

```bash
# Sync to Linear with 1-week sprints
/architect:sync-backlog --platform=linear --sprint-duration=1-week

# Sync to GitHub with auto-assignment
