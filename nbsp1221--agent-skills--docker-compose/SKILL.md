# Docker Compose

Opinionated conventions for consistent, maintainable Docker Compose files.

## Best Practices

### File naming and override strategy

- Prefer `compose.yaml` (or `compose.yml`) as the canonical base file.
- Keep local-only changes in `compose.override.yaml` (auto-merged by Compose).
  - If an override file is local-only, add it to `.gitignore` unless the team explicitly wants it committed (optionally keep a `.example` file).
- For environment-specific configs, use `compose.<env>.yaml` and combine with `-f`.
- Avoid the top-level `version` key (obsolete).

### Service naming and identity

- Use kebab-case service names; they become internal DNS names.
- Avoid `container_name` unless strictly required; it prevents scaling.
- Pin image tags (avoid `latest`); prefer digests for production.

### Env var conventions

- Use `.env` for interpolation, `env_file` for container runtime values.
- Keep secrets out of Compose files; commit `.env.example` only.
- Prefer mapping style for `environment` when values include special chars.
- If the same variable is set in both, `environment` overrides `env_file` (key order does not change behavior).

### Ports, volumes, and paths

- Quote `HOST:CONTAINER` port mappings to avoid YAML base-60 parsing issues.
- Prefer relative bind mounts starting with `./`.
- Use named volumes for persistent data.

### Readiness and dependencies

- Use `depends_on` for ordering; add `healthcheck` and `condition: service_healthy` for readiness-sensitive dependencies.

### Profiles for optional services

- Use `profiles` to gate optional services (e.g., debug, seed, admin) instead of maintaining separate files.
- If a service is profile-gated, any `depends_on` targets must be in the same profile or always enabled; otherwise the model is invalid.

### Project naming and file composition

- Set top-level `name` when you need stable project identifiers (network/volume names) across directories or CI.
- Use `include`/`fragments` to split large Compose files, but only if your Compose implementation supports them.

### DRY with extensions and anchors

- Use `x-` extension fields plus YAML anchors/merge to share repeated blocks (env, volumes, labels) across services.

### Secrets and configs

- Declare `secrets`/`configs` at top level and explicitly grant access per service; top-level declaration alone is not enough.
- Prefer `secrets`/`configs` for sensitive or shared files when the platform supports them.

### Deploy portability

- Treat `deploy` as platform-specific; some Compose implementations ignore it in local runs.
- Document when `deploy` is required so users do not assume it applies everywhere.

### Init for PID 1

- Set `init: true` for long-running services to handle PID 1 signal and zombie reaping correctly.

## Ordering Conventions

### Top-level order

1. `name` (optional)
2. `services`
3. `networks`
4. `volumes`
5. `configs`
6. `secrets`

### Service key order

Use this exact order for keys within each service to keep the file consistent.

1. Identity: `image` / `build`, `container_name`, `hostname`
2. Runtime: `command`, `entrypoint`, `restart`
3. Environment: `env_file`, `environment`, `labels`
4. Resources: `ports`, `expose`, `volumes`
5. Connectivity: `depends_on`, `networks`, `network_mode`
6. Health: `healthcheck`

## Validation

- Always run `docker compose config` before shipping changes.
