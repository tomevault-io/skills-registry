# FTC Code Review Checks

This skill defines the code quality and structure checks for FTC marketplace skills. These checks are the source of truth for both local reviews (`/review`) and PR bot reviews.

## Structure Checks (Errors)

These checks must pass - errors block PR merge.

### Plugin Directory Structure
- [ ] `plugins/<skill-name>/` directory exists
- [ ] `plugins/<skill-name>/plugin.json` exists
- [ ] `plugins/<skill-name>/CHANGELOG.md` exists
- [ ] `plugins/<skill-name>/skills/<skill-name>/` directory exists
- [ ] `plugins/<skill-name>/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` exists

### plugin.json Validation
- [ ] File is valid JSON (no syntax errors)
- [ ] Has `name` field matching directory name
- [ ] Has `version` field in semver format (X.Y.Z)
- [ ] Has `description` field (non-empty string)
- [ ] Has `author` field as object (NOT a string)
- [ ] Author object has `name` property
- [ ] Has `keywords` array (NOT `tags`)
- [ ] Keywords array includes "ftc"

### SKILL.md Frontmatter Validation
- [ ] File starts with `---` (YAML frontmatter)
- [ ] Has `name` field matching directory name
- [ ] Has `description` field (non-empty, < 1024 chars)
- [ ] Has `license` field
- [ ] Has `metadata` object
- [ ] Has `metadata.version` field matching plugin.json version
- [ ] Has `metadata.category` field

### Version Consistency
- [ ] Version in `plugin.json` matches version in SKILL.md frontmatter
- [ ] Version in `marketplace.json` entry matches plugin.json (if listed)

## Content Quality Checks (Warnings)

These are recommendations - warnings don't block merge but should be addressed.

### Description Quality
- [ ] Description explains WHAT the skill does
- [ ] Description explains WHEN to use it (trigger words)
- [ ] Description contains FTC-specific keywords
- [ ] Description is under 1024 characters

### SKILL.md Content
- [ ] File is under 500 lines (use progressive disclosure)
- [ ] Has "Quick Start" or "Getting Started" section
- [ ] Has code examples (```java or ```kotlin blocks)
- [ ] Has "Anti-Pattern" or "Don't" section with bad examples
- [ ] No `[TODO: ...]` placeholder markers remaining

### Code Examples
- [ ] Examples include both good and bad patterns
- [ ] Bad examples are marked with comments (// Bad, // Don't, etc.)
- [ ] Examples are syntactically correct

## Marketplace Checks (Errors)

### Registration
- [ ] Skill is listed in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`
- [ ] Entry uses `source` field (NOT `path`)
- [ ] Entry has `skills` array listing skill directories
- [ ] Version in marketplace entry matches plugin.json

## CHANGELOG Checks (Warnings)

### Format
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` follows Keep a Changelog format
- [ ] Has `## [Unreleased]` section at the top
- [ ] Categories use correct headers: Added, Changed, Fixed, Removed, Deprecated, Security

## New Skill vs Update Checks

### For New Skills (version 1.0.0)
- [ ] Version is 1.0.0 in all three locations
- [ ] This is CORRECT - new skills SHOULD start at 1.0.0
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md has initial 1.0.0 entry

### For Skill Updates
- [ ] New entries added to `## [Unreleased]` section
- [ ] Version NOT manually bumped (release process handles this)

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| `author` as string | Use object: `{"name": "...", "url": "..."}` |
| Using `tags` field | Rename to `keywords` |
| Using `path` in marketplace | Rename to `source` |
| Missing "ftc" keyword | Add "ftc" to keywords array |
| SKILL.md too long | Extract to API_REFERENCE.md, TROUBLESHOOTING.md |
| No anti-patterns | Always show what NOT to do |
| Version mismatch | Ensure all 3 locations match |

## Running This Review

```bash
/review <skill-name> --type code
```

Or as part of full review:
```bash
/review <skill-name>
```
