# FTC Robot Development Tools

Commands and guidance for the FTC robot development workflow. Designed to help rookies get up and running quickly.

## Quick Start

### 1. Check Your Setup

```
/doctor
```

This checks if ADB is installed and helps you install it if needed.

### 2. Connect to Robot

```
/connect
```

Connects to your robot via WiFi (default) or USB.

### 3. Build and Deploy

```
/build    # Compile your code
/deploy   # Build and install to robot
```

### 4. Debug

```
/log              # View robot logs
/log --errors     # View only errors
```

### 5. Control OpModes

```
/opmodes          # List available OpModes
/init TeleOp      # Initialize an OpMode
/start            # Start the OpMode
/stop             # Stop the OpMode
```

## Available Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/doctor` | Check environment setup (ADB, connection) |
| `/connect` | Connect to robot via WiFi or USB |
| `/build` | Compile robot code |
| `/deploy` | Build and deploy to robot |
| `/log` | View filtered robot logs |
| `/opmodes` | List available OpModes |
| `/init` | Initialize an OpMode |
| `/start` | Start the initialized OpMode |
| `/stop` | Stop the running OpMode |

## Connection Basics

### WiFi Connection (Recommended)

1. Power on your robot
2. Connect your computer to the robot's WiFi network (usually `TEAMNUMBER-RC`)
3. Run `/connect`

### USB Connection

1. Connect USB cable from computer to Control Hub
2. Run `/connect --usb`

### Common Issues

See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for solutions to:
- "ADB not found"
- "Cannot connect to robot"
- "Deploy failed"

## Environment Setup

See [ADB_SETUP.md](ADB_SETUP.md) for platform-specific ADB installation instructions.

## Status HUD

When connected, the status line shows:
```
🤖 Connected (12.4V) │ TeleOp Test [INIT] │ 192.168.43.1
```

See [HUD.md](HUD.md) for configuration options.

## Anti-Patterns

### Don't: Skip /doctor on a new machine

```
# BAD - Jump straight to connecting
/connect  # "ADB not found" error

# GOOD - Check environment first
/doctor   # Identifies missing dependencies
/connect  # Now it works
```

### Don't: Ignore build errors and deploy anyway

```
# BAD - Deploy after build fails
/build    # Shows errors, you ignore them
/deploy   # Deploys old working code, not your changes!

# GOOD - Fix errors before deploying
/build    # Fix any errors shown
/build    # Verify clean build
/deploy   # Now your changes are deployed
```

### Don't: Forget to connect before deploying

```
# BAD - Deploy fails silently
/deploy   # "No device connected" error

# GOOD - Ensure connection first
/connect  # Establish connection
/deploy   # Deploy succeeds
```

### Don't: Debug without filtering logs

```
# BAD - Overwhelmed by system noise
/log      # Thousands of unrelated messages

# GOOD - Filter to what matters
/log --errors     # Only error messages
/log --tag=MyOp   # Only your OpMode's logs
```
