# FTC Youth Safety Review Checks

This skill defines content appropriateness checks for FTC marketplace skills. FTC participants are students ages 12-18, so all content should be appropriate for that audience.

**Important:** These checks flag items for human review. They do not auto-reject content because context matters. A mentor or maintainer should review flagged items.

## Acceptable FTC Terms

These terms are ALLOWED despite potentially triggering filters:

| Term | Context |
|------|---------|
| `kill`, `killer` | Game mechanic (kill shot, killing it) |
| `attack`, `defense` | Game strategy terms |
| `destroy` | Game context (destroy opponent's stack) |
| `target` | Vision targeting, game elements |
| `shoot`, `shooter` | Game mechanisms |
| `score`, `scoring` | Points and objectives |
| `dead` | Battery dead, dead reckoning |

## Severity Levels

| Level | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| Error | Must fix | Personal information, clear violations |
| Warning | Flag for review | Context-dependent, needs human judgment |
| Info | Suggestion | Style improvements |

## Review Process

When flagging items:

1. **Quote the specific content** - Show exactly what was flagged
2. **Explain why** - What rule does it potentially violate
3. **Suggest alternative** - Offer appropriate replacement
4. **Request human review** - A mentor should make final call

## Example Flags

### Flagged (Context Review Needed)
```java
// Variable name flagged
double killer_shot_power = 0.8;  // "killer" flagged - is this game context?
```
**Recommendation:** Rename to `scoring_shot_power` for clarity.

### Acceptable (No Flag)
```java
// Game mechanic - acceptable
void scoreInHighBasket() { ... }

// Dead reckoning - acceptable
void driveByDeadReckoning() { ... }
```

### Must Fix (Error)
```java
// Personal information - must remove
// Created by John Smith, Central High School
String studentEmail = "john@school.edu";
```
**Required:** Remove personal information.
