# NEAR Contract Audit

Security audit skill for NEAR smart contracts in Rust.

## Audit Workflow

### Phase 1: Automated Analysis

Run your preferred Rust static analysis and NEAR-focused security tools on the contract to:

- Scan for common vulnerability patterns (reentrancy, unsafe math, unhandled promises, access control issues, etc.)
- Highlight potentially risky patterns for deeper manual review

### Phase 2: Manual Review

After automated analysis, perform manual review for:

- Business logic vulnerabilities
- Access control patterns
- Economic attack vectors
- Cross-contract interaction safety

### Phase 3: Code-Specific Analysis

For each finding, verify:

1. Is it a true positive?
2. What is the exploitability?
3. What is the recommended fix?

### Phase 4: Report Generation

Document findings with severity, location, description, and remediation.

## Vulnerability Quick Reference
