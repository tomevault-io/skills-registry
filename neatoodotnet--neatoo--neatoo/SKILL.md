# Neatoo Domain Models

Neatoo is a .NET framework for building domain models with automatic change tracking, validation, and rules through Roslyn source generators. It provides base classes that map to DDD concepts.

Neatoo focuses on the domain model: properties, change tracking, validation, rules, and collections. RemoteFactory is a separate, independent tool that generates client-server factories for **any .NET class** — it works with Neatoo entities, plain ViewModels, or POCOs. For factory attributes, authorization, and client-server patterns, see the RemoteFactory skill.

## Quick Start

<!-- snippet: skill-quickstart -->
<a id='snippet-skill-quickstart'></a>
```cs
[Factory]
public partial class Product : EntityBase<Product>
{
    public Product(IEntityBaseServices<Product> services) : base(services) { }

    [Required]
    public partial string Name { get; set; }
    public partial decimal Price { get; set; }

    [Create] public void Create() { }
}
```
<sup><a href='/src/samples/QuickStartSamples.cs#L11-L23' title='Snippet source file'>snippet source</a> | <a href='#snippet-skill-quickstart' title='Start of snippet'>anchor</a></sup>
<!-- endSnippet -->

This generates a factory (`IProductFactory`) with a `Create()` method. Properties auto-track changes, trigger validation, and fire `PropertyChanged`.

## Domain Logic First -- The Core Principle

**Business logic belongs in the domain model, not the UI.** Neatoo domain models are not DTOs that shuttle data to a smart UI. They are rich domain objects that encapsulate business rules, computed state, validation, and reactive behavior. The UI is a thin binding layer.

**When implementing a feature: design domain properties and rules first. Write the UI as a binding layer over those properties. If you find yourself writing business logic in a `.razor` file, stop and move it to the domain model.**

These patterns use `RuleManager.AddAction` and `AddActionAsync`, covered in Core Patterns below and in `references/validation.md`.

### Where Logic Goes

| Logic Type | Neatoo Mechanism | NOT in |
|-----------|-----------------|--------|
| Computed/derived values | `AddAction` with trigger properties | `.razor` arithmetic/ternary |
| Conditional visibility | Domain `bool` property via `AddAction` | `.razor` `@if` chains |
| Parent reacts to child changes | `AddAction` with child trigger `t => t.Items![0].Prop` | UI event handlers |
| Cross-property validation (single trigger) | `AddValidation` / `AddValidationAsync` | UI event handlers |
| Cross-property validation (multiple triggers) | `RuleBase<T>` / `AsyncRuleBase<T>` | UI event handlers |
| Reactive data fetch | `AddActionAsync` | UI `OnChanged` handlers |
| Cascading state changes | Chained rules (rule sets property -> triggers next rule) | UI code-behind |
| Workflow transitions | Domain methods + `AddAction` for `CanX` properties | UI button click handlers |
| LINQ over children | `AddAction` with child trigger, computed property | `.razor` inline LINQ |
| Parent orchestrates between children | `AddAction` with child trigger, action updates other child | UI bridging code |
| Cross-sibling rules in a list | Override `HandleNeatooPropertyChanged` | UI bridging code |

### The Smell Test

When writing or reviewing `.razor` files: if there are more than 3 conditional/computed expressions, business logic is leaking into the UI. Move it to the domain model as rules or computed properties.

```csharp
// WRONG: UI computes
<MudText>@(order.Quantity * order.UnitPrice)</MudText>
@if (order.Quantity > 0 && order.UnitPrice > 0 && order.Total > 500)
{ <MudAlert>Discount!</MudAlert> }

// RIGHT: Domain computes, UI binds
// In constructor: RuleManager.AddAction(t => t.Total = t.Quantity * t.UnitPrice, t => t.Quantity, t => t.UnitPrice);
// In constructor: RuleManager.AddAction(t => t.QualifiesForDiscount = t.Total > 500, t => t.Total);
<MudText>@order.Total</MudText>
@if (order.QualifiesForDiscount) { <MudAlert>Discount!</MudAlert> }
```

See `references/domain-logic-placement.md` for detailed patterns: computed properties, conditional visibility, cascading state, async side-effects, workflow state machines, child property triggers for parent-child reactivity, class-based rules with DI, and the refactoring smell test table.

## Base Class Quick Reference

| DDD Concept | Neatoo Base Class | Use When |
|-------------|-------------------|----------|
| Aggregate Root | `EntityBase<T>` | Root entity with full CRUD lifecycle |
| Entity | `EntityBase<T>` | Child entity within an aggregate |
| Value Object | `ValidateBase<T>` | Data with validation, no persistence lifecycle |
| Entity Collection | `EntityListBase<I>` | List of child entities (tracks deletions) |
| Validate Collection | `ValidateListBase<I>` | List of value objects (no deletion tracking) |
| Command | Static class with `[Execute]` | Server-side operation returning result |
| Read Model | `ValidateBase<T>` with `[Fetch]` only | Query result (no Insert/Update/Delete) |

## Key Properties

**There is no `IsDirty` in Neatoo.** Use `IsModified` / `IsSelfModified`.

| Property | Type | Meaning |
|----------|------|---------|
| `IsModified` | bool | Has unsaved changes (this or children) |
| `IsSelfModified` | bool | This object (only) has changes |
| `IsValid` | bool | This object and all children pass validation |
| `IsSelfValid` | bool | This object (only) passes validation |
| `IsSavable` | bool | `IsValid && IsModified && !IsBusy && !IsChild` |
| `IsNew` | bool | Not yet persisted |
| `IsDeleted` | bool | Marked for deletion |
| `RuleManager` | IRuleManager | Access to validation rules |

## Core Patterns

### Properties with Change Tracking

All Neatoo properties use `partial` properties. The source generator implements backing fields with automatic change tracking and validation triggering:

<!-- snippet: skill-properties-basic -->
<a id='snippet-skill-properties-basic'></a>
```cs
public partial string Name { get; set; }
public partial decimal Price { get; set; }
```
<sup><a href='/src/samples/QuickStartSamples.cs#L35-L38' title='Snippet source file'>snippet source</a> | <a href='#snippet-skill-properties-basic' title='Start of snippet'>anchor</a></sup>
<!-- endSnippet -->

The generator creates property implementations that call `Getter<T>()` and `Setter()` internally.

### Factory Methods

Neatoo entities use RemoteFactory for factory generation. See the `/RemoteFactory` skill for factory attributes (`[Factory]`, `[Create]`, `[Fetch]`, `[Insert]`, `[Update]`, `[Delete]`), service injection (`[Service]`), remote execution (`[Remote]`), and authorization (`[AuthorizeFactory]`).

### Save Routing (Neatoo State-Based)

When `Save()` is called, the factory routes based on Neatoo entity state:
- `IsNew == true` → `[Insert]` method
- `IsNew == false && IsDeleted == false` → `[Update]` method
- `IsDeleted == true` → `[Delete]` method

This routing is automatic based on entity state properties.

### Aggregate Save Cascading

State cascades UP automatically; saves cascade DOWN manually — each parent's `[Insert]`/`[Update]` must call `childFactory.SaveAsync()` on its children. See `references/entities.md` → "Aggregate Save Cascading" for the full pattern, rules, and anti-patterns.

### Validation

Add validation rules in the constructor using RuleManager or validation attributes:

<!-- snippet: skill-validation -->
<a id='snippet-skill-validation'></a>
```cs
public SkillValidationExample(IEntityBaseServices<SkillValidationExample> services) : base(services)
{
    // Inline validation with lambda
    RuleManager.AddValidation(
        emp => string.IsNullOrEmpty(emp.Name) ? "Name is required" : "",
        e => e.Name);

    // Or use validation attributes on properties
    // [Required(ErrorMessage = "Name is required")]
    // public partial string Name { get; set; }
}
```
<sup><a href='/src/samples/SkillValidationSamples.cs#L52-L64' title='Snippet source file'>snippet source</a> | <a href='#snippet-skill-validation' title='Start of snippet'>anchor</a></sup>
<!-- endSnippet -->

RuleManager also provides `AddAction`, `AddActionAsync`, `AddValidationAsync`, and class-based rules. **`AddValidation`/`AddValidationAsync` accept exactly one trigger property** — for multiple triggers, use a class-based rule. See `references/validation.md` for details.

Check validation state with `IsValid`, `IsSelfValid`, and `PropertyMessages`.

### Rules Do NOT Fire During Factory Methods

**Rules (including AddAction computed properties) do NOT fire during `[Create]`, `[Fetch]`, `[Insert]`, `[Update]`, `[Delete]`, or `LoadValue`.** Factory operations are wrapped in `PauseAllActions()`. `ResumeAllActions()` does NOT run rules — it only recalculates cached validity. `PropertyChanged` does NOT fire for changes made while paused.

**`RunRules` works while paused** — it has no `IsPaused` guard. Call `await RunRules(RunRulesFlag.All)` at the end of any factory method that sets properties with dependent AddAction rules:

```csharp
[Create]
public async Task Create()
{
    Quantity = 10;
    UnitPrice = 5.00m;
    await RunRules(RunRulesFlag.All);  // Forces computed properties to populate
    // Total is now 50.00
}
```

Without this call, computed properties remain at their default values when the entity reaches the client. See `references/rules-lifecycle.md` for the complete execution lifecycle, `RunRulesFlag` enum reference, and the factory method timeline.

### Child Property Triggers — Parent Reacts to Child Changes

To react to child property changes in an aggregate, use a child property trigger expression with `AddAction`. The `[0]` indexer is a syntactic placeholder — any child whose named property changes triggers the rule:

```csharp
// Parent recalculates when any child's LineTotal changes
RuleManager.AddAction(
    t => t.OrderTotal = t.Items?.Sum(i => i.LineTotal) ?? 0,
    t => t.Items![0].LineTotal);

// Multiple child property triggers
RuleManager.AddAction(
    t => t.HasInvalidQuantities = t.Items?.Any(i => i.Quantity <= 0) ?? false,
    t => t.Items![0].Quantity);
```

The action body can also push changes to other children — the parent acts as orchestrator:

```csharp
// When ShippingAddress.State changes, update tax on all items
RuleManager.AddAction(
    t => { foreach (var item in t.Items!) item.TaxRate = TaxRates.Get(t.ShippingAddress!.State); },
    t => t.ShippingAddress!.State);
```

**Do NOT use `t => t.Items` as the trigger** — that only fires when the `Items` property reference itself is reassigned, not when child items change. `TriggerProperty.IsMatch` uses exact string equality: `"Items" != "Items.LineTotal"`.

See `references/domain-logic-placement.md` → "Pattern 6: Child Property Triggers" for child triggers, orchestrator patterns, `NeatooPropertyChanged`, and `HandleNeatooPropertyChanged` overrides.

## Testing

**Critical:** Never mock Neatoo interfaces or classes. Use real factories and mock only external dependencies. Use `[SuppressFactory]` on test-only classes that inherit from Neatoo base classes. See `references/testing.md` for patterns and `references/pitfalls.md` for common mistakes.

## Troubleshooting

See `references/pitfalls.md` for common issues. Key quick checks: class and properties must be `partial`, class needs `[Factory]` attribute, and `IsSavable` requires both `IsValid` and `IsModified`.
