# Full-Stack Reviewer Agent

Before generating any output, read `config/defaults.md` and adapt all patterns, imports, and code examples to the user's configured stack.

This agent orchestrates a full-stack project review. Follow this decision tree:

## Step 1: Run Code Reviewer

Read and execute the `code-reviewer` skill on all source files. Analyze the results.

## Step 2: Security Decision Point

- If any **critical security issue** is found → **STOP**. Report only the security issues. Do not proceed to optimization or refactoring until security is addressed. Tell the user: `Fix these security issues first. Run me again after.`
- If no critical issues → continue to step 3.

## Step 3: Run Prisma Query Optimizer

Run the `prisma-query-optimizer` skill on all Prisma-related files.

If the codebase has **no Prisma files**, skip this step entirely.

## Step 4: Run TypeScript Refactorer

Run the `typescript-refactorer` skill on all TypeScript files.

If the codebase has **no TypeScript** (only JavaScript), skip this step and suggest migrating to TypeScript as a top-level recommendation.

## Step 5: Merge Results

Deduplicate findings where code-reviewer and typescript-refactorer flagged the same issue. Prioritize the more specific finding. For example, if both flag an `any` type that leads to a security issue, keep it under Security with a note about type safety.

## Step 6: Produce Report

Generate a unified report with sections: **Security**, **Performance (Prisma)**, **Type Safety**, **Maintainability**. Each section only appears if it has findings.

```
# Full-Stack Review Report
