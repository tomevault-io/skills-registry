# Testing Workflow
After code is developed, tests must be run to ensure the integrity of the final result.

**Crucial:** Tests MUST be run inside the container to access the correct runtime environment (DB, Config, Dependencies).

## 0. Pre-requisites: Environment Check

Before running any tests, verify you are inside the development container:

```bash
ls -d /workspaces/NetAlertX
```

**IF** this directory does not exist, you are likely on the host machine. You **MUST** immediately activate the `devcontainer-management` skill to enter the container or run commands inside it.

```text
activate_skill("devcontainer-management")
```

## 1. Full Test Suite (MANDATORY DEFAULT)

Unless the user **explicitly** requests "fast" or "quick" tests, you **MUST** run the full test suite. **Do not** optimize for time. Comprehensive coverage is the priority over speed.

```bash
cd /workspaces/NetAlertX; pytest test/
```

## 2. Fast Unit Tests (Conditional)

**ONLY** use this if the user explicitly asks for "fast tests", "quick tests", or "unit tests only". This **excludes** slow tests marked with `docker` or `feature_complete`.

```bash
cd /workspaces/NetAlertX; pytest test/ -m 'not docker and not feature_complete'
```

## 3. Running Specific Tests

To run a specific file or folder:

```bash
cd /workspaces/NetAlertX; pytest test/<path_to_test>
```

*Example:*
```bash
cd /workspaces/NetAlertX; pytest test/api_endpoints/test_mcp_extended_endpoints.py
```

## Authentication & Environment Reset

Authentication tokens are required to perform certain operations such as manual testing or crafting expressions to work with the web APIs. After making code changes, you MUST reset the environment to ensure the new code is running and verify you have the latest `API_TOKEN`.

1. **Reset Environment:** Run the setup script inside the container.
   ```bash
   bash /workspaces/NetAlertX/.devcontainer/scripts/setup.sh
   ```
2. **Wait for Stabilization:** Wait at least 5 seconds for services (nginx, python server, etc.) to start.
   ```bash
   sleep 5
   ```
3. **Obtain Token:** Retrieve the current token from the container.
   ```bash
   python3 -c "from helper import get_setting_value; print(get_setting_value('API_TOKEN'))"
   ```

The retrieved token MUST be used in all subsequent API or test calls requiring authentication.

### Troubleshooting

If tests fail with 403 Forbidden or empty tokens:
1. Verify server is running and use the setup script (`/workspaces/NetAlertX/.devcontainer/scripts/setup.sh`) if required.
2. Verify `app.conf` inside the container: `cat /data/config/app.conf`
3. Verify Python can read it: `python3 -c "from helper import get_setting_value; print(get_setting_value('API_TOKEN'))"`
