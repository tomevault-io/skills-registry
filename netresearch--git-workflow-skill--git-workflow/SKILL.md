# Git Workflow Skill

Expert patterns for Git version control: branching, commits, collaboration, and CI/CD.

## Reference Files

Load references on demand based on the task at hand:

| Reference | Content Triggers |
|-----------|-----------------|
| `references/branching-strategies.md` | Branching model, Git Flow, GitHub Flow, trunk-based, branch protection |
| `references/commit-conventions.md` | Commit messages, conventional commits, semantic versioning, commitlint |
| `references/pull-request-workflow.md` | PR create/review/merge, thread resolution, merge strategies, CODEOWNERS, signed commits + rebase |
| `references/ci-cd-integration.md` | GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, semantic release, deployment |
| `references/advanced-git.md` | Rebase, cherry-pick, bisect, stash, worktrees, reflog, submodules, recovery |
| `references/github-releases.md` | Release management, immutable releases, `--latest=false`, multi-branch |
| `references/git-hooks-setup.md` | Hook frameworks, detection, recommended hooks per stage |
| `references/code-quality-tools.md` | shellcheck, shfmt, git-absorb, difftastic |

## Conventional Commits

```
<type>[scope]: <description>
```

**Types**: `feat` (MINOR), `fix` (PATCH), `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `revert`

**Breaking change**: Add `!` after type or `BREAKING CHANGE:` in footer.

## Branch Naming

```
feature/TICKET-123-description
fix/TICKET-456-bug-name
release/1.2.0
hotfix/1.2.1-security-patch
```

## Hook Detection

Before first commit, detect and install hooks:

```bash
ls lefthook.yml .lefthook.yml captainhook.json .pre-commit-config.yaml .husky/pre-commit 2>/dev/null || echo "No hooks"
```

Install: lefthook.yml -> `lefthook install` | captainhook.json -> `composer install` | .husky/ -> `npm install` | .pre-commit-config.yaml -> `pre-commit install`

## Critical Release Rules

1. **Immutable releases**: Deleted GitHub releases block tag names PERMANENTLY. Never delete releases to "fix" issues -- bump version instead.
2. **Multi-branch releases**: Always use `--latest=false` when releasing from non-default branches (LTS, maintenance, hotfix).
3. **Pre-release checklist**: Version updated in source files, CI passes, CHANGELOG updated, `git pull` on main -- verify BEFORE `gh release create`.

## PR Merge Requirements

Before merging: all threads resolved, CI checks green (including annotations), branch rebased, commits signed (if required). For signed commits + rebase-only repos, use local `git merge --ff-only`.

## Verification

```bash
./scripts/verify-git-workflow.sh /path/to/repository
```
