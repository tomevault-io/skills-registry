# TYPO3 Extension Upgrade Skill

Systematic framework for upgrading TYPO3 extensions to newer LTS versions.
Extension code only -- NOT for project/core upgrades.

## Upgrade Toolkit

| Tool | Purpose | Files |
|------|---------|-------|
| Extension Scanner | Diagnose deprecated APIs | TYPO3 Backend |
| Rector | Automated PHP migrations | `.php` |
| Fractor | Non-PHP migrations | FlexForms, TypoScript, YAML, Fluid |
| PHPStan | Static analysis | `.php` |

## Core Workflow

1. Complete planning phase (consult `references/pre-upgrade.md`)
2. Create feature branch (verify git is clean)
3. Update `composer.json` constraints for target version
4. **Audit third-party dependencies** for major version changes (consult `references/third-party-dependency-upgrades.md`)
5. Run `rector process --dry-run` then review and apply
6. Run `fractor process --dry-run` then review and apply
7. Run `php-cs-fixer fix`
8. Run `phpstan analyse` **against each supported dependency version** and fix errors
9. Run `phpunit` and fix tests
10. Test in target TYPO3 version(s)
11. Verify success criteria (consult `references/verification.md`)

## When NOT to Apply Automatically

Do NOT blindly apply Rector/Fractor if dual-version compatibility is needed,
tests are missing, changes are unclear, or complex APIs (DBAL, Extbase) are
affected. Instead: apply specific rules manually, test between each change.

## Third-Party Dependency Upgrades

When `composer.json` widens constraints to a new major version of ANY dependency:

1. **Enumerate** all usages of the dependency's API in the codebase
2. **Cross-reference** against the new version's API (removed/renamed methods)
3. **Flag** methods called on interfaces that only exist on concrete classes
4. **Verify** test mocks reference methods existing in ALL supported versions
5. **Use adapter pattern** when method signatures differ between versions
6. **Run PHPStan** against EACH supported major version

See `references/third-party-dependency-upgrades.md` for details.

## Quick Commands

```bash
rector process --dry-run && rector process        # PHP migrations
fractor process --dry-run && fractor process       # Non-PHP migrations
php-cs-fixer fix && phpstan analyse && phpunit     # Quality checks
```

## Asset Templates

Config templates in `assets/`: `rector.php`, `fractor.php`, `phpstan.neon`, `phpunit.xml`, `.php-cs-fixer.php`
