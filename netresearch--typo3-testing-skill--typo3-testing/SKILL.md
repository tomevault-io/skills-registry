description: Use when setting up TYPO3 extension test infrastructure, writing unit/functional/E2E tests, configuring PHPUnit, mutation testing, mocking, CI/CD test pipelines, or debugging CI failures. For existing test suites, run the automated-assessment skill first to identify gaps. Also triggers on: ensure proper testing, test matrix, integration testing, e2e testing, coverage, test generation.

# TYPO3 Testing Skill

## Assessment-First Rule

**When enhancing an existing test suite** (not setting up from scratch), run the automated-assessment skill FIRST:

```bash
automated-assessment typo3-testing
```

> Install additional skills (e.g. `typo3-conformance`, `enterprise-readiness`) for broader assessment coverage.

This generates a gap report from 73+ checkpoints covering PHPUnit config, PHPStan level, runTests.sh, CaptainHook hooks, architecture tests, mutation thresholds, CI matrix, and coverage per class.

**Use the assessment report as the task list.** Resolve mechanical checkpoint failures before manual test writing.

### When This Rule Applies
- "enhance/improve/strengthen tests", "increase coverage/mutation score"
- "enterprise grade", "A+ testing", "fix all findings"

### When This Rule Does NOT Apply
- Setting up from scratch, writing a specific test, debugging a failing test

## Test Type Selection

| Type | Use When | Speed |
|------|----------|-------|
| **Unit** | Pure logic, no DB, validators, utilities | Fast |
| **Functional** | DB interactions, repositories, controllers | Medium |
| **Architecture** | Layer constraints, dependency rules (phpat) | Fast |
| **E2E (Playwright)** | User workflows, browser, accessibility | Slow |
| **Integration** | HTTP client, API mocking, OAuth flows | Medium |
| **Mutation** | Test quality verification, 70%+ coverage | CI/Release |

## runTests.sh - Mandatory

`Build/Scripts/runTests.sh` is mandatory. Must be executable, support `-s` (suite) and `-p` (PHP version).

## Git Hooks

Verify: `ls captainhook.json .git/hooks/pre-commit 2>/dev/null` (see `references/captainhook-setup.md`)

## Commands

```bash
# Setup (from skill dir)
scripts/setup-testing.sh [--with-e2e]
scripts/validate-setup.sh
scripts/generate-test.sh <Type> <Class>

# Run (always via runTests.sh)
Build/Scripts/runTests.sh -s unit|functional|phpstan|cgl|mutation|ci
```

Verify tests fail before fix, pass after.

## Scoring Requirements

| Criterion | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Unit tests | Required, 70%+ coverage |
| Functional tests | Required for DB operations |
| Architecture tests | **phpat required** for full points |
| PHPStan | Level 10 (max) |

### Content Triggers

- CI test failures across TYPO3 versions: load `ci-debugging.md`
- Functional tests with TSFE context: load `functional-testing.md`
- Mock failures across dependency versions: load `mock-validity.md`
- Image processing or extension-dependent tests: load `test-environment-guards.md`
- Event dispatcher testing with try/catch: load `event-dispatch-testing.md`
