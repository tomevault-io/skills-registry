# GitHub Copilot CLI

The new GitHub Copilot agentic CLI is integrated directly into the GitHub CLI (`gh`). The older standalone `github-copilot-cli` package and the `gh-copilot` extension are deprecated. You must use `gh copilot` which now triggers the new agentic experience natively.

When integrated into an AI workflow (AI evaluating AI), it acts as a robust secondary reviewer mapping against different context windows and potentially different foundational models than the primary agent, significantly reducing confirmation bias during PR or full-repository reviews.

> **⚠️ CRITICAL — Non-Interactive Mode**: The `gh copilot` CLI must be run in non-interactive mode using the `-p` (or `--prompt`) flag. Omitting this flag will launch an interactive UI and hang the agent indefinitely. Use `-s` (silent) to suppress styling/decorations and output raw text.

## Installation & Authentication Baseline

Before using the CLI in automated pipelines, ensure the terminal environment is equipped and authenticated:

```bash
# 1. Verify availability
gh copilot --version || echo "Copilot not installed"

# 2. Pre-check / Authenticate
# Check auth status first. If this fails, the environment cannot use Copilot.
gh auth status
# If unauthenticated, human interaction is required (which agents cannot do).
# Fallback: Gracefully skip the Copilot execution step, log the skip reason, and proceed with other tasks.
# gh auth login
```

## Agentic Interaction Strategies

Because the Copilot CLI is primarily interactive, standalone non-interactive agents cannot easily navigate its interactive UI natively for arbitrary open-ended tasks.

However, you can leverage its single-shot non-interactive mode (`-p`) for targeted tasks:

### Direct Tool Commands

For precise shell suggestions or file explanations in automated workflows:

```bash
# Shell Suggestion (Evaluates context and produces command)
gh copilot -p -s "find all files over 5mb in the current directory"

# File Explanation
gh copilot -p -s "explain src/utils/crypto.ts"
```

## Workflows Integration

This skill works synergistically with `github-commander`. Use the `copilot-audit` workflow via `github-commander` to execute a structured, auditable validation loop utilizing this CLI before generating PRs.

### Quota & Rate Limiting

Batch requests where possible when reviewing large repositories. Copilot CLI is subject to GitHub API rate limits. Instead of evaluating 50 files individually, group your prompts to evaluate architectural directories in conceptual batches.
