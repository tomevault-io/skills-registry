# Upgrade Next.js

Upgrade the current project to a targeted Next.js version following official migration guides.

## Instructions

1. **Detect current environment**:
   - Read `package.json` to identify the current Next.js version, React version, and package manager (`npm`, `pnpm`, `yarn`).
   - Read the lockfile to ensure you use the correct package manager.

2. **Determine target version**:
   - Do NOT blindly use `@latest`. Always determine the explicit target version (e.g., `15.0.0`) based on user request or current LTS.
   - For major version jumps, upgrade incrementally (e.g., 13 → 14 → 15).

3. **Consult Upgrade Decision Tree**:
   - Read [references/decision-tree.md](references/decision-tree.md) to find the correct codemods and checklists for your target version.

4. **Security Gate**:
   - You MUST request explicit user confirmation before running any codemod that modifies source files.

5. **Run codemods FIRST (before installing new versions)**:
   - Next.js codemods should often be run against the _old_ codebase before upgrading to automate breaking changes.
   - Example: `npx @next/codemod@<target-version> <transform> <path>`

6. **Pin dependencies**:
   - Upgrade Next.js and peer dependencies to the specific target version:
   - Example: `pnpm install next@15.0.0 react@19.0.0 react-dom@19.0.0`

7. **Review Diff**:
   - After running codemods and installing new dependencies, you MUST run `git diff` or review the changes.
   - Do NOT commit or ship without explicit user review of the codemod changes.

8. **Test the upgrade**:
   - Run `npm run build` (or equivalent) to check for build errors.
   - If there are errors in `next.config.js` or routing, resolve them manually.
