# Rust Development & Meta-Cognition

When solving Rust problems, **do not immediately write code.** Trace through the cognitive layers first to understand the data's lifecycle, ownership, and constraints.

## 🧠 1. The Meta-Cognition Framework (Before You Code)

### Layer 1: Domain Constraints (WHY)

What is the system trying to achieve?

- **Web Service:** Concurrent, async, low-latency (Often uses `axum`, `tokio`, `Arc<Mutex<T>>`).
- **CLI Tool:** Fast startup, zero overhead, clean exit codes (Often uses `clap`, `anyhow`, strict error formatting).
- **Embedded / Systems:** No heap allocation (Requires `no_std`, specific hardware limitations).

### Layer 2: Design Choices & Ownership (WHAT)

Ask the core question: **Who should own this data?**

- _Single owner, strictly unique_: Direct value or `Box<T>`.
- _Single thread, multiple owners_: `Rc<T>` (use `RefCell<T>` for mutation).
- _Multi-thread, multiple owners_: `Arc<T>` (use `Mutex<T>` or `RwLock<T>` for mutation).

**Why does it need to mutate?** Avoid slapping `mut` everywhere. Prefer returning new values or using tight, scoped mutability.

### Layer 3: Language Mechanics (HOW)

Use the compiler's strictness as a tool, not an obstacle.

- Implement standard traits: `Drop`, `Clone`, `Default`, `Display`, `From`, `TryFrom`.
- Avoid `unwrap()` or `expect()` in production logic. Propagate errors natively via `?` and `Result`.

## 🛡️ 3. Solving Borrow Checker Errors

Consult [references/borrow-checker.md](references/borrow-checker.md) for diagnostics and resolution paths for common compiler errors (E0382, E0596, E0499).

## ⚡ 4. High-Integrity Code Patterns

1. **Avoid Panic-Driven Development**: `clone()` is an acceptable escape hatch during prototyping, but do not scatter it throughout the code. Revisit the lifetime boundaries as soon as it works.
2. **The Newtype Pattern**: Use tuple structs to prevent invalid state. `struct UserId(u64);` avoids mixing it up with `struct OrderId(u64);`.
3. **Exhaustive Matching**: Prefer `match` over `if let` when handling Enums or State Machines. The compiler will notify you when a new variant is added, preventing silent bugs.
4. **Data-Oriented Modeling**: Prefer small, flat structs that compose over deep, object-oriented inheritance hierarchies.

## 🛠️ 5. Standard Commands

- **Run Application**: `cargo run`
- **Linting / Idioms**: `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`
- **Formatting**: `cargo fmt`
- **Testing**: `cargo test`

**Agent Directive:** When writing or editing Rust code, always invoke `cargo clippy` and `cargo test` dynamically to validate your implementations before concluding your task.

## 🔒 6. Security & `unsafe` Blocks

Avoid `unsafe` blocks. If you must use `unsafe` for FFI or performance, you MUST thoroughly document the exact safety invariants being upheld inside the block.

Require user confirmation before executing any command with external side effects, including `cargo publish` and registry operations.
