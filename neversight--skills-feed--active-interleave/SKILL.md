# Active Interleave Skill

Interleaves context from recently active Claude/Amp threads into current activity via random walk.

**Active Inference Pattern**: The interleave implements [Active Inference in String Diagrams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00861) epistemic foraging — actively sampling from recent contexts to minimize uncertainty about the current task. Each random walk step is an epistemic action that gathers information.

**Play/Coplay Duality**: The interleave embodies bmorphism's bidirectional principle:
- **Play** (action): Query recent threads, walk the awareness graph
- **Coplay** (perception): Integrate fragments, update current context

**GF(3) Balanced Exploration**: The triadic structure (MINUS/ERGODIC/PLUS) ensures balanced exploration — validation filters (MINUS), random walk explores (ERGODIC), and colored emission generates (PLUS). Conservation Σ = 0 maintains coherence.

## Activation

Load when context from recent work would help current task.

## Usage

```bash
# Interleave from last 24 hours
bb ~/.claude/skills/active-interleave/active.bb

# Interleave from last N hours
bb ~/.claude/skills/active-interleave/active.bb --hours 6

# Query-focused interleave
bb ~/.claude/skills/active-interleave/active.bb --query "aptos blockchain"

# JSON output
bb ~/.claude/skills/active-interleave/active.bb --json
```

## Behavior

1. **MINUS (-1)**: Validate recency window, filter to active threads only
2. **ERGODIC (0)**: Random walk through recent sessions following awareness edges  
3. **PLUS (+1)**: Emit interleaved fragments with GF(3) coloring

## GF(3) Conservation

Each interleave batch maintains Σ trits ≡ 0 (mod 3).

## Integration

Call from current thread to surface relevant recent context:

```clojure
;; In any bb script
(require '[babashka.process :refer [shell]])
(def context (-> (shell {:out :string} "bb" (str (System/getProperty "user.home") 
                 "/.claude/skills/active-interleave/active.bb") "--json")
                 :out))
```

## Schema

Reads from `~/worldnet/cognition.duckdb`:
- `messages` - Content with timestamps
- `sessions` - Session metadata  
- `awareness_edges` - Play/coplay graph
- `temporal_index` - Time-ordered index



## Scientific Skill Interleaving

This skill connects to the K-Dense-AI/claude-scientific-skills ecosystem:

### Graph Theory
- **networkx** [○] via bicomodule
  - Universal graph hub

### Bibliography References

- `general`: 734 citations in bib.duckdb



## SDF Interleaving

This skill connects to **Software Design for Flexibility** (Hanson & Sussman, 2021):

### Primary Chapter: 6. Layering

**Concepts**: layered data, metadata, provenance, units

### GF(3) Balanced Triad

```
active-interleave (−) + SDF.Ch6 (+) + [balancer] (○) = 0
```

**Skill Trit**: -1 (MINUS - verification)

### Secondary Chapters

- Ch4: Pattern Matching
- Ch7: Propagators
- Ch10: Adventure Game Example

### Connection Pattern

Layering adds metadata. This skill tracks provenance or annotations.
## Cat# Integration

This skill maps to **Cat# = Comod(P)** as a bicomodule in the equipment structure:

```
Trit: 0 (ERGODIC)
Home: Prof
Poly Op: ⊗
Kan Role: Adj
Color: #26D826
```

### GF(3) Naturality

The skill participates in triads satisfying:
```
(-1) + (0) + (+1) ≡ 0 (mod 3)
```

This ensures compositional coherence in the Cat# equipment structure.
