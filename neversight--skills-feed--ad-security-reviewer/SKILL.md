2. Identify NTLM fallback scenarios and weak encryption
3. Evaluate LDAP signing and channel binding enforcement
4. Assess Kerberos hardening (PAC enforcement, AES encryption)

```

## Best Practices

### Security Analysis Excellence

- Always create rollback plans before implementing changes
- Validate in test environment before production changes
- Document all security decisions and justifications
- Prioritize quick wins alongside structural changes
- Test remediation scripts before deployment
- Monitor for unintended side effects after changes
- Use least-privilege principle for all operations
- Maintain audit trail of all security modifications

### Assessment Methodology

- Follow a systematic approach: enumerate, analyze, prioritize, remediate
- Use multiple data sources to triangulate findings (LDAP, PowerShell, Azure AD)
- Validate findings against multiple systems to avoid false positives
- Document evidence for every finding (screenshots, query results)
- Consider both technical and organizational security factors
- Assess not just current state but also configuration drift

### Remediation Planning

- Prioritize by risk, not just ease of implementation
- Group related changes into cohesive remediation batches
- Provide multiple remediation options with trade-offs
- Include validation steps for each remediation action
- Document rollback procedures even if not expected to be needed
- Consider business impact and schedule changes during maintenance windows
- Communicate changes to affected teams before implementation

### Tool Selection and Usage

- Use native tools (PowerShell, ADUC) first, third-party tools second
- Validate tool outputs against multiple data sources
- Keep authentication and privilege escalation tools secure
- Consider audit logging requirements for all tools
- Use automation consistently across all domains
- Test tools in non-production first to validate behavior

### Reporting and Documentation

- Executive summaries should be actionable and concise
- Technical details should be reproducible by other analysts
- Include both finding and evidence in every report
- Provide clear remediation steps with PowerShell examples
- Track remediation progress over time
- Update documentation as environment changes

## Examples

### Example 1: Large Enterprise AD Security Assessment

**Scenario:** A Fortune 500 company with 50K users, 200+ domains, and complex trust relationships needs comprehensive security assessment.

**Assessment Approach:**
1. **Enumeration Phase**: Automated discovery of all domains, trusts, and privileged groups
2. **Analysis Phase**: Cross-domain analysis of permissions and delegation
3. **Risk Scoring**: Prioritized findings based on exploitability and impact
4. **Remediation Planning**: Phased approach addressing critical findings first

**Key Findings:**
- 847 accounts with Domain Admin privileges (should be <50)
- 23 domains with weak password policies (no complexity, no lockout)
- Cross-forest trusts using outdated authentication protocols
- 156 stale service accounts with excessive privileges

**Remediation Delivered:**
- Tiered admin model implementation reducing DA count to 32
- Password policy standardization across all domains
- Trust migration to selective authentication
- Service account lifecycle management automation

### Example 2: Privilege Escalation Path Analysis

**Scenario:** Security team suspects lateral movement paths exist from standard user accounts to Domain Admin.

**Investigation Approach:**
1. **Account Enumeration**: Query all user accounts and their group memberships
2. **Trust Mapping**: Map all delegation relationships and ACL permissions
3. **Path Analysis**: Use BloodHound-like analysis to find attack paths
4. **Exploit Validation**: Test identified paths in controlled environment

**Attack Paths Identified:**
- User accounts with "Write to user" permissions allowing DCSync
- Stale computer accounts usable for Kerberoasting
- Unconstrained delegation on legacy application servers
- Overly permissive cross-namespace permissions

**Remediation:**
- ACL cleanup with explicit justification for each permission
- Computer account restriction to required SPNs
- Migration from unconstrained to constrained delegation
- Cross-forest permission review and normalization

### Example 3: Cloud Hybrid Identity Security Review

**Scenario:** Organization with hybrid identity (AD Connect sync to Entra ID) needs security review of both environments.

**Assessment Scope:**
1. **On-Prem AD**: Password policies, MFA registration, risky sign-ins
2. **Entra ID**: Conditional Access policies, PIM configurations, consent grants
3. **AD Connect**: Sync permissions, filtering rules, device writeback
4. **Integration**: Pass-through authentication security, seamless SSO risks

**Findings and Remediation:**
- Pass-through Authentication agents not isolated from other workloads
- Conditional Access policies allowing legacy authentication
- Global Admins with permanent access (no PIM)
- Consent grants to unverified publisher applications

**Deliverables:**
- Hybrid identity security architecture diagram
- Entra ID Conditional Access policy recommendations
- AD Connect hardening checklist
- Ongoing monitoring and alerting rules
