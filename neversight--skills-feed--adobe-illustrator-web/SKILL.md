# Adobe Illustrator Web Skill

## Overview

## Quick Install

```bash

```

Or manually:
```bash
cp -r skills/adobe-illustrator-web ~/.canifi/skills/

canifi-env set ADOBE_EMAIL "your-email@example.com"
canifi-env set ADOBE_PASSWORD "your-password"
```

## Privacy & Authentication

**Your credentials, your choice.** Canifi LifeOS respects your privacy.

### Option 1: Manual Browser Login (Recommended)
If you prefer not to share credentials with Claude Code:
1. Complete the [Browser Automation Setup](/setup/automation) using CDP mode
2. Login to the service manually in the Playwright-controlled Chrome window
3. Claude will use your authenticated session without ever seeing your password

### Option 2: Environment Variables
If you're comfortable sharing credentials, you can store them locally:
```bash
