# Agent Skills

> Agent Skills are folders of instructions, scripts, and resources that agents can discover and use to do things more accurately and efficiently. An open standard for packaging agent capabilities.

## Quick Start

A skill is a folder with a `SKILL.md` file:

```
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md          # Required: instructions + metadata
├── scripts/          # Optional: executable code
├── references/       # Optional: documentation
└── assets/           # Optional: templates, resources
```

Minimal `SKILL.md`:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: Does X when user needs Y.
---

# My Skill

### Learning Path

1. **Foundation**: Read `docs/001-home.md` for overview
2. **Concepts**: Read `docs/002-what-are-skills.md` for structure
3. **Integration**: Read `docs/003-integrate-skills.md` for implementation
4. **Reference**: Consult `docs/004-specification.md` for technical details

## Common Tasks

### Create a new skill
→ `docs/002-what-are-skills.md` (structure and SKILL.md format)
→ `docs/004-specification.md` (frontmatter fields, naming rules)

### Integrate skills into an agent
→ `docs/003-integrate-skills.md` (discovery, metadata, activation)

### Validate skill format
→ `docs/004-specification.md` (validation rules, skills-ref tool)

### Understand progressive disclosure
→ `docs/002-what-are-skills.md` (how skills manage context efficiently)
