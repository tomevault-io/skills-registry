# AgentPreso — AI-Native Presentations

Create professional slide decks from markdown with charts, diagrams, AI-generated graphics, and 10 built-in themes.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install the CLI
curl -fsSL https://agentpreso.com/install.sh | sh

# 2. Authenticate
agentpreso login

# 3. Create a deck (generates a markdown file from the theme scaffold)
agentpreso create my-deck --theme glacier

# 4. Push to cloud
agentpreso push my-deck.md

# 5. Render to PDF
agentpreso render my-deck.md --format pdf
```

## When to Use

Activate this skill when the user wants to:
- Create slides, presentations, decks, or pitch decks
- Add charts or diagrams to slides
- Export slides to PDF or PPTX
- Work with Marp markdown
- Mentions AgentPreso by name
- Needs a visual summary, report, or briefing in slide format

## Markdown Format

Decks are single `.md` files. Frontmatter sets metadata and theme:

```markdown
---
marp: true
theme: glacier
title: My Presentation
---

<!-- _class: title-hero -->

# Presentation Title

Subtitle or tagline

---

<!-- _class: bullets -->

# Key Points

- First insight with supporting detail
- Second insight with data
- Third insight with takeaway

---

<!-- _class: two-col -->

# Comparison

::: left

**Option A**
Description of the first option.

::: right

**Option B**
Description of the second option.
```

**Key syntax:**
- `---` separates slides
- `<!-- _class: layout-name -->` sets a slide layout
- `::: left`, `::: right`, `::: center` mark columns
- `<!-- _class: invert -->` enables dark mode on a slide
- `{{variable}}` template variables replaced at render time
- `asset://filename.png` references uploaded images
- Chart blocks: `` ```chart `` with YAML (type, data with labels/values or x/series)
- Diagram blocks: `` ```mermaid `` with Mermaid syntax
- AI images: `` ```generated_image `` with a text prompt

## Slide Design Principles

- **Every slide needs a visual** — use charts, diagrams, images, or icons. Walls of text lose the audience.
- **Vary your layouts** — alternate between bullets, two-col, img-right, stats-grid. Repetition is boring.
- **One idea per slide** — if you have two points, make two slides. Density kills clarity.
- **Preview before you are done** — render and review. Adjust text fitting, check image placement, verify chart readability.

## Review Strategy

After creating a deck, preview every slide and review for quality. Two approaches:

**Parallel (recommended when subagents are available):** Spawn read-only subagents to review slide PNGs in parallel — one per slide or batch of 2-3. Each subagent checks the 3-second test, title quality, text density, visual presence, and layout fit, then reports findings as text. The parent agent collects findings, edits the `.md` file once, and re-previews only changed slides. See `commands/create-deck.md` for the full protocol.

**Sequential (default):** Review each slide preview yourself, fix issues, re-push, re-preview until satisfied.
