# AI-Generated Text Detection Skill

## Purpose

Detect patterns typical of LLM-generated text to ensure natural, human-authored academic writing. This skill helps maintain authenticity in research publications, dissertations, and documentation.

## When to Use This Skill

### Primary Use Cases
1. **Pre-Commit Validation** - Automatically check manuscripts and documentation before git commits
2. **Manuscript Review** - Validate academic writing before submission to journals or committees  
3. **Quality Assurance** - Part of systematic QA workflow for research artifacts
4. **On-Demand Analysis** - Manual review of any text file for AI patterns
5. **Writing Evolution Tracking** - Monitor writing style changes over time

### Specific Scenarios
- Before submitting dissertation chapters to advisor
- Prior to journal article submission
- When reviewing team member contributions
- After making significant edits to documentation
- When suspicious patterns are noticed in writing
- During peer review or committee review preparation

## Detection Methodology

### 1. Grammar Pattern Analysis

**What We Check:**
- **Excessive Perfection**: Zero typos, missing commas, or minor errors throughout
- **Comma Placement**: Perfect comma usage in all complex sentences
- **Formal Register**: Consistent formal tone with no informal elements
- **Grammar Consistency**: No variations in grammatical choices

**Red Flags:**
- Absolutely no grammatical errors in 10+ pages
- Every semicolon and colon used perfectly
- No sentence fragments or run-ons even in appropriate contexts
- Overly formal language even in methods sections

**Human Writing Typically Has:**
- Occasional minor typos or comma splices
- Some inconsistency in formality
- Natural variations in grammar choices
- Context-appropriate informality

### 2. Sentence Structure Uniformity

**What We Check:**
- **Sentence Length Distribution**: Variation in sentence lengths
- **Structural Patterns**: Repetitive sentence structures
- **Complexity Variation**: Mix of simple, compound, complex sentences
- **Opening Patterns**: How sentences begin

**Red Flags:**
- Most sentences 15-25 words (AI sweet spot)
- Repetitive subject-verb-object patterns
- Every paragraph starts with topic sentence
- Excessive use of transition words at sentence starts
- Predictable sentence complexity patterns

**Human Writing Typically Has:**
- Wide variation (5-40+ word sentences)
- Unpredictable sentence structures
- Occasional fragments for emphasis
- Natural flow without forced transitions

### 3. Paragraph Structure Analysis

**What We Check:**
- **Paragraph Length**: Uniformity vs. natural variation
- **Structural Pattern**: Topic sentence + support + conclusion pattern
- **Information Flow**: Natural vs. algorithmic organization
- **Paragraph Transitions**: Connection between paragraphs

**Red Flags:**
- All paragraphs 4-6 sentences long
- Every paragraph follows same structure  
- Mechanical transitions between paragraphs
- Perfectly balanced paragraph lengths
- No single-sentence paragraphs

**Human Writing Typically Has:**
- Paragraph length variation (1-10+ sentences)
- Structural diversity based on content
- Natural transitions
- Strategic use of short/long paragraphs for emphasis

### 4. Word Frequency Analysis (AI-Typical Words)

**High-Risk AI Words** (overused by LLMs):

**Verbs:**
- "delve" (rarely used by humans)
- "leverage" (business jargon)
- "utilize" (instead of "use")
- "facilitate" (overly formal)
- "demonstrate" (overused)
- "implement" (in non-technical contexts)
- "enhance" (marketing language)

**Adjectives:**
- "robust" (technical overuse)
- "comprehensive" (vague intensifier)
- "innovative" (buzzword)
- "cutting-edge" (cliché)
- "significant" (statistical overuse)
- "substantial" (formal overuse)
- "considerable" (formal overuse)
- "crucial" (intensity overuse)

**Transition Words** (overused):
- "furthermore" (very formal)
- "moreover" (archaic feeling)
- "additionally" (redundant)
- "consequently" (overused)
- "subsequently" (temporal overuse)
- "nevertheless" (formal overuse)
- "nonetheless" (synonym overuse)

**Phrases:**
- "it is important to note that"
- "it should be emphasized that"
- "a comprehensive analysis of"
- "in the context of"
- "with respect to"
- "in terms of"
- "in order to" (instead of "to")

**Detection Criteria:**
- Count frequency per 1000 words
- Compare to human academic writing baselines
- Flag if 3+ high-risk words per 1000 words
- Weight by word rarity (delve = high weight)

### 5. Punctuation Patterns

**What We Check:**
- **Semicolon Usage**: Frequency and correctness
- **Colon Usage**: Perfect usage patterns
- **Em-Dash Usage**: Consistent stylistic choices
- **Comma Patterns**: Perfection vs. natural variation
- **Ellipsis/Exclamation**: Absence in informal contexts

**Red Flags:**
- Excessive semicolon use (2+ per paragraph)
- Perfect colon usage throughout
- Consistent em-dash formatting (—)
- No missing commas anywhere
- Zero informal punctuation

**Human Writing Typically Has:**
- Inconsistent punctuation choices
- Occasional missing/extra commas
- Variable dash formatting (- vs -- vs —)
- Some informal punctuation where appropriate

## Confidence Scoring System

## Improvement Suggestions

### For High Confidence (70-100%) Detections

**Sentence Structure:**
- ❌ "Furthermore, the results demonstrate a comprehensive analysis of the robust dataset."
- ✅ "The results show our analysis covered the full dataset."

**Why Better:** Simpler words, no transition word, more direct

**Word Choice:**
- ❌ "This study delves into the utilization of innovative methodologies."
- ✅ "We examine how researchers use new methods."

**Why Better:** Active voice, common words, clearer meaning

**Paragraph Variation:**
- ❌ All paragraphs 5 sentences, topic sentence + 3 support + conclusion
- ✅ Mix paragraph lengths: 2, 7, 4, 3, 6 sentences based on content needs

**Why Better:** Natural flow based on content, not formula

### Specific Suggestion Categories

#### 1. Vary Sentence Lengths
```
Current: 15-25 word sentences consistently
Suggestion: Mix short (5-10), medium (15-20), long (25-35) sentences
Example:
  - Short: "The effect was significant."
  - Medium: "We observed a 23% increase across all conditions."
  - Long: "This finding aligns with previous work showing that..."
```

#### 2. Replace AI-Typical Words
```
Replace → With
- "delve into" → "examine", "explore", "investigate"
- "leverage" → "use", "apply", "employ"
- "utilize" → "use"
- "robust" → "strong", "reliable", "thorough"
- "facilitate" → "enable", "help", "allow"
- "furthermore" → "also", "next", [or remove]
- "moreover" → "additionally", "also", [or use dash]
- "comprehensive" → "complete", "thorough", "full"
```

#### 3. Add Natural Imperfections (Where Appropriate)
```
- Use contractions in appropriate contexts ("it's", "we'll")
- Include domain-specific jargon naturally
- Allow informal phrasing in methods/procedures
- Use occasional sentence fragments for emphasis
- Add personal observations or interpretations
- Include field-specific colloquialisms
```

#### 4. Break Paragraph Uniformity
```
Current: All paragraphs follow topic-support-support-support-conclusion
Suggestion: Vary based on content
  - Use single-sentence paragraphs for emphasis
  - Combine related ideas into longer paragraphs
  - Don't force every paragraph to have 5 sentences
  - Let content determine structure, not formula
```

#### 5. Remove Mechanical Transitions
```
❌ "Furthermore, the results show... Moreover, the analysis reveals..."
✅ "The results show... The analysis also reveals..." [simpler transitions]
✅ "The results show... Looking closer, the analysis..." [natural bridges]
```

## Examples

### Example 1: High Confidence Detection

**Input Text:**
```
Furthermore, this comprehensive study delves into the robust 
methodologies utilized to facilitate the implementation of innovative 
approaches. Moreover, the analysis demonstrates significant findings 
that leverage state-of-the-art techniques. Subsequently, the results 
indicate substantial improvements across all metrics. Nevertheless, 
additional research is crucial to fully comprehend the implications.
```

**AI-Check Report:**
```
Overall Confidence: 89% (HIGH - Likely AI-generated)

Issues Detected:
- 8 AI-typical words in 60 words (13.3 per 1000 words!)
- Every sentence starts with transition word
- Uniform sentence length (15-18 words each)
- Perfect grammar, zero natural imperfections
- Mechanical paragraph structure

AI Words Found:
- furthermore, comprehensive, delves, robust
- utilized, facilitate, innovative, leverage
- demonstrates, significant, subsequently, substantial
- nevertheless, crucial, comprehend

Recommendation: Complete rewrite recommended
```

**Suggested Revision:**
```
We examined the methods used in this approach. The analysis shows 
clear improvements across metrics. However, more research is needed 
to understand the full implications.

(23 words, 12% confidence - much more natural)
```

### Example 2: Medium Confidence Detection

**Input Text:**
```
The experimental design followed standard protocols established in 
previous work (Smith et al., 2023). We collected data from 150 
participants over six months. Statistical analysis used mixed-effects 
models to account for repeated measures. The results showed a 
significant main effect of condition (p < 0.001).
```

**AI-Check Report:**
```
Overall Confidence: 35% (MEDIUM - Possible minor AI assistance)

Issues Detected:
- Slightly uniform sentence length (11-15 words)
- One AI-typical word: "significant" (statistical context acceptable)
- Otherwise natural academic writing

Recommendation: Minor revisions optional, writing appears largely authentic
```

### Example 3: Low Confidence (Human Writing)

**Input Text:**
```
OK so here's what we found. The effect was huge - way bigger than 
expected. Participants in the experimental group scored 23% higher 
on average. This wasn't just statistically significant; it was 
practically meaningful.

We're still not sure why. Maybe it's the timing? Could be the 
instructions were clearer. Need to run follow-ups.
```

**AI-Check Report:**
```
Overall Confidence: 8% (LOW - Clearly human writing)

Human Writing Indicators:
- Natural sentence variation (4-19 words)
- Informal elements ("OK so", "way bigger")
- Incomplete thoughts and questions
- Natural uncertainty expressions
- Zero AI-typical words
- Authentic voice throughout

Recommendation: Writing is authentic, no changes needed
```

## Best Practices

   - Ensure authenticity before committee review
   - Track improvements over time

2. **Use During Drafting**
   - Check each section after writing
   - Apply suggestions immediately
   - Develop natural writing habits

3. **Pre-Submission Validation**
   - Run on complete manuscripts before journal submission
   - Check supplementary materials
   - Verify all documentation

### For Research Teams

1. **Establish Team Standards**
   - Set agreed-upon confidence thresholds
   - Define when to block vs. warn
   - Create team-specific word lists

2. **Code Review Integration**
   - Check documentation in pull requests
   - Validate README files and guides
   - Ensure authentic technical writing

3. **Track Team Writing**
   - Monitor trends across team members
   - Identify systematic issues
   - Share improvement strategies

### For Journal Submission

   - [ ] Overall confidence <30%
   - [ ] No flagged high-risk sections
   - [ ] AI-typical words <2 per 1000 words
   - [ ] Natural sentence variation present
   - [ ] Authentic academic voice throughout

2. **Demonstrating Authenticity**
   - Include AI-check reports in submission materials
   - Show writing evolution over time
   - Document revision process

## Limitations

### What This Skill Cannot Do

1. **Not 100% Accurate**
   - LLMs constantly improving
   - Patterns evolve over time
   - False positives possible (very formal human writing)
   - False negatives possible (heavily edited AI text)

2. **Cannot Detect All AI Usage**
   - Well-edited AI text may pass
   - Human writing in AI style may be flagged
   - Paraphrasing tools may evade detection
   - Future models may have different patterns

3. **Domain Limitations**
   - Trained primarily on academic writing
   - May not work well for creative writing
   - Technical jargon may affect scores
   - Non-English text not supported

### Use Alongside Human Judgment

**This skill is a tool, not a replacement for human judgment:**
- Use confidence scores as guidance, not absolute truth
- Consider context and field-specific norms
- Combine with plagiarism detection tools
- Maintain academic integrity standards
- Update word lists as AI patterns evolve

## Support

### Troubleshooting

**Problem:** False positive on authentic writing
**Solution:** Check if writing is overly formal. Consider field-specific norms. Adjust thresholds in config.

**Problem:** AI text passing with low confidence
**Solution:** Update AI-typical word lists. Check for heavily edited text. Report patterns for skill updates.

**Problem:** Pre-commit hook too slow
**Solution:** Reduce checked file types. Enable caching. Check only modified sections.

**Problem:** Disagreement with manual review
**Solution:** Generate detailed report. Review flagged sections specifically. Consider multiple metrics not just overall score.

### Getting Help
