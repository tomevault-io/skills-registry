# AI News Aggregator

This skill aggregates AI news from 7 authoritative sources and produces a comprehensive, deeply-analyzed report.
It uses a multi-agent workflow for parallel fetching, verification, sentiment analysis, and expert-informed reporting.

## Usage

```
/ai-news <days>
```

**Arguments:**
- `days` (optional, default: 7) - Number of days to look back from today

**Examples:**
- `/ai-news 3` - Get AI news from the past 3 days
- `/ai-news 7` - Get AI news from the past week
- `/ai-news` - Same as `/ai-news 7`

## Multi-Agent Workflow

Execute this workflow in order:

### Phase 1: Planning (Main Orchestrator)

1. Parse the `<days>` argument (default to 7 if not provided)
2. Calculate the date range: `[today - days, today]`
3. Prepare to spawn 7 parallel executor agents

### Phase 2: Parallel Execution

Spawn agents in parallel using Bash tool, each running one fetcher script:

```bash
# Run all 7 fetchers in parallel (from project root)
uv run python .claude/skills/ai-news/scripts/fetch_smol_news.py <days>
uv run python .claude/skills/ai-news/scripts/fetch_hf_papers.py <days>
uv run python .claude/skills/ai-news/scripts/fetch_hn_ai.py <days>
uv run python .claude/skills/ai-news/scripts/fetch_ai_news.py <days>
uv run python .claude/skills/ai-news/scripts/fetch_techcrunch.py <days>
uv run python .claude/skills/ai-news/scripts/fetch_the_batch.py <days>
uv run python .claude/skills/ai-news/scripts/fetch_reddit_ml.py <days> --min-score 20
```

**Key Outputs:**
- Each script returns JSON with items, metadata, and source info
- Reddit script includes `community_sentiment` with hot topics and engagement stats
- The Batch includes expert attribution

### Phase 3: Verification & Deduplication

After collecting results from all sources:

1. **Date Range Validation**: Confirm all items fall within `[start_date, end_date]`
2. **Deduplication**: Remove duplicate stories across sources
   - Match by URL or title similarity (>80% match)
   - Keep the version with most metadata
3. **Quality Filter**: Remove low-quality or off-topic items

### Phase 4: Deep Analysis & Sentiment Extraction

This is the **critical phase** for producing a valuable report. Perform these analyses:

#### 4.1 Theme Clustering
Group all items into major themes:
- **Research & Models**: New architectures, benchmarks, capabilities
- **Industry & Business**: Funding, acquisitions, enterprise adoption
- **Tools & Infrastructure**: Developer tools, APIs, frameworks
- **Policy & Safety**: Regulation, alignment, ethics
- **Applications**: Real-world deployments, use cases

#### 4.2 Trend Identification
For each major theme, analyze:
- What's the narrative arc? (emerging, maturing, declining)
- How many sources cover this topic?
- What's the engagement level (scores, comments)?

#### 4.3 Expert Sentiment Extraction
From **The Batch** (Andrew Ng) articles:
- Extract key opinions and predictions
- Note any warnings or concerns raised
- Identify recommended actions or takeaways

#### 4.4 Community Sentiment Analysis
From **Reddit** and **Hacker News**:
- What are the hot topics people are excited about?
- What criticisms or concerns are being raised?
- What's the overall mood (optimistic, skeptical, concerned)?
- Use the `community_sentiment` data from Reddit fetch

#### 4.5 Cross-Source Correlation
Identify stories that appear across multiple sources:
- Research paper on HuggingFace + discussed on Reddit
- Industry news on TechCrunch + expert analysis in The Batch
- These cross-source items are often the most significant

### Phase 5: Report Generation

Generate a **comprehensive, detailed report** with these sections:

```markdown
# AI News Report: [Start Date] to [End Date]

## Executive Summary
[3-4 paragraphs providing a narrative overview of the most important developments.
Start with the single biggest story, then cover 2-3 other major themes.

```

### Phase 5.1: Persist Report

After generating the report markdown, save it to disk:

```bash
cat <<'EOF' | uv run python .claude/skills/ai-news/scripts/write_report.py \
  --start-date YYYY-MM-DD \
  --end-date YYYY-MM-DD \
  --days N \
  --sources-ok source1,source2 \
  --sources-failed source3 \
  --total-items COUNT
<REPORT MARKDOWN HERE>
EOF
```

The script will:
- Write the report to `reports/ai-news_START_to_END_TIMESTAMP.md`
- Update `reports/manifest.jsonl`
- Copy to `reports/latest.md`
- Return JSON with filepath and metadata

Verify the JSON response includes `filepath` (and other expected fields) after the command runs.

**Important:** Always run this after displaying the report to the user.

### Phase 5.2: Render HTML

After saving the markdown, generate a self-contained HTML version alongside it:

```bash
uv run python .claude/skills/ai-news/scripts/render_html.py /path/to/report.md
```

The script writes `/path/to/report.html` (same basename) and prints the HTML filepath to stdout. Use the
`filepath` returned from Phase 5.1 as the input path.

### Phase 5.3: Upload to Cloudflare Archive (Optional)

If the `ADMIN_API_SECRET` environment variable is set, upload the HTML report to the Cloudflare archive:

```bash
ADMIN_API_SECRET=$ADMIN_API_SECRET uv run python .claude/skills/ai-news/scripts/upload_to_cloudflare.py \
  /path/to/report.html \
  --start-date YYYY-MM-DD \
  --end-date YYYY-MM-DD \
  --days N \
  --total-items COUNT
```

The script uploads the HTML to Cloudflare R2 and updates the KV index. The report will be immediately available at:
- Archive listing: https://julienh15.github.io/AI-News-Reports/archive/
- Direct link: https://ai-news-signup.julienh15.workers.dev/archive/{report_id}

**Note:** This step is optional and only runs if `ADMIN_API_SECRET` is available in the environment.

## Scripts Reference

All scripts are in `.claude/skills/ai-news/scripts/` directory:

| Script | Source | API/Method | Special Features |

- Report which sources succeeded/failed in the output
- Minimum viable report requires at least 2 sources

## Quality Guidelines

### Report Length
- Executive Summary: 300-500 words
- Each Trend Deep Dive: 400-600 words
- Total report: 2000-4000 words depending on activity level

### Analysis Depth
- Don't just list items - explain significance
- Connect dots across sources
- Provide actionable insights
- Include both optimistic and critical perspectives

### Linking
- Every claim should link to a source
- Use markdown hyperlinks consistently
- Include both discussion links and original sources
