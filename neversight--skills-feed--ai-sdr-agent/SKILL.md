# AI SDR Agent Setup

You are helping the user set up an AI SDR (Sales Development Representative) agent powered by HeyGen LiveAvatar technology. This creates a real-time video avatar that can have voice conversations with visitors about any website.

## Required Information (BOTH are required)

1. **LiveAvatar API Key** (REQUIRED) - Get your free API key from https://app.liveavatar.com/developers (sign in with your HeyGen account)
2. **Website URL** (REQUIRED) - The website the AI SDR should represent. This is NOT optional - you must get both pieces of information from the user before proceeding.

Parse any provided arguments: $ARGUMENTS

**IMPORTANT**: Do not proceed with setup until you have BOTH the API key AND the website URL from the user. Ask for both if not provided.

## Setup Steps

### Step 1: Check for existing project or clone it

```bash
# Check if we're already in the project
if [ -f "package.json" ] && grep -q "liveavatar" package.json 2>/dev/null; then
  echo "Already in LiveAvatar project"
else
  # Clone the repository
  git clone https://github.com/eNNNo/liveavatar-ai-sdr.git ai-sdr-agent
  cd ai-sdr-agent
fi
```

### Step 2: Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 3: Configure API key

Create `.env.local` with the user's API key:

```bash
cat > .env.local << 'EOF'
LIVEAVATAR_API_KEY=<USER_API_KEY>
EOF
```

Replace `<USER_API_KEY>` with the actual key provided by the user.

### Step 4: (Optional) Configure auto-start

If the user wants to skip the onboarding form, also add these to `.env.local`:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTO_START=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBSITE_URL=<WEBSITE_URL>
NEXT_PUBLIC_USER_NAME=Visitor
```

### Step 5: Start the application

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 6: Tell the user

- App is running at **http://localhost:3001**
- Open this URL in browser to create/talk to their AI SDR
- If auto-start is configured, it will immediately start the avatar session
- Session duration: 2 minutes per conversation
- They can create new sessions for different websites

## Error Messages

| Error | Meaning | Solution |
|-------|---------|----------|
| Invalid API key | The LiveAvatar API key is wrong | Check key at https://app.liveavatar.com/developers |
| Website unreachable | Can't fetch the URL | Verify URL is correct and publicly accessible |
| Avatar expired | Default avatar needs renewal | Select different avatar or renew HeyGen subscription |
| Context creation failed | API limit or server issue | Wait and retry, or check HeyGen account status |

## Example Interaction

**User**: "Create an AI SDR for shopify.com using API key abc123"

**You should**:
1. Clone/setup the project
2. Create `.env.local` with `LIVEAVATAR_API_KEY=abc123`
3. Run `npm install && npm run dev`
4. Tell user to open http://localhost:3001 and enter "shopify.com" in the form
