# AIReady Best Practices

Guidelines for writing code that AI coding assistants can understand and maintain effectively. Based on analysis of thousands of repositories and common AI model failure patterns.

## When to Apply

Reference these guidelines when:

- **Writing new features** - Apply patterns from the start
- **Reviewing pull requests** - Check for AI-unfriendly patterns
- **Refactoring code** - Improve AI comprehension
- **Debugging AI confusion** - Fix when assistants give wrong suggestions
- **Preparing for AI adoption** - Modernize codebase structure

## Rule Categories by Priority

| Priority | Category | Impact | Prefix |
|----------|----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Pattern Detection | CRITICAL | `patterns-` |
| 2 | Context Optimization | HIGH | `context-` |
| 3 | Consistency Checking | MEDIUM | `consistency-` |
| 4 | Documentation | MEDIUM | `docs-` |
| 5 | Dependencies | LOW | `deps-` |

## Quick Reference

### 1. Pattern Detection (CRITICAL)

- `patterns-semantic-duplicates` - Consolidate duplicate implementations
- `patterns-consistent-naming` - Use consistent names for similar concepts
- `patterns-interface-fragmentation` - Unify similar interfaces

### 2. Context Optimization (HIGH)

- `context-import-depth` - Keep import chains shallow (max 3 levels)
- `context-cohesion` - Group related functionality together
- `context-file-size` - Split oversized files

### 3. Consistency Checking (MEDIUM)

- `consistency-naming-conventions` - Follow project-wide naming patterns
- `consistency-error-handling` - Use consistent error patterns
- `consistency-api-design` - Maintain consistent API shapes

### 4. Documentation (MEDIUM)

- `docs-code-sync` - Keep docs in sync with code changes
- `docs-ai-context` - Document non-obvious AI context needs

### 5. Dependencies (LOW)

- `deps-circular` - Avoid circular dependencies
- `deps-freshness` - Keep dependencies up to date

## How to Use

Read individual rule files for detailed explanations and code examples:

```
rules/patterns-semantic-duplicates.md
rules/context-import-depth.md
rules/consistency-naming-conventions.md
```

Each rule file contains:

- Brief explanation of why it matters for AI
- Incorrect code example with explanation
- Correct code example with explanation
- Impact metrics and references

## Context Efficiency

This skill is designed for efficient context usage:

- **Lazy loading**: Only relevant rules are loaded when needed
- **Progressive disclosure**: Detailed examples are in separate files
- **Focused rules**: Each rule addresses one specific pattern
- **Measurable impact**: Clear metrics for each improvement

## Related Tools

These guidelines complement the AIReady CLI tools:

- **@aiready/pattern-detect** - Automated semantic duplicate detection
- **@aiready/context-analyzer** - Context window cost analysis
- **@aiready/consistency** - Naming convention checking
- **@aiready/cli** - Unified analysis tool
