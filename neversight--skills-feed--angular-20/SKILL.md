# Angular 20 Skill

## Rules

### Component Architecture

**MUST use standalone components:**
- All new components MUST be standalone
- Components MUST use `standalone: true` in decorator
- Components MUST explicitly import dependencies in `imports` array

**MUST NOT use NgModule-based components in new code:**
- NgModule declarations are forbidden for new components

### State Management

**MUST use Signals for local state:**
- Use `signal()` for component-level reactive state
- Use `computed()` for derived state
- Use `effect()` for side effects

**MUST use @ngrx/signals for global state:**
- Centralized application state MUST use @ngrx/signals
- MUST NOT use custom state management solutions

### Routing

**MUST use lazy-loaded routes for large modules:**
- Feature modules MUST be lazy loaded
- Use `loadChildren` or `loadComponent` for routing

**MUST implement prefetching strategies:**
- Configure preloading strategy for performance optimization

### HTTP & API

**MUST use HttpClient with typed responses:**
- All HTTP calls MUST specify response types
- API services MUST centralize HTTP logic
- Error handling MUST be implemented for all HTTP calls

### Testing

**MUST include unit tests:**
- Use Jasmine/Karma or Jest for unit testing
- Components MUST have corresponding spec files

**MUST include E2E tests for critical flows:**
- Use Playwright for E2E testing

### Performance

**MUST use AOT compilation for production:**
- Production builds MUST use `ng build` with AOT

**MUST use OnPush change detection where applicable:**
- Components with Signals SHOULD use `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush`

### Accessibility

**MUST enforce accessibility (a11y) guidelines:**
- Templates MUST follow WCAG standards
- Interactive elements MUST be keyboard accessible

### Build & Deployment

**MUST use Angular CLI for builds:**
- Use `ng build` to create production artifacts

**MUST configure environment-specific settings:**
- Separate configurations for development, staging, and production

## Context

### Purpose
This skill provides structured guidance and best practices for Angular 20 development, including typical workflows, common patterns, quality standards, and example templates.

### Angular 20 Core Concepts
- Angular 20 features & changes  
- TypeScript-first architecture  
- Standalone components  
- Signals and reactivity  
- Composition API  
- Angular CLI workflows

### When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Developing Angular 20 applications
- Setting up new Angular projects
- Implementing components, routing, state management
- Optimizing performance
- Writing tests
- Deploying Angular applications

### Key Tasks & Workflows

#### 1) Create a new Angular 20 app
Use Angular CLI to bootstrap projects:
```bash
ng new your-app --routing --style=scss
```

#### 2) Component & Template Patterns
- Use standalone components where possible
- Keep templates clean & concise
- Enforce accessibility (a11y) guidelines

#### 3) Routing & Navigation
- Setup RouterModule with routes
- Use lazy-loaded routes for large modules
- Implement prefetching strategies for performance

#### 4) State & Reactivity
- Prefer Signals for local state
- Consider @ngrx/signals for global state
- Manage effects/rx workflows carefully

#### 5) HTTP & REST
- Use HttpClient with typed responses
- Centralize API service layer with error handling

#### 6) Testing
- Unit test with Jasmine/Karma or Jest
- E2E tests with Playwright

#### 7) Performance
- Use AOT compilation
- Optimize bundle with `ng build`
- Use OnPush change detection where applicable

#### 8) Deployment
- Build artifacts: `ng build`
- Serve with static hosts / CDNs
- Configure environment-specific settings

## 📌 Examples & Code Snippets

### Example Standalone Component
```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-example',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [CommonModule],
  template: `
    @if (showContent()) {
      <div>Content here</div>
    }
  `
})
export class ExampleComponent {
  showContent = signal(true);
}
```

### Example Reactive Form
```typescript
import { Component, inject } from '@angular/core';
import { FormBuilder, ReactiveFormsModule, Validators } from '@angular/forms';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-form',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [ReactiveFormsModule],
  template: `
    <form [formGroup]="form">
      <input formControlName="name" />
    </form>
  `
})
export class FormComponent {
  private fb = inject(FormBuilder);
  
  form = this.fb.group({
    name: ['', Validators.required]
  });
}
```

### Example API Service
```typescript
import { Injectable, inject } from '@angular/core';
import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';

@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })
export class ApiService {
  private http = inject(HttpClient);
  
  getData(): Observable<any[]> {
    return this.http.get<any[]>('/api/data');
  }
}
```

Refer to official Angular docs and community standards for evolving best practices.
