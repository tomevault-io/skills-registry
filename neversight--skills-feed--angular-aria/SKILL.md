Angular Aria is a collection of headless, accessible directives that implement common WAI-ARIA patterns. The directives handle keyboard interactions, ARIA attributes, focus management, and screen reader support—you provide the HTML structure, CSS styling, and business logic.

Install via `npm install @angular/aria`.

## When to Apply

Use this skill when:

- Building **custom accessible UI components** that need WAI-ARIA compliance
- Implementing **keyboard navigation** patterns (arrow keys, Enter, Escape, Tab)
- Adding **focus management** to interactive widgets
- Creating **headless/unstyled** UI primitives with custom styling
- Building **autocomplete**, **combobox**, **listbox**, **select**, or **multiselect** inputs
- Implementing **menus**, **menubars**, or **toolbars** with proper ARIA roles
- Creating **accordion**, **tabs**, **tree**, or **grid** patterns
- Needing **screen reader support** for custom components

Do NOT use this skill when:

- Using Angular Material components (they have built-in accessibility)
- Building simple forms with native HTML elements
- The WAI-ARIA pattern you need is not covered by Angular Aria
