# Apple Music Skill

## Overview
Enables Claude to interact with Apple Music for streaming, library management, playlist curation, and music discovery through the web interface.

## Quick Install

```bash
curl -sSL https://canifi.com/skills/apple-music/install.sh | bash
```

Or manually:
```bash
cp -r skills/apple-music ~/.canifi/skills/
```

## Setup

Configure via [canifi-env](https://canifi.com/setup/scripts):

```bash
# First, ensure canifi-env is installed:
# curl -sSL https://canifi.com/install.sh | bash

canifi-env set APPLE_ID_EMAIL "your-email@example.com"
```

## Privacy & Authentication

**Your credentials, your choice.** Canifi LifeOS respects your privacy.

### Option 1: Manual Browser Login (Recommended)
If you prefer not to share credentials with Claude Code:
1. Complete the [Browser Automation Setup](/setup/automation) using CDP mode
2. Login to the service manually in the Playwright-controlled Chrome window
3. Claude will use your authenticated session without ever seeing your password

### Option 2: Environment Variables
If you're comfortable sharing credentials, you can store them locally:
```bash
canifi-env set SERVICE_EMAIL "your-email"
canifi-env set SERVICE_PASSWORD "your-password"
```

**Note**: Credentials stored in canifi-env are only accessible locally on your machine and are never transmitted.

## Authentication Flow
1. Navigate to music.apple.com via Playwright MCP
2. Click "Sign In" button

4. Handle 2FA via trusted device or iMessage
5. Maintain session for subsequent requests

## Error Handling

- Rate Limited: Implement exponential backoff
- 2FA Required: Wait for code via iMessage or trusted device
- Playback Error: Check subscription status and device availability

## Self-Improvement Instructions

1. Document the change with context
2. Update element selectors accordingly
3. Track successful operations for pattern learning
4. Suggest workflow optimizations

## Notes
- Requires active Apple Music subscription
- Web player has some limitations vs native apps
- 2FA is typically required for Apple ID
- Library sync may take a few moments
