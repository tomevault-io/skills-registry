## Triggers

- "submit for approval"
- "route for approval"
- "approval workflow"
- "get sign-off"
- "approval status"
- "who needs to approve"

## Purpose

This skill manages the complete approval lifecycle for marketing assets by:
- Defining approval chains based on asset type and value
- Routing assets to appropriate approvers
- Tracking approval status in real-time
- Managing escalations and deadlines
- Recording approval history for audit

## Behavior

When triggered, this skill:

1. **Determines approval requirements**:
   - Identify asset type and category
   - Calculate approval tier (budget, risk, visibility)
   - Load approval chain configuration

2. **Initializes approval request**:
   - Create approval record
   - Attach asset and supporting materials
   - Set deadlines based on priority

3. **Routes to approvers**:
   - Notify approvers in sequence or parallel
   - Provide context and review materials
   - Track response status

4. **Manages workflow**:
   - Process approvals/rejections
   - Handle revision requests
   - Escalate overdue items
   - Route to next approver

5. **Records decisions**:
   - Document approval/rejection rationale
   - Maintain audit trail
   - Archive final approved version
