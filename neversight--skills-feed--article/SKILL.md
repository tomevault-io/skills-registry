export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key

# Or Gemini as alternative
pip install google-generativeai
export GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

## Article Operations

### Generate Article

- Transitions between sections"
```

## Article Types

### Tutorial

SOLUTIONS: [how you solved them]

Format as engineering blog post with:
- Problem statement
- Architecture decisions
- Implementation details
- Lessons learned
- Results/metrics"
```

## Content Enhancement

### Verify Technical Accuracy

```bash
ARTICLE=$(cat draft.md)
gemini -m pro -o text -e "" "Review this technical article for accuracy:

$ARTICLE

Check:
1. Code examples work correctly
2. Technical claims are accurate
3. Best practices are current
4. No outdated information
5. Security considerations

Flag any issues with corrections."
```

### Improve Readability

```bash
ARTICLE=$(cat draft.md)
gemini -m pro -o text -e "" "Improve the readability of this article:

$ARTICLE

Focus on:
- Clearer sentences
- Better transitions
- Active voice
- Removing jargon
- Adding helpful examples"
```

### Add Code Examples

```bash
ARTICLE=$(cat draft.md)
gemini -m pro -o text -e "" "Add practical code examples to this article:

$ARTICLE

For each concept:
- Add working code snippet
- Include comments
- Show expected output
- Provide variations where helpful"
```

### Generate Revision

```bash
ARTICLE=$(cat draft.md)
FEEDBACK="[feedback from reviewers]"

gemini -m pro -o text -e "" "Revise this article based on feedback:

CURRENT:
$ARTICLE

FEEDBACK:
$FEEDBACK

Incorporate the feedback while maintaining the article's voice and structure."
```

```code
[Full working example]
```

## Next Steps

[Where to go from here]
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start with the reader** - What problem do they have?
2. **Show, don't tell** - Use code examples
3. **One idea per section** - Keep it focused
4. **Use concrete examples** - Abstract concepts need grounding
5. **Include working code** - Test everything
6. **End with action** - Tell readers what to do next
7. **Get feedback** - Have someone else read it
8. **Revise ruthlessly** - First drafts are just the start
