# Ask User Question

## Overview

This skill enables structured, interactive questioning to gather user input during task execution. It provides a framework for presenting clear questions with predefined options, supporting both single and multiple selection modes.

## When to Use

Invoke this skill when:
- Gathering user preferences or requirements
- Clarifying ambiguous instructions
- Making decisions on implementation choices
- Offering directional choices to the user
- Needing structured input rather than free-form responses

## Question Structure

Each question interaction consists of:

1. **Question**: Clear, specific text ending with a question mark
2. **Header**: Short label (max 12 characters) displayed as a chip/tag
3. **Options**: 2-4 distinct choices, each with label and description
4. **Multi-select flag**: Whether multiple answers are allowed

### Option Components

Each option requires:
- **Label**: Concise display text (1-5 words)
- **Description**: Explanation of what this option means or its implications

## Formatting Guidelines

### Question Text
- Keep questions specific and actionable
- End with a question mark
- If multi-select is enabled, phrase accordingly (e.g., "Which features do you want to enable?")

### Header
- Maximum 12 characters
- Use as category indicator
- Examples: "Auth method", "Library", "Approach", "Feature"

### Option Labels
- Keep concise: 1-5 words
- Make mutually exclusive (unless multi-select)
- Place recommended option first with "(Recommended)" suffix

### Option Descriptions
- Explain implications and trade-offs
- Provide context for informed decisions
- Keep focused and relevant

## Question Templates

### Binary Choice Template
```
Header: "Confirm"
Question: "Do you want to proceed with [action]?"
Options:
  - Label: "Yes, proceed"
    Description: "Continue with the proposed action"
  - Label: "No, cancel"
    Description: "Stop and reconsider alternatives"
```

### Implementation Choice Template
```
Header: "Approach"
Question: "Which implementation approach should be used for [feature]?"
Options:
  - Label: "[Option A] (Recommended)"
    Description: "[Benefits and trade-offs of option A]"
  - Label: "[Option B]"
    Description: "[Benefits and trade-offs of option B]"
  - Label: "[Option C]"
    Description: "[Benefits and trade-offs of option C]"
```

### Feature Selection Template (Multi-select)
```
Header: "Features"
Question: "Which features do you want to enable?"
Options:
  - Label: "[Feature 1]"
    Description: "[What this feature provides]"
  - Label: "[Feature 2]"
    Description: "[What this feature provides]"
  - Label: "[Feature 3]"
    Description: "[What this feature provides]"
MultiSelect: true
```

### Library/Tool Selection Template
```
Header: "Library"
Question: "Which library should be used for [purpose]?"
Options:
  - Label: "[Library A] (Recommended)"
    Description: "[Key characteristics, community support, maintenance status]"
  - Label: "[Library B]"
    Description: "[Key characteristics, use cases, limitations]"
```

## Multiple Questions

When gathering related information, batch up to 4 questions in a single interaction. Each question follows the same structure independently.

### Batching Guidelines
- Group logically related questions
- Maintain independent options per question
- Limit to 4 questions maximum per interaction
- Order questions by dependency (independent first)

## Response Handling

Users can always provide custom input via "Other" option. Design questions to:
- Cover the most common/likely choices
- Allow for unexpected user preferences
- Not force users into predefined boxes

## Best Practices

### Do
- Provide clear context in descriptions
- Order options with recommended first
- Use consistent terminology
- Keep option count manageable (2-4)
- Make each option distinct

### Avoid
- Vague or open-ended questions
- Overlapping options
- Technical jargon without explanation
- Questions answerable through code inspection
- Asking permission to proceed (use ExitPlanMode for plan approval)

## Integration with Plan Mode

When in plan mode:
- Use this skill to clarify requirements BEFORE finalizing plans
- Do NOT use to ask "Is my plan ready?" (use ExitPlanMode instead)
- Focus on gathering information needed for planning decisions

## Examples

### Example 1: Authentication Method Selection
```
Header: "Auth method"
Question: "Which authentication method should we implement?"
Options:
  - Label: "JWT tokens (Recommended)"
    Description: "Stateless authentication with token-based sessions, good for APIs"
  - Label: "Session cookies"
    Description: "Traditional server-side sessions, simpler but requires session storage"
  - Label: "OAuth 2.0"
    Description: "Delegate authentication to external providers (Google, GitHub, etc.)"
```

### Example 2: Database Selection
```
Header: "Database"
Question: "Which database should be used for this project?"
Options:
  - Label: "PostgreSQL (Recommended)"
    Description: "Robust relational database with excellent JSON support"
  - Label: "SQLite"
    Description: "Lightweight, file-based database suitable for smaller applications"
  - Label: "MongoDB"
    Description: "Document-oriented NoSQL database for flexible schemas"
```

### Example 3: Multi-select Features
```
Header: "Features"
Question: "Which optional features should be included?"
Options:
  - Label: "Dark mode"
    Description: "Add theme switching capability with dark color scheme"
  - Label: "Internationalization"
    Description: "Support for multiple languages using i18n framework"
  - Label: "Analytics"
    Description: "Track user behavior and usage patterns"
  - Label: "PWA support"
    Description: "Enable offline functionality and app installation"
MultiSelect: true
```

## Output Format

When using this skill, structure the question presentation as:

```
**[Header]**: [Question]

Options:
1. **[Label]**: [Description]
2. **[Label]**: [Description]
...

[If multi-select: "Select all that apply"]
```

Wait for user response before proceeding with the selected approach.
