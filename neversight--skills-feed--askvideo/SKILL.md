# AskVideo - Chat with YouTube Videos

Get information, summaries, and answers from any YouTube video using AI.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- User shares a YouTube URL and asks questions about it
- User wants to summarize a YouTube video
- User asks "what's in this video?"
- User wants to extract information from video content
- User needs to understand a tutorial, lecture, or presentation
- User asks about timestamps or specific topics in a video

**Keywords:** YouTube, video summary, video transcript, explain video, what's in this video, video content, video tutorial

## Prerequisites

The `askvideo` CLI must be installed and authenticated:

```bash
# Check if installed
which askvideo

# If not installed
npm install -g askvideo

# Authenticate (first time only - requires user's email)
askvideo login
```

## Commands

### Ask a Single Question (Recommended for Agents)

Use `--simple` flag for clean, non-streaming output:

```bash
askvideo ask "<question>" --url "<youtube-url>" --simple
```

**Examples:**
```bash
# Get a summary
askvideo ask "Summarize this video in 3 bullet points" --url "https://youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID" --simple

# Ask specific questions
askvideo ask "What are the main topics covered?" --url "https://youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID" --simple

# Extract information
askvideo ask "List all the tools mentioned in this video" --url "https://youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID" --simple

# Get timestamps
askvideo ask "At what timestamp do they discuss pricing?" --url "https://youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID" --simple
```

### Ask About an Already-Indexed Video

If the video was previously processed, use the video ID for faster responses:

```bash
askvideo ask "<question>" --id <video-id> --simple
```

### List User's Indexed Videos

```bash
askvideo videos
```

### Check Credits

```bash
askvideo credits
```

## Workflow for Agents

1. **When user shares a YouTube URL with a question:**
   ```bash
   askvideo ask "<user's question>" --url "<url>" --simple
   ```

2. **For multiple questions about the same video:**
   - First query will index the video (takes 30-60 seconds)
   - Subsequent queries are instant
   - Use `--id` flag if you have the video ID

3. **If credits are exhausted:**
   - Run `askvideo credits` to check remaining credits
   - Inform user they need to upgrade at https://askvideo.ai/pricing

## Response Format

The CLI returns plain text answers. Present them to the user in a clear format:

```
Based on the video:

[AI response from askvideo]
```

## Error Handling

| Error | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Authentication required" | Run `askvideo login` |
| "No video credits remaining" | User needs to upgrade plan |
| "No message credits remaining" | User needs to upgrade plan |
| "Failed to fetch transcript" | Video may not have captions |

## Supported Video Types

- Standard YouTube videos with captions/transcripts
- YouTube Shorts
- Unlisted videos (if URL is provided)

## Limitations

- Requires video to have a transcript (auto-generated or manual captions)
- Free plan: 1 video + 10 messages per month
- Video processing takes 30-60 seconds on first query

## Examples for Common Tasks

### Summarize a Video
```bash
askvideo ask "Give me a comprehensive summary of this video with key takeaways" --url "URL" --simple
```

### Explain a Tutorial
```bash
askvideo ask "Explain the step-by-step process shown in this tutorial" --url "URL" --simple
```

### Extract Code/Commands
```bash
askvideo ask "List all the code snippets or commands mentioned in this video" --url "URL" --simple
```

### Find Specific Information
```bash
askvideo ask "What does the speaker say about [topic]?" --url "URL" --simple
```

### Get Video Outline
```bash
askvideo ask "Create an outline of all topics covered with timestamps if mentioned" --url "URL" --simple
```
