description: Use for installing, upgrading, authenticating, and using Atlassian Command Line Interface (ACLI, `acli`) for Atlassian Cloud. Triggers include Jira CLI tasks (work items, projects, boards, sprints), Atlassian Admin CLI tasks (user/org admin via API key), Rovo Dev CLI usage, enabling shell completion, scripting/CI usage, and troubleshooting `acli` errors or trace IDs. Use when this capability is needed.

# Atlassian CLI (acli)

Use `acli` to automate and operate Atlassian Cloud workflows from the terminal (Jira, Admin, and Rovo Dev).

## Workflow

1. Install or upgrade `acli` (pick the OS-specific path).
2. Authenticate (pick token vs OAuth vs admin API key).
3. Discover the exact command/flags via `acli help ...` and `--help`.
4. Prefer machine-readable output (`--json`) for automation; parse with `jq`.
5. Handle bulk operations with `--ignore-errors` where appropriate; capture trace IDs on unexpected errors.

## Decision Tree

### Install / Upgrade

```
Which OS?
  macOS:
    - Preferred: Homebrew
    - Fallback: download binary + put on PATH
  Linux:
    - Preferred: apt (Debian/Ubuntu) or yum (RHEL/CentOS)
    - Fallback: download binary to /usr/local/bin or ~/.local/bin
  Windows:
    - Download acli.exe via PowerShell (Invoke-WebRequest)
Upgrade:
  - Homebrew: brew upgrade acli
  - apt/yum: upgrade package
  - binary installs: re-download and replace
```

Read `references/install.md` for exact commands.

### Authenticate

```
What are you trying to access?
  Jira Cloud:
    - API token (non-interactive, CI-friendly)
    - OAuth (interactive): acli jira auth login --web
  Atlassian Admin (org admin):
    - API key (admin commands)
  Rovo Dev:
    - API token login, then: acli rovodev run
```

Read `references/auth.md` for exact login commands.

## Secrets Handling (Do This By Default)

- Avoid putting tokens/keys directly in the command line.
- Prefer stdin from a secret store/CI secret variable.
- Never print tokens/keys into logs, diffs, or chat transcripts.

## Command Discovery Pattern

- Show top-level help: `acli --help`
- Show product help: `acli jira --help`, `acli admin --help`, `acli rovodev --help`
- Show deep help: `acli jira workitem create --help`
- Use `acli help [path]` when unsure where a command lives.

## Automation Patterns

- Chain commands with `&&` when later steps must only run on success.
- Redirect tabular output (`--csv`) to files.
- Use `--json | jq ...` to extract specific fields.

Read `references/automation.md`.

## Shell Completion

Enable completion for bash/zsh/fish/powershell.

Read `references/shell-completion.md`.

## Troubleshooting

- Capture trace IDs from unexpected errors for support tickets.
- Use `--ignore-errors` for bulk operations where partial success is acceptable.
- Use `--generate-input-json` / `--generate-json` on commands that support JSON-driven workflows.

Read `references/troubleshooting.md`.
