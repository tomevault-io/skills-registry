## Core Philosophy: Audio as Skill Atom Feedback

From Daniel Cook's Skill Atom framework, audio serves as **immediate feedback** that creates insight:

```
Action → Simulation → Feedback (AUDIO) → Insight
```

**Key Principles:**

1. **Proportional Feedback**: Sound intensity matches action significance
2. **Melodic Hierarchy**: Sounds build from simple to complex as achievements grow
3. **Error as Invitation**: Failure sounds should redirect, not punish
4. **Fantasy Cohesion**: All sounds share a unified palette creating consistent world
5. **No Cognitive Overload**: Sounds inform, never overwhelm

## Rule 1: Volume Hierarchy by Sound Type

Different sounds serve different psychological purposes and need balanced volumes.

| Sound Category | Volume | Frequency | Psychology |
|----------------|--------|-----------|------------|
| Micro-feedback (hover, type) | 0.2–0.3 | Very high | Subtle confirmation, shouldn't fatigue |
| UI interaction (click, toggle) | 0.25–0.35 | High | Tactile feedback, responsive feel |
| Success/feedback | 0.3–0.5 | Moderate | Clear outcome signal |
| Warning/attention | 0.4–0.5 | Low | Noticeable but not alarming |
| Phase completion | 0.5–0.6 | Low | Meaningful milestone |
| Major achievement | 0.6–0.8 | Rare | Celebration, memorable |
| Background music | 0.15–0.25 | Continuous | Atmosphere, never dominate |

**Why:** Balanced audio creates professional feel. Loud frequent sounds cause fatigue; quiet celebrations feel anticlimactic.

---

## Rule 2: Frequency Band Management (Anti-Masking)

Sounds must occupy distinct frequency bands to remain readable when played together.

### Frequency Allocation

| Sound Type | Primary Band | HPF | Notes |
|------------|--------------|-----|-------|
| Sub-bass (rumble, impact) | 30–80 Hz | None | Use sparingly, causes mud |
| Bass (weight, power) | 80–200 Hz | 80 Hz | Rock, thuds, explosions |
| Low-mid (body, warmth) | 200–500 Hz | 150–200 Hz | Most sounds need HPF here |
| Mid (clarity, presence) | 500 Hz–2 kHz | — | Core content for most sounds |
| Upper-mid (detail, attack) | 2–4 kHz | — | Transients, consonants |
| Presence (brilliance) | 4–8 kHz | — | Air, shimmer |
| High (sparkle, air) | 8–16 kHz | — | Gentle, avoid harshness |

### HPF (High-Pass Filter) Guidelines

```
HPF 100–150 Hz  → Heavy impacts, bass elements
HPF 150–200 Hz  → Standard UI, most game sounds
HPF 200–250 Hz  → Light, airy sounds (sparkles, chimes)
HPF 250+ Hz     → Ethereal, floating sounds
```

**Why:** Low frequencies mask each other and cause "mud." HPF keeps sounds clean and distinct.

## Rule 3: Duration by Function

Sound length must match its psychological purpose.

| Function | Duration | Rationale |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| Micro-feedback (keystroke) | 50–120 ms | Instant, doesn't interrupt |
| UI click/tap | 100–180 ms | Responsive, crisp |
| Success feedback | 200–400 ms | Satisfying but brief |
| Warning/alert | 250–500 ms | Attention-getting |
| Phase celebration | 400–800 ms | Meaningful pause |
| Major achievement | 600–1200 ms | Memorable moment |
| Ambient loop | Seamless | Background atmosphere |

### Tail Management

**Critical:** Keep tails tight to prevent audio pile-up.

```
Decay 100–250 ms  → Snappy, rapid-fire safe
Decay 250–400 ms  → Standard feedback
Decay 400–600 ms  → Celebrations, important moments
Decay 600+ ms     → Only for rare, significant events
```

---

## Rule 4: Kind Games Audio Philosophy

From Daniel Cook's Kind Games framework, audio should support prosocial design:

### Audio for Psychological Safety

| Goal | Sound Design | Anti-Pattern |
|------|--------------|--------------|
| **Error as invitation** | Gentle questioning tone, descending then rising | Harsh buzzer, punishment |
| **Encouragement** | Warm, supportive tones | Mocking or condescending |
| **Progress celebration** | Proportional joy | Over-the-top for minor achievements |
| **Failure feedback** | Curious, "try again" feel | Shame-inducing |

### Error Sound Design

```
✅ Good: "Gentle descending three-note woodwind phrase, curious not sad"
✅ Good: "Soft 'hmm' with upward questioning inflection at end"

❌ Bad: "Harsh buzzer sound"
❌ Bad: "Sad trombone descending"
❌ Bad: "Game show failure sound"
```

### Success Sound Hierarchy

Build a melodic progression that players learn to anticipate:

```
Micro:     Single tone (sparkle, chime)
Small:     Two-note ascending (success)
Medium:    Three-note phrase (phase complete)
Major:     Full flourish with resolution (achievement)
Epic:      Orchestral swell with choir (milestone)
```

## Rule 5: AI Audio Prompt Engineering (ElevenLabs)

When generating sounds via AI, use these prompt patterns for high clarity, low masking, non-musical UI readability.

### Prompt Structure

```
[Sound description] + [Technical specs] + [Anti-patterns]
```

### Technical Spec Template

```
"{description}, {frequency info} ({X}–{Y} kHz), HPF {Z} Hz,
{duration} ms, {decay/tail info}, no {anti-patterns}"
```

### Frequency Descriptors

| Term | Frequency Range | Use For |
|------|-----------------|---------|
| "bright transient" | 2–4 kHz | Attacks, clicks, impacts |
| "airy sheen/shimmer" | 8–12 kHz | Magic, sparkles, ethereal |
| "low-mid body" | 200–500 Hz | Warmth, weight |
| "mid presence" | 1–2 kHz | Clarity, readability |
| "sub rumble" | 30–80 Hz | Impact, power (use sparingly) |

### Essential Anti-Patterns to Include

Always specify what to **avoid** in prompts:

```
"no melody"         → Prevents musical interference with game music
"no pad/drone"      → Prevents sustained tones that cause masking
"no reverb wash"    → Keeps sound tight and readable
"no low-end buildup" → Prevents mud in mix
"no harsh highs"    → Prevents ear fatigue
"no musical tone"   → Keeps UI sounds non-distracting
"non-musical"       → Reinforces UI intent
```

## Rule 6: Sound Category Templates

### UI Micro-Feedback

```
"Soft {material} {action}, {duration} ms, bright transient (2–4 kHz),
HPF {180–220} Hz, short decay {80–150} ms, no musical tone, no reverb."

Examples:
- "Soft wooden tok with subtle shimmer tail, 120 ms, bright 2–4 kHz, HPF 200 Hz"
- "Gentle paper rustle with airy top, 100 ms, HPF 180 Hz, no reverb"
```

### Success/Completion

```
"Warm {instrument} {motion} with {quality} {overtone}, {duration} ms,
{frequency detail}, HPF {X} Hz, {decay} decay, non-melodic."

Examples:
- "Warm ascending harp glissando with gentle bell overtone, 350 ms"
- "Bright crystalline chime with soft shimmer tail, 300 ms, 8–12 kHz"
```

### Error/Invalid

```
"Gentle {instrument} {motion}, {quality} not {negative}, {duration} ms,
HPF {X} Hz, reads as '{intention}'."

Examples:
- "Gentle descending three-note woodwind phrase, curious not sad, 400 ms"
- "Soft questioning hum with upward inflection, 300 ms, HPF 200 Hz"
```

### Achievement/Celebration

```
"{Scale} {instrument} {action} with {detail}, {duration} ms,
{frequency}, {space} {wet%}, non-melodic."

Examples:
- "Full magical fanfare with shimmering strings, 800 ms, short room 0.3s 15% wet"
- "Grand orchestral flourish with bells and rising resolution, 1000 ms"
```

### Impact/Action

```
"{Weight} {material} {action} + {secondary}, {duration} ms,
HPF {X} Hz, {decay}, no boom, no long tail."

Examples:
- "Heavy stone thud with brief debris ticks, 400 ms, HPF 150 Hz, dry"
- "Shield deflect: tight metallic ting with micro scrape, 150 ms"
```

## Rule 7: Fantasy Theme Palette

For cohesive fantasy audio, maintain consistent instrument families:

### Magical/Ethereal
- Chimes (crystalline, bell-like)
- Harps (warm, flowing)
- Wind instruments (airy, breathy)
- Sparkle textures (high shimmer)

### Earthen/Natural
- Wood (soft toks, knocks)
- Stone (thuds, scrapes)
- Organic (sprouts, rustles)
- Water (drips, flows)

### Metal/Martial
- Sword (slices, clangs)
- Shield (deflects, impacts)
- Armor (clinks, rattles)
- Mechanical (clicks, locks)

### Mystical/Divine
- Choir textures (soft "ahh")
- Bells (resonant, pure)
- Shimmer (ascending)
- Glow sounds (warm hum)

---

## Rule 8: Multi-Instance Handling

When sounds may trigger simultaneously (40+ players casting), apply these modifiers:

### Layered Event Prompt Modifier

```
"40 layered one-shots, onset jitter 10–40 ms, pitch variance ±2–4 semitones,
wide stereo distribution, HPF consistent, subtle short room 0.2–0.3 s at 8–12% wet,
avoid masking and low-end buildup, preserve transient clarity."
```

### Key Techniques

| Technique | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Onset jitter (10–40 ms) | Prevents phase cancellation |
| Pitch variance (±2–4 semi) | Creates natural variation |
| Stereo distribution | Spatial separation |
| Short room (0.2–0.3s, 8–12%) | Cohesion without wash |
| Consistent HPF | Prevents mud accumulation |

---

## Rule 9: Accessibility Considerations

### Reduced Audio for Motion Sensitivity

Some users prefer reduced audio stimulation with reduced motion:

```javascript
// Audio should respect prefers-reduced-motion
const reduceAudio = window.matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)').matches;

if (reduceAudio) {
  // Use simpler, shorter sounds
  // Reduce celebration intensity
  // Skip non-essential feedback sounds
}
```

### Non-Audio Alternatives

Every sound should have a visual equivalent:
- Micro-feedback → Visual pulse/glow
- Success → Color flash + checkmark
- Error → Shake animation + icon
- Achievement → Badge animation

---

## Rule 10: Testing Checklist

Before finalizing sounds:

- [ ] **Volume balance**: All sounds sit correctly in hierarchy
- [ ] **Frequency separation**: No masking when sounds overlap
- [ ] **Duration appropriate**: Matches function and pacing
- [ ] **HPF applied**: No unwanted low-end
- [ ] **Tail tight**: No lingering that causes pile-up
- [ ] **Non-musical**: Doesn't interfere with game music
- [ ] **Error inviting**: Failure sounds encourage retry
- [ ] **Celebration proportional**: Matches achievement significance
- [ ] **Accessible**: Works with reduced audio preference
- [ ] **40-cast safe**: Still readable when many play together

## Example: Fantasy Phonics Sound Design

### Complete Sound Specification

| Sound | Prompt | Vol | Duration |
|-------|--------|-----|----------|
| `sparkle` | "Soft twinkling chime like fairy dust falling, brief delicate whispered magic, 2–4 kHz transient + 8–12 kHz shimmer, HPF 220 Hz, 100 ms, no musical tone" | 0.25 | 100 ms |
| `success` | "Warm ascending harp glissando with gentle bell overtone, spell completing successfully, 2–6 kHz, HPF 200 Hz, 350 ms decay, non-melodic" | 0.4 | 350 ms |
| `phaseComplete` | "Crystalline chime cascade with soft orchestral swell, treasure chest unlock feel, triumphant but intimate, 4–12 kHz, HPF 200 Hz, 600 ms, short room 0.2s 10% wet" | 0.6 | 600 ms |
| `wordComplete` | "Full magical fanfare with shimmering strings and choir ahh, spell book illuminating, genuine mastery, 1–12 kHz, HPF 150 Hz, 800 ms, room 0.3s 15% wet" | 0.7 | 800 ms |
| `milestone` | "Grand orchestral flourish with bells rising to majestic resolution, wizard rank-up energy, proudest moment, full spectrum, HPF 100 Hz, 1200 ms, room 0.4s 20% wet" | 0.75 | 1200 ms |
| `click` | "Soft wooden tok with subtle magical shimmer tail, tapping wizard staff, tactile responsive, 2–8 kHz, HPF 200 Hz, 120 ms, no reverb" | 0.25 | 120 ms |
| `error` | "Gentle descending three-note woodwind phrase, curious not sad, sounds like 'hmm try again', invitation to explore, 500 Hz–4 kHz, HPF 180 Hz, 400 ms, no harsh" | 0.35 | 400 ms |

### Design Rationale

- **Melodic hierarchy**: sparkle (single) → success (ascending) → milestone (full flourish)
- **Fantasy cohesion**: Chimes, harps, bells, woodwinds — storybook palette
- **Error as invitation**: Questioning woodwind, not punishing buzzer
- **Proportional celebration**: 100 ms micro vs 1200 ms milestone
