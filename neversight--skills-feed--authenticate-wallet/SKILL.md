# Wallet Authentication

Manage the authentication session for the `fibx` CLI. Supports two methods: email OTP (via Privy server wallets) and private key import (local wallet).

## Prerequisites

- No active session required — this skill creates one

## Rules

1. For email login, NEVER ask the user for a private key.
2. For private key import, ALWAYS warn the user first: _"Your private key will be stored locally in an encrypted session file. Shall I proceed?"_
3. You MUST complete `auth login` before `auth verify`. They are sequential steps.
4. After successful `auth verify` or `auth import`, ALWAYS run `npx fibx@latest status` to confirm the session is active.
5. NEVER store or log private keys, OTP codes, or session tokens in conversation history.

## Commands

### Email OTP Login (2-step)

```bash
# Step 1: Send OTP to email
npx fibx@latest auth login <email>

# Step 2: Verify OTP code
npx fibx@latest auth verify <email> <code>
```

### Private Key Import

```bash
npx fibx@latest auth import
```

> **INTERACTIVE COMMAND**: This opens a prompt for the user to paste their private key. The agent CANNOT pass the key as a CLI argument. Instruct the user to enter it in the terminal prompt, or run it via the agent's terminal tool and let the user type the key.

### Session Management

```bash
# Check current session status
npx fibx@latest status

# End session
npx fibx@latest auth logout
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type   | Description                          | Required          |
| --------- | ------ | ------------------------------------ | ----------------- |
| `email`   | string | User's email address                 | Yes (email OTP)   |
| `code`    | string | One-time password received via email | Yes (verify step) |

## Examples

**User:** "Log me in with user@example.com"

```bash
npx fibx@latest auth login user@example.com
# Wait for user to provide the OTP code (e.g. "123456")
npx fibx@latest auth verify user@example.com 123456
npx fibx@latest status
```

**User:** "Import my private key"

```bash
# Warn user first, then:
npx fibx@latest auth import
npx fibx@latest status
```

**User:** "Log me out"

```bash
npx fibx@latest auth logout
```

## Error Handling

| Error               | Action                                                |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `Invalid code`      | Ask the user to check their email and retry `verify`. |
| `Rate limit`        | Wait 60 seconds before retrying.                      |
| `Session expired`   | Restart from `auth login`.                            |
| `Not authenticated` | Run the full login flow before other skills.          |
