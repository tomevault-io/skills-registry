name: automation-brainstorm
description: Interactive workflow design advisor for Power Automate, n8n, Make, Zapier and other platforms. Guides users through planning automation workflows with smart questions about triggers, actions, data flow, and error handling. Uses research sub-agent to find best practices and generates detailed implementation plan. Triggers when user mentions "create workflow", "build flow", "design automation", "need ideas for", or describes workflow requirements without having a complete design. Use when this capability is needed.

# Automation Brainstorm

Interactive workflow design advisor that helps plan and architect automation workflows through guided conversations.

## Supported Platforms

- **Power Automate** (Microsoft)
- **n8n** (Open-source)
- **Make** (formerly Integromat)
- **Zapier**
- **Other JSON-based workflow platforms**

## Purpose

This skill provides expert guidance for planning automation workflows by:
1. Understanding user requirements through interactive questions
2. Recommending triggers, actions, and data flow patterns
3. Researching platform-specific best practices
4. Identifying potential issues early
5. Generating detailed implementation plan for automation-build-flow

## When This Skill Activates

Automatically activates when user:
- Mentions creating/building a new workflow: "I want to create a flow that..."
- Asks for ideas/advice: "What's the best way to automate..."
- Describes requirements without complete design: "I need to sync data between..."
- Requests planning help: "Help me design a workflow for..."
- Keywords: "create flow", "build automation", "design workflow", "need ideas"

**Does NOT activate when**:
- User has complete plan and wants to build (use automation-build-flow)
- User has error and needs debugging (use automation-debugger)
- User wants to validate existing flow (use automation-validator)

## Core Workflow

### Phase 1: Platform & Context Discovery

**CRITICAL**: Always determine the platform first!

1. **Check if Platform Specified**
   - Look for platform mention in user message
   - Power Automate, n8n, Make, Zapier, etc.

2. **Ask for Platform if Missing**
   ```
   Use AskUserQuestion tool:

   Question: "Which automation platform will you be using for this workflow?"
   Header: "Platform"
   Options:
   - Power Automate (Microsoft cloud platform with Office 365 integration)
   - n8n (Open-source, self-hosted, node-based automation)
   - Make (Visual scenario builder, formerly Integromat)
   - Zapier (SaaS automation platform, easy to use)
   - Other (Specify in custom response)
   ```

3. **Gather Initial Requirements**
   - What problem are they solving?
   - What systems need to connect?
   - What's the expected frequency?
   - Any specific constraints?

### Phase 2: Interactive Design Session

Use AskUserQuestion tool for guided discovery. Ask 2-4 questions per iteration.

#### Question Set 1: Trigger Design

```
Use AskUserQuestion tool:

Question 1: "What should trigger this workflow?"
Header: "Trigger Type"
Options:
- Schedule (Run on a regular schedule - hourly, daily, etc.)
- Event (Triggered by an event - new email, file upload, etc.)
- Webhook (Triggered by HTTP request from external system)
- Manual (Run on demand by user)

Question 2: "How frequently will this workflow run?"
Header: "Frequency"
Options:
- High (Multiple times per minute or real-time)
- Medium (Every few minutes to hourly)
- Low (Daily, weekly, or on-demand)
- Variable (Depends on external events)
```

#### Question Set 2: Data & Actions

```
Use AskUserQuestion tool:

Question 1: "What data sources will you read from?"
Header: "Data Sources"
MultiSelect: true
Options:
- Databases (SQL, NoSQL, cloud databases)
- APIs (REST APIs, webhooks, web services)
- Files (CSV, Excel, JSON, XML, documents)
- Email (Read emails, attachments, process content)
- Other (Cloud storage, messaging systems, etc.)

Question 2: "What actions will the workflow perform?"
Header: "Actions"
MultiSelect: true
Options:
- Transform data (Parse, filter, map, aggregate)
- Create/Update records (Database, CRM, systems)
- Send notifications (Email, Slack, Teams, SMS)
- File operations (Upload, download, convert)
- Other (Custom API calls, complex logic)
```

#### Question Set 3: Error Handling & Requirements

```
Use AskUserQuestion tool:

Question 1: "How critical is this workflow?"
Header: "Criticality"
Options:
- Critical (Must not fail, needs immediate alerts)
- Important (Should retry on failure, log errors)
- Standard (Basic error handling, can fail occasionally)
- Low (Minimal error handling, best effort)

Question 2: "What are your main concerns?"
Header: "Concerns"
MultiSelect: true
Options:
- Performance (Speed, processing large volumes)
- Reliability (Must not lose data, retry logic)
- Security (Handle sensitive data, authentication)
- Monitoring (Need visibility, logging, alerts)
- Cost (API limits, execution costs, efficiency)
```

### Phase 3: Research Best Practices

**CRITICAL**: Use Task tool to launch research sub-agent.

```
Use Task tool with subagent_type="Explore" and thoroughness="very thorough"

Prompt: "Research best practices for [PLATFORM] workflow with the following requirements:

*This plan was generated by automation-brainstorm skill and is ready for automation-build-flow*
```

## Output Delivery

After generating the plan:

1. **Present Complete Plan**
   - Show full structured plan above
   - Highlight key decisions and rationale

2. **Summarize Key Points**
   - Platform and trigger choice
   - Main actions and data flow
   - Critical considerations (performance, security, errors)

3. **Next Steps**
   - Suggest: "Ready to build? Use automation-build-flow with this plan"
   - Or: "Need changes? I can refine any section"

4. **Save Plan** (Optional)
   - Suggest saving plan to file: `workflow_plan_{name}.md`
   - Makes it easy to reference later

## Best Practices

### 1. Always Ask for Platform First
```
If platform not specified → Use AskUserQuestion immediately
Do not proceed with generic advice
Platform determines connectors, patterns, limitations
```

### 2. Iterative Questioning
```
Don't ask all questions at once
2-4 questions per iteration
Adjust questions based on previous answers
Use multiSelect for non-exclusive choices
```

### 3. Research Documentation
```
Always use research sub-agent
Don't rely on general knowledge
Cite specific documentation files
Platform-specific recommendations only
```

### 4. Structured Plan Output
```
Follow the plan format exactly
Include all sections
Be specific (no placeholders or TODOs)
Ready for automation-build-flow consumption
```

### 5. Consider User Experience Level
```
Beginner → More explanation, simpler patterns
Intermediate → Best practices, common patterns
Advanced → Performance optimization, complex patterns
```

## Quality Checklist

Before delivering plan, verify:

- [ ] Platform specified and confirmed
- [ ] All user requirements captured
- [ ] Research sub-agent consulted documentation
- [ ] Best practices from documentation applied
- [ ] All plan sections complete (no TODOs/placeholders)

## Advanced Features

### Refining the Plan

If user asks for changes:
```
"Can you add email notifications?"
→ Update relevant section
→ Add email action to data flow
→ Update error handling if needed
→ Regenerate updated plan
```

### Multiple Workflows

If requirements suggest multiple workflows:
```
"This should be split into 2 workflows:
1. [Workflow 1 purpose]
2. [Workflow 2 purpose]

Should I create separate plans?"
```

### Comparison Mode

If user unsure about platform:
```
"Would you like me to compare how this would work on:
- n8n vs Power Automate?
- Make vs Zapier?

I can show pros/cons for your use case"
```

## Common Patterns

### High-Volume Data Sync
- Schedule trigger with pagination
- Batching and throttling
- Incremental sync (track last run)
- Robust error handling

### Event-Driven Processing
- Webhook or event trigger
- Immediate processing
- Idempotency (handle duplicates)
- Fast response time

### File Processing
- File upload/creation trigger
- File size validation
- Chunked processing for large files
- Error handling per file

### Multi-System Integration
- Orchestration pattern
- Sequential or parallel execution
- Transaction handling
- Rollback strategy

## Troubleshooting

### User Unsure About Requirements

Guide with examples:
```
"Let me give you examples:
- E-commerce order processing
- Customer onboarding automation
- Report generation and distribution
- Data synchronization between systems

Which is closest to your use case?"
```

### Platform Choice Unclear

Provide guidance:
```
"Platform selection depends on:
- Power Automate: Best if you use Microsoft 365, cloud-native
- n8n: Best if you want self-hosted, open-source, full control
- Make: Best for visual design, many pre-built templates
- Zapier: Best for quick setup, ease of use, SaaS

What's your priority?"
```
