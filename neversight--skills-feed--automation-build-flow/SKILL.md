# Automation Build Flow

Professional workflow builder that generates complete, production-ready JSON for any automation platform.

## Supported Platforms

- **Power Automate** (Microsoft)
- **n8n** (Open-source)
- **Make** (formerly Integromat)
- **Zapier**
- **Other JSON-based workflow platforms**

## Purpose

This skill generates complete automation workflows by:
1. Taking implementation plan or requirements as input
2. Validating platform compatibility
3. Using flow-builder sub-agent to generate complete JSON
4. Ensuring all best practices are implemented
5. Producing ready-to-import workflow JSON

## When This Skill Activates

Automatically activates when user:
- Has implementation plan: "Build this workflow from the plan"
- Provides requirements: "Create a workflow that does X, Y, Z"
- Requests JSON generation: "Generate the flow JSON"
- Has plan from automation-brainstorm: "Use this plan to build the flow"
- Keywords: "build flow", "create workflow", "generate JSON", "implement this"

**Prerequisites**:
- Platform must be specified (or will ask)
- Requirements must be clear (or will request clarification)

**Does NOT activate when**:
- User needs help planning (use automation-brainstorm)
- User has error to debug (use automation-debugger)
- User wants validation only (use automation-validator)

## Core Workflow

### Phase 1: Input Analysis

1. **Determine Input Type**

   **Type A: Implementation Plan** (from automation-brainstorm)
   - Structured markdown plan
   - Contains all sections (trigger, actions, error handling, etc.)
   - Platform specified
   - Ready to build → Proceed to Phase 2

   **Type B: Direct Requirements** (user provided)
   - User describes what they want
   - May be less structured
   - Needs clarification → Gather requirements

2. **Verify Platform**

   Check if platform specified:
   - In plan: Check "Platform" section
   - In message: Look for platform mention
   - If missing: Ask using AskUserQuestion

   ```
   Use AskUserQuestion tool:

   Question: "Which platform should I generate this workflow for?"
   Header: "Platform"
   Options:
   - Power Automate (Microsoft, generates .json for "Paste code" feature)
   - n8n (Open-source, generates workflow.json for import)
   - Make (Integromat, generates scenario blueprint.json)
   - Zapier (Generates zap JSON for import API)
   - Other (Specify platform and format needed)
   ```

3. **Validate Requirements Completeness**

   Essential elements needed:
   - ✅ Trigger type and configuration
   - ✅ Main actions/steps
   - ✅ Data flow between steps
   - ✅ Error handling requirements
   - ⚠️  Optional: Specific connectors, advanced config

   If missing critical info:
   ```
   Use AskUserQuestion tool to gather missing pieces:

   Example for missing trigger:
   Question: "What should trigger this workflow?"
   Header: "Trigger"
   Options: [Schedule/Event/Webhook/Manual]

   Example for missing actions:
   Question: "What are the main actions this workflow should perform?"
   Header: "Actions"
   MultiSelect: true
   Options: [Based on context]
   ```

### Phase 2: Build Workflow with Sub-Agent

**CRITICAL**: Use Task tool to launch flow-builder sub-agent.

```
Use Task tool with subagent_type="general-purpose" or "Plan"

Prompt: "Generate complete workflow JSON for [PLATFORM] with the following specification:

## Platform

## Best Practices

### 1. Complete Specification to Sub-Agent

```
Provide ALL details to flow-builder:
- Complete plan or requirements
- Platform-specific connector names
- All configurations and parameters
- Error handling requirements
- Performance settings

Don't assume sub-agent knows context!
```

### 2. Validate Before Presenting

```
Always check generated JSON:
✅ Syntax valid
✅ Structure complete
✅ Platform schema compliance
✅ No placeholders/TODOs
✅ All actions present

If issues found → Regenerate with corrections
```

### 3. Clear Import Instructions

```
Provide platform-specific import steps:
- Where to import (exact menu path)
- What to configure after import
- Common issues to watch for
- Validation recommendations
```

### 4. Error Handling Always Included

```
Never skip error handling:
- Global error handler (scope/try-catch)
- Action-level handlers where needed
- Retry logic for transient errors
- Notifications on critical failures
```

### 5. Performance by Default

```
Always include performance optimizations:
- API rate limit respect (delays)
- Batching for high-volume
- Concurrency configuration
- Filtering at source
```

### To automation-validator

**Recommended Flow**:
```
After JSON generation:
"Would you like me to validate this workflow before you import it?
I can run automation-validator to check for potential issues."
```

**If user agrees**:
- Save JSON to temp file
- Trigger automation-validator
- Show validation report
- Fix any issues found
- Regenerate if needed

### From Direct Requirements

**If user provides requirements without plan**:
1. Gather essential info (platform, trigger, actions)
2. Use AskUserQuestion for missing pieces
3. Generate JSON from requirements
4. May be simpler than brainstorm output
5. Suggest brainstorm for complex workflows

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Build from Brainstorm Plan

**User**: "Build the workflow from the plan above"

**Skill**:
1. Identifies plan in conversation history
2. Extracts platform (e.g., "n8n")
3. Passes complete plan to flow-builder sub-agent
4. Receives complete n8n workflow JSON
5. Validates JSON structure
6. Presents to user with import instructions

### Scenario 2: Build from Simple Requirements

**User**: "Create a Power Automate flow that runs daily and emails me a list of new files from OneDrive"

**Skill**:
1. Platform specified → Power Automate ✓
2. Trigger clear → Schedule (daily) ✓
3. Actions clear → Get files, Send email ✓
4. Generates structured spec for flow-builder
5. Receives Power Automate JSON
6. Presents with configuration notes

### Scenario 3: Missing Platform

**User**: "Build a workflow that syncs database to API"

**Skill**:
1. Platform not specified → Ask user
2. User selects "Make"
3. Clarifies: Which database? Which API?
4. Gathers configuration details
5. Generates Make scenario JSON
6. Presents with import instructions

### Scenario 4: Complex Multi-Step

**User**: "Implement the workflow plan for high-volume Salesforce sync"

**Skill**:
1. References plan (contains all details)
2. Platform: n8n (from plan)
3. Passes comprehensive spec to flow-builder:
   - Scheduled trigger (every 5 minutes)
   - Salesforce query with pagination
   - Data transformation nodes
   - Batch processing (100 records)
   - Error handling with retry
   - Notification on failure
4. Receives complex n8n workflow (20+ nodes)
5. Validates all connections
6. Presents with testing recommendations

## Quality Checklist

Before delivering JSON, verify:

- [ ] Platform correctly identified

## Advanced Features

### Iterative Refinement

If user wants changes:
```
"Add email notification when it fails"
→ Regenerate with updated spec
→ Add email action to error handler
→ Present updated JSON
```

### Partial JSON Updates

If user has JSON and wants to modify:
```
"This workflow needs better error handling"
→ Read existing JSON
→ Identify error handling gaps
→ Regenerate with improvements
→ Present updated JSON
```

### Multi-Platform Generation

If user wants same workflow for different platforms:
```
"Generate this for both Power Automate and n8n"
→ Generate for Power Automate
→ Generate for n8n
→ Present both with comparison notes
```

## Troubleshooting

### Sub-Agent Returns Invalid JSON

**Problem**: JSON has syntax errors or missing elements

**Solution**:
1. Validate with JSON parser
2. Identify specific issues
3. Regenerate with detailed corrections:
   ```
   "Previous generation had [SPECIFIC_ISSUE].
   Regenerate with correct [CORRECTION]."
   ```

### Platform Schema Mismatch

**Problem**: JSON doesn't match platform schema

**Solution**:
1. Reference platform format documentation
2. Identify schema violations
3. Provide correct schema example to sub-agent
4. Regenerate with schema compliance focus

### Missing Critical Configuration

**Problem**: Generated JSON missing key settings

**Solution**:
1. Review original spec
2. Identify what's missing
3. Add explicit requirement to sub-agent prompt
4. Regenerate with complete spec

### Ambiguous Requirements

**Problem**: Requirements unclear, can't generate reliably

**Solution**:
1. Don't guess!
2. Use AskUserQuestion to clarify
3. Get specific details
4. Generate only when requirements clear
