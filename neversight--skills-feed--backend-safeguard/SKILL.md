# Backend Safeguard Protocol (Supabase + Vercel API)

## 1. Database Schema & Migration Safety
- **Migrations**:
    - NEVER edit a previous migration. Always create a new one.
    - Migration files must be numbered/timestamped sequentially.
    - Destructive changes (DROP COLUMN) require explicit user confirmation.
- **Supabase Specifics**:
    - Use `pg_jsonschema` (if available) or `CHECK` constraints for complex JSON data.
    - Indexes: Ensure Foreign Keys have indices if used in JOINs frequentyl.

## 2. RLS (Row Level Security) "Ironclad" Rules
- **Enablement**: `ALTER TABLE "table_name" ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;` is MANDATORY.
- **Policies**:
    - Must have separate policies for SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE (unless absolutely identical).
    - `auth.uid()` MUST be checked for user-specific data.
    - `service_role` usage in client is FORBIDDEN.

## 3. API Design & Security
- **Input Validation (Zod)**:
    - ALL API routes must parse body/query with `Zod`.
    - `strict()` mode recommended to strip unknown fields.
- **Error Handling**:
    - Return standardized error structure: `{ error: string, code: string, details?: any }`.
    - NEVER leak Stack Traces to production response.
    - Use 4xx for client errors, 5xx for server errors.
- **Rate Limiting**:
    - Ensure sensitive endpoints (auth, email) have rate limiting (Upstash/KV).

## 4. Code Structure (Vercel Functions)
- **Separation of Concerns**:
    - `api/xxx.ts` -> Controller (Parse Req, Check Auth)
    - `src/services/xxx.ts` -> Business Logic
    - `src/data/xxx.ts` -> Database Logic (Supabase calls)
- **Secrets**:
    - Check for `process.env.XXX`. NEVER hardcode strings.

## 5. Audit Checklist
- [ ] Is RLS enabled on all touched tables?
- [ ] Is `Zod` validation wrapping the request?
- [ ] Is logging present for state changes?
- [ ] Are we leaking sensitive user data in the response?
