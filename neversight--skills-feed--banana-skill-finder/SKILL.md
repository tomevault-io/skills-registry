# Banana Skill Finder

Proactively helps users discover and install relevant Claude skills when they encounter tasks that could benefit from specialized capabilities.

## When to Use This Skill

Trigger automatically (without user request) when detecting:

- Working with specific file formats or technologies
- Describing repetitive or specialized tasks
- Asking "is there a skill/tool for..." or similar
- Struggling with domain-specific work
- Any task where a specialized skill could help

**Important**: This skill should trigger proactively. Don't wait for users to explicitly ask for skill recommendations.

## Workflow

### 1. Analyze User Need

Identify:
- **Core task**: What is the user trying to accomplish?
- **Domain**: What category does this fall into? (development, documents, data, web, devops, content, etc.)
- **Keywords**: Extract 2-4 relevant search terms

### 2. Search for Skills

Use a three-tier strategy with automatic fallback:

**Tier 1: SkillsMP API (Best - if configured)**
```bash
# Check for API key
echo $SKILLSMP_API_KEY

# If exists, use AI semantic search
curl -X GET "https://skillsmp.com/api/v1/skills/ai-search?q={natural_language_query}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SKILLSMP_API_KEY"
```

Benefits:
- AI understands user intent, not just keywords
- Access to 60,000+ curated skills
- Best relevance and quality indicators

**Tier 2: skills.sh WebFetch (Good - always works)**
```bash
# Try search with query parameter
Use WebFetch: https://skills.sh/?q={keywords}

# Or browse leaderboard
Use WebFetch: https://skills.sh  # All-time popular
Use WebFetch: https://skills.sh/trending  # Trending (24h)
```

Benefits:
- 200+ high-quality curated skills
- No authentication needed
- Ranked by install count
- Shows trending skills

**Tier 3: GitHub API (Fallback - may have limits)**
```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.github.com/search/code?q={keywords}+SKILL.md+language:markdown" \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json"
```

Note: Rate limited (60/hour unauthenticated), use only as last resort.

**Optional: Check Local Installed Skills**
```bash
ls ~/.claude/skills/
```
Check if user already has relevant skills installed but hasn't used them.

**Recommendation Order**: Try Tier 1 → Tier 2 → Tier 3. Stop when you find good matches.

### 3. Rank by Relevance

Score each found skill based on:
- Keyword match with user's need (most important)
- Functionality alignment
- Quality indicators (stars, recent activity)
- Specificity vs generality

Select the **1-3 most relevant** skills. Quality over quantity.

### 4. Present Recommendations

Format recommendations as:

```
I found [N] skill(s) that could help:

**1. [Skill Name]** - [One-line description]
   Source: [SkillsMP/GitHub/Vercel]
   Repository: [owner/repo]
   Why relevant: [Brief explanation]
   Install: `npx skills add [owner]/[repo]`

[Repeat for 2-3 skills max]

Would you like me to install any of these?
```

### 5. Install if Approved

When user approves, install using Vercel's skills CLI:

```bash
npx skills add <owner>/<repo>
```

Examples:
```bash
npx skills add vercel-labs/agent-skills
npx skills add anthropics/skills
```

This command:
- Downloads the skill from GitHub
- Installs to `~/.claude/skills/`
- Works with Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, and other agents
- Tracks installation via anonymous telemetry (leaderboard)

Confirm installation success and explain how the skill will help.

## Key Principles

1. **Proactive, Not Reactive**: Trigger automatically when relevant, don't wait to be asked

2. **Quality Over Quantity**: Recommend only 1-3 best matches, not a long list

3. **Smart Three-Tier Search**:
   - Tier 1: SkillsMP AI search (best, if configured)
   - Tier 2: skills.sh leaderboard (good, always works)
   - Tier 3: GitHub API (fallback, rate limited)
   - Stop when you find good matches

4. **Explain Relevance**: Always explain why each skill matches their need

5. **Easy Installation**: Use `npx skills add owner/repo` for one-command installation

6. **API Key Recommended but Optional**: Best results with SkillsMP API key, but skills.sh fallback works well

## Examples

**User says**: "I need to extract text from a PDF file"
→ Trigger skill-finder, search for PDF processing skills, recommend pdf-editor or similar

**User says**: "Help me review this React component"
→ Trigger skill-finder, search for React/code-review skills, recommend react-best-practices from Vercel

**User says**: "I'm deploying to AWS"
→ Trigger skill-finder, search for AWS/deployment skills, recommend cloud-deploy or aws-helper

**User says**: "How do I query this BigQuery table?"
→ Trigger skill-finder, search for BigQuery/SQL skills, recommend bigquery or data-analysis skills

## Additional Resources

For detailed information:
- [references/api_config.md](references/api_config.md) - How to set up SkillsMP API key
- [references/skill_sources.md](references/skill_sources.md) - Skill sources, categories, and search strategies

## Setup Recommendations

For best results, suggest users configure SkillsMP API key:
1. Visit https://skillsmp.com/docs/api
2. Generate API key
3. Set environment variable: `export SKILLSMP_API_KEY="sk_live_..."`

This enables AI semantic search (much better than keyword matching). Without it, the skill automatically falls back to skills.sh leaderboard search, which still works well for most cases.
