# Basecamp CLI

Command-line interface for Basecamp. All output is JSON.

## Prerequisites

```bash
basecamp version   # Verify installation
basecamp projects  # Verify authentication (run `basecamp auth` if needed)
```

## Project Context

Create `.basecamp.yml` in a directory to set default project:

```yaml
project_id: 12345678
```

Then omit project_id from commands when in that directory.

```

### Message Types

```bash
basecamp events                                           # All events
basecamp events-project [project_id]                      # Project events
basecamp events-recording [project_id] <recording_id>     # Recording events
```

## Error Handling

Errors return JSON to stderr:

```json
{"error": "not authenticated, run 'basecamp auth' first"}
```

## Tips

- All commands output JSON - pipe to `jq` for filtering
- Use `--comments` flag to include comments on supported commands
- Recording IDs work across types (todos, cards, messages, etc.)
- Get vault_id from `basecamp docs` output for upload commands
