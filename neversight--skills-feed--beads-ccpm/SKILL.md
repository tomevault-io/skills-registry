# Beads CCPM - Project Management Skill

A comprehensive, agent-agnostic project management system for AI-assisted software development, powered by the Beads local-first task tracker.

## Capabilities

- **PRD Management**: Create, edit, list, and track Product Requirements Documents
- **Epic Workflow**: Decompose PRDs into epics, break epics into tasks, sync to Beads
- **Issue Tracking**: Start, sync, close, and analyze issues with parallel work streams
- **Parallel Execution**: Launch multiple agents to work on independent tasks simultaneously
- **Git Integration**: Worktree and branch-based workflows for isolated development
- **Bidirectional Sync**: Keep local markdown files and Beads task tracker in sync
- **Context Management**: Create, prime, and update project context for agent sessions

## Quick Start

1. `/pm:init` - Initialize the PM system and install Beads
2. `/pm:prd-new <feature>` - Create a new PRD through brainstorming
3. `/pm:prd-parse <feature>` - Convert PRD to a technical epic
4. `/pm:epic-decompose <epic>` - Break epic into numbered tasks
5. `/pm:epic-sync <epic>` - Push epic and tasks to Beads
6. `/pm:epic-start <epic>` - Launch parallel agent execution

## Project Data

This skill stores project data in `.project/` at the project root:
- `.project/prds/` - Product Requirements Documents
- `.project/epics/` - Epics and their task files
- `.project/context/` - Project context documentation
- `.project/adrs/` - Architecture Decision Records

## Dependencies

- [Beads CLI](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) - Local-first task tracker (auto-installed by `/pm:init`)
- Git - Version control
