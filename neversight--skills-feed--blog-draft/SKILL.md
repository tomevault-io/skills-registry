3. Present research summary to user

### 2. Brainstorm & Clarify

Present findings and ask:
- Main takeaway for readers?

- Points to emphasize or exclude?

**Wait for user response.**

### 3. Title & Outline

#### Generate SEO-Optimized Title

Follow [references/seo-title-guide.md](references/seo-title-guide.md) to create click-worthy titles:

1. Identify primary keyword from topic

   - **Keyword + Benefit**: "SEO Title Tags: Master Optimization in 5 Steps"

#### Create Outline

Include:
- Selected title and 2-3 alternates for A/B testing
- Meta info (audience, tone, length, main takeaway, primary keyword)
- Section structure with key points and supporting evidence
- Sources to cite

**Get user approval**, then save as `OUTLINE.md` and commit.

### 4. Draft

Write the full post following the outline. Use `assets/draft-template.md` for structure.

**Citation requirement**: Every statistic, comparison, or factual claim must cite its source using inline references [1] linked to a References section.

Save as `draft-v0.1.md` and commit.
