## ID vs AccountNumber

Bloomerang distinguishes between:
- **ID**: API identifier (use in API calls)
- **AccountNumber**: UI-friendly reference (displayed to users)

## Full API Reference

For complete endpoint specifications, request/response schemas, and examples, search the OpenAPI spec (do not read the full file - it's 1.5MB):

```
references/bloomerang-openapi.json
```

Search patterns (use grep or jq):
- Endpoints: `jq '.paths | keys'`
- Schemas: `jq '.components.schemas | keys'`
- Specific endpoint: `jq '.paths["/constituent/{id}"]'`
