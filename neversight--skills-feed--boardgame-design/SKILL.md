# Board Game Design Skill

## Overview

This skill provides comprehensive guidance for designing engaging board games, with emphasis on German-style Eurogame principles. It covers mechanical design, balance analysis, asymmetric faction design, resource economy systems, playtesting methodology, and rules documentation.

## Core Design Philosophy

### The Eurogame Approach

German-style Eurogames emphasize:

1. **Strategy Over Luck**: Minimize randomness; player decisions should drive outcomes
2. **No Player Elimination**: Everyone stays engaged until the end
3. **Indirect Conflict**: Competition through position, resources, and efficiency rather than direct attacks
4. **Multiple Paths to Victory**: No single dominant strategy
5. **Elegant Mechanics**: Maximum strategic depth from minimal rules complexity
6. **Bounded Play Time**: Built-in mechanisms to limit game length (fixed turns, resource depletion, scoring thresholds)

### What Makes Games Fun

- **Meaningful Decisions**: Every choice should have trade-offs and consequences
- **Appropriate Challenge**: Difficulty that creates satisfaction without frustration
- **Player Interaction**: Opponents' actions should matter to your strategy
- **Emergent Complexity**: Simple rules that create rich strategic possibilities
- **Steady Pacing**: Interesting events throughout; no "grinding" phases
- **Replayability**: Variability and multiple strategies encourage repeated play

## Key Design Workflows

### 1. Mechanical Design

When designing core mechanics:

- **Identify the Core Loop**: What is the most repeated action? It must be simple, fun, and have depth
- **Establish Core Constraints**: A central limitation that drives all decisions (e.g., Lift ≥ Weight in UP SHIP!)
- **Design Feedback Loops**: Actions should create cascading effects and player interaction
- **Create Tension Points**: Moments of meaningful scarcity and difficult choices
- **Balance Simplicity and Depth**: "Elegance" means rich strategy from few rules

### 2. Resource Economy Design

Resources are the lifeblood of strategic games:

- **Define Resource Types**: Money, actions, time, components, information
- **Create Scarcity**: Limited resources force meaningful choices
- **Design Flow**: Sources (generation), sinks (consumption), and conversion paths
- **Ebb and Flow**: Scarcity that changes over the game creates dynamic tension
- **Control = Power**: Whoever controls a scarce resource gains strategic advantage
- **Multiple Currencies**: Different resource types that don't directly convert create interesting trade-offs

**The Action Economy**: The most precious resource is often actions/turns. When designing:
- Make every action feel valuable
- Create opportunity cost between competing good options
- Consider: "I take it, opponent takes it, or it doesn't happen"

### 3. Asymmetric Faction Design

Asymmetry increases replayability but requires careful balance:

**Types of Asymmetry** (from subtle to extreme):
1. **Asymmetric Results**: Same rules, different outcomes from choices (Monopoly)
2. **Asymmetric Starting Positions**: Different initial resources/positions (Catan)
3. **Asymmetric Abilities**: Special powers that modify standard rules (Terra Mystica)
4. **Asymmetric Rules**: Fundamentally different gameplay for each faction (Root)

**Balance Principles**:
- Players should feel powerful, not restricted
- Each faction needs at least 3 viable strategic paths
- Trade-offs should be meaningful: strong at X, weaker at Y
- Theme should justify mechanical differences
- Consider self-balancing through player interaction (ganging up on leaders)
- "Dial down" extremes: moderate bonuses are easier to balance

**Testing Asymmetry**:
- Asymmetry creates combinatorial explosion of test cases
- Focus playtesting on faction vs. faction matchups
- Track win rates by faction over many games
- Watch for perceived imbalance vs. actual imbalance

### 4. Balance Analysis

Balance ensures fair competition and strategic viability:

**Pre-Playtest Balance**:
- Mathematical modeling of cost-benefit ratios
- Compare similar options: are costs proportional to power?
- Check for dominant strategies on paper
- Model income/resource generation over game length

**Balance Levers**:
- Costs (acquisition price, upkeep, opportunity cost)
- Power (immediate effect, ongoing benefit, win condition contribution)
- Availability (scarcity, prerequisites, timing)
- Risk (variance, dependencies, counter-play)

**Handling Runaway Leaders**:
- Catch-up mechanisms (bonus for trailing players)
- Diminishing returns on accumulated advantage
- Player interaction as natural balancing (targeting the leader)
- Hidden scoring until game end

### 5. Playtesting Methodology

Playtesting is iterative, time-consuming, and essential:

**Phase 1: Solo Testing**
- Test core loop alone
- Verify basic mechanics work
- Identify obvious broken strategies
- Goal: Does the game function?

**Phase 2: Guided Testing**
- Play with interested friends/colleagues
- Watch for dominant strategies and unexpected behavior
- Begin mechanical balancing
- Goal: Is the game playable and interesting?

**Phase 3: Blind Testing**
- External playtesters with no guidance
- Observe without intervening
- Test rulebook clarity
- Goal: Can people learn and enjoy it independently?

**Best Practices**:
- Observe behavior, don't just ask opinions (actions reveal more than words)
- Track specific metrics: game length, decision time, win rates
- Change one variable at a time when iterating
- Distinguish "perceived balance" from actual balance
- Feedback loop: implement → test → analyze → repeat

### 6. Rules Documentation

Clear rules prevent confusion and arguments:

- **Organize by Phase/Turn Structure**: Players should find rules in play order
- **Define Terms Early**: Establish vocabulary before using it
- **Handle Edge Cases**: Anticipate conflicts and provide resolution
- **Include Examples**: Concrete illustrations of abstract rules
- **Create Quick Reference**: Summary card for experienced players
- **Cross-Reference**: Link related sections for easy navigation
- **Playtest the Rulebook**: Rules are a product that needs testing too

## When This Skill Activates

Claude uses this skill when you:

- Request help designing a new game or game system
- Ask for balance analysis of existing mechanics
- Want to design or validate asymmetric factions
- Need help with resource economy design
- Ask for rules clarity review
- Request playtesting methodology guidance
- Ask about making a game "more fun" or "more engaging"

## Example Workflows

### Example: Designing a New Resource System

When asked "How should I design an engineer economy?":

1. Define the resource's role (what does it enable?)
2. Identify sources (how are engineers acquired?) and costs
3. Identify sinks (how are engineers consumed/spent?)
4. Create scarcity tension (never enough for everything)
5. Add trade-offs (using engineers for X means not using them for Y)
6. Model mathematically (income vs. consumption over game length)
7. Design focused playtest to validate

### Example: Balancing Asymmetric Factions

When asked "Is faction X balanced?":

1. List faction's unique abilities and constraints
2. Compare power level to other factions' abilities
3. Identify intended trade-offs (what's the cost of the benefit?)
4. Check for unintended synergies or exploits
5. Review win rate data if available
6. Suggest adjustments if needed (dial up/down specific abilities)
7. Design faction-focused playtest scenarios

### Example: Making a Mechanic More Engaging

When asked "This part of the game feels boring":

1. Identify the specific mechanic/phase in question
2. Analyze: Is there meaningful choice? Tension? Consequence?
3. Check pacing: Too slow? Too predictable?
4. Look for "grinding" (repetitive actions without interesting decisions)
5. Consider adding: scarcity, trade-offs, player interaction, or stakes
6. Propose targeted changes that preserve overall design
7. Plan A/B playtest comparing old vs. new version
