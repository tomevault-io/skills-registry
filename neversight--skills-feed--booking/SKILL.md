## Search Process

### Step 1: Gather Search Criteria
From user request or travel plan, collect:
- **City/Location**: Specific city and optional neighborhood
- **Check-in Date**: Format as YYYY-MM-DD (e.g., 2026-07-17)
- **Check-out Date**: Format as YYYY-MM-DD (e.g., 2026-07-20)
- **Nights**: Calculate duration
- **Adults**: Number of adult travelers
- **Children**: Number and ages of children
- **Price Range**: Min and max per night in USD
- **Preferred Chains**: Specific chain or "any"
- **Required Amenities**: From preferences (pool, fridge, free cancellation, etc.)

### Step 2: Construct Search Query
Use web search with query like:
```
site:booking.com [City] [Neighborhood] [Hotel Chain Brand] [Check-in Date] [Check-out Date] [Number of guests]
```

Alternative: Use natural language web search:
```
[Hotel Chain Brand] hotels in [City] [Neighborhood] on Booking.com, [Check-in Date] to [Check-out Date], [Number of guests], price $[Min]-$[Max]
```

### Step 3: Filter and Validate Results
For each hotel found:
- ✅ Verify it matches preferred chain/brand
- ✅ Check price is within range
- ✅ Confirm availability for dates
- ✅ Check guest ratings (prefer 7.5+ out of 10)
- ✅ Verify required amenities (especially fridge for family)
- ✅ Check room size (larger for 3+ night stays)
- ✅ Note if free cancellation available

### Step 4: Retrieve Direct Website Links
For each selected hotel:
1. Search for: `[Hotel Name] [City] official website`
2. Look for the hotel's direct booking site (often chain.com or hotel's own domain)
3. Note: Direct booking sometimes offers better rates or perks

### Step 5: Handle Edge Cases
- **No results found**: Expand search to nearby neighborhoods or adjacent dates
- **Outside price range**: Present closest options and note the price difference
- **No preferred chains available**: Suggest highly-rated independent hotels
- **Missing amenities**: Flag mandatory vs. preferred missing amenities

- Consider hotel location relative to planned activities in `plan.md`
- Note parking availability and costs (important for road trips)
- Flag breakfast options (family prefers mix of hotel breakfast and local diners)
- When in doubt about chain brands, search "[Brand Name] part of which hotel chain"
- For multi-night stays (3+), prioritize larger rooms and suites
- Free cancellation is highly valued for flexibility
