# Brand Identity Wizard

Create a comprehensive brand identity document that content skills can reference for consistent voice, messaging, and audience targeting.

## Purpose

Many content skills (newsletters, podcasts, social posts, SEO articles) need brand context to produce on-brand content. This wizard creates a single `brand-identity.md` file that all skills can reference.

**Core Philosophy:** Define once, use everywhere. A well-defined brand identity enables consistent content creation across all channels.

## When to Use This Wizard

Use this wizard when:
- Setting up a new skills vault for a brand/company
- Starting content production for a new client
- Your brand identity has evolved and needs updating
- Content feels inconsistent across different skills

**You'll need:**
- 30-60 minutes for the initial interview
- Access to existing brand materials (website, past content, style guides)
- Decision-making authority on brand voice
