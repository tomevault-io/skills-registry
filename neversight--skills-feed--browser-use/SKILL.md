# Browser Use

AI-powered browser automation for web interactions, research, and data extraction powered by the browser-use library.

## When to Use

- Automate web interactions (fill forms, click buttons, navigate pages)
- Perform deep research across multiple web sources
- Extract structured data from web pages
- Learn and replay browser workflows as reusable skills
- Monitor and manage long-running browser automation tasks

## Core Tools

### run_browser_agent

## Common Workflows

### Web Research Workflow

1. Use `run_deep_research` with your research question
2. Review the synthesized markdown report
3. Use `run_browser_agent` for follow-up exploration of specific sources
4. Check `task_list` to monitor progress

```
# Step 1: Deep research
run_deep_research
topic: What are the best practices for MCP server development in 2025?
max_searches: 8

# Step 2: Follow-up investigation
run_browser_agent
task: Go to the top-ranked article and extract code examples
```

### Form Automation Workflow

1. Use `run_browser_agent` with task describing the form
2. Include URL if known, or let agent search for it
3. Agent navigates, fills fields, and submits
4. Use `task_get` to verify completion

```
run_browser_agent
task: Fill out the contact form at https://example.com/contact with name "John Doe", email "john@example.com", and message "Request for demo"
max_steps: 30
```

### Learning and Reusing Skills

1. Run `run_browser_agent` with `learn: true` to discover APIs
2. Agent records network calls and extracts patterns
3. Save skill with `save_skill_as`
4. Use `skill_list` to see learned skills
5. Reuse with `skill_name` parameter for faster execution

```
# Step 1: Learn a skill
run_browser_agent
task: Go to Hacker News and extract the top 10 stories with titles, URLs, and scores
learn: true
save_skill_as: hackernews_top_stories

# Step 2: List learned skills
skill_list

# Step 3: Reuse the skill (faster direct execution)
run_browser_agent
task: Get current top stories from Hacker News
skill_name: hackernews_top_stories
skill_params: {"limit": 5}
```

### Long-Running Task Management

1. Start a browser automation task (runs in background)
2. Use `task_list` to check status
3. Use `task_get` for detailed progress
4. Use `task_cancel` if needed

```
# Step 1: Start task
run_browser_agent
task: Research all articles on example.com blog and create a summary
max_steps: 200

# Step 2: Check progress
task_list
status_filter: running

# Step 3: Get details
task_get
task_id: a1b2c3d4

# Step 4: Cancel if needed
task_cancel
task_id: a1b2c3d4
```

## Advanced Features

### Skill-Based Execution

When a skill is learned with API endpoints, it supports **direct execution** which bypasses the AI agent for much faster performance:

- First run: Agent explores the website (60-120 seconds)
- Skill learned: API patterns extracted and saved
- Subsequent runs: Direct API calls (2-5 seconds)

**Fallback behavior:** If direct execution fails (auth required, API changed), automatically falls back to agent-based execution.

### Progress Tracking

Both `run_browser_agent` and `run_deep_research` support real-time progress tracking:

- Step-by-step navigation updates
- Progress percentage (current step / total steps)
- Current stage (initializing, navigating, extracting, analyzing)
- Task message (current action description)

### Background Task Support

Long-running tasks automatically run in background when requested by the MCP client:

- Tasks tracked in SQLite database
- Persistent across server restarts
- Query status anytime with `task_list` and `task_get`
- Cancel with `task_cancel`

## Configuration

The browser-use MCP server can be configured via `~/.config/mcp-server-browser-use/config.json` or environment variables. Key settings:

- `browser.headless` - Run browser in headless mode (default: true)
- `browser.cdp_url` - Connect to external Chrome via CDP (optional)
- `agent.max_steps` - Default maximum steps (default: 100)
- `research.max_searches` - Default research searches (default: 5)
- `skills.enabled` - Enable skill learning and execution (default: true)
- `skills.directory` - Where to store learned skills (default: ~/.config/browser-skills/)

## Troubleshooting

### Server Not Responding

```
# Check server health
health_check

# Check if server is running
# In terminal: mcp-server-browser-use status
```

### Task Stuck or Failing

```
# List running tasks
task_list
status_filter: running

# Get task details
task_get
task_id: <task_id>

# Cancel if stuck
task_cancel
task_id: <task_id>
```

### Skill Execution Fails

```
# Get skill details to verify parameters
skill_get
skill_name: my_skill

# Try without skill to re-learn
run_browser_agent
task: <original task>
learn: true
save_skill_as: my_skill_v2
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start with health_check** - Verify server is ready before running tasks
2. **Use descriptive task names** - Help the AI understand your intent clearly
3. **Set reasonable max_steps** - 30-50 for simple tasks, 100-200 for complex research
4. **Learn frequently-used workflows** - Save time with skill-based execution
5. **Monitor long tasks** - Use task_list and task_get to track progress
6. **Clean up failed tasks** - Use task_cancel to free resources
7. **Save research to files** - Use save_to_file to preserve research reports

## Limitations

- Browser automation requires the MCP server to be running as a daemon
- CDP-based browsers must be on localhost (security restriction)
- Some websites may block automation (respect robots.txt and rate limits)
- Skill learning requires successful task completion and API discovery
- Task cancellation may take a few seconds to complete gracefully
