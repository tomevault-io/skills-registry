# Browser Workflow Generator Skill

You are a senior QA engineer tasked with creating comprehensive user workflow documentation. Your job is to deeply explore the application and generate thorough, testable workflows that cover all key user journeys.

## Task List Integration

**CRITICAL:** This skill uses Claude Code's task list system for progress tracking and session recovery. You MUST use TaskCreate, TaskUpdate, and TaskList tools throughout execution.

### Why Task Lists Matter Here
- **Parallel agent tracking:** Monitor 3 exploration agents completing simultaneously
- **Progress visibility:** User sees "Exploring: 2/3 agents complete"
- **Session recovery:** If interrupted, know which agents finished and what they found
- **Iteration tracking:** Track multiple approval rounds with user
- **Audit trail:** Record what was explored, researched, and generated

### Task Hierarchy
```
[Main Task] "Generate: Browser Workflows"
  └── [Explore Task] "Explore: Routes & Navigation" (agent)
  └── [Explore Task] "Explore: Components & Features" (agent)
  └── [Explore Task] "Explore: State & Data" (agent)
  └── [Research Task] "Research: Web UX Conventions" (agent)
  └── [Generate Task] "Generate: Workflow Drafts"
  └── [Approval Task] "Approval: User Review #1"
  └── [Write Task] "Write: browser-workflows.md"
```

### Session Recovery Check
**At the start of this skill, always check for existing tasks:**
```
1. Call TaskList to check for existing workflow generator tasks
2. If a "Generate: Browser Workflows" task exists with status in_progress:
   - Check which exploration tasks completed (read their metadata for findings)
   - Check if UX research completed
   - Check if drafts were generated
   - Resume from appropriate phase
3. If no tasks exist, proceed with fresh execution
```

## Process

### Phase 1: Assess Current State

**Create the main workflow generator task:**
```
TaskCreate:
- subject: "Generate: Browser Workflows"
- description: |
    Generate comprehensive browser workflow documentation.
    Starting: assess current state
- activeForm: "Assessing current state"

TaskUpdate:
- taskId: [main task ID]
- status: "in_progress"
```

1. Check if `/workflows/browser-workflows.md` already exists
2. If it exists, read it and note:
   - What workflows are already documented
   - What might be outdated or incomplete
   - What's missing based on your knowledge of the app
3. Ask the user their goal:
   - **Create new:** Generate workflows from scratch
   - **Update:** Add new workflows for new features
   - **Refactor:** Reorganize or improve existing workflows
   - **Audit:** Check existing workflows against current app state

**Update task with assessment results:**
```
TaskUpdate:
- taskId: [main task ID]
- metadata: {
    "existingFile": true/false,
    "existingWorkflowCount": [N],
    "userGoal": "create" | "update" | "refactor" | "audit"
  }
```

### Phase 2: Explore the Application [DELEGATE TO AGENTS]

**Purpose:** Thoroughly understand the app by launching multiple Explore agents in parallel. This saves context and allows comprehensive codebase exploration.

**Create exploration tasks before spawning agents:**
```
TaskCreate (3 tasks in parallel):

Task 1:
- subject: "Explore: Routes & Navigation"
- description: "Find all routes, navigation patterns, and entry points"
- activeForm: "Exploring routes"

Task 2:
- subject: "Explore: Components & Features"
- description: "Find all interactive UI components and major features"
- activeForm: "Exploring components"

Task 3:
- subject: "Explore: State & Data"
- description: "Understand data model and user CRUD actions"
- activeForm: "Exploring data model"

Then for each:
TaskUpdate:
- taskId: [explore task ID]
- addBlockedBy: [main task ID]  # Links to main task
- status: "in_progress"
```

**Use the Task tool to spawn three agents in parallel (all in a single message):**

```
Agent 1 - Routes & Navigation:
Task tool parameters:
- subagent_type: "Explore"
- model: "sonnet"
- prompt: |
    You are exploring a web application to find all routes and navigation patterns.

    ## What to Find

    1. **All Routes/Pages**

    3. **Component Patterns**
       - Identify reusable component patterns
       - Note any component libraries used (MUI, Radix, etc.)
       - Find data-testid or accessibility attributes

    ## Return Format

    ```
    ## Components & Features Report

    ### Major Features
    | Feature | Entry Point | Key Components |
    |---------|-------------|----------------|

    ### Interactive Components by Page
    #### [Page Name]
    - Buttons: [list]
    - Forms: [list]
    - Other: [list]

    ### Component Patterns
    - UI library: [if any]
    - Common patterns: [list]
    ```
```

```
Agent 3 - State & Data:
Task tool parameters:
- subagent_type: "Explore"
- model: "sonnet"
- prompt: |
    You are exploring a web application to understand its data model and user actions.

    ## What to Find

    1. **Data Model**
       - Find state management (Redux, Zustand, Context, etc.)
       - Identify main data entities/types
       - Note data relationships

    2. **User Actions (CRUD)**
       - What can users create?

    ### Data Entities
    | Entity | Properties | CRUD Operations |
    |--------|------------|-----------------|

    ### User Actions
    - Create: [list of things users can create]
    - Read: [list of things users can view]
    - Update: [list of things users can modify]
    - Delete: [list of things users can remove]

    ### API Patterns
    - Base URL: [if found]
    - Key endpoints: [list]
    ```
```

**After each agent returns, update its task:**
```
TaskUpdate:
- taskId: [explore task ID]
- status: "completed"
- metadata: {
    "routesFound": [count],        # For routes agent
    "componentsFound": [count],    # For components agent
    "entitiesFound": [count],      # For data agent
    "summary": "[brief summary of findings]"
  }
```

**After all agents return:** Synthesize findings into a feature inventory:
- List all user-facing features
- Group by area/section of the app
- Note entry points and exit points

**Update main task with exploration summary:**
```
TaskUpdate:
- taskId: [main task ID]
- metadata: {
    "explorationComplete": true,
    "routesFound": [total],
    "featuresFound": [total],
    "entitiesFound": [total]
  }
```

### Phase 3: Identify User Journeys

**Update main task for journey identification phase:**
```
TaskUpdate:
- taskId: [main task ID]
- activeForm: "Identifying user journeys"
```

Based on exploration, identify key user journeys:

**Core Journeys** (every user does these):
- Onboarding/first-time experience
- Primary task completion
- Navigation between main sections

**Feature Journeys** (specific feature usage):
- Each major feature should have its own workflow
- Include happy path and key variations

**Edge Case Journeys** (important but less common):
- Error handling flows
- Empty states
- Settings/preferences
- Account/profile management

**Update main task with journey counts:**
```
TaskUpdate:
- taskId: [main task ID]
- metadata: {
    "coreJourneys": [count],
    "featureJourneys": [count],
    "edgeCaseJourneys": [count],
    "totalWorkflows": [total]
  }
```

### Phase 4: Research UX Conventions [DELEGATE TO AGENT]

**Purpose:** For each major screen/page type identified, research what good web UX looks like. Delegate this to an agent to save context.

**Create UX research task:**
```
TaskCreate:
- subject: "Research: Web UX Conventions"
- description: |
    Research UX conventions for identified page types.
    Page types: [list from Phase 3]
- activeForm: "Researching UX conventions"

TaskUpdate:
- taskId: [research task ID]
- addBlockedBy: [main task ID]
- status: "in_progress"
```

**Use the Task tool to spawn a UX research agent:**

```
Task tool parameters:
- subagent_type: "general-purpose"
- model: "sonnet"
- prompt: |
    You are researching web UX conventions for a workflow generator.

    ## Page Types to Research
    [Include list of page types identified from Phase 2/3, e.g.:]
    - Login page
    - Dashboard
    - Settings page
    - List/table view
    - Detail page
    - Onboarding flow

    ## Your Task

    For each page type:

    1. **Search for reference examples** using WebSearch:
       - "web app [page type] design Dribbble"
       - "best SaaS [page type] UI examples"
       - "[well-known web app] [page type] screenshot"

    2. **Visit 2-3 reference examples** to understand conventions

    3. **Document UX conventions** for each page type

    ## Return Format

    For each page type, return:
    ```
    ### Page: [Page Type]
    **Reference Examples:** [Apps/sites compared]
    **Expected Web Conventions:**
    - [Convention 1]
    - [Convention 2]
    - [Convention 3]
    **Anti-patterns to flag:**
    - [Anti-pattern 1 - why it's wrong for web]
    - [Anti-pattern 2]
    ```

    ## Example Output

    ### Page: Dashboard
    **Reference Examples:** Linear, Notion, Figma
    **Expected Web Conventions:**
    - Top navigation bar with logo, search, and user menu
    - Sidebar for section navigation (collapsible on smaller screens)
    - Cards or widgets for key metrics
    - Hover states on all interactive elements
    - Keyboard shortcuts for power users (with visible hints)
    - Responsive layout that works from 320px to 2560px+
    **Anti-patterns to flag:**
    - Bottom tab bar (mobile pattern)
    - Pull-to-refresh gesture requirement
    - No hover states on buttons/links
    - URLs that don't reflect current view state
```

**After agent returns:**
```
TaskUpdate:
- taskId: [research task ID]
- status: "completed"
- metadata: {
    "pageTypesResearched": [count],
    "conventionsDocumented": [count],
    "antiPatternsIdentified": [count]
  }
```

Include UX expectations in workflows so the executor knows what to verify for each page type.

### Phase 5: Generate Workflows

**Create workflow generation task:**
```
TaskCreate:
- subject: "Generate: Workflow Drafts"
- description: |
    Generate [N] workflow drafts based on exploration and UX research.
    Core: [count], Feature: [count], Edge Case: [count]
- activeForm: "Generating workflow drafts"

TaskUpdate:
- taskId: [generate task ID]
- addBlockedBy: [main task ID]
- status: "in_progress"
```

For each journey, create a workflow with this structure:

```markdown
## Workflow: [Descriptive Name]

> [Brief description of what this workflow tests and why it matters]

1. [Top-level step]
   - [Substep with specific detail]
   - [Substep with expected outcome]
2. [Next top-level step]
   - [Substep]
3. Verify [expected final state]
```

**Guidelines for writing steps:**
- Be specific: "Click the blue 'Add Guest' button in the toolbar" not "Click add"
- Include expected outcomes: "Verify the modal appears" not just "Open modal"
- Use consistent language: Navigate, Click, Type, Verify, Drag, Select
- Group related actions under numbered steps with substeps
- Include wait conditions where timing matters

### Phase 6: Organize & Write

**Mark generation task as complete:**
```
TaskUpdate:
- taskId: [generate task ID]
- status: "completed"
- metadata: {
    "workflowsGenerated": [count],
    "totalSteps": [count],
    "coreWorkflows": [list of names],
    "featureWorkflows": [list of names],
    "edgeCaseWorkflows": [list of names]
  }
```

**Update main task for organization phase:**
```
TaskUpdate:
- taskId: [main task ID]
- activeForm: "Organizing workflows"
```

Structure the final document:

```markdown
# Browser Workflows

> Auto-generated workflow documentation for [App Name]
> Last updated: [Date]

## Quick Reference

| Workflow | Purpose | Steps |
|----------|---------|-------|
| [Name] | [Brief] | [Count] |

---

## Core Workflows

### Workflow: [Name]
...

## Feature Workflows

### Workflow: [Name]
...

## Edge Case Workflows

### Workflow: [Name]
...
```

**Do not write to file yet - proceed to Phase 7 for user approval first.**

### Phase 7: Review with User (REQUIRED)

**This step is mandatory. Do not write the final file without user approval.**

**Create approval task:**
```
TaskCreate:
- subject: "Approval: User Review #1"
- description: |
    Present workflows to user for approval.
    Workflows: [count]
    Awaiting user decision.
- activeForm: "Awaiting user approval"

TaskUpdate:
- taskId: [approval task ID]
- addBlockedBy: [main task ID]
- status: "in_progress"
```

After generating the workflows, use `AskUserQuestion` to get explicit approval:

1. **Present a summary** to the user:
   - Total workflows generated (list each by name)
   - Features/areas covered
   - Any gaps or areas you couldn't fully cover
   - Anything that needs manual verification

2. **Use AskUserQuestion** to ask:
   - "Do these workflows cover all the key user journeys?"
   - Provide options: Approve / Add more workflows / Modify existing / Start over

3. **If user wants additions or changes:**

   **Update approval task as needing changes:**
   ```
   TaskUpdate:
   - taskId: [approval task ID]
   - subject: "Approval: User Review #1 - changes requested"
   - status: "completed"
   - metadata: {"decision": "changes_requested", "feedback": "[user feedback]"}
   ```

   **Create new approval task for next round:**
   ```
   TaskCreate:
   - subject: "Approval: User Review #2"
   - description: |
       Second review round after changes.
       Changes made: [list of changes]
   - activeForm: "Awaiting user approval (round 2)"
   ```

   - Ask specifically what workflows to add or modify
   - Generate the additional/modified workflows
   - Return to step 1 and present updated summary
   - Repeat until user approves

4. **Only after explicit approval:**

   **Update approval task as approved:**
   ```
   TaskUpdate:
   - taskId: [approval task ID]
   - subject: "Approval: User Review #[N] - approved ✅"
   - status: "completed"
   - metadata: {"decision": "approved", "reviewRounds": [N]}
   ```

   Write to `/workflows/browser-workflows.md`

**Example AskUserQuestion usage:**

```
Question: "I've identified [N] workflows covering [areas]. Do these look complete?"
Options:
- "Yes, looks good - write the file"
- "Add more workflows"
- "Modify some workflows"
- "Let me describe what's missing"
```

If user selects "Add more" or "Modify", follow up with another question asking for specifics before proceeding.

### Phase 8: Write File and Complete

**Create write task:**
```
TaskCreate:
- subject: "Write: browser-workflows.md"
- description: "Write approved workflows to file"
- activeForm: "Writing workflow file"

TaskUpdate:
- taskId: [write task ID]
- status: "in_progress"
```

**Write the file to `/workflows/browser-workflows.md`**

**Mark write task as complete:**
```
TaskUpdate:
- taskId: [write task ID]
- status: "completed"
- metadata: {"outputPath": "/workflows/browser-workflows.md", "workflowCount": [N]}
```

**Mark main task as complete:**
```
TaskUpdate:
- taskId: [main task ID]
- status: "completed"
- metadata: {
    "outputPath": "/workflows/browser-workflows.md",
    "workflowCount": [N],
    "reviewRounds": [N],
    "explorationAgents": 3,
    "uxResearch": true
  }
```

**Final summary from task data:**
```
## Browser Workflows Generated

**File:** /workflows/browser-workflows.md
**Workflows:** [count from task metadata]
**Review rounds:** [count from approval task metadata]

### Exploration Summary
- Routes found: [from explore task metadata]
- Components found: [from explore task metadata]
- Data entities: [from explore task metadata]

### Workflows Created
[List from generate task metadata]

The workflows are ready to be executed with the browser-workflow-executor skill.
```

### Session Recovery

If resuming from an interrupted session:

**Recovery decision tree:**
```
TaskList shows:
├── Main task in_progress, no explore tasks
│   └── Start Phase 2 (exploration)
├── Main task in_progress, some explore tasks completed
│   └── Check which agents finished, spawn remaining
├── Main task in_progress, all explore tasks completed, no research task
│   └── Start Phase 4 (UX research)
├── Main task in_progress, research completed, no generate task
│   └── Start Phase 5 (generate workflows)
├── Main task in_progress, generate completed, no approval task
│   └── Start Phase 7 (user review)
├── Main task in_progress, approval task in_progress
│   └── Present summary to user again
├── Main task in_progress, approval completed (approved), no write task
│   └── Start Phase 8 (write file)
├── Main task completed
│   └── Show final summary
└── No tasks exist
    └── Fresh start (Phase 1)
```

**Resuming with partial exploration:**
If some exploration agents completed but others didn't:
1. Read completed agent findings from task metadata
2. Spawn only the missing agents
3. Combine all findings when all complete

**Always inform user when resuming:**
```
Resuming workflow generation session:
- Exploration: [N]/3 agents complete
- UX Research: [complete/pending]
- Workflows generated: [count or "pending"]
- Approval: [status]
- Resuming: [next action]
```

## Workflow Writing Standards

**Step Types:**

| Action | Format | Example |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Navigation | Navigate to [URL/page] | Navigate to the dashboard |
| Click | Click [specific element] | Click the "Save" button |
| Type | Type "[text]" in [field] | Type "john@email.com" in the email field |
| Select | Select "[option]" from [dropdown] | Select "Round" from table shape dropdown |
| Drag | Drag [element] to [target] | Drag guest card onto table |
| Verify | Verify [expected state] | Verify success toast appears |
| Wait | Wait for [condition] | Wait for loading spinner to disappear |

## Automation-Friendly Workflow Guidelines

When writing workflows, consider what can and cannot be automated by Claude-in-Chrome:

### Prefer UI Actions Over Keyboard Shortcuts

**Instead of:**
```markdown
- Press Cmd+Z to undo
- Press Cmd+S to save
- Press Delete to remove
```

**Write:**
```markdown
- Click the Undo button in toolbar, OR press Cmd+Z
- Click the Save button, OR press Cmd+S
- Click the Delete button, OR press Delete key
```

### Mark Non-Automatable Steps

Use `[MANUAL]` tag for steps that require manual verification:

```markdown
3. Grant camera permission
   - [MANUAL] Click "Allow" on browser permission prompt
   - Note: Browser permission dialogs cannot be automated

4. Download the report
   - [MANUAL] Click "Download PDF" and verify file saves
   - Note: File download dialogs cannot be automated
```

### Known Automation Limitations

These interactions **cannot** be automated and should include `[MANUAL]` tags or UI alternatives:

| Limitation | Example | Recommendation |
|------------|---------|----------------|
| Keyboard shortcuts | Cmd+Z, Cmd+C, Cmd+V | Provide button alternative |
| Native dialogs | alert(), confirm(), prompt() | Skip or mark [MANUAL] |
| File operations | Upload/download dialogs | Mark [MANUAL] |
| Browser permissions | Camera, location prompts | Mark [MANUAL], pre-configure |
| Pop-up windows | OAuth, new window opens | Document as [MANUAL] |
| Print dialogs | Print preview | Mark [MANUAL] |

### Include Prerequisites for Automation

When workflows require specific setup:

```markdown
## Workflow: Upload Profile Photo

**Prerequisites for automation:**
- Browser must have camera/file permissions pre-configured
- Test file should be accessible at known path

> Tests uploading a new profile photo.

1. Open profile settings
   ...
```

**Substep Format:**
- Use bullet points under numbered steps
- Include specific selectors or descriptions
- Note expected intermediate states

**Example Workflow:**

```markdown
## Workflow: Create New Event with Tables and Guests

> Tests the complete flow of setting up a new seating arrangement from scratch.

1. Enter the application
   - Navigate to https://app.example.com
   - Click "Get Started" or "Try Demo" button
   - Verify canvas view loads with empty state

2. Add a table to the canvas
   - Click "Add Table" button in toolbar
   - Select "Round" from shape options
   - Verify table appears on canvas
   - Verify table shows "0/8 seats" indicator

3. Add a guest
   - Click "Add Guest" button
   - Type "John Smith" in name field
   - Press Enter or click Save
   - Verify guest appears in guest list sidebar

4. Assign guest to table
   - Drag "John Smith" from guest list
   - Drop onto the round table
   - Verify guest name appears at table
   - Verify seat count updates to "1/8 seats"

5. Verify final state
   - Verify guest is no longer in unassigned list
   - Verify table shows assigned guest
   - Verify canvas can be zoomed and panned
```

## Handling Updates

When updating existing workflows:

1. **Preserve working workflows** - Don't rewrite what works
2. **Mark deprecated steps** - If UI changed, note what's outdated
3. **Add new workflows** - Append new features as new workflows
4. **Version notes** - Add changelog comments for significant changes

## Browser/Web Platform UX Anti-Patterns

When generating workflows, include UX verification steps that check for these common anti-patterns where web apps incorrectly use native mobile conventions or miss web-specific requirements:

### Navigation Anti-Patterns
| Anti-Pattern | Web Convention | What to Check |
|--------------|----------------|---------------|
| Gesture-only navigation | Click + gesture alternatives | All navigation should work with mouse clicks |
| Breaking back button | URL-based navigation | Browser back button should work intuitively |
| No URL for states | Deep linkable URLs | Important states should have shareable URLs |
| Tab bar at bottom | Top navigation or sidebar | Bottom tab bars are mobile patterns, not web |
| Swipe-only carousels | Arrow buttons + indicators | Carousels need visible click controls |

### Interaction Anti-Patterns
| Anti-Pattern | Web Convention | What to Check |
|--------------|----------------|---------------|
| Missing hover states | Clear hover feedback | All interactive elements need hover indication |
| No focus indicators | Visible focus rings | Keyboard navigation needs visible focus states |
| Touch-sized-only buttons | Standard web button sizes | Buttons can be smaller than 44pt on web |
| Pull-to-refresh | Refresh button or auto-refresh | Web doesn't support native pull-to-refresh |
| Long press menus | Right-click or visible menu buttons | Context menus should use right-click on web |

### Visual Anti-Patterns
| Anti-Pattern | Web Convention | What to Check |
|--------------|----------------|---------------|
| Full-screen modals everywhere | Inline expansion or sized modals | Web modals typically don't need full-screen |
| iOS/Android specific styling | Platform-agnostic web design | Avoid native mobile component styling |
| No responsive breakpoints | Responsive design | Layout should adapt to viewport width |
| Mobile-only viewport | Desktop-first or responsive | Should work well at 1200px+ widths |
| App-like splash screens | Immediate content loading | Web should show content quickly, not splash |

### Component Anti-Patterns
| Anti-Pattern | Web Convention | What to Check |
|--------------|----------------|---------------|
| Native mobile pickers | HTML select or custom dropdowns | Use web-native form components |
| Action sheets sliding up | Dropdown menus or modals | Use web-appropriate menu patterns |
| iOS-style toggle switches | Checkboxes or web-styled toggles | Consider web conventions for boolean inputs |
| Floating bottom bars | Fixed headers or inline CTAs | Sticky bottom bars can feel app-like |
| Edge swipe gestures | Visible navigation buttons | Don't rely on edge swipes for critical actions |

### Accessibility Anti-Patterns
| Anti-Pattern | Web Convention | What to Check |
|--------------|----------------|---------------|
| No keyboard navigation | Full keyboard support | All features accessible via keyboard |
| Missing ARIA labels | Proper accessibility markup | Screen readers should understand the UI |
| Color-only indicators | Color + icon/text indicators | Don't rely solely on color for meaning |
| Auto-playing media | User-initiated playback | Media should not auto-play with sound |
| Trapped focus in modals | Proper focus management | Focus should be trapped correctly in modals |

### Workflow UX Verification Steps

When writing workflows, include verification steps for platform appropriateness:

```markdown
## Workflow: [Name]

...

6. Verify web platform conventions
   - Verify all interactive elements have hover states
   - Verify browser back button works correctly
   - Verify keyboard navigation is possible
   - Verify layout is responsive (try different viewport widths)
   - Verify URLs are shareable/deep-linkable for important states
```
