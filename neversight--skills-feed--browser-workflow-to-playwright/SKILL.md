# Browser Workflow to Playwright Skill

You are a senior QA automation engineer. Your job is to translate human-readable browser workflow markdown files into Playwright E2E test files that can run in CI.

## Task List Integration

**CRITICAL:** This skill uses Claude Code's task list system for progress tracking and session recovery. You MUST use TaskCreate, TaskUpdate, and TaskList tools throughout execution.

### Why Task Lists Matter Here
- **Selector mapping progress:** Track which workflows have selectors resolved
- **Ambiguous selector tracking:** Each ambiguous selector becomes a blocking task awaiting user input
- **Translation progress:** User sees "3/5 workflows translated"
- **Session recovery:** If interrupted, know which selectors were found and which need resolution
- **Code generation tracking:** Track test generation and user approval

### Task Hierarchy
```
[Main Task] "Convert: Browser Workflows to Playwright"
  └── [Parse Task] "Parse: browser-workflows.md"
  └── [Check Task] "Check: Existing tests"
  └── [Selector Task] "Selectors: Find for all workflows" (agent)
      └── [Ambiguous Task] "Resolve: Settings button selector" (user input needed)
      └── [Ambiguous Task] "Resolve: Submit button selector" (user input needed)
  └── [Generate Task] "Generate: Playwright test file" (agent)
  └── [Approval Task] "Approval: Review generated tests"
  └── [Write Task] "Write: e2e/browser-workflows.spec.ts"
```

### Session Recovery Check
**At the start of this skill, always check for existing tasks:**
```
1. Call TaskList to check for existing conversion tasks
2. If a "Convert: Browser Workflows to Playwright" task exists with status in_progress:
   - Check if parsing completed
   - Check if selector discovery completed (read metadata for mappings)
   - Check for pending ambiguous selector tasks awaiting user input
   - Check if code generation completed
   - Resume from appropriate phase
3. If no tasks exist, proceed with fresh execution
```

## The Translation Pipeline

```
/workflows/browser-workflows.md     →     e2e/browser-workflows.spec.ts
     (Human-readable)                         (Playwright tests)
```

## When to Use This Skill

Use when:
- User has refined browser workflows via `browser-workflow-executor`
- User wants to promote workflows to CI
- User says "convert to playwright", "generate CI tests", "automate these workflows"

## Process

### Phase 1: Read and Parse Workflows

**Create the main conversion task:**
```
TaskCreate:
- subject: "Convert: Browser Workflows to Playwright"
- description: |
    Convert browser workflows markdown to Playwright E2E tests.
    Source: /workflows/browser-workflows.md
    Target: e2e/browser-workflows.spec.ts
- activeForm: "Parsing workflows"

TaskUpdate:
- taskId: [main task ID]
- status: "in_progress"
```

**Create parse task:**
```
TaskCreate:
- subject: "Parse: browser-workflows.md"
- description: "Read and parse workflow file"
- activeForm: "Parsing workflows"

TaskUpdate:
- taskId: [parse task ID]
- addBlockedBy: [main task ID]
- status: "in_progress"
```

1. Read `/workflows/browser-workflows.md`
2. If file doesn't exist, inform user and stop
3. Parse all workflows (each starts with `## Workflow:` or `### Workflow:`)
4. For each workflow, extract:
   - Name and description
   - URL (if specified)
   - Numbered steps and substeps
   - Any `[MANUAL]` tagged steps

**Mark parse task complete with workflow inventory:**
```
TaskUpdate:
- taskId: [parse task ID]
- status: "completed"
- metadata: {
    "workflowCount": [N],
    "workflows": [list of names],
    "totalSteps": [count],
    "manualSteps": [count]
  }
```

### Phase 2: Check for Existing Tests

**Create check task:**
```
TaskCreate:
- subject: "Check: Existing tests"
- description: "Check for existing Playwright tests and determine diff"
- activeForm: "Checking existing tests"

TaskUpdate:
- taskId: [check task ID]
- addBlockedBy: [main task ID]
- status: "in_progress"
```

1. Look for existing `e2e/browser-workflows.spec.ts`
2. If exists, parse it to find:
   - Which workflows are already translated
   - Timestamps or version markers
3. Determine which workflows need updating (diff strategy):
   - New workflows → Add
   - Modified workflows → Update
   - Removed workflows → Ask user whether to remove tests

**Mark check task complete with diff summary:**
```
TaskUpdate:
- taskId: [check task ID]
- status: "completed"
- metadata: {
    "existingTestFile": true/false,
    "existingWorkflows": [list of names],
    "toAdd": [list of new workflow names],
    "toUpdate": [list of modified workflow names],
    "toRemove": [list of removed workflow names],
    "hasCustomCode": true/false
  }
```

### Phase 3: Explore Codebase for Selectors [DELEGATE TO AGENT]

**Purpose:** For each workflow step, explore the codebase to find reliable selectors. Delegate this to an Explore agent to save context.

**Create selector discovery task:**
```
TaskCreate:
- subject: "Selectors: Find for all workflows"
- description: |
    Find Playwright selectors for [N] workflows, [M] total steps.
    Priority: data-testid > aria-label > role+text > :has-text > class > CSS path
- activeForm: "Discovering selectors"

TaskUpdate:
- taskId: [selector task ID]
- addBlockedBy: [main task ID]
- status: "in_progress"
```

**Use the Task tool to spawn an Explore agent:**

```
Task tool parameters:
- subagent_type: "Explore"
- model: "sonnet" (balance of speed and thoroughness)
- prompt: |
    You are finding reliable Playwright selectors for browser workflow steps.

    ## Workflows to Find Selectors For
    [Include parsed workflow steps that need selectors]

    ## What to Search For

    For each step, find the BEST available selector using this priority:

    **Selector Priority (best to worst):**
    1. data-testid="..."     ← Most stable, explicitly for testing
    2. aria-label="..."      ← Accessible and meaningful
    3. role="..." + text     ← Semantic and readable
    4. :has-text("...")      ← Works but fragile if text changes
    5. .class-name           ← Works but fragile if styles change
    6. Complex CSS path      ← Last resort, very fragile

    ## Search Strategy

    1. **Component Selectors**
       - Use Grep to search for React/Vue component names mentioned in steps
       - Find data-testid attributes: `data-testid=`
       - Find CSS class names in component files

    2. **Text-Based Selectors**
       - Match button text to actual button implementations
       - Find aria-labels: `aria-label=`
       - Locate placeholder text for inputs

    3. **Structural Selectors**
       - Identify form structures for input fields
       - Find modal/dialog patterns
       - Locate navigation elements

    ## Return Format

    Return a structured mapping:
    ```
    ## Selector Mapping

    ### Workflow: [Name]

    | Step | Element Description | Recommended Selector | Confidence | Notes |
    |------|---------------------|---------------------|------------|-------|
    | 1.1  | Login button        | [data-testid="login-btn"] | High | Found in LoginForm.tsx:45 |
    | 1.2  | Email input         | input[name="email"] | High | Found in LoginForm.tsx:23 |
    | 2.1  | Submit button       | button:has-text("Submit") | Medium | No data-testid, using text |

    ### Ambiguous Selectors (need user input)
    - Step 3.2 "settings button": Found multiple matches:
      1. [data-testid="settings-icon"] in Header.tsx
      2. [data-testid="settings-btn"] in Sidebar.tsx
      - Recommendation: Ask user which one

    ### Missing Selectors (not found)
    - Step 4.1 "export dropdown": Could not find element, may need manual inspection
    ```
```

**After agent returns:**

**Update selector task with findings:**
```
TaskUpdate:
- taskId: [selector task ID]
- status: "completed"
- metadata: {
    "selectorsFound": [count],
    "highConfidence": [count],
    "mediumConfidence": [count],
    "ambiguous": [count],
    "missing": [count]
  }
```

**For each ambiguous selector, create a resolution task:**
```
For each ambiguous selector:

TaskCreate:
- subject: "Resolve: [element description] selector"
- description: |
    Step [N.M]: "[step text]"
    Found multiple matches:
    1. [selector option 1] (in [file])
    2. [selector option 2] (in [file])
    Awaiting user decision.
- activeForm: "Awaiting selector choice"

TaskUpdate:
- taskId: [resolve task ID]
- addBlockedBy: [selector task ID]
- status: "in_progress"
```

**Ask user to resolve ambiguous selectors:**
Use `AskUserQuestion` for each ambiguous selector task. After user responds:
```
TaskUpdate:
- taskId: [resolve task ID]
- status: "completed"
- metadata: {"chosenSelector": "[user's choice]", "reason": "[if provided]"}
```

Use the selector mapping to generate accurate Playwright test code. For missing selectors, flag for manual verification with TODO comments.

### Phase 4: Map Actions to Playwright

Translate natural language steps to Playwright commands:

| Workflow Language | Playwright Code |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| "Navigate to [URL]" | `await page.goto('URL')` |
| "Click [element]" | `await page.locator(selector).click()` |
| "Tap [element]" | `await page.locator(selector).click()` |
| "Type '[text]' in [field]" | `await page.locator(selector).fill('text')` |
| "Press Enter" | `await page.keyboard.press('Enter')` |
| "Wait for [element]" | `await expect(page.locator(selector)).toBeVisible()` |
| "Verify [condition]" | `await expect(...).toBe...(...)` |
| "Scroll to [element]" | `await page.locator(selector).scrollIntoViewIfNeeded()` |
| "Hover over [element]" | `await page.locator(selector).hover()` |
| "Select '[option]' from [dropdown]" | `await page.locator(selector).selectOption('option')` |
| "Upload [file]" | `await page.locator(selector).setInputFiles('path')` |
| "Wait [N] seconds" | `await page.waitForTimeout(N * 1000)` |
| "Take screenshot" | `await page.screenshot({ path: '...' })` |

### Phase 5: Handle Untranslatable Steps

For steps that cannot be automated:

**[MANUAL] tagged steps:**
```typescript
test.skip('Step N: [description]', async () => {
  // MANUAL: This step requires human intervention
  // Original: "[step text]"
  // Reason: [why it can't be automated]
});
```

**Ambiguous selectors:**
```typescript
// TODO: Selector needs verification - found multiple matches
// Options found:
//   1. [data-testid="btn-submit"]
//   2. button:has-text("Submit")
// Using best guess, please verify:
await page.locator('[data-testid="btn-submit"]').click();
```

**Platform-specific steps:**
```typescript
test.skip('Step N: [description]', async () => {
  // SKIP: This step is browser-specific and tested via browser-workflow-executor
  // Original: "[step text]"
});
```

### Phase 6: Generate Test File [DELEGATE TO AGENT]

**Purpose:** Generate the Playwright test file from the parsed workflows and selector mapping. Delegate to an agent for focused code generation.

**Create code generation task:**
```
TaskCreate:
- subject: "Generate: Playwright test file"
- description: |
    Generate e2e/browser-workflows.spec.ts from workflows and selector mapping.
    Workflows: [count]
    Selectors resolved: [count]
    Ambiguous resolved: [count]
- activeForm: "Generating Playwright tests"

TaskUpdate:
- taskId: [generate task ID]
- addBlockedBy: [main task ID]
- status: "in_progress"
```

**Use the Task tool to spawn a code generation agent:**

```
Task tool parameters:
- subagent_type: "general-purpose"
- model: "sonnet" (good balance for code generation)
- prompt: |
    You are generating a Playwright E2E test file from browser workflow specifications.

    ## Input Data

    **Workflows:**
    [Include parsed workflow data with names, steps, substeps]

    **Selector Mapping:**
    [Include selector mapping from Phase 3 agent]

    **Existing Test File (if updating):**
    [Include existing test content if this is an update, or "None - new file"]

    ## Your Task

    Generate `e2e/browser-workflows.spec.ts` following this structure:

    1. **File header** with generation timestamp and instructions
    2. **Imports** from @playwright/test
    3. **Test.describe block** for each workflow
    4. **Test.beforeEach** for common setup (navigation)
    5. **Individual tests** for each step
    6. **test.skip** for [MANUAL] steps with clear comments

    ## Code Style Requirements

    - Use the recommended selectors from the mapping
    - Add comments for each substep
    - Include setup code in tests that need prior state
    - Mark ambiguous selectors with TODO comments
    - Follow Playwright best practices

    ## Handle Special Cases

    - [MANUAL] steps → `test.skip()` with explanation
    - Ambiguous selectors → Use best guess + TODO comment
    - Missing selectors → Use descriptive text selector + TODO
    - Steps needing prior state → Add setup within test

    ## Return Format

    Return the complete test file content ready to write.
    Also return a summary:
    ```
    ## Generation Summary
    - Workflows: [count]
    - Total tests: [count]
    - Skipped (manual): [count]
    - TODOs for review: [count]
    ```
```

**After agent returns:**

**Update generation task with summary:**
```
TaskUpdate:
- taskId: [generate task ID]
- status: "completed"
- metadata: {
    "workflowsTranslated": [count],
    "totalTests": [count],
    "skippedManual": [count],
    "todosForReview": [count],
    "linesOfCode": [count]
  }
```

Review any TODOs with the user before writing the file.

Create `e2e/browser-workflows.spec.ts` with this structure:

```typescript
/**
 * Browser Workflow Tests
 *
 * Auto-generated from /workflows/browser-workflows.md
 * Generated: [timestamp]
 *
 * To regenerate: Run browser-workflow-to-playwright skill
 * To update workflows: Edit /workflows/browser-workflows.md and re-run
 */

import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

// ============================================================================
// WORKFLOW: [Workflow Name]
// Generated from: browser-workflows.md
// Last updated: [timestamp]
// ============================================================================

test.describe('Workflow: [Name]', () => {
  test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
    // Common setup for this workflow
    await page.goto('[base-url]');
  });

  test('Step 1: [Description]', async ({ page }) => {
    // Substep: [substep description]
    await page.locator('[selector]').click();

    // Substep: [substep description]
    await expect(page.locator('[selector]')).toBeVisible();
  });

  test('Step 2: [Description]', async ({ page }) => {
    // ... continues
  });

  test.skip('Step 3: [MANUAL - Description]', async () => {
    // MANUAL: [reason]
  });
});

// ============================================================================
// WORKFLOW: [Next Workflow Name]
// ============================================================================

test.describe('Workflow: [Next Name]', () => {
  // ...
});
```

### Phase 7: Handle Updates (Diff Strategy)

When updating existing tests:

1. **Parse existing test file** to extract:
   - Workflow names and their test blocks
   - Any custom modifications (marked with `// CUSTOM:`)

2. **Compare with workflow markdown:**
   - Hash each workflow's content to detect changes
   - Track workflow names for additions/removals

3. **Update strategy:**
   ```
   Workflow in MD | Workflow in Tests | Action
   ---------------|-------------------|--------
   Present        | Missing           | ADD new test block
   Present        | Present (same)    | SKIP (no change)
   Present        | Present (diff)    | UPDATE test block
   Missing        | Present           | ASK user: remove or keep?
   ```

4. **Preserve custom code:**
   - Look for `// CUSTOM:` comments
   - Keep custom assertions or setup
   - Warn user if custom code conflicts with updates

### Phase 8: Review with User

**Create approval task:**
```
TaskCreate:
- subject: "Approval: Review generated tests"
- description: |
    Review generated Playwright tests before writing.
    Tests: [count]
    TODOs: [count]
    Awaiting user approval.
- activeForm: "Awaiting test approval"

TaskUpdate:
- taskId: [approval task ID]
- addBlockedBy: [main task ID]
- status: "in_progress"
```

Before writing the file:

1. **Show translation summary (from task metadata):**
   ```
   Workflows to translate: 5 (from parse task metadata)
   - Workflow A: 8 steps (7 translated, 1 manual)
   - Workflow B: 6 steps (6 translated)
   - Workflow C: 10 steps (8 translated, 2 need selector help)

   Selectors: [from selector task metadata]
   - High confidence: [count]
   - Medium confidence: [count]
   - Resolved by user: [count from resolve tasks]

   Tests generated: [from generate task metadata]
   - Total tests: [count]
   - Skipped (manual): [count]
   - TODOs for review: [count]
   ```

2. **Any remaining ambiguous selectors** should have been resolved via resolve tasks in Phase 3.
   If any were skipped, ask now.

3. **Confirm before writing:**
   - Show diff if updating existing file (from check task metadata)
   - List any workflows being added/removed
   - Get explicit approval

**After user approves:**
```
TaskUpdate:
- taskId: [approval task ID]
- status: "completed"
- metadata: {"decision": "approved"}
```

**Create write task and write the file:**
```
TaskCreate:
- subject: "Write: e2e/browser-workflows.spec.ts"
- description: "Write approved Playwright test file"
- activeForm: "Writing test file"

TaskUpdate:
- taskId: [write task ID]
- status: "in_progress"
```

**Write the file to `e2e/browser-workflows.spec.ts`**

**Mark write task complete:**
```
TaskUpdate:
- taskId: [write task ID]
- status: "completed"
- metadata: {"outputPath": "e2e/browser-workflows.spec.ts", "testsWritten": [count]}
```

**Mark main task complete:**
```
TaskUpdate:
- taskId: [main task ID]
- status: "completed"
- metadata: {
    "outputPath": "e2e/browser-workflows.spec.ts",
    "workflowsTranslated": [count],
    "totalTests": [count],
    "skippedManual": [count],
    "selectorsResolved": [count],
    "ambiguousResolved": [count]
  }
```

**Final summary from task data:**
```
## Playwright Tests Generated

**Output:** e2e/browser-workflows.spec.ts
**Workflows:** [from parse task] → [from generate task] tests

### Translation Summary
| Workflow | Steps | Tests | Manual | TODOs |
|----------|-------|-------|--------|-------|
[Generated from task metadata]

### Selector Resolution
- High confidence: [from selector task]
- User-resolved: [count of completed resolve tasks]
- Missing (TODO): [from selector task]

### Next Steps
1. Run tests: `npx playwright test e2e/browser-workflows.spec.ts`
2. Review any TODO comments in the file
3. Add to CI pipeline

The tests are ready to run with Playwright.
```

### Session Recovery

If resuming from an interrupted session:

**Recovery decision tree:**
```
TaskList shows:
├── Main task in_progress, no parse task
│   └── Start Phase 1 (parse workflows)
├── Main task in_progress, parse completed, no check task
│   └── Start Phase 2 (check existing tests)
├── Main task in_progress, check completed, no selector task
│   └── Start Phase 3 (selector discovery)
├── Main task in_progress, selector completed, resolve tasks pending
│   └── Ask user to resolve remaining ambiguous selectors
├── Main task in_progress, all resolve tasks completed, no generate task
│   └── Start Phase 6 (code generation)
├── Main task in_progress, generate completed, no approval task
│   └── Start Phase 8 (user review)
├── Main task in_progress, approval completed, no write task
│   └── Write the file
├── Main task completed
│   └── Show final summary
└── No tasks exist
    └── Fresh start (Phase 1)
```

**Resuming with partial selector resolution:**
If some ambiguous selector tasks are completed but others pending:
1. Read completed resolve tasks to get user's selector choices
2. Present remaining ambiguous selectors to user
3. Continue after all resolved

**Always inform user when resuming:**
```
Resuming Playwright conversion session:
- Workflows parsed: [count from parse task]
- Existing tests: [from check task]
- Selectors found: [from selector task]
- Ambiguous resolved: [count completed resolve tasks]/[total]
- Code generated: [yes/no from generate task]
- Resuming: [next action]
```

## Selector Discovery Prompts

When exploring the codebase, use these search patterns:

**For buttons:**
```
Search: "button" + "[text from workflow]"
Look for: data-testid, aria-label, className, onClick handler name
```

**For inputs:**
```
Search: "input" + "[field name]" OR "TextField" + "[label]"
Look for: name, id, placeholder, aria-label, data-testid
```

**For modals/dialogs:**
```
Search: "Modal" OR "Dialog" + "[title from workflow]"
Look for: Component name, aria-labelledby, className
```

**For navigation:**
```
Search: "Link" OR "NavLink" OR "router" + "[destination]"
Look for: href, to prop, data-testid
```

## Example Translation

**Workflow markdown:**
```markdown
## Workflow: User Login

> Tests the login flow for existing users.

**URL:** http://localhost:5173/login

1. Navigate to login page
   - Open the login page
   - Verify login form is visible

2. Enter credentials
   - Type "test@example.com" in email field
   - Type "password123" in password field

3. Submit login
   - Click the "Sign In" button
   - Wait for redirect to dashboard
   - Verify user name appears in header
```

**Generated Playwright:**
```typescript
test.describe('Workflow: User Login', () => {
  test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto('http://localhost:5173/login');
  });

  test('Step 1: Navigate to login page', async ({ page }) => {
    // Substep: Open the login page
    // (handled in beforeEach)

    // Substep: Verify login form is visible
    await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="login-form"]')).toBeVisible();
  });

  test('Step 2: Enter credentials', async ({ page }) => {
    // Substep: Type "test@example.com" in email field
    await page.locator('input[name="email"]').fill('test@example.com');

    // Substep: Type "password123" in password field
    await page.locator('input[name="password"]').fill('password123');
  });

  test('Step 3: Submit login', async ({ page }) => {
    // Setup: Fill credentials first (tests are independent)
    await page.locator('input[name="email"]').fill('test@example.com');
    await page.locator('input[name="password"]').fill('password123');

    // Substep: Click the "Sign In" button
    await page.locator('button[type="submit"]:has-text("Sign In")').click();

    // Substep: Wait for redirect to dashboard
    await expect(page).toHaveURL(/\/dashboard/);

    // Substep: Verify user name appears in header
    await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="user-name"]')).toBeVisible();
  });
});
```

## Test Independence

Since each step becomes a separate test, ensure tests are independent:

1. **Each test should set up its own state** (don't rely on previous test)
2. **Use `test.beforeEach`** for common setup
3. **Consider test.describe.serial** if order truly matters (discouraged)
4. **Add setup steps within tests** that need prior state

## Error Handling

If translation fails:

1. **Missing workflow file:** Inform user, suggest running generator first
2. **Unparseable workflow:** Show which workflow failed, ask for clarification
3. **No selectors found:** List the step, ask user for selector
4. **Conflicting selectors:** Show options, let user choose
5. **Playwright not configured:** Offer to set up Playwright config

## Output Files

Primary output:
- `e2e/browser-workflows.spec.ts` - The generated test file

Optional outputs:
- `e2e/browser-workflows.selectors.ts` - Extracted selectors for reuse
- `.claude/workflow-test-mapping.json` - Mapping of workflows to tests for diff tracking
