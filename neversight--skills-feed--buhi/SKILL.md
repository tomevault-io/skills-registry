description: Audible notifications for Claude Code tasks and user confirmations. Use this skill when the user wants to (1) test the notification sound by running /buhi, (2) hear the notification sound manually, or (3) get help with configuring automatic sound playback on task completion and user confirmation requests using Claude Code's hook system (Stop hook and PreToolUse hook with AskUserQuestion matcher). The skill automatically detects whether it's installed globally or locally and configures the appropriate settings.json file with absolute paths. Use when this capability is needed.

# Buhi - Audible Notifications

Play audible notifications when Claude Code tasks complete and when user confirmation is requested.

## Overview

This skill provides two key capabilities:

1. **Manual sound playback** - The `/buhi` command plays a "Buhi" sound effect (cute pig sound) to test notifications or trigger manually
2. **Automatic notifications** - Integration with Claude Code's hook system to play sounds when:
   - Tasks complete (Stop hook)
   - User confirmation is requested (PreToolUse hook with AskUserQuestion matcher) - such as Yes/No prompts, multiple choice selections, etc.

## The `/buhi` Command

When invoked, this command:

1. Detects whether the skill is installed globally (`~/.claude/skills/buhi/`) or locally (`.claude/skills/buhi/`)
2. Automatically configures hooks in the appropriate `settings.json` with the correct absolute path:
   - **Stop hook**: Plays sound when tasks complete
   - **PreToolUse hook** (matcher: AskUserQuestion): Plays sound when user confirmation is requested
3. Detects the operating system (macOS, Linux, or Windows)
4. Plays the `buhi.m4a` sound file from the skill directory using the appropriate OS command

This means you only need to run `/buhi` once to set up automatic notifications for both task completions and user confirmations.

### Installation Locations

The skill automatically adapts to where it's installed:

- **Global installation** (`~/.claude/skills/buhi/`): Configures `~/.claude/settings.json` - notifications work for all projects
- **Local installation** (`.claude/skills/buhi/`): Configures `.claude/settings.json` in your project - notifications work only for this project

### Path Detection Logic

When `/buhi` is invoked, it:

1. **Detects installation location** by examining the skill's base directory path:
   - If the base directory is `~/.claude/skills/buhi/` → Global installation
   - If the base directory is `<project>/.claude/skills/buhi/` → Local installation

2. **Determines settings.json path**:
   - Global: `~/.claude/settings.json`
   - Local: `<project>/.claude/settings.json` (two directories up from skill base)

3. **Constructs absolute audio file path**:
   - Uses the skill's base directory path + `/buhi.m4a`
   - This ensures the hook works regardless of the current working directory

4. **Selects audio player based on OS**:
   - macOS: `afplay`
   - Linux: `paplay`
   - Windows: PowerShell `Media.SoundPlayer`

### Implementation

**macOS:**
```bash
afplay <absolute-path-to>/buhi.m4a
```

**Linux:**
```bash
paplay <absolute-path-to>/buhi.m4a
```

**Windows:**
```bash
powershell -c "(New-Object Media.SoundPlayer '<absolute-path-to>/buhi.m4a').PlaySync()"
```

### Usage

Simply run `/buhi` to:
- Test that audio playback is working
- Hear the notification sound
- Verify the skill is installed correctly

## Automatic Notifications

The `/buhi` command automatically configures hooks in the appropriate `settings.json` file. These hooks trigger the notification sound in the following scenarios:

- **Task completion** (Stop hook): When Claude Code finishes executing a task
- **User confirmation** (PreToolUse hook with AskUserQuestion matcher): When Claude asks for your input, such as Yes/No prompts, multiple choice selections, or other confirmations

### Automatic Configuration

Running `/buhi` will:
1. Detect the skill installation location (global or local)
2. Determine the correct `settings.json` path
3. Use the absolute path to the audio file for reliability
4. Create or update both hook configurations with your OS-appropriate audio player

This ensures the notification works regardless of your current working directory.

### Manual Configuration (Optional)

If you need to manually configure or customize the hook, here's what `/buhi` sets up. Note that it uses absolute paths to ensure reliability:

**macOS (Global installation):**
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": [
      {
        "matcher": "",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "afplay ~/.claude/skills/buhi/buhi.m4a"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "AskUserQuestion",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "afplay ~/.claude/skills/buhi/buhi.m4a"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**macOS (Local installation):**
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": [
      {
        "matcher": "",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "afplay /absolute/path/to/project/.claude/skills/buhi/buhi.m4a"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "AskUserQuestion",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "afplay /absolute/path/to/project/.claude/skills/buhi/buhi.m4a"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Linux (Global installation):**
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": [
      {
        "matcher": "",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "paplay ~/.claude/skills/buhi/buhi.m4a"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "AskUserQuestion",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "paplay ~/.claude/skills/buhi/buhi.m4a"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Windows (Global installation):**
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": [
      {
        "matcher": "",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "powershell -c \"(New-Object Media.SoundPlayer '~/.claude/skills/buhi/buhi.m4a').PlaySync()\""
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "AskUserQuestion",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "powershell -c \"(New-Object Media.SoundPlayer '~/.claude/skills/buhi/buhi.m4a').PlaySync()\""
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The `/buhi` command automatically determines your installation type and OS, then configures the appropriate absolute path.

**Important Notes:**
- **Global installation**: Configures `~/.claude/settings.json` - notifications work for all projects
- **Local installation**: Configures `.claude/settings.json` in your project - notifications work only for this project
- If you already have hooks configured, `/buhi` will preserve your existing hooks
- The sound will play in two scenarios (globally or per-project depending on installation):
  - After EVERY task completion (Stop hook)
  - Before EVERY user confirmation request (PreToolUse hook with AskUserQuestion matcher)
- Uses absolute paths to ensure the hook works regardless of your current working directory
- No need to restart Claude Code - hooks are loaded automatically

## Customization

### Adjust Volume

Edit your `settings.json` file and add volume parameters to the hook command:

**macOS example:**
```json
"command": "afplay -v 0.5 /absolute/path/to/buhi.m4a"
```

Volume range: `0.0` (mute) to `1.0` (full volume)

### Use Custom Sound

Replace `buhi.m4a` with your own audio file:

```bash
# For local installation
cp your-sound.m4a .claude/skills/buhi/buhi.m4a

# For global installation
cp your-sound.m4a ~/.claude/skills/buhi/buhi.m4a
```

Or update your `settings.json` to reference a different sound file:

```json
"command": "afplay /path/to/your/custom-sound.m4a"
```

Supported formats: `.m4a`, `.mp3`, `.wav` (varies by OS and audio player)

### Disable Notifications

Remove or comment out the hooks from your `settings.json`:

**For local installation** (`.claude/settings.json`):
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    // "Stop": [...]  // Commented out - disables task completion notifications
    // "PreToolUse": [...]  // Commented out - disables user confirmation notifications
  }
}
```

**For global installation** (`~/.claude/settings.json`):
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    // "Stop": [...]  // Commented out - disables task completion notifications
    // "PreToolUse": [...]  // Commented out - disables user confirmation notifications
  }
}
```

Or delete the hook entries entirely if you have no other hooks configured. You can also disable them individually - for example, keep task completion notifications but disable user confirmation notifications.

## Troubleshooting

### Sound doesn't play when running `/buhi`

1. **Verify skill installation:**
   ```bash
   # For local installation
   ls -la .claude/skills/buhi/buhi.m4a

   # For global installation
   ls -la ~/.claude/skills/buhi/buhi.m4a
   ```

2. **Check system audio player:**
   - macOS: `afplay` is pre-installed
   - Linux: Install PulseAudio (`sudo apt-get install pulseaudio-utils`)
   - Windows: PowerShell SoundPlayer requires Windows 10+

3. **Test playback manually:**
   ```bash
   # macOS (use the appropriate path for your installation)
   afplay ~/.claude/skills/buhi/buhi.m4a

   # Linux
   paplay ~/.claude/skills/buhi/buhi.m4a

   # Windows PowerShell
   (New-Object Media.SoundPlayer '~/.claude/skills/buhi/buhi.m4a').PlaySync()
   ```

### Sound doesn't play on task completion

1. **Verify settings.json was created:**
   ```bash
   # For local installation
   cat .claude/settings.json

   # For global installation
   cat ~/.claude/settings.json
   ```

   If the file doesn't exist, run `/buhi` again to create it.

2. **Verify settings.json syntax:**
   ```bash
   # For local installation
   cat .claude/settings.json | python -m json.tool

   # For global installation
   cat ~/.claude/settings.json | python -m json.tool
   ```

   Or use any JSON validator to ensure the file is valid JSON.

3. **Check hook configuration:**
   - Ensure the Stop hook is properly configured
   - Verify the file path is an absolute path pointing to the audio file
   - Check that the audio file exists at the specified path
   - Confirm the path matches your installation type (global vs local)

4. **Review hook execution:**
   - Check Claude Code output for hook errors
   - Verify the matcher pattern (empty string matches all)
   - Try running the command manually with the exact path from settings.json to test it works

### Multiple OS support

The `/buhi` command automatically detects your operating system and configures the appropriate audio player command. If you switch between different operating systems on the same project, simply run `/buhi` again to update the configuration for your current OS.

## Technical Details

### Audio Players

- **macOS**: Uses `afplay`, Apple's built-in audio file player
- **Linux**: Uses `paplay`, PulseAudio's command-line player (requires pulseaudio-utils package)
- **Windows**: Uses PowerShell's `Media.SoundPlayer` class (built into .NET Framework)

### Hook System

The hooks trigger in the following scenarios:

**Stop hook** triggers when:
- Claude Code finishes executing a task
- Background operations complete
- Agent processes stop

**PreToolUse hook** (with AskUserQuestion matcher) triggers when:
- Claude asks for user confirmation (Yes/No prompts)
- Claude presents multiple choice options
- Any user input is requested via the AskUserQuestion tool

The `matcher` field accepts regex patterns to filter which events trigger the hook. An empty string matches all events.

### File Format

The included `buhi.m4a` file is:
- Format: M4A (MPEG-4 Audio)
- Codec: AAC
- Compatible with all three supported platforms
- Small file size for quick playback

## Use Cases

- **Long-running builds**: Get notified when compilation finishes without watching the terminal
- **Test suites**: Hear when extensive test runs complete
- **Code generation**: Know when large file transformations finish
- **Background tasks**: Stay focused on other work while waiting for operations
- **User confirmation alerts**: Get notified when Claude needs your input for decisions (Yes/No, multiple choice, etc.)
- **Multi-tasking**: Switch to other applications while working with Claude, and get alerted when your attention is needed
- **Accessibility**: Audio feedback for vision-impaired developers

## Best Practices

1. **Test with headphones first** - The sound plays at system volume
2. **Be considerate in shared spaces** - May not be appropriate for quiet offices
3. **Adjust volume appropriately** - Start with lower volumes and increase as needed
4. **Customize for your workflow** - Use different sounds for different notification types
