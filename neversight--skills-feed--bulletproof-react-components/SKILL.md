# Bulletproof React Components

Nine patterns that ensure React components survive real-world conditions beyond the happy path — SSR, hydration, concurrent rendering, portals, and more.

## How It Works

1. When writing or reviewing a reusable React component, consult the **Quick Rules** below
2. For code examples and deeper explanation, read `./references/patterns.md`
3. Run through the **Checklist** before shipping

## Quick Rules

| # | Pattern | Rule |
|---|---------|------|
| 1 | **Server-Proof** | Never call browser APIs (`localStorage`, `window`, `document`) during render. Use `useEffect`. |
| 2 | **Hydration-Proof** | Inject a synchronous inline `<script>` to set client-dependent values before React hydration. |
| 3 | **Instance-Proof** | Use `useId()` for all generated IDs. Never hardcode IDs in reusable components. |
| 4 | **Concurrent-Proof** | Wrap server data-fetching in `React.cache()` to deduplicate calls per request. |
| 5 | **Composition-Proof** | Use Context instead of `React.cloneElement()` — cloneElement breaks with Server Components, lazy, and memo. |
| 6 | **Portal-Proof** | Use `ref.current?.ownerDocument.defaultView \|\| window` for event listeners, not the global `window`. |
| 7 | **Transition-Proof** | Wrap state updates in `startTransition()` to enable View Transition API animations. |
| 8 | **Activity-Proof** | Use `useLayoutEffect` to disable DOM side effects (e.g., `<style>` tags) when hidden by `<Activity>`. |
| 9 | **Future-Proof** | Use `useState(() => value)` for stable identity. `useMemo` is only a performance hint — React may discard it. |

## Checklist

When building a reusable React component, verify:

- [ ] No browser APIs called during render (server-proof)
- [ ] No hydration flash for client-storage values (hydration-proof)
- [ ] No hardcoded IDs; uses `useId()` (instance-proof)
- [ ] Server data fetches wrapped in `cache()` (concurrent-proof)
- [ ] Uses Context instead of `cloneElement` (composition-proof)
- [ ] Event listeners use `ownerDocument.defaultView` (portal-proof)
- [ ] State updates wrapped in `startTransition()` where needed (transition-proof)
- [ ] DOM side effects respect `<Activity>` visibility (activity-proof)
- [ ] Stable values use `useState` initializer, not `useMemo` (future-proof)

## Present Results to User

When reviewing a component against these patterns, format as:

```
**Bulletproof Check: `<ComponentName>`**

| Pattern | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Server-Proof | PASS/FAIL | ... |
| ... | ... | ... |

**Suggested fixes:**
1. ...
```
