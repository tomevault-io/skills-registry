# React (Components, Hooks, State)

Reusable patterns for scalable React codebases, including Zustand state
management.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:

- Writing or refactoring `.tsx` components
- Extracting hooks into `hooks/<area>/useXxx.ts`
- Removing helpers from components/hooks into `utils/`
- Removing inline types into `types/`
- Implementing global UI state (modals, progress indicators)
- Managing shared data across components or avoiding prop drilling
- Setting up cross-component communication with Zustand

## Non-Negotiables (MUST)

### Components and Hooks

- Exactly **one exported component per `.tsx` file**.
- Exactly **one exported hook per hook file** (`hooks/<area>/useXxx.ts`).
- **No helper functions inside** components or hooks; extract helpers to
  `utils/`.
- **No inline types** inside components or hooks; import from `types/`.
- Prefer server-side rendering boundaries wisely (avoid `'use client'` for large
  subtrees).

### State (Zustand)

- One store per domain (e.g., `uiStore`, `workspaceStore`, `statusLogStore`).
- Keep stores focused; split when they grow too large.
- Use selectors to minimize re-renders:
  `useStore((state) => state.specificValue)`.
- Actions should be defined in the store, not in components.
- Modals should read their visibility state from stores, not receive as props.

## Rules

### Component Patterns

- `react-one-component-per-file` - One component per file (STRICT)
- `react-client-vs-server` - Client vs Server Components (App Router)
- `react-folder-namespacing` - Folder namespacing for complex components
- `react-performance` - Performance optimization (memo, useCallback)
- `react-accessibility` - Accessibility best practices
- `react-component-testing` - Component tests in `__tests__`, React Testing Library

### Hooks Best Practices

- `react-one-hook-per-file` - One hook per file (STRICT)
- `react-no-helpers-in-hooks` - No helpers inside hooks (STRICT)
- `react-no-types-in-hooks` - No types inside hooks (STRICT)
- `react-stable-api` - Stable API for hooks
- `react-side-effects` - Side effects in hooks

### State (Zustand)

- `zustand-when-to-use` - When to use Zustand (modals, global UI state, shared
  data)
- `zustand-store-organization` - Store organization (one store per domain,
  selectors, actions)
- `zustand-modal-pattern` - Modal pattern with Zustand (read visibility from
  store)
- `zustand-avoiding-prop-drilling` - Use Zustand stores instead of prop drilling

- `busirocket-typescript-standards` - TypeScript and type conventions
- `busirocket-nextjs` - Server vs Client Components (detailed)

## How to Use

Read individual rule files for detailed explanations and code examples:

```
rules/react-one-component-per-file.md
rules/react-one-hook-per-file.md
rules/react-client-vs-server.md
rules/zustand-store-organization.md
rules/zustand-modal-pattern.md
```

Each rule file contains:

- Brief explanation of why it matters
- Code examples (correct and incorrect patterns)
- Additional context and best practices
