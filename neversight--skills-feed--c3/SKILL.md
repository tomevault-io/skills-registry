# C3 Architecture Assistant

## REQUIRED: Load References

Before proceeding, use Glob to find and Read these files:
1. `**/references/skill-harness.md` - Red flags and complexity rules
2. `**/references/layer-navigation.md` - How to traverse C3 docs

## Intent Recognition & Routing

This skill is the **primary entry point** for C3 tasks. Route based on intent:

| User Says | Intent | Route To | Agent Chain |
|-----------|--------|----------|-------------|
| "pattern/convention/standard/ref/how should we" | Pattern | `/c3-ref` | (inline) |
| "provision/design/plan/envision/architect X" (no ref keywords) | Design-only | `/c3-provision` | (inline, stops at ADR) |
| "where/what/how/explain/show me" | Question | `/c3-query` | c3-navigator → c3-summarizer |
| "add/modify/remove/fix/refactor/implement" | Change | `/c3-alter` | c3-orchestrator → c3-analysis → c3-synthesizer → c3-dev |
| "audit/validate/check/verify/sync" | Audit | this skill | → c3-content-classifier |
| (no .c3/ directory) | Initialize | `/onboard` | (inline) |

**When unclear:** Ask "Do you want to explore (query), design only (provision), change and implement (alter), manage patterns (ref), or audit?"

---

## Mode: Adopt

Route to `/onboard` skill for the full staged learning loop.

---

## Mode: Audit

**REQUIRED:** Load `**/references/audit-checks.md` for full procedure.

| Scope | Command |
|-------|---------|
| Full system | `audit C3` |
| Container | `audit container c3-1` |
| ADR | `audit adr adr-YYYYMMDD-slug` |

**Checks:** Inventory vs code, categorization, reference validity, diagrams, ADR lifecycle, abstraction boundaries, content separation, context files

**Content Separation Check (Phase 9):**
- Verifies components contain domain logic, refs contain usage patterns
- Uses `c3-skill:c3-content-classifier` agent for LLM-based analysis
- Detects: missing refs for technologies, integration patterns in components, duplicated patterns

**Context Files Check (Phase 10):**
- Verifies CLAUDE.md files exist in Code Reference directories
- Checks c3-generated blocks are current (match component/refs)
- Detects: missing CLAUDE.md, stale blocks, orphaned blocks
- Resolution: Run `/c3 apply` to generate/update files

**Example:**
```
User: "Check if C3 docs are up to date"

1. Load audit-checks.md
2. Run Phase 1: Gather (list containers, components, ADRs)
3. Run Phase 2-10: Validate each check
4. Output audit report with PASS/FAIL/WARN per check
5. List actionable fixes for any failures
```

## Proactive Pattern Awareness

C3 provides **ambient pattern awareness** through CLAUDE.md files in code directories:

| Mechanism | How It Works |
|-----------|--------------|
| CLAUDE.md files | Generated in Code Reference directories, loaded automatically by Claude |
| `/c3 apply` | Generates/updates CLAUDE.md files based on component docs |
| Audit Phase 10 | Checks CLAUDE.md presence and freshness |

**Why CLAUDE.md over hooks:**
- Hooks fire too late (PreToolUse on Edit/Write happens after Claude decides what to change)
- Subagents don't receive SessionStart context
- CLAUDE.md loads at session start for all agents

**Legacy hooks** (still available but less reliable):

| Hook | Script | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| SessionStart | `c3-context-loader` | Loads system goal, all refs, code→component mapping |
| PreToolUse (Edit/Write) | `c3-edit-context` | Surfaces relevant patterns when editing documented files |
| PreToolUse (Edit/Write) | `c3-gate` | Gates edits to ADR-approved files only |

---

## Mode: Apply

**Trigger:** User says "apply", "generate context", "propagate context", "create CLAUDE.md"

Generates CLAUDE.md files in directories listed in component Code References.

```
/c3 apply [--dry-run]

1. Scan .c3/c3-*/c3-*.md for Code References sections
2. For each referenced directory:
   - Create CLAUDE.md if missing
   - Update c3-generated block if stale
   - Preserve user content outside block
3. Report: created, updated, skipped counts
4. Files left unstaged for user review
```

**CLAUDE.md template:**
```markdown
<!-- c3-generated: c3-201 -->
# c3-201: Component Title

Before modifying this code, read:
- Component: `.c3/c3-2-api/c3-201.md`
- Patterns: `ref-error-handling`, `ref-logging`

Full refs: `.c3/refs/ref-{name}.md`
<!-- end-c3-generated -->
```

**Workflow:**
1. Run `/c3 audit` to see what's missing (Phase 10)
2. Run `/c3 apply` to generate files
3. Review and commit generated files
