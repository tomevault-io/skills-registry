# Calm Skill

## Overview
Enables Claude to use Calm for wellness tracking including viewing meditation history, sleep story usage, and accessing the mindfulness content library.

## Quick Install

```bash
curl -sSL https://canifi.com/skills/calm/install.sh | bash
```

Or manually:
```bash
cp -r skills/calm ~/.canifi/skills/
```

## Setup

Configure via [canifi-env](https://canifi.com/setup/scripts):

```bash
# First, ensure canifi-env is installed:
# curl -sSL https://canifi.com/install.sh | bash

canifi-env set CALM_EMAIL "your-email@example.com"
canifi-env set CALM_PASSWORD "your-password"
```

## Privacy & Authentication

**Your credentials, your choice.** Canifi LifeOS respects your privacy.

### Option 1: Manual Browser Login (Recommended)
If you prefer not to share credentials with Claude Code:
1. Complete the [Browser Automation Setup](/setup/automation) using CDP mode
2. Login to the service manually in the Playwright-controlled Chrome window
3. Claude will use your authenticated session without ever seeing your password

### Option 2: Environment Variables
If you're comfortable sharing credentials, you can store them locally:
```bash
canifi-env set SERVICE_EMAIL "your-email"
