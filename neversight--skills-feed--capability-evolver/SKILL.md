# 🧬 Capability Evolver

**"I don't just run code. I write it."**

The **Capability Evolver** is a meta-skill that allows OpenClaw agents to inspect their own runtime history, identify failures or inefficiencies, and autonomously write new code or update their own memory to improve performance.

Now featuring **Ascension Protocol (v2.0)**: A structured knowledge accumulation system.

## ✨ Features

- **🔍 Auto-Log Analysis**: Automatically scans memory and history files for errors and patterns.
- **🛠️ Self-Repair**: Detects crashes and suggests patches.
- **💎 Knowledge Crystallization**: Extracts lessons into `memory/KNOWLEDGE_BASE/LESSONS_LEARNED.md`.
- **🥚 Skill Incubation**: Can spontaneously generate new skills in `skills/`.
- **🐕 Mad Dog Mode**: Continuous self-healing loop (`--loop`).

## 📦 Usage

### Manual Trigger
```bash
node skills/capability-evolver/index.js
```

### 🐕 Mad Dog Mode (Continuous)
Runs the evolver in an infinite loop (Agent-Driven).
```bash
node skills/capability-evolver/index.js --loop
```
*Stop with `kill -9 <pid>`.*

## 🧠 Internal Logic (Ascension Protocol)

1.  **Introspect**: Scan recent logs for errors or user corrections.
2.  **Evolve**: 
    - **Fix**: Repair broken code.
    - **Crystallize**: Write new rules to `KNOWLEDGE_BASE`.
    - **Promote**: Update core docs (`AGENTS.md`) if critical.
3.  **Persist**: Commit to Git and safe-publish if needed.

## 🛡️ Safety & Risk Protocol (MANDATORY)

### Risk Assessment & Mitigation

| Risk | Level | Mitigation Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Infinite Recursion** | High | **Strict Single Process**: `evolve.js` MUST NOT spawn child evolution processes. The loop is handled safely in `index.js`. |
| **Runaway Process** | High | **Kill Switch**: Use `kill -9 <pid>` to terminate the Mad Dog loop if it becomes unresponsive. |
| **Hallucinated Fixes** | Medium | **Human Review (Optional)**: "Fixing non-broken code" is a risk. Mitigation: Periodic human audit of changes. |
| **File Corruption** | High | **Git Sync**: Always keep `workspace_daily_sync` (or `git-sync`) active to backup the workspace before/after evolution. |
