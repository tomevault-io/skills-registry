# Character Profile Generator

This skill enables the creation of rich, consistent virtual character profiles by combining a structured template with an interactive discovery process.

## Workflow

To generate a character profile, follow these steps:

### 1. Initial Consultation

Ask the user for basic information about the character (e.g., name, gender, role) and any initial ideas they have.

### 2. Clarifying Dialogue

Ask 3-5 targeted questions to delve deeper into the character's psyche. Focus on:

- **Personality & MBTI**: How do they react to stress? Are they introverted or extroverted?
- **Behavior & Habits**: Do they have any unique quirks or repetitive actions?
- **Background & Motivation**: What drives them? What is a significant event from their past?
- **Communication Style**: How do they speak? Any specific slang or verbal tics?

### 3. Profile Generation

Load the template from `assets/profile_template.md` and populate it using the information gathered.

- Use the provided structure strictly.
- Expand on the "核心人格特質" (Core Personality Traits) and "說話方式" (Speaking Style) to ensure they are distinctive.
- For missing fields not covered in the dialogue, generate creative and consistent details that fit the character's established persona.
