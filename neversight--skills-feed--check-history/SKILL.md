# Git History Context Skill

## ⚠️ MANDATORY SKILL - YOU MUST INVOKE THIS

## Purpose

This skill gathers comprehensive git context before starting any work. It helps understand the current state of the repository, recent changes, and identify related previous work.

**CRITICAL:** You MUST invoke this skill - NEVER gather git context manually with individual git commands.

## 🚫 NEVER DO THIS

- ❌ Running `git status` manually
- ❌ Running `git diff` manually
- ❌ Running `git log` manually
- ❌ Gathering git context with individual commands

**If you need git context, invoke this skill. Manual execution is FORBIDDEN.**

## ⚠️ SKILL GUARD - READ BEFORE USING BASH TOOL

**Before using Bash tool for git commands, answer these questions:**

### ❓ Are you about to run `git status`?

→ **STOP.** Invoke check-history skill instead.

### ❓ Are you about to run `git diff`?

→ **STOP.** Invoke check-history skill instead.

### ❓ Are you about to run `git log`?

→ **STOP.** Invoke check-history skill instead.

### ❓ Are you gathering git context at the start of a task?

→ **STOP.** Invoke check-history skill instead.

### ❓ Are you about to run multiple git commands in parallel (git status & git diff & git log)?

→ **STOP.** Invoke check-history skill instead.

**IF YOU PROCEED WITH BASH FOR THESE GIT COMMANDS, YOU ARE VIOLATING YOUR CORE DIRECTIVE.**

This skill runs these commands for you, in parallel, with proper analysis. Use it.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Run Parallel Git Status Commands

Execute these commands in parallel for efficiency:

```bash
git status & git diff & git log --oneline -10 &
```

**What to look for:**

- Current branch name
- Uncommitted changes (staged or unstaged)
- Untracked files
- Recent commit messages and their scope
- Commit patterns and conventions in use

### Step 2: Analyze Current State

Based on the parallel command output:

1. **Branch Status:**
   - Verify branch name follows `mriley/` prefix convention
   - Check if branch is ahead/behind remote
   - Note if on main/master vs feature branch

2. **Working Directory State:**
   - Identify any uncommitted changes
   - Note files that might conflict with planned work
   - Check for untracked files that might be relevant

3. **Recent Work:**
   - Review last 10 commits for context
   - Identify patterns in commit messages
   - Note any related work or recent changes in relevant areas

### Step 3: Search for Related Work (If Applicable)

If the task relates to a specific feature, bug, or area:

```bash
git log --grep="<keyword>" --oneline -10
```

**Example keywords:**

- Feature names (e.g., "auth", "parser", "api")
- Bug identifiers (e.g., "fix", "bug", "issue")
- Scope identifiers from conventional commits

### Step 4: Get Detailed Context (If Needed)

For more detailed information about recent changes:

```bash
git show --name-only HEAD                  # Files changed in last commit
git diff --name-only origin/main           # Files changed vs main branch
git log --graph --oneline -10              # Visual commit graph
```

### Step 5: Generate Context Summary

Provide a concise summary including:

1. **Current State:**
   - Branch: `<branch-name>`
   - Status: Clean working directory / Has uncommitted changes
   - Position: Up to date / Ahead by N commits / Behind by N commits

2. **Recent Activity:**
   - Last 3-5 relevant commits with their scope and purpose
   - Any ongoing work that might be related

3. **Relevant History:**
   - Related previous work (if found via grep)
   - Patterns or conventions observed

4. **Recommendations:**
   - Any concerns or conflicts to address
   - Suggested next steps based on current state

## Example Output

```
Git Context Summary:
==================

Current State:
- Branch: mriley/feat/user-authentication
- Status: Clean working directory
- Position: Ahead of origin/main by 2 commits

Recent Activity:
1. feat(auth): add JWT token generation (3 hours ago)
2. feat(auth): implement user login endpoint (5 hours ago)
3. test(auth): add unit tests for password hashing (1 day ago)

Relevant History:
- Found 3 commits related to "auth" in past week
- Project consistently uses conventional commits with scope
- Security-focused: all auth changes include tests

Recommendations:
- Safe to proceed with auth-related work
- Follow existing pattern: feature + tests in same commit
- Consider reviewing recent auth commits for context
```

## Error Handling

### If git command fails:

- Verify we're in a git repository
- Check git is installed and accessible
- Report error to user with specific command that failed

### If not in a git repo:

- Note this is not a git repository
- Skip git-specific checks
- Proceed with file system context if needed

## Integration with Other Skills

This skill should be invoked by:

- **`sparc-plan`** - Before creating implementation plans
- **`safe-commit`** - To understand what's being committed
- **`create-pr`** - To generate meaningful PR descriptions

## Best Practices

1. **Always run parallel commands** - Don't run git commands sequentially
2. **Be concise** - Summarize, don't dump raw git output
3. **Focus on relevance** - Highlight information relevant to the current task
4. **Note patterns** - Identify conventions and patterns in commit history
5. **Flag concerns** - Highlight any potential conflicts or issues early
