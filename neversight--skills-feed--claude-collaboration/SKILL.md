# Claude Code Collaboration Best Practices

This skill provides guidance on effectively using Claude Code in team environments, managing shared knowledge through skills, and maximizing value from AI-assisted development.

## Core Principles

1. **Skills are living documentation** - They evolve as you learn
2. **Capture knowledge explicitly** - Claude doesn't auto-update skills
3. **All skills live in $CLAUDE_METADATA** - No local skills or commands in projects
4. **Share knowledge across the team** - Centralized repo ensures consistency
5. **Version control your skills** - Track changes and improvements
6. **Be intentional about updates** - Not everything learned needs to be captured

### Critical: No Local Skills or Commands

**ALL skills and commands MUST be in the $CLAUDE_METADATA repository, never in individual project directories.**

**❌ Never do this:**
```bash
# Creating local skill in project
echo "---" > .claude/skills/my-local-skill/SKILL.md
```

**✅ Always do this:**
```bash
# Create skill in central repo
mkdir -p $CLAUDE_METADATA/skills/project-name
echo "---" > $CLAUDE_METADATA/skills/project-name/SKILL.md

# Then symlink to project
ln -s $CLAUDE_METADATA/skills/project-name .claude/skills/project-name
```

**Why centralization is mandatory:**
- **Version control**: All skills tracked in one git repo
- **Team sharing**: Everyone uses the same knowledge
- **Consistency**: No divergence between projects
- **Maintenance**: Update once, applies everywhere
- **Discovery**: Team can see all available skills

**Even project-specific skills go in the central repo** under `$CLAUDE_METADATA/skills/project-name/`.

## Understanding How Skills Work

### What Happens During a Session

**At session start:**
- Claude reads all `.claude/skills/` files in your directory
- Skills provide context and guidelines for the session
- Knowledge from skills is "loaded" into Claude's working context

**During the session:**
- Claude learns from your conversation (temporary, in-context learning)
- Solutions discovered apply only to this conversation
- Skills remain unchanged unless you explicitly update them

**At session end:**
- All temporary learning is lost
- Skills remain exactly as they were at the start
- Next session starts fresh, reading skills again

### What This Means

**✅ Skills persist across sessions** - They're files on disk
**❌ Session learnings don't persist** - They exist only in conversation context
**⚠️ You must explicitly update skills** - Claude won't do it automatically

---

## When to Update Skills

### Always Update Skills For:

1. **Repeated problems with known solutions**
   - "We keep hitting this error, here's how to fix it"
   - Add to troubleshooting section

2. **New best practices discovered**
   - "Using --quiet saves 85% tokens, use it by default"
   - Add to optimization guidelines

3. **Common workflows that need standardization**
   - "Our team always does X before Y"
   - Add to standard procedures

4. **Configuration patterns that work**
   - "This cron job setup works best for our HPC"
   - Add as recommended configuration

5. **Important architectural decisions**
   - "We decided to use symlinks for global skills because..."
   - Document rationale for future reference

### Don't Update Skills For:

1. **One-time issues** - Specific to a particular run or environment
2. **Experimental approaches** - Wait until proven effective
3. **User-specific preferences** - Unless they should be team defaults
4. **Obvious information** - Already well-documented elsewhere
5. **Temporary workarounds** - Not worth making permanent

### Example: When to Update

**Scenario 1: New error pattern discovered**
```
Session: "WF8 fails when Hi-C files are missing R2 reads"
Action: ✅ ADD to troubleshooting - this will happen again
Rationale: Common issue with known solution
```

**Scenario 2: One-off configuration issue**
```
Session: "My personal laptop has Python 3.7, need 3.8"
Action: ❌ DON'T ADD to skill - personal environment issue
Rationale: Not relevant to others, not a recurring pattern
```

**Scenario 3: Token optimization discovered**
```
Session: "Using --quiet mode saves 15K → 2K tokens!"
Action: ✅ ADD to token efficiency skill
Rationale: Valuable for entire team, significant impact
```

## How to Update Skills

### Method 1: Explicit Request (Recommended)

```
User: "We just solved the issue with workflow timeouts in HPC environments.
       Add this to the VGP skill under troubleshooting."

Claude: [Reads current skill, adds new troubleshooting entry, saves file]
```

**Benefits:**
- You control what gets captured
- You review the update
- Clear and intentional

### Method 2: Ask Claude to Suggest Updates

```
User: "Based on our work today, what should we add to the VGP skill?"

Claude: [Reviews conversation, suggests additions]

User: "Yes, add those three things."

Claude: [Updates skill file]
```

**Benefits:**
- Claude identifies patterns you might miss
- Quick end-of-session review
- Collaborative approach

### Method 3: End-of-Session Summary

```
User: "Summarize today's learnings and update the relevant skills."

Claude: [Creates summary, updates multiple skills if needed]
```

**Benefits:**
- Batch updates
- Comprehensive capture
- Good for long sessions

### Method 4: Periodic Review

```
User: "We've been working on VGP for a month.
       Review our conversation history and suggest skill improvements."

Claude: [Analyzes patterns, suggests updates]
```

**Benefits:**
- Catches accumulated knowledge
- Identifies trends
- Good for major skill overhauls

## Skill Organization Patterns

### Pattern 1: Project-Specific Skills (In Central Repo)

**Use for:**
- Project-specific knowledge (VGP workflows, Galaxy APIs)
- Custom tooling and scripts
- Domain-specific patterns

**Location:** `$CLAUDE_METADATA/skills/project-name/` (NOT in project directory)

**Example:**
```
$CLAUDE_METADATA/
└── skills/
    ├── my-project/              # Project-specific skill
    │   └── SKILL.md
    └── another-project/         # Another project-specific skill
        └── SKILL.md

my-project/
└── .claude/
    └── skills/
        └── my-project -> $CLAUDE_METADATA/skills/my-project  # Symlink only!
```

**Important:** Even project-specific skills live in the central repo and are symlinked to projects.

### Pattern 2: General Skills (Cross-Project)

**Use for:**
- General development practices
- Tool-agnostic optimizations (token efficiency)
- Team-wide standards

**Location:** `$CLAUDE_METADATA/skills/`

**Example:**
```
$CLAUDE_METADATA/skills/
├── token-efficiency/
│   └── SKILL.md
├── claude-collaboration/
│   └── SKILL.md
└── python-testing-patterns/
    └── SKILL.md
```

### Pattern 3: Symlinking Skills to Projects

**This is THE standard pattern - all projects use symlinks, no exceptions.**

**Setup:**
```bash
# In each project
cd /path/to/project
mkdir -p .claude/skills .claude/commands

# Symlink skills from central repo
ln -s $CLAUDE_METADATA/skills/token-efficiency .claude/skills/token-efficiency
ln -s $CLAUDE_METADATA/skills/my-project .claude/skills/my-project

# Symlink commands from central repo
ln -s $CLAUDE_METADATA/commands/global/*.md .claude/commands/
```

**Benefits:**
- Update once, applies everywhere
- Consistent across all projects
- Easy to maintain
- Version controlled in one place
- Team can discover all skills

**Critical rule:** Projects contain ONLY symlinks, never actual skill/command files.

### Pattern 4: Skills with Supporting Documentation

**Structure:**
```
skills/skill-name/
├── SKILL.md              # Core concepts and quick reference
├── reference.md          # Detailed technical documentation
├── troubleshooting.md    # Common issues and solutions
├── examples/             # Code examples
└── templates/            # Template files
```

**When to use:**
- SKILL.md is getting too long (>1000 lines)
- Detailed reference material available
- Multiple categories of information (guides, troubleshooting, examples)

**Progressive disclosure benefit:**
- Claude sees SKILL.md description always (minimal tokens)
- Supporting files only loaded when skill activated
- Deep details available without cluttering main skill

**Example - galaxy-tool-wrapping:**
```markdown
## Supporting Documentation

This skill includes detailed reference documentation:

- **reference.md** - Comprehensive Galaxy tool wrapping guide
- **troubleshooting.md** - Practical troubleshooting guide
- **dependency-debugging.md** - Dependency conflict resolution

These files provide deep technical details that complement the core concepts above.
```

**Best practice:**
- Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines if possible
- Move detailed guides to supporting files
- Reference supporting files at end of SKILL.md
- Use descriptive filenames (troubleshooting.md, not tips.md)

---

## Centralized Skill Repository Pattern

**Problem**: Managing skills across multiple projects leads to duplication and maintenance overhead.

**Solution**: Use a centralized repository with selective symlinks and environment variables.

### Setup

1. **Create central repository**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p $CLAUDE_METADATA/{skills,commands}
   ```

2. **Set environment variable** in `~/.zshrc`:
   ```bash
   export CLAUDE_METADATA="$CLAUDE_METADATA"
   ```

3. **Organize by domain**:
   ```
   $CLAUDE_METADATA/
   ├── skills/
   │   ├── domain-1/SKILL.md
   │   └── domain-2/SKILL.md
   └── commands/
       └── category/
           └── command.md
   ```

### Per-Project Activation

**Key principle**: Only symlink skills needed for each project

```bash
# In project directory
ln -s $CLAUDE_METADATA/skills/domain-1 .claude/skills/domain-1
ln -s $CLAUDE_METADATA/commands/category/*.md .claude/commands/
```

### Benefits

- **No performance penalty**: Progressive disclosure loads skills only when activated
- **Selective activation**: Each project sees only relevant skills
- **Easy maintenance**: Update once, all projects benefit
- **Portable**: Change location via environment variable
- **Team-friendly**: Commit symlinks, team members use their own central repo

### Standardized Setup Prompts

Provide users with copy-paste prompts for new projects in `$CLAUDE_METADATA/QUICK_REFERENCE.md`:

**Basic setup**:
```
Set up Claude Code for this project. Show me available skills in $CLAUDE_METADATA and let me choose which ones to symlink.
```

**Sync existing project**:
```
Check what skills and commands are available in $CLAUDE_METADATA and compare with what's currently symlinked in this project. Show me what's new or missing, and let me choose which ones to add.
```

**VGP-specific**:
```
Set up Claude Code for a VGP pipeline project. Symlink the vgp-pipeline skill and all VGP commands from $CLAUDE_METADATA.
```

### Example Directory Structure

```
$CLAUDE_METADATA/
├── README.md                    # Setup documentation
├── QUICK_REFERENCE.md           # Copy-paste prompts for users
├── NEW_MACHINE_SETUP.md         # First-time machine setup
├── skills/                      # ALL skills (general + project-specific)
│   ├── token-efficiency/        # General skill
│   │   └── SKILL.md
│   ├── claude-collaboration/    # General skill
│   │   └── SKILL.md
│   ├── vgp-pipeline/           # Project-specific skill
│   │   └── SKILL.md
│   └── galaxy-tool-wrapping/   # Domain skill
│       └── SKILL.md
└── commands/                    # ALL commands
    ├── global/                  # Commands for all projects
    │   ├── update-skills.md
    │   └── sync-skills.md
    └── vgp-pipeline/           # Project-specific commands
        ├── check-status.md
        └── debug-failed.md
```

**Key point:** ALL skills and commands live in this central repo. Projects contain only symlinks.

### Migration Pattern

**From duplicated or local skills** (old/wrong way):
```
project-1/.claude/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md          # ❌ Duplicate!
project-2/.claude/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md          # ❌ Duplicate!
project-3/.claude/skills/project-specific/SKILL.md  # ❌ Local only!
```

**To centralized skills** (correct way):
```
$CLAUDE_METADATA/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md          # ✅ Single source of truth
$CLAUDE_METADATA/skills/project-specific/SKILL.md  # ✅ Even project-specific!

project-1/.claude/skills/my-skill -> $CLAUDE_METADATA/skills/my-skill
project-2/.claude/skills/my-skill -> $CLAUDE_METADATA/skills/my-skill
project-3/.claude/skills/project-specific -> $CLAUDE_METADATA/skills/project-specific
```

**Critical rule:** ALL skills in $CLAUDE_METADATA, even if only used by one project.

### Team Workflow

1. **Central repo is git-tracked**:
   ```bash
   cd $CLAUDE_METADATA
   git init
   git remote add origin git@github.com:team/claude-metadata.git
   ```

2. **Team members clone**:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:team/claude-metadata.git $CLAUDE_METADATA
   export CLAUDE_METADATA="$CLAUDE_METADATA"
   ```

3. **Projects use symlinks**:
   ```bash
   # Commit symlinks to project repos
   git add .claude/
   git commit -m "Add Claude Code skill symlinks"
   ```

4. **Updates propagate automatically**:
   ```bash
   # Update central skills
   cd $CLAUDE_METADATA
   git pull

   # All projects with symlinks now use updated skills! 🎉
   ```

---

## Version Control for Skills

### Why Version Control Skills?

1. **Track evolution** - See how knowledge grows over time
2. **Review changes** - Understand what was added and why
3. **Rollback mistakes** - Undo bad updates
4. **Share with team** - Everyone uses same skills
5. **Audit trail** - Know who added what when

### Setup Git for Global Skills

```bash
cd $CLAUDE_METADATA
git init
git add .claude/
git commit -m "Initial skills: token-efficiency, claude-collaboration"

# Optional: Push to GitHub for team sharing
git remote add origin git@github.com:your-team/claude-skills.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Workflow for Skill Updates

```bash
# Before making changes
cd $CLAUDE_METADATA
git status  # See current state

# After Claude updates a skill
git diff  # Review changes

# If changes look good
git add .claude/skills/
git commit -m "Add WF8 Hi-C troubleshooting pattern"
git push

# If changes are wrong
git checkout -- .claude/skills/token-efficiency/SKILL.md  # Undo
```

### Team Collaboration

```bash
# Team member pulls latest skills
cd $CLAUDE_METADATA
git pull

# All symlinked projects auto-update! 🎉

# Team member adds their own learning
# (Claude updates skill based on their session)
git add .
git commit -m "Add HPC-specific cron patterns"
git push

# Other team members pull and benefit
git pull
```

---

## Sharing Skills with Team

### Method 1: Git Repository (Recommended)

**Setup:**
```bash
# Create shared skills repo
mkdir claude-team-skills
cd claude-team-skills
mkdir -p .claude/skills

# Add initial skills
cp -r $CLAUDE_METADATA/skills/* .claude/skills/

# Initialize git
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial team skills"
git remote add origin git@github.com:your-org/claude-team-skills.git
git push -u origin main
```

**Team members use:**
```bash
# Clone shared skills
git clone git@github.com:your-org/claude-team-skills.git ~/claude-team-skills

# Link to their projects
cd /path/to/project
ln -s ~/claude-team-skills/.claude/skills/token-efficiency .claude/skills/token-efficiency

# Stay updated
cd ~/claude-team-skills
git pull  # Periodically pull updates
```

### Method 2: Shared Network Drive

**Setup:**
```bash
# Create skills on shared drive
mkdir /mnt/shared/claude-skills/.claude/skills

# Team members symlink
ln -s /mnt/shared/claude-skills/.claude/skills/token-efficiency .claude/skills/token-efficiency
```

**Pros:** Simple, immediate updates
**Cons:** No version control, risk of conflicts

### Method 3: Copy-Based (Simple but Manual)

**Setup:**
```bash
# Share skills file via email/Slack
# Team members copy to their projects
cp received-skill.md .claude/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md
```

**Pros:** Simple, no infrastructure needed
**Cons:** No automatic updates, easy to diverge

---

## Best Practices for Skill Maintenance

### 1. Regular Review Sessions

**Weekly quick review:**
```
"Review this week's work and suggest skill updates"
```

**Monthly deep review:**
```
"Analyze patterns from this month's sessions and propose major skill improvements"
```

### 2. Clear Update Messages

**Good commit messages:**
```
git commit -m "Add token optimization for VGP log files (96% savings)"
git commit -m "Document WF8 failure pattern when Hi-C R2 missing"
git commit -m "Add HPC cron job environment setup"
```

**Bad commit messages:**
```
git commit -m "update skill"
git commit -m "fixes"
git commit -m "stuff"
```

### 3. Keep Skills Focused

**Good:** One skill per topic
- `token-efficiency.md` - Only token optimization
- `vgp-troubleshooting.md` - Only VGP issues
- `deployment.md` - Only deployment procedures

**Bad:** Kitchen sink skills
- `everything.md` - Token optimization + VGP + deployment + testing + ...
- Hard to maintain, hard to use

### 4. Document Rationale

**Include "why" not just "what":**

```markdown
## Use --quiet Mode by Default

**Why:** VGP status checks produce 15K tokens of output with verbose mode,
but only 2K with --quiet mode. Over a typical workflow (10 status checks),
this saves 130K tokens (87% reduction).

**When to override:** User explicitly requests detailed output, or debugging
requires seeing all intermediate steps.
```

### 5. Prioritize High-Impact Knowledge

**Capture first:**
- Patterns that save significant time/tokens
- Solutions to common, repeated problems
- Critical configuration requirements
- Team-wide standards

**Capture later:**
- Nice-to-know information
- Rarely-used edge cases
- Obvious procedures

---

## Measuring Skill Effectiveness

### Signs Your Skills Are Working

1. **Fewer repeated questions** - Claude knows the answer from skills
2. **Consistent behavior** - Claude follows team patterns automatically
3. **Faster onboarding** - New team members get instant context
4. **Token efficiency** - Optimizations applied automatically
5. **Better debugging** - Known issues resolved quickly

### Signs Skills Need Improvement

1. **Claude ignores guidelines** - Skills aren't clear or prominent enough
2. **Repeated manual corrections** - Patterns not captured in skills
3. **Team divergence** - Different team members do things differently
4. **Outdated information** - Skills reference old tools/patterns
5. **Too verbose** - Skills are too long, key info buried

### Metrics to Track

**Before/after comparison:**
```
Before token-efficiency skill:
- Average status check: 15K tokens
- Weekly VGP monitoring: 60K tokens

After token-efficiency skill:
- Average status check: 2K tokens (87% reduction)
- Weekly VGP monitoring: 8K tokens (87% reduction)
```

**Knowledge retention:**
```
Before skill updates:
- Same question asked 5 times over 2 months

After skill update:
- Question answered correctly from skill every time
```

---

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### Pitfall 1: Forgetting to Update Skills

**Problem:** Valuable knowledge stays in conversation, gets lost

**Solution:** End-of-session ritual
```
Last message every session:
"What did we learn today that should go in our skills?"
```

### Pitfall 2: Skills Become Too Long

**Problem:** Skills are 10,000+ lines, Claude can't find key info

**Solution:** Split into focused sub-skills
```
Before: vgp-everything.md (10K lines)
After:
  - vgp-setup.md (2K lines)
  - vgp-troubleshooting.md (3K lines)
  - vgp-optimization.md (2K lines)
```

### Pitfall 3: Skills Conflict

**Problem:** Multiple skills give contradictory advice

**Solution:** Regular conflict audits
```
"Review all my skills and identify any conflicting guidelines"
```

### Pitfall 4: No Version Control

**Problem:** Can't undo bad changes, can't see history

**Solution:** Set up git from day one
```bash
cd $CLAUDE_METADATA
git init
git add .claude/
git commit -m "Initial skills"
```

### Pitfall 5: Skills Not Shared

**Problem:** Each team member has different skills, inconsistent behavior

**Solution:** Use shared git repo or symlinks
```bash
# Team repo for skills
git clone git@github.com:team/claude-skills.git ~/claude-team-skills

# Each project links to shared skills
ln -s ~/claude-team-skills/.claude/skills/* .claude/skills/
```

```

**Usage:** Swap skills based on environment

### Pattern 3: Role-Based Skills

**For users:**
```markdown
# User Guide
- How to run workflows
- Common commands
- Troubleshooting
```

**For developers:**
```markdown
# Developer Guide
- Code architecture
- How to add new workflows
- Testing patterns
```

**Usage:** Different skills for different team roles

## Documentation for Session Interruptions

### Creating Resume Documentation

When working on long-running tasks that may span multiple sessions, create comprehensive documentation to enable seamless resume:

**Three-tier documentation approach**:

1. **RESUME_HERE.md** - Quick start guide
   - 3-5 step quick start
   - Essential commands only
   - Clear current status
   - Visual indicators (✅🔄⏸️ emojis)

2. **PROJECT_STATUS.md** - Complete context
   - What has been done
   - What's in progress
   - What's next
   - All files created
   - Key findings
   - Sample of missing data points

3. **scripts/README.md** - Technical details
   - Script documentation
   - How to run each tool
   - Troubleshooting
   - Expected outputs

### Template: RESUME_HERE.md

```markdown
# 🔄 Resume [Project Name]

## Current Status
✅ Completed: [brief status with metrics]
🔄 In Progress: [what's running, % complete]
⏸️ Interrupted at: [specific point with details]

## Resume in 3 Steps

### 1️⃣ Setup
\```bash
cd /path/to/project
conda activate env_name
\```

### 2️⃣ Continue work
\```bash
./script.py  # Brief explanation of what this does
\```

### 3️⃣ Check results
\```bash
# Quick validation command with expected output
\```

## Full Documentation
📄 **PROJECT_STATUS.md** - Complete context
📄 **scripts/README.md** - Technical details
```

### Best Practices

1. **Create early**: Don't wait until interruption is imminent
   - Create documentation as you work
   - Update it throughout the session

2. **Test commands**: Verify resume commands actually work
   - Don't assume paths or commands will work
   - Include absolute paths when needed

3. **Status tracking**: Include counts, percentages, specific progress points
   - "6% complete (31/518 species)" not just "in progress"
   - Show what's done vs. what remains

4. **Next actions**: Be explicit about what happens next
   - "Run script X, then merge with Y, then verify with Z"
   - Include expected runtime

5. **Background processes**: Document how to check/resume running processes
   - Process IDs if applicable
   - How to check status
   - How to restart if needed

### Example: Long-Running Data Fetch Project

```markdown
# 🔄 Resume GenomeScope Data Retrieval

## Current Status
✅ **123 species** have GenomeScope data (17.2% of 716 total)
🔄 **Comprehensive search was running** - searches all assembly folders
⏸️ **Interrupted at ~6% progress** (31/518 remaining species)

## Resume in 3 Steps

### 1️⃣ Navigate and activate environment
\```bash
cd /Users/user/project
conda activate curation_paper
\```

### 2️⃣ Resume comprehensive search
\```bash
# This will pick up where we left off (skips existing data automatically)
python scripts/03c_comprehensive_genomescope_search.py
# Expected runtime: ~2 hours
\```

### 3️⃣ Merge new data (after search completes)
\```bash
python scripts/04_merge_and_enrich.py
\```

## Files Already Created
- genomescope_data/ - 123 raw summary files
- genomescope_enrichment_data.csv - Parsed data
- VGPPhase1-freeze-1.0-ENRICHED.csv - Main dataset

## Full Documentation
📄 **GENOMESCOPE_DATA_RETRIEVAL_STATUS.md** - Complete status
📄 **scripts/README_GENOMESCOPE_SCRIPTS.md** - Script docs
```

### When to Create Resume Documentation

**Always create when:**
- Task will take hours to complete
- Running scripts that can be interrupted
- Multiple scripts need to be run in sequence
- Complex setup with multiple steps
- Work may span multiple days/sessions

**Pattern ensures:**
- Anyone (including you later) can resume work
- No mental overhead to remember state
- Clear next steps visible immediately
- All context preserved

## Summary

**Key Principles:**
1. **Skills are permanent, sessions are temporary**
2. **Update skills explicitly** - Claude won't auto-update
3. **ALL skills in $CLAUDE_METADATA** - No local skills or commands ever
4. **Version control your skills** with git in central repo
5. **Share skills across team** - Centralization ensures consistency
6. **Regular reviews** keep skills valuable

**Critical Architectural Rule:**
🚫 **NEVER create skills or commands directly in project directories**
✅ **ALWAYS create in $CLAUDE_METADATA and symlink to projects**

Even project-specific skills must live in the central repository. This ensures:
- **Single source of truth** - No duplicates, no divergence
- **Version control** - All skills tracked in one git repo
- **Team sharing** - Everyone can discover and use all skills
- **Easy maintenance** - Update once, applies everywhere

**Remember:** Claude is a powerful assistant, but skills are how you make that power consistent, shareable, and permanent.
