# Claude Context Management

## Overview

Claude conversations can grow indefinitely, but context windows have limits. **Context management** strategies enable unlimited conversations while optimizing costs. This skill covers two complementary approaches: **server-side clearing** (API-managed) and **client-side compaction** (SDK-managed), plus integration with the memory tool for automatic context preservation.

**The Problem**: As conversations grow, token consumption increases. Without management:
- Input tokens accumulate (context growing every turn)
- Costs scale linearly with conversation length
- Eventually hit context window limits
- Important information gets lost when clearing occurs

**The Solution**: Automatic context editing and summarization strategies that preserve important information while reducing token consumption.

## When to Use

This skill is essential for:

1. **Long-Running Conversations** (>50K tokens accumulated)
   - Multi-step research projects
   - Extended code analysis sessions
   - Iterative problem-solving workflows

2. **Multi-Session Workflows**
   - Projects spanning days/weeks
   - Shared conversation histories
   - Team collaboration scenarios

3. **Token Cost Optimization**
   - High-volume API usage
   - Production agentic systems
   - Cost-sensitive deployments

4. **Tool-Heavy Applications**
   - Web search workflows (50+ searches)
   - File editing tasks (100+ file operations)
   - Database query sequences

5. **Memory-Augmented Applications**
   - Knowledge accumulation across sessions
   - Persistent context preservation
   - Infinite chat implementations

6. **Hybrid Thinking Scenarios**
   - Extended reasoning sessions
   - Complex problem decomposition
   - Preservation of thinking blocks

## Workflow

### Step 1: Assess Context Needs

**Objectives**:
- Understand conversation characteristics
- Estimate token growth patterns
- Identify clearing triggers

**Actions**:
1. Analyze expected conversation length
   - Single turn: <5K tokens (skip context management)
   - Short conversation: 5-50K tokens (optional)
   - Long conversation: 50K-200K tokens (recommended)
   - Extended session: 200K+ tokens (required)

2. Identify dominant content type
   - Tool results (web search, file operations)
   - Thinking blocks (extended reasoning)
   - Text conversation
   - Mixed (combination)

3. Determine session persistence
   - Single session (one API call to completion)
   - Multi-turn conversation (human in the loop)
   - Long-running agent (hours/days)

### Step 2: Choose Strategy

**Decision Framework**:

| Scenario | Strategy | Rationale |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| Immediate clearing needed, tool results dominate | Server-side (`clear_tool_uses_20250919`) | Results removed before Claude processes, minimal disruption |
| Extensive thinking blocks being generated | Server-side (`clear_thinking_20251015`) | Preserves recent reasoning, maintains cache hits |
| SDK context monitoring available | Client-side compaction | Automatic summarization on threshold |
| Both tool results and thinking | Combine both strategies | Thinking first, then tool clearing |
| Multi-session, knowledge accumulation | Add memory tool | Proactive preservation before clearing |

**Selection Questions**:
- Is this tool-heavy? → Use `clear_tool_uses_20250919`
- Is this reasoning-heavy? → Use `clear_thinking_20251015`
- Can you monitor context in your SDK? → Use client-side compaction
- Need persistent cross-session storage? → Add memory tool integration

### Step 3: Configure Context Editing

**For Server-Side Clearing**:

1. Choose trigger type:
   - `input_tokens`: Trigger when input accumulates (most common)
   - `tool_uses`: Trigger when tool calls accumulate

2. Set trigger value:
   - Conservative: 50,000-75,000 tokens (frequent clearing)
   - Balanced: 100,000-150,000 tokens (recommended)
   - Aggressive: 150,000+ tokens (rare clearing)

3. Define what to keep:
   - `keep` parameter: Most recent N items to preserve
   - Recommended: Keep 3-5 most recent tool uses (or thinking turns)

4. Exclude important tools:
   - `exclude_tools`: Don't clear results from these tools
   - Example: `["web_search"]` (web search results often important)

**For Client-Side Compaction**:

1. Enable in SDK configuration
2. Set `context_token_threshold` (e.g., 100,000)
3. Optional: Customize `summary_prompt`
4. Optional: Choose model for summaries (default: same model, can use Haiku for cost)

### Step 4: Integrate Memory Tool (Optional)

**When to Add Memory**:
- Multi-session workflows needing persistence
- Automatic context preservation before clearing
- Knowledge accumulation across days/weeks
- Agentic tasks requiring state management

**Integration Pattern**:
1. Enable memory tool in tools array: `{"type": "memory_20250818", "name": "memory"}`
2. Configure context clearing (server-side or client-side)
3. Claude automatically receives warnings before clearing
4. Claude can proactively save important information to memory
5. After clearing, information accessible via memory lookups

**How It Works**:
- As context approaches clearing threshold, Claude receives automatic warning
- Claude writes summaries/key findings to memory files
- Content gets cleared from active conversation
- On next turn, Claude can recall via memory tool
- Enables infinite conversations without manual intervention

### Step 5: Monitor and Optimize

**Monitoring Metrics**:
- Input tokens per turn (should stabilize after clearing)
- Clearing frequency (target: once per session or less)
- Token reduction percentage (target: 30-50% savings)
- Memory file size (if using memory tool)

**Optimization Adjustments**:
- Too frequent clearing? Increase trigger threshold
- Important content lost? Decrease threshold or exclude more tools
- Memory files too large? Implement archival strategy
- Cost not improving? Consider client-side compaction + model downsizing for summaries

### Step 6: Validate and Adjust

**Validation Checklist**:
- [ ] Context editing configured and deployed
- [ ] No important information lost during clearing
- [ ] Token consumption reduced as expected
- [ ] Response quality unaffected by clearing
- [ ] Memory integration working (if enabled)
- [ ] Clearing threshold appropriate for workload

**Adjustment Process**:
1. Monitor first conversation end-to-end
2. Measure actual token savings
3. Check memory file contents for completeness
4. Identify any lost context
5. Adjust trigger thresholds/exclusions
6. Repeat until optimal balance achieved

## Quick Start

### Basic Server-Side Tool Clearing

```python
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic()

# Configure context management for tool result clearing
response = client.beta.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-5",
    max_tokens=4096,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Search for AI developments"}],
    tools=[{"type": "web_search_20250305", "name": "web_search"}],
    betas=["context-management-2025-06-27"],
    context_management={
        "edits": [
            {
                "type": "clear_tool_uses_20250919",
                "trigger": {"type": "input_tokens", "value": 100000},
                "keep": {"type": "tool_uses", "value": 3},
                "clear_at_least": {"type": "input_tokens", "value": 5000},
                "exclude_tools": ["web_search"]
            }
        ]
    }
)

print(response.content[0].text)
```

### Basic Client-Side Compaction

```python
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic()

# Configure automatic summarization when tokens exceed threshold
runner = client.beta.messages.tool_runner(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-5",
    max_tokens=4096,
    tools=[
        {
            "type": "text_editor_20250728",
            "name": "file_editor",
            "max_characters": 10000
        }
    ],
    messages=[{
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Review all Python files and summarize code quality issues"
    }],
    compaction_control={
        "enabled": True,
        "context_token_threshold": 100000
    }
)

# Process until completion, automatic compaction on threshold
for event in runner:
    if hasattr(event, 'usage'):
        print(f"Current tokens: {event.usage.input_tokens}")

result = runner.until_done()
print(result.content[0].text)
```

### Memory Tool Integration

```python
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic()

# Enable both memory tool and context clearing
response = client.beta.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-5",
    max_tokens=4096,
    messages=[...],
    tools=[
        {
            "type": "memory_20250818",
            "name": "memory"
        },
        # Your other tools
    ],
    betas=["context-management-2025-06-27"],
    context_management={
        "edits": [
            {
                "type": "clear_tool_uses_20250919",
                "trigger": {"type": "input_tokens", "value": 100000}
            }
        ]
    }
)

# Claude will automatically receive warnings and can write to memory
```
