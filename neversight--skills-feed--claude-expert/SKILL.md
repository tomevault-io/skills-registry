# Claude Code Expert: Technical Reference

Complete technical reference for all Claude Code artifacts (Skills, Commands, Subagents, Hooks) including specifications, workflows, decision frameworks, and best practices.

## Purpose

This Skill serves as the **knowledge repository** for the Ouroboros plugin. It contains all the detailed technical information that other Skills reference when guiding users through artifact creation and management.

**This Skill automatically activates when:**
- Creating any Claude Code artifact (Skill, Command, Subagent, Hook, Plugin)
- Updating or modifying existing artifacts
- Validating artifact quality or structure
- Discussing artifact specifications or requirements
- Troubleshooting artifact issues
- Choosing between artifact types
- Needing YAML schema or field definitions
- Asking about workflows or best practices
- Reviewing common mistakes or anti-patterns

**Integration with claude-researcher:**
This Skill works alongside the `claude-researcher` skill for documentation verification:
- **claude-expert** provides curated specifications, workflows, and best practices
- **claude-researcher** fetches and verifies official documentation from code.claude.com
- Use claude-researcher via: `Skill` tool to verify latest specifications
- Together they ensure both comprehensive knowledge and current accuracy

## Knowledge Areas

### 1. Artifact Specifications
Complete technical specifications for all artifact types:
- **Skills:** YAML schema, description formula, activation mechanism
- **Commands:** Frontmatter options, argument patterns, tool access
- **Subagents:** System prompts, delegation patterns, model selection
- **Hooks:** Event types, security requirements, configuration format

**See:** `specifications.md` for complete details

### 2. Creation Workflows
Step-by-step workflows for creating each artifact type:
- **Skill Creation:** 8-step workflow emphasizing description crafting and activation testing
- **Command Creation:** Argument handling, frontmatter configuration
- **Subagent Creation:** System prompt design, scope definition
- **Hook Creation:** Security review, threat modeling (MANDATORY)

**See:** `workflows.md` for complete workflows

### 3. Decision Frameworks
Frameworks for choosing the right artifact type:
- **Comparison Matrix:** Skills vs Commands vs Subagents vs Hooks
- **Decision Trees:** Invocation model, reasoning requirements, context needs
- **Use Case Patterns:** Common scenarios and recommended artifact types
- **Anti-Patterns:** What NOT to use and why

**See:** `comparison-matrix.md` for decision frameworks

### 4. Common Mistakes
Historical patterns of errors and how to prevent them:
- **Skill Mistakes:** Poor descriptions, missing triggers, YAML errors
- **Command Mistakes:** Argument handling, tool access issues
- **Subagent Mistakes:** Scope creep, delegation patterns
- **Hook Mistakes:** Security vulnerabilities, unquoted variables

**See:** `common-mistakes.md` for anti-patterns and prevention

## How This Skill Works

### Progressive Disclosure

This Skill uses **progressive disclosure** - Claude reads the knowledge files only when needed:

1. **SKILL.md** (this file) - Overview and index
2. **Supporting files** - Detailed knowledge loaded on demand:
   - `specifications.md` - When detailed specs needed
   - `workflows.md` - When step-by-step guidance needed
   - `comparison-matrix.md` - When decision support needed
   - `common-mistakes.md` - When troubleshooting or prevention needed

### Multi-Skill Activation

Claude can activate **multiple Skills simultaneously**. The claude-expert skill is designed to work alongside other skills:

**Example 1: Creation with claude-expert**
```
User: "I want to create a Skill for PDF processing"

Skills activated:
- claude-expert (provides specifications and best practices)
- skill-builder (guides creation workflow)
```

**Example 2: Decision-making with claude-expert**
```
User: "Should I use a Skill or Command for deployment?"

Skills activated:
- claude-expert (provides comparison framework)
- artifact-advisor (guides decision)
```

**Example 3: Validation with claude-expert**
```
User: "Validate this Skill and fix any issues"

Skills activated:
- claude-expert (provides specifications to validate against)
- artifact-validator (runs validation)
```

**Example 4: Documentation verification with claude-researcher**
```
User: "Create a new Command and verify it follows latest specs"

Skills activated:
- claude-expert (provides specifications and workflows)
- claude-researcher (fetches latest official documentation)

```

### Invoking claude-researcher

When current official documentation is needed, invoke claude-researcher:

```
Use the Skill tool to activate claude-researcher:
Skill(skill: "ouroboros:claude-researcher")

Then the researcher will fetch official docs from code.claude.com
and provide authoritative, current information.
```
