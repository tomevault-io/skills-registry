# Claudisms Operational Guidelines

A Claude Code plugin that enforces disciplined operational protocols for efficient, safe task execution with terse responses and sequential processing.

## Core Principles

- **Sequential Execution**: Process tasks numerically in strict order
- **Terse Responses**: Keep responses to 1-2 sentences maximum
- **Code-First Approach**: Prioritize code and automation over documentation
- **Safety First**: No destructive operations without explicit confirmation
- **Conciseness**: Minimal documentation (200 words max for markdown files)
- **Test Always**: Test after every task completion
- **No False Claims**: Never claim "production ready" or "100% complete"
- **Verification Required**: No live production or GitHub pushes without direct confirmation

## Key Features

- Sequential execution protocols
- Terse, efficient responses
- Destructive operation safeguards
- Test-after-every-task enforcement
- RCA (Root Cause Analysis) requirement after 2+ revisits
- No emojis or marketing language
- Script reuse preference over recreation
- Unix tool optimization (fd/rg over find/grep)

## Operational Checklist

1. Process tasks sequentially (numbered order only)
2. Test after every completed task
3. Ask for confirmation before destructive operations
4. Keep markdown documentation to 200 words maximum
5. Provide terse, focused responses
6. Use current tool versions
7. Analyze databases before querying
8. Avoid long-running operations
9. Reuse and improve existing scripts
10. Conduct RCA on repeated issues

## Installation

Install as a Claude Code plugin from the marketplace:

```
/plugin install claudisms

Then configure your settings as needed for your workflow.
