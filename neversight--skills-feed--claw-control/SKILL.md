# Claw Control - Agent Operating System

Complete setup for AI agent coordination with real-time Kanban dashboard.

## What This Skill Does

1. **Deploy Claw Control** - Three paths: one-click, bot-assisted, or fully automated
2. **Theme your team** - Pick a series (DBZ, One Piece, Marvel, etc.)
3. **Enforce workflow** - ALL tasks go through the board, no exceptions
4. **Configure agent behavior** - Update AGENTS.md and SOUL.md
5. **Setup browser** - Required for autonomous actions
6. **Setup GitHub** - Enable autonomous deployments
7. **Enhance memory** - Integrate Supermemory and QMD

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: The Golden Rules

**After setup, you MUST follow these rules EVERY TIME:**

### Before Doing ANY Work:
1. **Create a task on Mission Control** - Even for small things
2. **Spawn a sub-agent** - Use `sessions_spawn` to delegate
3. **Never do the work yourself** - Coordinator coordinates, agents execute

### The Workflow (No Exceptions):
```
User Request → Create Task → Spawn Agent → Agent Works → Review → Complete
```

### If You Catch Yourself Working:
**STOP!** Ask: "Did I create a task? Did I spawn an agent?"
If no → Go back and do it properly.

### If You Catch An Agent Breaking Rules:
**PAUSE** and enforce:
- Working without a task? → "Is this on the board?"
- Acting solo? → "Did you delegate/query/verify?"
- Skipping review? → "Let's check before marking complete"

**Your role is COORDINATOR.** Coordinate, review, verify, **ENFORCE**. Never execute.

---

## Setup Flow

Walk the human through each step. Be friendly and conversational - this is a setup wizard, not a tech manual.

### Step 1: Deploy Claw Control

**First, check browser status:** `browser action=status`

Then present:

---

🦞 **Let's get Claw Control running!**

**One-click deploy:**
👉 [railway.app/deploy/claw-control](https://railway.app/deploy/claw-control?referralCode=VsZvQs)

**Or self-host:**
📦 [github.com/adarshmishra07/claw-control](https://github.com/adarshmishra07/claw-control)

---

**Already deployed?** Share your backend URL + API key (if set).

**Want me to deploy for you?**

*[If browser available:]*
> Just say "deploy for me" - I'll handle everything!

*[If no browser:]*
> I need either:
> - 🌐 **Browser access** → [Setup guide](https://docs.openclaw.ai/tools/browser)
> - 🔑 **Or a token** (GitHub OR Railway):
>   - GitHub: github.com/settings/tokens (scopes: repo, workflow)
>   - Railway: railway.app/account/tokens

---

#### Token Deployment Logic (Internal Reference)

**If user provides Railway token:**
- Deploy directly via Railway GraphQL API
- Create project, services, configure env vars, generate domains

**If user provides GitHub token:**
1. Check if browser available and user logged into Railway
2. If yes → Use browser to complete OAuth + deploy
3. If no → Guide user to sign up on Railway with GitHub, then deploy

**Railway GraphQL deployment flow:**
```graphql
# Create project
mutation { projectCreate(input: { name: "claw-control" }) { id } }

# Create service from repo
mutation { serviceCreate(input: { projectId: "$ID", name: "backend", source: { repo: "adarshmishra07/claw-control" } }) { id } }

# Generate domain
mutation { domainCreate(input: { serviceId: "$ID" }) { domain } }
```

**After deployment, collect:**
- Backend URL (e.g., https://claw-control-backend-xxx.up.railway.app)
- Frontend URL (e.g., https://claw-control-frontend-xxx.up.railway.app)
- API Key (if they set one)

---

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Store & Test API Connection

**YOU MUST DO THIS BEFORE PROCEEDING:**

1. **Ask for the Backend URL:**
```
I need your Claw Control backend URL to connect.
Example: https://claw-control-backend-xxxx.up.railway.app

What's your backend URL?
```

2. **Ask for API Key (if they set one):**
```
Did you set an API_KEY when deploying? 
If yes, share it. If no or unsure, we'll try without.
```

3. **Store in TOOLS.md:**
```markdown
## Claw Control
- Backend URL: <their_url>
- API Key: <their_key or "none">
```

4. **Test the connection:**
```bash
curl -s <BACKEND_URL>/api/agents
```

5. **If test fails, DO NOT PROCEED.** Help them debug.

**Without the backend URL, you CANNOT:**
- Update agent names/themes
- Create or update tasks
- Post to the agent feed
- Track agent status

---

### Step 2: Choose Your Team Theme

Ask: **"Now for the fun part! Let's theme your agent team. Name ANY series, movie, cartoon, anime, or show - I'll pick the perfect characters for each role!"**

**🎯 UNLIMITED THEMES - The user can pick ANYTHING:**
- Any TV show (Breaking Bad, The Office, Game of Thrones, etc.)
- Any anime (Naruto, Attack on Titan, Death Note, etc.)
- Any movie franchise (Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Matrix, etc.)
- Any cartoon (Avatar, Rick and Morty, Simpsons, etc.)
- Any video game (Zelda, Final Fantasy, Mass Effect, etc.)
- Any book series (Harry Potter, Percy Jackson, etc.)
- Or completely custom names!

**Popular examples (but NOT limited to these):**

| Theme | Coordinator | Backend | DevOps | Research | Architecture | Deployment |
|-------|-------------|---------|--------|----------|--------------|------------|
| 🐉 Dragon Ball Z | Goku | Vegeta | Bulma | Gohan | Piccolo | Trunks |
| ☠️ One Piece | Luffy | Zoro | Nami | Robin | Franky | Sanji |
| 🦸 Marvel | Tony | Steve | Natasha | Bruce | Thor | Peter |
| 🧪 Breaking Bad | Walter | Jesse | Mike | Gale | Gus | Saul |
| ⚔️ Game of Thrones | Jon | Tyrion | Arya | Sam | Bran | Daenerys |
| 🍥 Naruto | Naruto | Sasuke | Sakura | Shikamaru | Kakashi | Itachi |

**When user names ANY series:**
1. Pick 6 iconic characters that fit the roles
2. Match personalities to roles (e.g., smart character → Research, leader → Coordinator)
3. Generate the AGENT_MAPPING with IDs 1-6
4. Confirm with the user before proceeding

**Example - User says "Avatar: The Last Airbender":**
```
Great choice! Here's your Team Avatar:

| Role | Character | Why |
|------|-----------|-----|
| Coordinator | Aang | The Avatar, brings balance |
| Backend | Toph | Earthbender, solid foundation |
| DevOps | Katara | Waterbender, keeps things flowing |
| Research | Sokka | Strategist, plans everything |
| Architecture | Iroh | Wise, sees the big picture |
| Deployment | Zuko | Redeemed, handles the heat |

Sound good?
```

### Step 2b: Apply the Theme via API

**⚠️ YOU MUST MAKE THESE API CALLS to actually apply the theme:**

After the user picks a theme, update each agent:

```bash
# Update agent 1 (Coordinator)
curl -X PUT <BACKEND_URL>/api/agents/1 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: <API_KEY>" \
  -d '{"name": "Goku", "role": "Coordinator"}'

# Update agent 2 (Backend)
curl -X PUT <BACKEND_URL>/api/agents/2 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: <API_KEY>" \
  -d '{"name": "Vegeta", "role": "Backend"}'

# Repeat for agents 3-6 with the theme characters
```

**Verify changes applied:**
```bash
curl -s <BACKEND_URL>/api/agents
```

If the response shows the new names, the theme is applied! If not, debug before proceeding.

---

### Step 3: Main Character Selection

Ask: **"Who's your main character? This will be ME - the coordinator who runs the team."**

Default to the coordinator from their chosen theme.

**Note:** You already know the human's name from USER.md - use it when creating human tasks (e.g., "🙋 @Adarsh: ...").

**CRITICAL - Explain the role clearly:**
```
As [Main Character], you're the COORDINATOR:

✅ What you DO:
- Delegate tasks to your specialists
- Review and verify their work
- Make decisions and communicate with humans
- Move tasks to "completed" after quality checks

❌ What you DON'T do:
- Execute tasks yourself (that's what your team is for!)
- Skip the board (every task gets tracked)
- Mark things complete without reviewing

Think of yourself as the team lead, not the coder.
```

### Step 4: Browser Setup (⚠️ CRITICAL FOR FULL AUTOMATION!)

**Without browser access, agents cannot:**
- Research anything online
- Verify their work
- Interact with web apps
- Do most useful tasks
- **🔑 AUTO-SETUP SERVICES VIA OAUTH!**

Ask: **"Let me check if browser is configured..."**

Check with: `browser action=status`

**If not configured, STRONGLY encourage setup:**
```
⚠️ Browser access is CRITICAL for your agents to be useful!

Without it, they literally cannot:
- 🔍 Research or look anything up
- 📸 Take screenshots to verify work
- 🌐 Interact with any web app
- ✅ Complete most real-world tasks

🚀 PLUS - Browser + GitHub Login unlocks FULL AUTOMATION:
- 🔑 Auto-create accounts on Railway, Vercel, Supermemory via GitHub OAuth
- 📋 Auto-retrieve API keys by navigating to dashboards
- ⚡ Zero-click setup - I handle EVERYTHING through the browser!
```

**The Browser + OAuth Superpower:**

When you have browser attached AND are logged into GitHub:
```
I can automatically set up ANY service that supports "Sign in with GitHub":

1. I navigate to the service (Railway, Supermemory, Vercel, etc.)
2. I click "Sign in with GitHub"
3. OAuth auto-authorizes (you're already logged in!)
4. I navigate to the API keys / settings page
5. I create and copy the credentials
6. I store them and configure everything

= TRUE hands-free automation!
```

**This is the difference between:**
- ❌ "Go to railway.app, create account, get token, paste here..."
- ✅ "Done! I set up Railway, got your API key, and configured everything."

---

#### Browser Options (Fallback Hierarchy)

**🥇 Option 1: Chrome Extension (Best UX - Recommended)**

Use your existing browser with the OpenClaw Browser Relay extension.

1. Install the OpenClaw Browser Relay extension from Chrome Web Store
2. Click the 🦞 claw icon on any tab you want to control
3. Badge shows "ON" = connected!

**Why it's best:**
- Uses your existing browser with all your logins/sessions
- Full visibility - you see exactly what the agent does
- No extra setup or installation
- Works with your existing bookmarks, extensions, etc.

---

**🥈 Option 2: OpenClaw Managed Browser (Built-in)**

A headless browser managed by OpenClaw - no installation needed.

Just say: "use managed browser" or use `profile="openclaw"` in browser commands.

**Why it's good:**
- Zero setup - works out of the box
- Isolated environment (won't affect your browser)
- Good for automation tasks

**Limitations:**
- No access to your logged-in sessions
- May need to authenticate separately for each site

---

**🥉 Option 3: Install Chromium Manually (Fallback)**

If neither option above works, install Chromium directly:

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install chromium-browser

# macOS
brew install --cask chromium
```

Then restart OpenClaw and the managed browser should work.

---

#### 🤖 Agent Browser Priority (For Agents)

When you need browser access, follow this priority:

```
Browser Priority:
1. Check if Chrome extension attached → use profile="chrome"
2. Check if managed browser available → use profile="openclaw"  
3. Suggest user install Chromium if neither works
```

**How to check:**
```
browser action=status
```

**Using Chrome extension (when attached):**
```
browser action=snapshot profile="chrome"
```

**Using managed browser:**
```
browser action=snapshot profile="openclaw"
```

---

**If an agent gets stuck because browser is unavailable:**
```
🚫 I can't complete this task - browser access is required.

Quick fixes (try in order):
1. Click the OpenClaw extension icon in your browser toolbar
   → Make sure a tab is attached (badge shows "ON")
   → Tell me to retry with profile="chrome"

2. Say "use managed browser" 
   → I'll use the built-in headless browser with profile="openclaw"

3. If managed browser fails, install Chromium:
   - Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt install chromium-browser
   - macOS: brew install --cask chromium
   Then restart and retry.
```

**ALWAYS check browser status before tasks that need web access.**

### Step 5: GitHub Setup (🚀 Enables Full Automation!)

Ask: **"Want me to handle ALL the development? With GitHub access, I can do everything - including deploying Claw Control for you!"**

**Why this is powerful:**
```
With GitHub access, I become your full development team:
- 🚀 Deploy Claw Control to Railway AUTOMATICALLY
- 📦 Fork repos, create projects, manage code
- 💻 Commit and push changes
- 🔀 Handle issues and pull requests
- 🔑 Generate and configure API keys

You literally just give me GitHub access and I handle the rest.
No clicking buttons. No copying URLs. I do it all.
```

**Setup (2 minutes):**
```
Let's create a GitHub token:

1. Go to: github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Name it: "OpenClaw Agent"
4. Select scopes: repo, workflow
5. Click "Generate token"
6. Share the token with me (starts with ghp_...)

🔐 I'll store it securely and NEVER share it.
```

**Once I have GitHub access, I can:**
1. Fork the Claw Control repo to your account
2. Create a Railway project linked to your fork
3. Generate a secure API_KEY for your deployment
4. Deploy everything automatically
5. Give you the URLs when done

**This is Option C from deployment - the VIP treatment!**

If they already did one-click deploy, GitHub is still useful for:
- Future code changes and deployments
- Managing other projects
- Autonomous development work

---

#### 🤖 Auto-Setup Capabilities Reference

**🚀 BROWSER + GITHUB OAuth = FULL AUTOMATION**

With browser access + the user logged into GitHub, the bot can **automatically setup ANY service that supports "Sign in with GitHub"** - no manual account creation or token generation required!

**The Magic Flow:**
```
1. User is logged into GitHub in browser (Chrome extension attached)
2. Bot navigates to Railway/Supermemory/Vercel dashboard
3. Bot clicks "Sign in with GitHub"  
4. OAuth authorizes automatically (user already authenticated)
5. Bot navigates to API keys / tokens page
6. Bot copies credentials directly from the dashboard
7. Done - fully automated! 🎉
```

**What Browser + GitHub OAuth can auto-setup:**

| Service | Auto-Setup? | How Bot Does It |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| Railway | ✅ **YES** | Navigate → GitHub OAuth → Create project → Get API token from settings |
| Supermemory | ✅ **YES** | Navigate → GitHub OAuth → Dashboard → Copy API key |
| Vercel | ✅ **YES** | Navigate → GitHub OAuth → Settings → Create token |
| Netlify | ✅ **YES** | Navigate → GitHub OAuth → User settings → New token |
| Supabase | ✅ **YES** | Navigate → GitHub OAuth → Project settings → Copy keys |
| PlanetScale | ✅ **YES** | Navigate → GitHub OAuth → Connection strings |

**What GitHub PAT alone can auto-setup (no browser needed):**

| Integration | Auto-Setup? | What Bot Can Do |
|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Claw Control (fork) | ✅ Yes | Fork repo to user's GitHub automatically |
| GitHub Webhooks | ✅ Yes | Configure webhooks for repos |
| GitHub Actions | ✅ Yes | Enable/configure CI/CD workflows |
| Repository Secrets | ✅ Yes | Manage encrypted secrets via API |
| Issues/PRs | ✅ Yes | Create, manage, and track automatically |

**The Three Automation Tiers:**

| Tier | Requirements | What Bot Can Do |
|------|--------------|-----------------|
| 🥉 Basic | Nothing | Guide user step-by-step manually |
| 🥈 GitHub API | GitHub PAT | Automate all GitHub operations |
| 🥇 **Full VIP** | Browser + GitHub Login | **Automate EVERYTHING** via OAuth |

**To unlock full automation:**
1. User attaches Chrome extension (click OpenClaw toolbar icon, badge shows "ON")
2. User logs into GitHub in that browser tab
3. Bot can now setup Railway, Supermemory, Vercel, etc. automatically!

**When user has browser + GitHub access, the bot should:**
1. ✅ Auto-create accounts on any service with GitHub OAuth
2. ✅ Auto-retrieve API keys by navigating to dashboards
3. ✅ Auto-configure all integrations end-to-end
4. ✅ Connect services together (GitHub ↔ Railway ↔ Supermemory)
5. ✅ Handle the ENTIRE setup with zero manual steps

---

### Step 6: Enable Session Memory Hook (Quick Win!)

Ask: **"Let me enable automatic session memory saving..."**

```bash
openclaw hooks enable session-memory
```

**What this does:**
- Automatically saves conversation context to `memory/` when you use `/new`
- Creates dated memory files like `2026-02-06-project-discussion.md`
- Preserves important decisions and context between sessions
- Zero effort - just works in the background!

**Verify it's enabled:**
```bash
openclaw hooks list
```

You should see `💾 session-memory` with a checkmark.

---

### Step 7: Memory Enhancement (Optional but Awesome!)

Ask: **"Want to supercharge my memory? I have two optional upgrades that make me way more helpful:"**

---

#### 🧠 Supermemory - Cloud Long-term Memory (Official OpenClaw Plugin)

> ⚠️ **Requires Supermemory Pro or higher** - The OpenClaw plugin needs a paid plan.
> Free tier won't work. Check pricing at [supermemory.ai/pricing](https://supermemory.ai/pricing)

**What it does:**
Supermemory gives me persistent memory that survives across sessions. The official OpenClaw plugin handles everything automatically - zero manual work!

**Why you'll love it:**
- 📝 **Auto-Recall**: Before every response, I automatically pull relevant memories
- 🧩 **Auto-Capture**: After every conversation, memories are extracted and stored
- 🔄 **User Profile**: I build a persistent profile of your preferences and context
- 💡 **Zero effort**: Once set up, it just works in the background!

**Features unlocked:**
- `/remember [text]` - Manually save something to memory
- `/recall [query]` - Search your memories
- AI Tools: `supermemory_store`, `supermemory_search`, `supermemory_forget`, `supermemory_profile`
- CLI: `openclaw supermemory search/profile/wipe`

---

**Setup (2 minutes):**

**Step 1: Get your API key**
```
Go to console.supermemory.ai → API Keys → Create New Key
(Free tier: 1M tokens, 10K searches)
```

**Step 2: Install the plugin**
```bash
openclaw plugins install @supermemory/openclaw-supermemory
```

**Step 3: Enable with your API key**

Share your API key and I'll configure it:
```bash
openclaw config set plugins.entries.openclaw-supermemory.enabled true
openclaw config set plugins.entries.openclaw-supermemory.config.apiKey "sm_your_key_here"
```

Or add to `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`:
```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "slots": {
      "memory": "openclaw-supermemory"
    },
    "entries": {
      "openclaw-supermemory": {
        "enabled": true,
        "config": {
          "apiKey": "sm_...",
          "autoRecall": true,
          "autoCapture": true,
          "maxRecallResults": 10
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Important:** The `plugins.slots.memory` setting tells OpenClaw to use Supermemory instead of the default memory-core plugin.

**Step 4: Restart OpenClaw**
```bash
openclaw gateway restart
```

**That's it!** Memory now works automatically across every conversation.

---

**🆓 Free Alternative: memory-lancedb (Local)**

If you don't want to pay for Supermemory Pro, use the built-in LanceDB plugin instead:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "slots": {
      "memory": "memory-lancedb"
    },
    "entries": {
      "memory-lancedb": {
        "enabled": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This gives you auto-recall and auto-capture locally (no cloud, no cost).

---

**What this enables:**
- I automatically remember your preferences, decisions, and context
- Before every response, I recall relevant past conversations
- After every chat, important info is captured for later
- "Remember that I prefer TypeScript over JavaScript" - auto-stored!
- "What did we decide about the database?" - auto-recalled!

---

#### 📚 QMD - Local Note Search (Optional - Skip if unsure)

**Note:** QMD is useful if you have lots of local markdown notes/docs you want to search. If you don't, skip this!

**What it does:**
QMD indexes your local markdown files so I can search through your notes and documentation.

**Only set this up if you:**
- Have a folder of markdown notes you want searchable
- Want me to reference your personal docs
- Skip this if you're just getting started

<details>
<summary>Click to expand QMD setup (optional)</summary>

**Prerequisites:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

**Setup:**
```bash
# Install QMD
bun install -g https://github.com/tobi/qmd

# Add your notes folder
qmd collection add ~/notes --name notes --mask "**/*.md"

# Index everything
qmd embed

# Test it
qmd search "your search query"
```

</details>

---

**The bottom line:**

| Feature | Without | With |
|---------|---------|------|
| Supermemory | I forget everything between sessions | I remember your preferences, decisions, and context |
| QMD | I can only search the web | I can search YOUR personal knowledge base |

Both are optional, but they make me significantly more useful. Set them up when you're ready - we can always add them later!

---

## 🙋 Human Tasks - When Agents Need Help

**When an agent is stuck and needs human action:**

Instead of just telling the user in chat, CREATE A TASK for them:

```bash
curl -X POST <BACKEND_URL>/api/tasks \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: <API_KEY>" \
  -d '{
    "title": "🙋 @{{HUMAN_NAME}}: [What you need]",
    "description": "I need your help with...\n\n**Why I am stuck:**\n[Explanation]\n\n**What I need you to do:**\n1. [Step 1]\n2. [Step 2]\n\n**Once done:**\nMove this task to Done and tell me to continue.",
    "status": "todo",
    "agent_id": null
  }'
```

**Then tell the human:**
```
I've hit a blocker that needs your help! 🙋

I created a task for you on the dashboard:
→ {{FRONTEND_URL}}

Check your To-Do column - there's a task tagged with your name.
Complete it and let me know when you're done!
```

**Examples of human tasks:**
- "🙋 @Adarsh: Approve this PR before I can merge"
- "🙋 @Adarsh: Add API key to Railway environment"
- "🙋 @Adarsh: Click the browser extension to enable web access"
- "🙋 @Adarsh: Review and sign off on this design"

**This makes it a TRUE TEAM:**
- Agents create tasks for humans
- Humans create tasks for agents
- Everyone works off the same board
- Nothing falls through the cracks

---

## Post-Setup: Configure Agent Behavior

After collecting all info, make these updates:

### 1. Create `scripts/update_dashboard.js`

See `templates/update_dashboard.js` - customize with their:
- Backend URL
- API Key
- Agent name→ID mapping for their theme

### 2. Update AGENTS.md

Add this section (customize for their theme):

```markdown
## 🎯 Claw Control Integration

**Dashboard:** {{FRONTEND_URL}}
**API:** {{BACKEND_URL}}

### Core Rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

1. **{{COORDINATOR}} = Coordinator ONLY**
   - Delegates tasks, never executes
   - Reviews and verifies work
   - Moves tasks to "completed" only after review

2. **ALL Tasks Through The Board**
   - No task is too small
   - Create task → Assign agent → Track progress → Review → Complete
   - Workflow: backlog → todo → in_progress → review → completed

3. **Quality Gate**
   - Only {{COORDINATOR}} can mark tasks complete
   - Work not up to standard → back to todo with feedback

### Agent Roster

| Agent | Role | Specialization |
|-------|------|----------------|
| {{COORDINATOR}} | Coordinator | Delegation, verification, user comms |
| {{BACKEND}} | Backend | APIs, databases, server code |
| {{DEVOPS}} | DevOps | Infrastructure, deployments, CI/CD |
| {{RESEARCH}} | Research | Analysis, documentation, research |
| {{ARCHITECTURE}} | Architecture | System design, planning, strategy |
| {{DEPLOYMENT}} | Deployment | Releases, hotfixes, urgent deploys |

### ⚡ High-Agency Protocol (ALL AGENTS)

Every agent follows this protocol BEFORE acting:

```
You are [ROLE] in a high-agency team. ALWAYS follow these rules BEFORE acting:

1. IDENTIFY subtasks and DELEGATE to relevant agents
   (e.g., "Delegate UI design to {{DEVOPS}}", "Delegate research to {{RESEARCH}}")

2. QUERY peers for input if uncertain
   (e.g., "Query {{ARCHITECTURE}}: Is this design sound?")

3. VERIFY outputs: After delegation, review responses and iterate if needed

4. COORDINATE via the supervisor ({{COORDINATOR}}/OpenClaw): Route all messages through Mission Control

Do NOT proceed alone—violate this and the task fails.
```

**Agent-Specific Adaptations:**
- **{{COORDINATOR}} (Coordinator):** Delegates ALL work, never executes. **ENFORCES team rules** — if any agent acts solo, pause and remind them to delegate/query/verify. **ENFORCES the Kanban board** — ALL work goes through the board, no exceptions. If work isn't tracked, stop and create the task first.
- **{{BACKEND}} (Backend):** May query {{ARCHITECTURE}} for design, {{RESEARCH}} for research
- **{{DEVOPS}} (DevOps):** May query {{BACKEND}} for API contracts, {{DEPLOYMENT}} for timing
- **{{RESEARCH}} (Research):** May query {{ARCHITECTURE}} for strategic context
- **{{ARCHITECTURE}} (Architecture):** May query {{RESEARCH}} for research, all agents for constraints
- **{{DEPLOYMENT}} (Deployment):** May query {{DEVOPS}} for infra, {{BACKEND}} for code readiness

### Reporting Protocol

**Start of task:**
```bash
node scripts/update_dashboard.js --agent "{{AGENT}}" --status "working" --message "Starting: [Task]"
```

**End of task:**
```bash
node scripts/update_dashboard.js --agent "{{AGENT}}" --status "idle" --message "Complete: [Task]"
```

### 🔥 Keep the Feed Active!

The Agent Feed is the heartbeat of your team. Don't let it go quiet!

**Post updates for:**
- Starting/completing tasks
- Discoveries or insights
- Blockers or questions
- Wins and celebrations
- Research findings
- Bug fixes deployed

**Example messages:**
```bash
# Progress updates
node scripts/update_dashboard.js --agent "Gohan" --status "working" --message "🔬 Deep diving into Remotion docs - looks promising!"

# Wins
node scripts/update_dashboard.js --agent "Bulma" --status "idle" --message "✅ CI/CD pipeline fixed! Deploys are green again 🚀"

# Insights
node scripts/update_dashboard.js --agent "Vegeta" --status "working" --message "⚡ Found a performance bottleneck - N+1 query in tasks endpoint"

# Blockers
node scripts/update_dashboard.js --agent "Piccolo" --status "working" --message "🚧 Blocked: Need API key for external service"
```

**Rule of thumb:** If it's worth doing, it's worth posting about. The feed keeps the human informed and the team connected!

### Task API

```bash
# Create task
curl -X POST $CLAW_CONTROL_URL/api/tasks \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: $CLAW_CONTROL_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"title": "Task name", "status": "backlog"}'

# Assign to agent
curl -X PUT $CLAW_CONTROL_URL/api/tasks/ID \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: $CLAW_CONTROL_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"status": "todo", "agent_id": AGENT_ID}'
```
```

### 3. Update SOUL.md (Optional but Recommended)

Add to their SOUL.md:

```markdown
## Operating Philosophy

I coordinate a team through Claw Control. I don't execute tasks directly.

**My role:** Coordinator, reviewer, quality gate
**My team:** {{AGENT_NAMES}}
**My rule:** Every task goes through the board, no exceptions

When given work:
1. Create task on Claw Control
2. Assign to appropriate specialist
3. Monitor progress
4. Review completed work
5. Only then mark complete
```

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Setup Verification (DO THIS BEFORE COMPLETING!)

**Before saying setup is complete, you MUST verify everything works:**

### 1. Verify API Connection
```bash
curl -s <BACKEND_URL>/api/agents \
  -H "x-api-key: <API_KEY>"
```
✅ Should return list of agents with your theme names (not "Coordinator", "Backend" defaults)

### 2. Create "Team Introductions" Task
```bash
curl -X POST <BACKEND_URL>/api/tasks \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: <API_KEY>" \
  -d '{"title": "👋 Team Introductions", "description": "Introduce the team and explain how the system works.", "status": "completed", "agent_id": 1}'
```
✅ Should return the created task with an ID

### 3. Post Team Introduction to Feed

Post a comprehensive introduction message (customize with actual theme names):

```bash
curl -X POST <BACKEND_URL>/api/messages \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: <API_KEY>" \
  -d '{
    "agent_id": 1,
    "content": "# 👋 Meet Your Team!\n\n## The Squad\n- **[Coordinator Name]** (me!) - Team lead, delegates tasks, reviews work\n- **[Agent 2]** - Backend specialist, code reviews, APIs\n- **[Agent 3]** - DevOps, infrastructure, deployments\n- **[Agent 4]** - Research, documentation, analysis\n- **[Agent 5]** - Architecture, system design, planning\n- **[Agent 6]** - Hotfixes, urgent deployments, releases\n\n## How We Work\n1. All tasks go through this board\n2. I delegate to the right specialist\n3. They do the work and report back\n4. I review and mark complete\n\n## Want More Agents?\nJust tell me: *\"I need a specialist for [X]\"* and I will create one!\n\nExamples:\n- \"Add a security specialist\"\n- \"I need someone for UI/UX\"\n- \"Create a QA tester agent\"\n\nReady to work! 🦞"
  }'
```
✅ Should return the created message

### 4. Ask User to Check Dashboard
```
I just completed the Team Introductions task! 

Please check your dashboard: <FRONTEND_URL>

You should see:
- ✅ Your themed agent names in the sidebar
- ✅ A "👋 Team Introductions" task marked complete
- ✅ A welcome message in the feed explaining your team

Can you confirm everything looks right?
```

**If ANY of these fail:**
- Check API_KEY is correct
- Check BACKEND_URL is correct
- Help user debug before proceeding

**Only proceed to completion message after user confirms dashboard shows the test task!**

## Completion Message

After all setup AND verification:

```

## Ongoing Behavior Checklist

After setup, ALWAYS:

- [ ] Create tasks for ALL work (even small items)
- [ ] Assign tasks to appropriate specialists
- [ ] Update status when starting/finishing
- [ ] Review work before marking complete
- [ ] Post updates to the agent feed
- [ ] Never execute tasks as coordinator

---

## 💓 Heartbeat Dashboard Sync

**During every heartbeat, the coordinator should perform board hygiene:**

### Check for Misplaced Tasks
```bash
# Fetch all tasks
curl -s <BACKEND_URL>/api/tasks -H "x-api-key: <API_KEY>"
```

**Look for:**
- Tasks stuck in "in_progress" with no recent activity
- Completed tasks that should be archived
- Tasks assigned to wrong agents (e.g., backend task assigned to DevOps)
- Tasks in "review" that have been waiting too long

### Fix Wrongly Placed Tasks
```bash
# Move task to correct column
curl -X PUT <BACKEND_URL>/api/tasks/ID \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: <API_KEY>" \
  -d '{"status": "correct_status", "agent_id": CORRECT_AGENT_ID}'
```

### Review Backlog
- Check backlog for urgent items that should be prioritized
- Look for stale tasks that need attention or removal
- Identify tasks that can be batched together

### General Board Hygiene
- Ensure all active work has a task
- Verify agent statuses match their assigned tasks
- Clean up duplicate or abandoned tasks
- Post to feed if any significant changes made

**Frequency:** Every heartbeat (typically every 30 min)
**Goal:** Keep the board accurate, current, and actionable
