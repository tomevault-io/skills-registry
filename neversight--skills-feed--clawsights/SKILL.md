# Clawsights — Upload Your Claude Code Stats

Before starting, create a task list with these items so the user can see progress:
1. Get GitHub identity
2. Generate insights report
3. Read and preview report
4. Confirm upload preferences
5. Upload to Clawsights
6. Show results

Mark each task as in_progress when you start it and completed when done. Follow these steps exactly:

## Step 1: Get GitHub Identity

Tell the user: "I'll grab your GitHub identity so Clawsights can create your profile at clawsights.dev/{handle}."

Run these commands to get the user's GitHub handle and auth token:

```bash
gh api user --jq '.login'
```

```bash
gh auth token
```

If `gh` is not installed or the user is not logged in, tell them:
- Install: `brew install gh` (or see https://cli.github.com)
- Login: `gh auth login`

Store the handle and token for later use. Do not show the token to the user.

## Step 2: Run /insights

Run the `/insights` skill to generate a fresh report. Wait for it to complete fully.

## Step 3: Read the Report

Read the file at `~/.claude/usage-data/report.html`.

Also extract the subtitle line for the preview. It looks like:
```
<p class="subtitle">38,539 messages across 4769 sessions | 2025-12-19 to 2026-02-09</p>
```

## Step 4: Show Preview and Ask About Narratives

Display a preview of what will appear on their profile. Extract these from the report HTML and show them:

```
=== Clawsights Upload Preview ===
GitHub: @{handle}
Date range: {date_from} to {date_to}

Messages:      {totalMessages}
Sessions:      {totalSessions}
Lines Changed: +{linesAdded} / -{linesRemoved}
Days Active:   {daysActive}
Msgs/Day:      {msgsPerDay}
Files Touched: {filesTouched}
Top Languages: {top 3 languages from the chart}

How You Use Claude Code:
  {first 3 lines of the usage narrative, followed by "..."}

Impressive Things You Did:
  {first 3 win titles, followed by "..."}

This will be publicly visible at clawsights.dev/{handle}
```

Omit any section that has no data. Then use the AskUserQuestion tool to ask TWO questions:

**Question 1:** "Include narrative sections on your public profile?"
- Options:
  - "Yes" — Include "How You Use Claude Code" and "Impressive Things You Did" sections on your profile
  - "No" — Only show quantitative stats (messages, lines, languages, etc.)

**Question 2:** "Ready to upload?"
- Options:
  - "Upload" — Upload stats to clawsights.dev
  - "Cancel" — Don't upload anything

If they choose Cancel, stop here.

Store whether they chose to include narratives as `include_narratives` (true/false).

## Step 5: Upload

First, determine the upload URL. Run this command and use the output as the base URL:

```bash
echo ${CLAWSIGHTS_URL:-https://clawsights.dev}
```

Then make a POST request using that base URL:

```bash
curl -s -X POST BASE_URL/api/upload \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"github_token\": \"TOKEN_HERE\", \"report_html\": $(cat ~/.claude/usage-data/report.html | jq -Rs .), \"include_narratives\": BOOLEAN_HERE}"
```

Replace `BASE_URL` with the output from the echo command above.
Replace `TOKEN_HERE` with the actual token from Step 1.
Replace `BOOLEAN_HERE` with `true` or `false` based on the user's choice in Step 4.

## Step 6: Show Result

Parse the JSON response and display:

```
Uploaded! View your profile: https://clawsights.dev/{handle}

Your percentiles:
  Messages: top {X}%
  Sessions: top {X}%
  Velocity: top {X}%
  Scale: top {X}%
  Multi-clauding: top {X}%
```

If the upload fails, show the error message from the response.
