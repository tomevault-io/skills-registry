description: Use when the user asks to "clean transient comments", "remove temporary comments", or remove comments that describe past changes rather than documenting current code.

Remove comments that read like commit messages or dev notes about refactors.

## Detection Heuristics

Flag comments that:
- Use past tense or temporal words ("now", "was", "used to", "moved", "changed", "updated", "fixed")
- Reference where code came from or went ("moved to X", "extracted from Y")
- Explain *that* something changed rather than *why* it exists

Examples to remove:
- `// This is now done via mixin`
- `// Moved to ItemFunctions.java`
- `// Updated to use new API`

## Preserve

- WHY explanations (rationale, edge cases, warnings)
- TODO/FIXME with ongoing relevance
- Ticket/issue references
- Domain logic documentation

## Process

### Phase 1: Scan

Scan provided paths, or default to src/, lib/, and common source files.

### Phase 2: Report

List files, specific comments planned for removal with context, and rationale.

**Wait for approval before removing.**

### Phase 3: Remove

After approval, delete flagged comments. Preserve all code structure and formatting.
