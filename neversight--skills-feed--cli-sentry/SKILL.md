# Sentry CLI Issue Management

> **Compatibility**: This skill is compatible with `sentry-cli` v3 only.
>
> **Important**: `sentry-cli api` was removed in v3. Do **not** use `sentry-cli api` for anything. Use `~/.agents/skills/cli-sentry/scripts/sentry-api.sh` for API calls (see [API Access](#api-access) and [API Fallbacks](#api-fallbacks)).
>
> **File paths**: All `scripts/` and `references/` paths in this skill resolve under `~/.agents/skills/cli-sentry/`. Do not look for them in the current working directory.

## Overview

Expert guidance for managing Sentry issues via the CLI and API. Use this skill for fetching, triaging, categorizing, and resolving Sentry issues.

**Key capabilities:**

- Preflight validation of sentry-cli installation and auth
- List and filter issues by status, time period, and query
- Categorize issues (Valid, False Positive, Already Resolved, Third Party)
- Resolve, mute, and unresolve issues (individually or in bulk)

## Safety Rules

**Prohibited operations:**

- `sentry-cli api` — Removed in v3. Use `sentry-api.sh` instead
- `DELETE /issues/{id}/` - Issue deletion (irreversible)
- Project or release deletion
- Bulk status changes without explicit user confirmation
- Modifying alert rules, notification settings, or project configuration

**Allowed operations:**

- Listing and viewing issues (read-only)
- Resolving issues (reversible via unresolve)
- Muting/ignoring issues (reversible via unmute)
- Fetching event details and stack traces

## API Access

> **NEVER manually parse `~/.sentryclirc` or construct `Authorization` headers.**
> All Sentry API calls MUST go through one of these scripts:
>
> - `~/.agents/skills/cli-sentry/scripts/fetch-issues.sh` — list unresolved issues with rich JSON
> - `~/.agents/skills/cli-sentry/scripts/sentry-api.sh` — general-purpose authenticated API wrapper
>
> These scripts handle credential resolution internally. Do not use `$SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` directly.

### `sentry-api.sh` Usage

```bash
bash ~/.agents/skills/cli-sentry/scripts/sentry-api.sh METHOD PATH [BODY]
```

- `METHOD`: GET, PUT, POST (DELETE is rejected)
- `PATH`: Sentry API path — `{org}` and `{project}` placeholders are auto-substituted from config
- `BODY`: optional JSON string for PUT/POST

## Prerequisites

### Configuration (`~/.sentryclirc`)

Sentry credentials are stored in `~/.sentryclirc` (the native sentry-cli config file):

```ini
[auth]
token=sntrys_...

[defaults]
org=your-org-slug
project=your-project-slug
```

- **`token`** — Org token (`sntrys_`) or user token (`sntryu_`). Both use `Authorization: Bearer`. Generate at https://sentry.io/settings/account/api/auth-tokens/
- **`org`** — Your organization slug in Sentry
- **`project`** — Your project slug in Sentry

> Environment variables (`SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`, `SENTRY_ORG`, `SENTRY_PROJECT`) override rc file values when set. The rc file is the primary persistent store.

### Setup: Missing Configuration

Before running any Sentry operation, run the preflight check:

```bash
bash ~/.agents/skills/cli-sentry/scripts/check-sentry.sh -v
```

If the preflight check fails with exit code 4 (missing config), prompt the user for each missing value using `AskUserQuestion`, then write the values to `~/.sentryclirc`:

- If the file doesn't exist, create it with `[auth]` and `[defaults]` sections
- If the file exists, add missing keys under the appropriate section (`token` → `[auth]`, `org`/`project` → `[defaults]`)
- Re-run the preflight check to confirm

### Configuration Resolution Order

Settings resolve in this order (first wins):

1. CLI flags (`--org`, `--project`)
2. Environment variables (`SENTRY_ORG`, `SENTRY_PROJECT`, `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`)
3. `~/.sentryclirc`

## Issue Management

### List Issues (CLI)

```bash
# List all issues
sentry-cli issues list --project <project>

# List with status filter
sentry-cli issues list --project <project> --status unresolved

# Full search syntax (Sentry query language)
sentry-cli issues list --project <project> --query "is:unresolved browser.name:Chrome"

# Pagination control (default: 5 pages)
sentry-cli issues list --project <project> --pages 10
```

### List Issues (API - Richer Data)

Use `~/.agents/skills/cli-sentry/scripts/fetch-issues.sh` for triage-quality JSON with metadata, culprit, event counts, and timestamps:

```bash
bash ~/.agents/skills/cli-sentry/scripts/fetch-issues.sh --org=<org> --project=<project>
bash ~/.agents/skills/cli-sentry/scripts/fetch-issues.sh --org=<org> --project=<project> --stats-period=7d --limit=50
```

### Get Issue Details (API)

```bash
bash ~/.agents/skills/cli-sentry/scripts/sentry-api.sh GET /issues/{issue_id}/ | jq
```

### Get Latest Event / Stack Trace (API)

```bash
bash ~/.agents/skills/cli-sentry/scripts/sentry-api.sh GET /issues/{issue_id}/events/latest/ | jq '.exception // {note: "no exception data"}'
```

### Resolve / Mute / Unresolve (CLI)

```bash
# Resolve
sentry-cli issues resolve --project <project> -i <issue_id>

# Mute (ignore)
sentry-cli issues mute --project <project> -i <issue_id>

# Unresolve
sentry-cli issues unresolve --project <project> -i <issue_id>

# Resolve in next release only
sentry-cli issues resolve --project <project> -i <issue_id> --next-release
```

## Issue Categorization

Categorize each issue into one of four categories:

### 1. Valid

Genuine application errors requiring investigation and fixes.

**Indicators:**

- Stack trace points to application code (`src/`, `app/`, `webpack://`)
- Error originates from application logic, not external code
- Reproducible user-facing issues
- API errors from application endpoints

### 2. False Positive

Errors that appear as issues but are not actual problems.

**Indicators:**

- Network errors from user connectivity issues (timeouts, DNS failures)
- Browser-specific quirks not affecting functionality
- Expected errors (e.g., 401 for unauthenticated users, 404 for deleted resources)
- Errors from automated bots/crawlers

### 3. Already Resolved

Issues that have been fixed in subsequent deployments.

**Indicators:**

- Last seen date predates a known fix
- No recent occurrences (check `lastSeen` field)
- Related code has been refactored or removed
- Issue matches a closed GitHub issue or merged PR

### 4. Third Party

Errors originating from browser extensions or external scripts. See `~/.agents/skills/cli-sentry/references/extension-patterns.md` for comprehensive detection patterns.

**Indicators:**

- Stack trace contains extension URLs (`chrome-extension://`, `moz-extension://`, etc.)
- Error from injected scripts (`inpage.js`, `content.js`, `inject.js`)
- Known extension error messages (`ResizeObserver loop`, `Extension context invalidated`)
- Stack trace mentions known extensions (MetaMask, Grammarly, LastPass, etc.)

## Triage Workflow

1. **Preflight** - Run `bash ~/.agents/skills/cli-sentry/scripts/check-sentry.sh -v` to verify config and auth. If missing, prompt the user and write to `~/.sentryclirc`
2. **Fetch** - Run `bash ~/.agents/skills/cli-sentry/scripts/fetch-issues.sh --org=<org> --project=<project>` to get all unresolved issues
3. **Inspect** - For each issue, fetch its latest event to examine the stack trace:
   ```bash
   bash ~/.agents/skills/cli-sentry/scripts/sentry-api.sh GET /issues/{issue_id}/events/latest/ \
     | jq '.exception.values[0].stacktrace.frames // empty'
   ```
   Check `culprit`, `title`, `metadata`, `lastSeen`, and event count
4. **Categorize** - Assign each issue to Valid, False Positive, Already Resolved, or Third Party
5. **Present** - Summarize in a triage report table:

```markdown
## Sentry Issue Triage Report

### Valid (N issues)

| Issue | Title | Events | Last Seen |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PROJ-123 | TypeError in Component | 45 | 2h ago |

### Third Party (N issues)

| Issue | Title | Source | Events |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PROJ-126 | ResizeObserver loop | Browser Extension | 234 |

### False Positives (N issues)

| Issue | Title | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PROJ-128 | Network Error | User connectivity |

### Already Resolved (N issues)

| Issue | Title | Last Seen | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PROJ-130 | Hydration mismatch | 14d ago | Fixed in v2.3.1 |
```

## Bulk Actions

After triage, resolve or mute issues in bulk. Always confirm with the user before executing.

```bash
# Bulk resolve via API
bash ~/.agents/skills/cli-sentry/scripts/sentry-api.sh PUT \
  "/projects/{org}/{project}/issues/?id=123&id=456&id=789" \
  '{"status": "resolved"}'

# Bulk ignore/mute via API
bash ~/.agents/skills/cli-sentry/scripts/sentry-api.sh PUT \
  "/projects/{org}/{project}/issues/?id=123&id=456&id=789" \
  '{"status": "ignored"}'
```

| Issue details      | Script | `bash ~/.agents/skills/cli-sentry/scripts/sentry-api.sh GET /issues/{id}/`                                                      |
| Latest event       | Script | `bash ~/.agents/skills/cli-sentry/scripts/sentry-api.sh GET /issues/{id}/events/latest/`                                        |

| Unresolve          | CLI    | `sentry-cli issues unresolve --project <p> -i <id>`                                                                             |
| Bulk update        | Script | `bash ~/.agents/skills/cli-sentry/scripts/sentry-api.sh PUT "/projects/{org}/{project}/issues/?id=..." '{"status":"resolved"}'` |

## Tips

1. Run `sentry-cli info` to verify configuration and auth status from any source
2. Pipe API responses through `jq` for readable output: `... | jq '.[] | {shortId, title, count, lastSeen}'`
3. Triage Third Party issues first - they are the easiest to identify and often the most numerous
4. Check `~/.agents/skills/cli-sentry/references/extension-patterns.md` before categorizing ambiguous stack traces
