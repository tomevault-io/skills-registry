# CLRS Data Structures & Algorithms Reference

A comprehensive reference for data structures and algorithms based on "Introduction to Algorithms" (CLRS). This skill provides language-agnostic guidance with pseudocode examples that can be translated to any programming language.

## When This Skill Activates

This skill automatically activates when you:
- Ask about or need to implement a data structure
- Need to choose between data structures for a problem
- Discuss time/space complexity trade-offs
- Need algorithm implementations (sorting, searching, graph algorithms)
- Mention specific structures: B-tree, heap, hash table, graph, etc.

## Decision Guides

- [Which Data Structure Should I Use?](data-structure-selection.md) - Decision guide by use case
- [Complexity Cheat Sheet](complexity-cheat-sheet.md) - Quick reference for Big-O

## How to Use This Reference

1. **Choosing a structure**: Start with the decision guides
2. **Learning a structure**: Read the full documentation with examples
3. **Quick reminder**: Use the tables above for at-a-glance reference
4. **Implementation**: Follow the pseudocode, adapt to your language

## Language Translation Notes

The pseudocode in this reference uses these conventions:
- `class` for type definitions
- `function` for methods/functions
- `->` for method calls on objects
- `//` for comments
- Type hints shown as `name: Type`

Translate to your language:
- **PHP**: `class`, `function`, `->`, `//`, type hints in docblocks or PHP 8+
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: `class`, `function`/arrow, `.`, `//`, TS types
- **Python**: `class`, `def`, `.`, `#`, type hints
- **Java/C#**: Direct mapping with `new`, generics
