# Delegate to Code Janitor

When you encounter **repetitive, mechanical code tasks**, launch the `code-janitor` agent instead of doing the work yourself to preserve context.

## Delegate When:

- Fixing multiple linting errors across files
- Renaming variables/functions consistently across codebase
- Updating import statements in multiple files
- Fixing formatting or style violations throughout project
- Resolving IDE diagnostics in batch
- Bulk refactoring that doesn't require design decisions

## Keep in Main When:

- Task requires architectural decisions
- Single file with 1-2 changes
- User explicitly wants you to do it

## How:

Use Task tool with `subagent_type: "essentials:code-janitor"` providing task description and scope.

The code-janitor agent uses TodoWrite to track work, iterates until complete, and verifies with linters.
