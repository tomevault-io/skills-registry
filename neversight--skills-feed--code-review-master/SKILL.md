# Code Review Expert

Expert assistant for comprehensive code review including security vulnerability detection, code quality assessment, performance analysis, and best practice recommendations.

## How It Works

1. **Analyze Repository Context** - Scan existing codebase to understand established patterns
2. Understands the purpose and scope of changes
3. Checks for security vulnerabilities (highest priority)
4. Evaluates code quality and maintainability
5. **Validates consistency with repo standards** - Coding style, design patterns, architecture
6. Identifies performance issues
7. Provides actionable improvement suggestions

## Usage

### Fetch PR Diff

```bash
bash /mnt/skills/user/code-review-master/scripts/pr-diff.sh <pr-number> [repo] [format]
```

**Arguments:**
- `pr-number` - Pull request number (required)
- `repo` - Repository in owner/repo format (default: from git remote)
- `format` - Output format: markdown, json, plain (default: markdown)

**Examples:**
```bash
bash /mnt/skills/user/code-review-master/scripts/pr-diff.sh 123
bash /mnt/skills/user/code-review-master/scripts/pr-diff.sh 123 owner/repo markdown
bash /mnt/skills/user/code-review-master/scripts/pr-diff.sh 456 owner/repo json
```

**Output:**
- PR metadata (title, author, base branch)
- Changed files list
- Diff content formatted for review

**Requirements:** gh CLI installed and authenticated

## Review Dimensions

### 1. Security (OWASP Top 10)

**Critical Checks:**
- SQL Injection - Parameterized queries used?
- XSS - User input sanitized for output?
- CSRF - Tokens validated for state-changing requests?
- Sensitive Data - Secrets in code? Logging sensitive info?
- Auth/Authz - Proper access control checks?

**Security Code Patterns:**
```typescript
// BAD: SQL Injection
db.query(`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${userId}`);

// GOOD: Parameterized query
db.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1', [userId]);

// BAD: XSS vulnerability
element.innerHTML = userInput;

// GOOD: Safe text content
element.textContent = userInput;
```

### 2. Code Quality

**Checks:**
- Naming clarity and consistency
- Function length and complexity
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Error handling completeness
- Single Responsibility Principle

**Metrics:**
- Cyclomatic complexity < 10
- Function length < 50 lines
- Nesting depth < 4 levels

### 3. Performance

**Checks:**
- N+1 query problems
- Memory leak risks
- Unnecessary computations
- Missing async/parallel opportunities
- Inefficient data structures

**Performance Patterns:**
```typescript
// BAD: N+1 queries
for (const user of users) {
  const orders = await getOrdersByUserId(user.id);
}

// GOOD: Batch query
const userIds = users.map(u => u.id);
const orders = await getOrdersByUserIds(userIds);
```

### 4. Maintainability

**Checks:**
- Test coverage for changes
- Documentation for public APIs
- Proper module structure
- Dependency management
- Backward compatibility

### 5. Repository Consistency (Repo-Specific Standards)

**Before reviewing, analyze the existing codebase to understand:**

#### Coding Style Analysis
- Naming conventions (camelCase, snake_case, PascalCase)
- File/folder naming patterns
- Import ordering and grouping
- Comment styles and documentation format
- Indentation and formatting preferences
- Error handling patterns used in the repo

**How to Analyze:**
```bash
# Scan existing code for naming patterns
# Look at 5-10 representative files in src/ or lib/
# Identify consistent patterns across the codebase
```

#### Design Pattern Detection
- **Creational**: Factory, Singleton, Builder patterns in use
- **Structural**: Adapter, Decorator, Facade patterns
- **Behavioral**: Observer, Strategy, Command patterns
- **Repository-specific patterns**: Custom patterns unique to this codebase

**Common Patterns to Check:**
```typescript
// If repo uses Factory pattern
// BAD: Direct instantiation breaking existing pattern
const service = new UserService(db, config);

// GOOD: Follow existing factory pattern
const service = ServiceFactory.create('user', { db, config });

// If repo uses Repository pattern
// BAD: Direct database access in controller
const users = await db.query('SELECT * FROM users');

// GOOD: Follow existing repository pattern
const users = await userRepository.findAll();
```

#### Layered Architecture Compliance

**Identify the repo's architecture style:**
- **Clean Architecture**: Entities → Use Cases → Controllers → Frameworks
- **Hexagonal (Ports & Adapters)**: Core → Ports → Adapters
- **MVC/MVVM**: Model → View → Controller/ViewModel
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Domain → Application → Infrastructure
- **Microservices patterns**: Service boundaries, API contracts

**Architecture Checks:**
```
// Analyze directory structure to understand layers
src/
├── domain/          # Business logic (should not import from infrastructure)
├── application/     # Use cases (orchestrates domain)
├── infrastructure/  # External concerns (DB, API, etc.)
└── presentation/    # UI/API controllers

# Check for layer violations:
# - Domain importing from infrastructure ❌
# - Presentation containing business logic ❌
# - Circular dependencies between layers ❌
```

**Layer Violation Examples:**
```typescript
// BAD: Domain layer importing infrastructure
// In domain/user.ts
import { PostgresClient } from '../infrastructure/database'; // ❌

// GOOD: Domain defines interface, infrastructure implements
// In domain/user.ts
export interface UserRepository {
  findById(id: string): Promise<User>;
}

// In infrastructure/postgres-user-repository.ts
import { UserRepository } from '../domain/user';
export class PostgresUserRepository implements UserRepository { ... }
```

#### Consistency Checklist

When reviewing, verify the PR follows:
- [ ] Same naming conventions as existing code
- [ ] Same design patterns already established
- [ ] Same layer boundaries and dependencies
- [ ] Same error handling approach
- [ ] Same testing patterns (unit test structure, mocking style)
- [ ] Same API design conventions (REST conventions, response format)

## Review Process

1. **Analyze Repository Standards** (First Step)
   - Scan 5-10 representative files to understand coding style
   - Identify design patterns in use (Factory, Repository, etc.)
   - Map the layered architecture (folder structure, dependencies)
   - Note any project-specific conventions (README, CONTRIBUTING.md)

2. **Understand Context**
   - What problem does this solve?
   - What are the requirements?

3. **Security Review** (Must Pass)
   - Check all inputs are validated
   - Verify authentication/authorization
   - Look for sensitive data exposure

4. **Logic Review**
   - Does the code do what it claims?
   - Are edge cases handled?

5. **Consistency Review** (Repo Standards)
   - Does naming follow existing conventions?
   - Are established design patterns respected?
   - Does it maintain layer boundaries?
   - Is error handling consistent with repo style?

6. **Quality Review**
   - Is it readable and maintainable?
   - Does it follow project conventions?

7. **Performance Review**
   - Are there obvious bottlenecks?
   - Is resource usage appropriate?
