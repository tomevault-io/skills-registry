# Codebase Researcher

Systematic deep research skill that analyzes codebases from the top level down, generating comprehensive knowledge about project structure, architecture, and implementation patterns.

## Purpose

Conduct systematic research of codebases to:
- Build comprehensive understanding of project architecture
- Document key components and their relationships
- Identify patterns, conventions, and best practices
- Generate knowledge bases (SKILL.md, CLAUDE.md, references/)
- Support onboarding and knowledge transfer

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- Starting work on a new codebase
- Documenting existing architecture
- Creating CLAUDE.md or SKILL.md files
- Performing comprehensive code audits
- Building team knowledge bases

## Research Methodology

### Standard Deep Research Algorithm

The research process follows a hierarchical approach:

1. **Identify Root-Level Directories** - List all significant folders, excluding common ignore patterns
2. **Spawn Specialized Subagents** - Create one subagent per important directory
3. **Parallel Analysis** - Each subagent analyzes its assigned directory deeply
4. **Aggregate Findings** - Combine insights into cohesive documentation
5. **Generate Artifacts** - Produce SKILL.md, CLAUDE.md, and references/

### Directory Filtering

Automatically exclude from research:
- `node_modules/`, `venv/`, `.venv/`, `env/`
- `dist/`, `build/`, `out/`, `.next/`, `target/`
- `.git/`, `.svn/`, `.hg/`
- Hidden directories (starting with `.`) unless specifically relevant
- `__pycache__`, `*.egg-info`

Include in research:
- Source code directories (`src/`, `lib/`, `app/`)
- Configuration directories (`.roo/`, `.claude/`, `config/`)
- Documentation (`docs/`, `specs/`, `architecture/`)
- Scripts and tooling (`scripts/`, `tools/`, `cli/`)
- Tests (`tests/`, `__tests__/`, `spec/`)

## Using the Slash Command

Execute deep research via the provided slash command:

```bash
/deep-research
```

This command will:
1. Scan root-level directories
2. Determine which directories are important
3. Generate and execute a `claude` command with `--agents` flag
4. Spawn one subagent per important directory
5. Collect and synthesize findings

See [`scripts/deep_research.sh`](scripts/deep_research.sh) for implementation details.

## Script Integration

### Deep Research Script

The `scripts/deep_research.sh` script automates the research process:

**Key Features:**
- Automatically filters ignored directories via `.gitignore` patterns
- Dynamically generates subagents JSON for `claude --agents`
- Spawns parallel analysis tasks
- Aggregates results into structured output

**Usage:**
```bash
# From skill directory
./scripts/deep_research.sh [output_dir]

# From project root
./.roo/skills/codebase-researcher/scripts/deep_research.sh ./output
```

### Subagent Generation

The script uses `claude --agents` to programmatically create specialized subagents:

```json
{
  "cli-analyzer": {
    "description": "Analyze CLI directory structure and command patterns",
    "prompt": "You are an expert at analyzing CLI tooling. Examine the directory structure, identify command patterns, and document the architecture.",
    "tools": ["Read", "Glob", "Grep", "Bash"]
  },
  "skills-analyzer": {
    "description": "Analyze skills directory and documentation",
    "prompt": "You are an expert at analyzing Agent Skills. Examine skill structure, identify patterns, and document the skill ecosystem.",
    "tools": ["Read", "Glob", "Grep"]
  }
}
```

## Output Structure

Research produces:

### Primary Output: SKILL.md or CLAUDE.md

Contains:
- Project overview and purpose
- Architecture summary
- Key directories and their roles
- Important patterns and conventions
- Getting started guidance

### Supporting Output: references/

Detailed documentation organized by concern:
- `references/architecture.md` - System architecture
- `references/directory_structure.md` - Directory layout and purpose
- `references/patterns.md` - Code patterns and conventions
- `references/dependencies.md` - Dependency graph and relationships

## Research Workflow

### Phase 1: Discovery

```bash
# List root directories
ls -la

# Identify significant folders
find . -maxdepth 1 -type d ! -name ".*" ! -name "node_modules"

# Check for .gitignore patterns
cat .gitignore
```

### Phase 2: Subagent Orchestration

For each important directory, generate a specialized subagent with:
- **Name**: Derived from directory (e.g., "cli-analyzer", "docs-analyzer")
- **Description**: Directory-specific research scope
- **Prompt**: Tailored analysis instructions
- **Tools**: Read, Glob, Grep, Bash (as needed)

### Phase 3: Deep Analysis

Each subagent performs:
1. **Structure Mapping** - Document file organization
2. **Code Analysis** - Identify key functions, classes, modules
3. **Pattern Recognition** - Find conventions and idioms
4. **Dependency Tracking** - Map imports and relationships
5. **Documentation Review** - Extract existing docs

### Phase 4: Synthesis

Combine subagent findings into:
- Unified architecture documentation
- Cross-cutting concerns and patterns
- Integration points and workflows
- Knowledge base for future reference

## Best Practices

### Effective Research

1. **Start Broad, Go Deep** - Begin with high-level overview, then drill into specifics
2. **Follow the Code** - Trace execution paths and data flows
3. **Document Decisions** - Capture why things are structured as they are
4. **Identify Gaps** - Note missing documentation or unclear patterns
5. **Preserve Context** - Link related components and explain relationships

### Quality Criteria

Research output should:
- Be **accurate** - Reflect actual code structure and behavior
- Be **comprehensive** - Cover all significant components
- Be **actionable** - Enable others to work with the codebase
- Be **maintainable** - Update easily as code evolves
- Be **discoverable** - Organized for easy navigation

### Common Pitfalls

Avoid:
- **Overwhelming detail** - Focus on significant patterns, not every line
- **Outdated documentation** - Verify findings against current code
- **Isolated analysis** - Show how components relate
- **Assumption-based docs** - Confirm behavior through code inspection

## Example Research Session

```bash
# 1. Execute deep research
/deep-research

# 2. Review generated subagent plan
#    The script will show which subagents will be created

# 3. Confirm execution
#    Claude runs research with specialized subagents

# 4. Review outputs
#    - CLAUDE.md or SKILL.md in project root
#    - references/ directory with detailed documentation
```

## Integration with Existing Skills

This skill complements:
- **skill-creator** - Use research findings to create specialized skills
- **spec-writer** - Research informs specification documents
- **architecture** - Deep analysis feeds architecture documentation

## Technical Notes

### Subagent Spawning

Uses Claude Code's `--agents` flag for programmatic subagent definition:

```bash
claude --agents '{
  "subagent-name": {
    "description": "What this subagent does",
    "prompt": "Detailed instructions",
    "tools": ["Read", "Grep", "Glob"],
    "model": "sonnet"
  }
}'
```

### Headless Mode Integration

Can run non-interactively for automation:

```bash
claude -p "Perform deep research on this codebase" \
  --permission-mode plan \
  --output-format json
```
