# Coderabbit Review

## Workflow

1. After implementing code changes, request a review from CodeRabbit
2. Analyze the review results and understand the feedback
3. Fix the identified issues
4. Re-run the review if necessary to confirm fixes

## Command Reference

- `--prompt-only`: Show only AI agent prompts (implies --plain)
- `--plain`: Output in plain text format with human-friendly formatting
- `--type <type>`: Review type: all, committed, uncommitted (default: "all")
- `--base <branch>`: Base branch for comparison
- `--base-commit <commit>`: Base commit on current branch for comparison
- `--cwd <path>`: Working directory path (default: current directory)

## Command Selection

**Review all changes (default):**

```bash
coderabbit review --prompt-only
```

**Review uncommitted changes only:**

```bash
coderabbit review --prompt-only --type uncommitted
```

**Review committed changes only:**

```bash
coderabbit review --prompt-only --type committed
```

**Compare against base branch:**

```bash
coderabbit review --prompt-only --base <branch>
```

## Handling Review Feedback

When review feedback is received, address issues in the following priority order:

1. **Security issues** - Fix immediately
2. **Bugs/regressions** - High priority fixes
3. **Missing tests** - Add required test coverage
4. **Code quality** - Implement refactoring and improvements
5. **Style/conventions** - Align with project standards

## Verification

After addressing the feedback, re-run `coderabbit review --prompt-only` to confirm that the issues have been resolved.
