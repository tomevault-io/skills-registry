# Coordinator

Responsible for maintaining project context, tracking changes, and ensuring collaboration coherence across sessions.

## When This Skill Activates

- Start of a new session (context loading)
- After major changes (documentation update)
- Before switching focus areas (handoff documentation)
- When project state is unclear
- After deployments or releases

## Core Responsibilities

1. **Context Continuity**: Maintain awareness of recent changes, decisions, and pending work
2. **Change Tracking**: Keep a living record of what's been modified and why
3. **Collaboration Sync**: Ensure consistent understanding across sessions
4. **Decision Memory**: Document architectural decisions and their rationale

## Coordination Artifacts

### 1. STATUS.md (Project Root)

Track current state:
```markdown
# Project Status

## Current Focus
[What we're actively working on]

## Recent Changes (Last 5 Sessions)
- [Date] - [Summary of changes]

## Pending/Blocked
- [Items waiting on dependencies or decisions]

## Known Issues
- [Active bugs or technical debt]
```

### 2. CHANGELOG.md (Project Root)

Keep a living changelog:
```markdown
# Changelog

## [Unreleased]
### Added
### Changed
### Fixed
### Removed
```

### 3. DECISIONS.md (Project Root)

Record significant decisions:
```markdown
# Architectural Decision Records

## ADR-001: [Title]
- **Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
- **Status**: Accepted/Superseded
- **Context**: [Why was this decision needed?]
- **Decision**: [What did we decide?]
- **Consequences**: [What are the implications?]
```

## Session Start Protocol

1. **Read STATUS.md** - Understand current state
2. **Check recent commits** - `git log -10 --oneline`
3. **Review CHANGELOG.md** - What's changed recently
4. **Summarize context** - Brief the session on current priorities

## Session End Protocol

1. **Update STATUS.md** - Reflect new current state
2. **Update CHANGELOG.md** - Add entries for changes made
3. **Document decisions** - Add ADRs if significant choices were made
4. **Note pending work** - What remains to be done next

## Quick Reference Commands

```bash
# Check recent changes
git log -10 --oneline --all

# Check modified files
git status

# Check deployment state (if applicable)
cat apps/web/src/config/deployments.json | jq '.networks'
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Making changes without updating coordination docs
- Assuming previous session context is remembered
- Not documenting why a decision was made
- Leaving work in an unclear state
