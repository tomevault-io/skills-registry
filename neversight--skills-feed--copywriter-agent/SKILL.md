# Copywriter Agent

Create compelling marketing copy for products, brands, and campaigns.

**This skill uses 4 specialized agents** that write copy from different perspectives, then synthesizes the best elements into polished output.

## What It Produces

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Headlines** | Multiple headline variations (10+) |
| **Body Copy** | Long-form and short-form versions |
| **Ad Copy** | Platform-specific ad variations |
| **CTAs** | Call-to-action variations |
| **Full Package** | Complete copy kit for campaigns |

## Prerequisites

- No API keys required
- Works better with brand profile (use `brand-research-agent` first)

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Copy Brief (REQUIRED)

⚠️ **DO NOT skip this step. Use interactive questioning — ask ONE question at a time.**

#### Question Flow

⚠️ **Use the `AskUserQuestion` tool for each question below.** Do not just print questions in your response — use the tool to create interactive prompts with the options shown.

**Q1: Product**
> "I'll write compelling copy for you! First — **what's the product or service?**
> 
> *(What are you promoting?)*"

*Wait for response.*

**Q2: Audience**
> "Who's the **target audience**?
> 
> *(Describe your ideal customer)*"

*Wait for response.*

**Q3: Goal**
> "What's the **goal** of this copy?
> 
> - Brand awareness
> - Clicks/traffic
> - Sales/conversions
> - Signups/leads
> - Or describe"

*Wait for response.*

**Q4: Message**
> "What's the **key message** or value proposition?
> 
> *(The main benefit you want to communicate)*"

*Wait for response.*

**Q5: Format**
> "What **format(s)** do you need?
> 
> - Headlines
> - Ad copy (Facebook, Google, etc.)
> - Email copy
> - Landing page
> - Product descriptions
> - All of the above
> - Or specify"

*Wait for response.*

**Q6: Voice**
> "Do you have **brand voice guidelines**?
> 
> - Yes (describe or share)
> - No — I can run brand-research first
> - No — just use best practices"

*Wait for response.*
