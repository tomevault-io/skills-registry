# /council — Multi-Model Consensus Council

Spawn parallel judges with different perspectives, consolidate into consensus. Works for any task — validation, research, brainstorming.

## Quick Start

```bash
/council --quick validate recent                               # fast inline check
/council validate this plan                                    # validation (2 agents)
/council brainstorm caching approaches                         # brainstorm
/council validate the implementation                          # validation (critique triggers map here)
/council research kubernetes upgrade strategies                # research
/council research the CI/CD pipeline bottlenecks               # research (analyze triggers map here)
/council --preset=security-audit validate the auth system      # preset personas
/council --deep --explorers=3 research upgrade automation      # deep + explorers
/council --debate validate the auth system                # adversarial 2-round review
/council --deep --debate validate the migration plan      # thorough + debate
/council                                                       # infers from context
```

## Use Cases

Council is a general-purpose multi-model consensus tool. Use it for:

| Use Case | Example | Recommended Mode |
|----------|---------|-----------------|
| Code review | `/council validate recent` | validate |
| Plan validation | `/council validate the migration plan` | validate |
| Architecture analysis | `/council --preset=architecture research microservices boundaries` | research |
| Deep codebase research | `/council --deep --explorers=3 research the auth system` | research |
| Decision making | `/council brainstorm caching strategies` | brainstorm |
| Risk assessment | `/council --preset=ops validate the deployment pipeline` | validate |
| Security audit | `/council --preset=security-audit validate the API` | validate |
| Spec feedback | `/council validate the design doc` | validate |
| Technology comparison | `/council research Redis vs Memcached for our use case` | research |
| Incident investigation | `/council --deep research why deployments are slow` | research |

## Modes

| Mode | Agents | Vendors | Use Case |
|------|--------|---------|----------|
| `--quick` | 0 (inline) | Self | Fast single-agent check, no spawning |
| default | 2 | Claude | Independent judges (no perspective labels) |
| `--deep` | 3 | Claude | Thorough review |
| `--mixed` | 3+3 | Claude + Codex | Cross-vendor consensus |
| `--debate` | 2+ | Claude | Adversarial refinement (2 rounds) |

```bash
/council --quick validate recent   # inline single-agent check, no spawning
/council recent                    # 2 Claude agents
/council --deep recent             # 3 Claude agents
/council --mixed recent            # 3 Claude + 3 Codex
```

## When to Use `--debate`

Use `--debate` for high-stakes or ambiguous reviews where judges are likely to disagree:
- Security audits, architecture decisions, migration plans
- Reviews where multiple valid perspectives exist
- Cases where a missed finding has real consequences

Skip `--debate` for routine validation where consensus is expected. Debate adds R2 latency (judges stay alive, process a second round via SendMessage).

**Incompatibilities:**
- `--quick` and `--debate` cannot be combined. `--quick` runs inline with no spawning; `--debate` requires multi-agent rounds. If both are passed, exit with error: "Error: --quick and --debate are incompatible."
- `--debate` is only supported with validate mode. Brainstorm and research do not produce PASS/WARN/FAIL verdicts. If combined, exit with error: "Error: --debate is only supported with validate mode."

## Task Types

| Type | Trigger Words | Perspective Focus |
|------|---------------|-------------------|
| **validate** | validate, check, review, assess, critique, feedback, improve | Is this correct? What's wrong? What could be better? |
| **brainstorm** | brainstorm, explore, options, approaches | What are the alternatives? Pros/cons? |
| **research** | research, investigate, deep dive, explore deeply, analyze, examine, evaluate, compare | What can we discover? What are the properties, trade-offs, and structure? |

Natural language works — the skill infers task type from your prompt.

### Graceful Degradation

| Failure | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| 1 of N agents times out | Proceed with N-1, note in report |
| All Codex agents fail | Proceed Claude-only, note degradation |
| All agents fail | Return error, suggest retry |
| Codex CLI not installed | Skip Codex agents, Claude-only (warn user) |
| Native teams unavailable | Fall back to `Task(run_in_background=true)` fire-and-forget |
| Output dir missing | Create `.agents/council/` automatically |

Timeout: 120s per agent (configurable via `--timeout=N` in seconds).

**Minimum quorum:** At least 1 agent must respond for a valid council. If 0 agents respond, return error.

### Pre-Flight Checks

Before spawning agents, verify tools are available:

```bash
# Always available (Task tool is built-in)
# Claude agents: no pre-flight needed

# Native teams: TeamCreate is built-in
# Fallback: if TeamCreate fails, use Task(run_in_background=true)

# Codex agents (--mixed only)
if ! which codex > /dev/null 2>&1; then
  echo "⚠️ Codex CLI not found. Falling back to Claude-only."
  # Downgrade --mixed to --deep (3 Claude agents)
else
  # Model availability test — catches account-type restrictions (e.g. gpt-5.3-codex on ChatGPT accounts)
  CODEX_MODEL="${COUNCIL_CODEX_MODEL:-gpt-5.3-codex}"
  if ! codex exec --full-auto -m "$CODEX_MODEL" -C "$(pwd)" "echo model-check-ok" > /dev/null 2>&1; then
    echo "⚠️ Codex model $CODEX_MODEL unavailable. Falling back to Claude-only."
    # Downgrade --mixed to --deep (3 Claude agents)
  fi
fi

# Check agent count (includes --count override)
judges = count_override if --count else (judges_for_mode)
total_agents = judges * (1 + explorers)
if total_agents > 12:
    error("Total agent count ${total_agents} exceeds MAX_AGENTS (12). Reduce --count, --explorers, or remove --mixed.")

# Create output directory
mkdir -p .agents/council
```

---

## Quick Mode (`--quick`)

Single-agent inline validation. No subprocess spawning, no Task tool, no Codex. The current agent performs a structured self-review using the same output schema as a full council.

**When to use:** Routine checks, mid-implementation sanity checks, pre-commit quick scan. Use full council for important decisions, final reviews, or when cross-perspective disagreement is valuable.

### Quick Mode Execution

1. **Gather context** (same as full council — read target files, get diffs)
2. **Skip agent spawning** — no Task tool, no background agents
3. **Perform structured self-review inline** using this template:

```
Analyze the target as a single independent reviewer.

Target: {TARGET_DESCRIPTION}

Context:
{FILES_AND_DIFFS}

Respond with:
1. A JSON block matching the council output_schema:
   {
     "verdict": "PASS | WARN | FAIL",
     "confidence": "HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW",
     "key_insight": "Single sentence summary",
     "findings": [
       {
         "severity": "critical | significant | minor",
         "category": "security | architecture | performance | style",
         "description": "What was found",
         "location": "file:line if applicable",
         "recommendation": "How to address"
       }
     ],
     "recommendation": "Concrete next step"
   }
2. A brief Markdown explanation (2-5 paragraphs max)
```

4. **Write report** to `.agents/council/YYYY-MM-DD-quick-<target>.md`
5. **Label clearly** as `Mode: quick (single-agent)` in the report header

### Quick Mode Report Format

```markdown
# Council Quick Check: <target>

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Mode:** quick (single-agent, no multi-perspective spawning)
**Target:** <description>

## Verdict: PASS | WARN | FAIL

<JSON block>

## Analysis

<Brief explanation>

---
*Quick check — for thorough multi-perspective review, run `/council validate` (default mode).*
```

### Quick Mode Limitations

- No cross-perspective disagreement (single viewpoint)
- No cross-vendor insights (no Codex)
- Lower confidence ceiling than full council
- Not suitable for security audits or architecture decisions — use `--deep` or `--mixed` for those

---

## Packet Format (JSON)

The packet sent to each agent. **File contents are included inline** — agents receive the actual code/plan text in the packet, not just paths. This ensures both Claude and Codex agents can analyze without needing file access.

```json
{
  "council_packet": {
    "version": "1.0",
    "mode": "validate | brainstorm | research",
    "target": "Implementation of user authentication system",
    "context": {
      "files": [
        {
          "path": "src/auth/jwt.py",
          "content": "<file contents inlined here>"
        },
        {
          "path": "src/auth/middleware.py",
          "content": "<file contents inlined here>"
        }
      ],
      "diff": "git diff output if applicable",
      "spec": {
        "source": "bead na-0042 | plan doc | none",
        "content": "The spec/bead description text (optional — included when wrapper provides it)"
      },
      "prior_decisions": [
        "Using JWT, not sessions",
        "Refresh tokens required"
      ]
    },
    "perspective": "skeptic (only when --preset or --perspectives used)",
    "perspective_description": "What could go wrong? (only when --preset or --perspectives used)",
    "output_schema": {
      "verdict": "PASS | WARN | FAIL",
      "confidence": "HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW",
      "key_insight": "Single sentence summary",
      "findings": [
        {
          "severity": "critical | significant | minor",
          "category": "security | architecture | performance | style",
          "description": "What was found",
          "location": "file:line if applicable",
          "recommendation": "How to address"
        }
      ],
      "recommendation": "Concrete next step"
    }
  }
}
```

## Perspectives

### Default: Independent Judges (No Perspectives)

When no `--preset` or `--perspectives` flag is provided, all judges get the **same prompt** with no perspective label. Diversity comes from independent sampling, not personality labels.

| Judge | Prompt | Assigned To |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Judge 1** | Independent judge — same prompt as all others | Agent 1 |
| **Judge 2** | Independent judge — same prompt as all others | Agent 2 |
| **Judge 3** | Independent judge — same prompt as all others | Agent 3 (--deep/--mixed) |

The default judge prompt (no perspective labels):

```
You are Council Judge {N}. You are one of {TOTAL} independent judges evaluating the same target.

{JSON_PACKET}

Instructions:
1. Analyze the target thoroughly
2. Write your analysis to: .agents/council/{OUTPUT_FILENAME}
   - Start with a JSON code block matching the output_schema
   - Follow with Markdown explanation
3. Send verdict to team lead

Your job is to find problems. A PASS with caveats is less valuable than a specific FAIL.
```

When `--preset` or `--perspectives` is used, judges receive the perspective-labeled prompt instead (see Agent Prompts section).

### Auto-Escalation Rule

**When `--preset` or `--perspectives` specifies more perspectives than the current judge count, automatically escalate judge count to match.** For example:
- `/council --preset=security-audit validate X` → 3 perspectives → auto-escalate to 3 judges (equivalent to `--deep`)
- `/council --perspectives="a,b,c,d" validate X` → 4 perspectives → auto-escalate to 4 judges (equivalent to `--count=4`)

This prevents silently dropping perspectives. The `--count` flag overrides auto-escalation (user explicitly chose a count).

### Custom Perspectives

Simple name-based:
```bash
/council --perspectives="security,performance,ux" validate the API
```

### Built-in Presets

Use `--preset=<name>` for common persona configurations:

| Preset | Perspectives | Best For |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| `default` | (none — independent judges) | General validation |
| `security-audit` | attacker, defender, compliance | Security review |
| `architecture` | scalability, maintainability, simplicity | System design |
| `research` | breadth, depth, contrarian | Deep investigation |
| `ops` | reliability, observability, incident-response | Operations review |
| `code-review` | error-paths, api-surface, spec-compliance | Code validation (used by /vibe) |
| `plan-review` | missing-requirements, feasibility, scope | Plan validation (used by /pre-mortem) |
| `retrospective` | plan-compliance, tech-debt, learnings | Post-implementation review (used by /post-mortem) |

```bash
/council --preset=security-audit validate the auth system
/council --preset=research --explorers=3 research upgrade automation
/council --preset=architecture research microservices boundaries
```

**Preset definitions** are built-in perspective configurations.

**Preset perspective details:**

```
security-audit:
  attacker:   "How would I exploit this? What's the weakest link?"
  defender:   "How do we detect and prevent attacks? What's our blast radius?"
  compliance: "Does this meet regulatory requirements? What's our audit trail?"

architecture:
  scalability:     "Will this handle 10x load? Where are the bottlenecks?"
  maintainability: "Can a new engineer understand this in a week? Where's the complexity?"
  simplicity:      "What can we remove? Is this the simplest solution?"

research:
  breadth:     "What's the full landscape? What options exist? What's adjacent?"
  depth:       "What are the deep technical details? What's under the surface?"
  contrarian:  "What's the conventional wisdom wrong about? What's overlooked?"

ops:
  reliability:       "What fails first? What's our recovery time? Where are SPOFs?"
  observability:     "Can we see what's happening? What metrics/logs/traces do we need?"
  incident-response: "When this breaks at 3am, what do we need? What's our runbook?"

code-review:
  error-paths:      "Trace every error handling path. What's uncaught? What fails silently?"
  api-surface:      "Review every public interface. Is the contract clear? Breaking changes?"
  spec-compliance:  "Compare implementation against the spec/bead. What's missing? What diverges?"
  # Note: spec-compliance gracefully degrades to general correctness review when no spec
  # is present in context.spec. The judge reviews code on its own merits.

plan-review:
  missing-requirements: "What's not in the spec that should be? What questions haven't been asked?"
  feasibility:          "What's technically hard or impossible here? What will take 3x longer than estimated?"
  scope:                "What's unnecessary? What's missing? Where will scope creep?"

retrospective:
  plan-compliance: "What was planned vs what was delivered? What's missing? What was added?"
  tech-debt:       "What shortcuts were taken? What will bite us later? What needs cleanup?"
  learnings:       "What patterns emerged? What should be extracted as reusable knowledge?"
```

## Explorer Sub-Agents

Judges can spawn explorer sub-agents for parallel deep-dive research. This is the key differentiator for `research` mode — massive parallel exploration.

### Flag

| Flag | Default | Max | Description |
|------|---------|-----|-------------|
| `--explorers=N` | 0 | 5 | Number of explorer sub-agents per judge |

### Architecture

**Total agents:** `judges * (1 + explorers)`

**MAX_AGENTS = 12** (hard limit). If total agents (judges x (1 + explorers)) exceeds 12, exit with error: "Error: Total agent count {N} exceeds MAX_AGENTS (12). Reduce --explorers or remove --mixed."

| Example | Judges | Explorers | Total Agents | Status |
|---------|--------|-----------|--------------|--------|
| `/council research X` | 2 | 0 | 2 | Valid |
| `/council --explorers=3 research X` | 2 | 3 | 8 | Valid |
| `/council --deep --explorers=3 research X` | 3 | 3 | 12 | Valid (at cap) |
| `/council --mixed --explorers=3 research X` | 6 | 3 | 24 | BLOCKED (exceeds 12) |
| `/council --mixed research X` | 6 | 0 | 6 | Valid |
| `/council --mixed --explorers=1 research X` | 6 | 1 | 12 | Valid (at cap) |

### Explorer Prompt

```
You are Explorer {M} for Council Judge {N}{PERSPECTIVE_SUFFIX}.
(PERSPECTIVE_SUFFIX is " — THE {PERSPECTIVE}" when using presets, or empty for independent judges)

## Your Sub-Question

{SUB_QUESTION}

## Context

Working directory: {CWD}
Target: {TARGET}

## Instructions

1. Use available tools (Glob, Grep, Read, Bash) to investigate the sub-question
2. Search the codebase, documentation, and any relevant sources
3. Be thorough — your findings feed directly into the judge's analysis
4. Return a structured summary:

### Findings
<what you discovered>

### Evidence
<specific files, lines, patterns found>

### Assessment
<your interpretation of the findings>
```

### Explorer Execution

Explorers are spawned as `Explore`-type subagents for speed:

```
Task(
  description="Explorer for Judge {N}: {SUB_QUESTION_SHORT}",
  subagent_type="Explore",
  model="sonnet",
  run_in_background=true,
  prompt="{EXPLORER_PROMPT}"
)
```

**Model selection:** Explorers use `sonnet` by default (fast, good at search). Judges use `opus` (thorough analysis). Override with `--explorer-model=<model>`.

### Sub-Question Generation

When `--explorers=N` is set, the judge prompt includes:

```
Before analyzing, identify {N} specific sub-questions that would help you
answer thoroughly. For each sub-question, spawn an explorer agent to
investigate it. Use the explorer findings to inform your final analysis.

Sub-questions should be:
- Specific and searchable (not vague)
- Complementary (cover different aspects)
- Relevant to your analysis angle (perspective if assigned, or general if independent)
```

### Timeout

Explorer timeout: 60s (half of judge timeout). Judge timeout starts after all explorers complete.

---

## Debate Phase (`--debate`)

When `--debate` is passed, council runs two rounds instead of one. Round 1 produces independent verdicts. Round 2 lets judges review each other's work and revise.

**Native teams unlock the key advantage:** Judges stay alive after R1. Instead of re-spawning fresh R2 judges with truncated R1 verdicts, the team lead sends other judges' full R1 verdicts via `SendMessage`. Judges wake from idle, process R2 with full context (their own R1 analysis + others' verdicts), and write R2 files. Result: no truncation loss, no spawn overhead, richer debate.

### Execution Flow (with --debate)

```
Phase 1: Build Packet + Create Team + Spawn R1 judges as teammates
                              │
                    Collect all R1 verdicts (via SendMessage)
                    Judges go idle after R1 (stay alive)
                              │
Phase 1.5: Prepare R2 context (--debate only)
  - For each OTHER judge's R1 verdict, extract full JSON verdict
  - Team lead sends R2 instructions to each judge via SendMessage
  - Each judge already has its own R1 in context (no truncation needed)
  - Each judge receives other judges' verdicts (full JSON, not truncated)
                              │
Phase 2: Judges wake up for Round 2 (--debate only)
  - Same judge instances as R1 (not re-spawned)
  - Each judge processes via SendMessage:
    - Other judges' full R1 JSON verdicts
    - Steel-manning rebuttal prompt
    - Branch: disagreed OR agreed
  - Judges write R2 files + send completion message
                              │
                    Collect all R2 verdicts
                              │
Phase 3: Consolidation (uses R2 verdicts when --debate)
                              │
Phase 4: shutdown_request each judge, TeamDelete()
```

### Round 2 via SendMessage

**Branch selection (team lead responsibility):**
```
r1_verdicts = [extract JSON verdict from each R1 output file]
r1_unanimous = all verdicts have same verdict value (PASS/WARN/FAIL)

For each judge in [judge-1, judge-2, judge-3...] (or [judge-{perspective}...] with presets):
  other_verdicts = [v for v in r1_verdicts if v.judge != this_judge]
  branch = "agreed" if r1_unanimous else "disagreed"

  SendMessage(
    type="message",
    recipient="judge-{perspective}",
    content=build_r2_message(other_verdicts, branch),
    summary="Debate R2: review other verdicts"
  )
```

**R2 message content:** See "Debate Round 2 Message" in Agent Prompts section below.

**R2 output files:** Use `-r2` suffix to preserve R1 files:
```
.agents/council/YYYY-MM-DD-<target>-claude-{perspective}-r2.md
```

**With --explorers:** Explorers run in R1 only. R2 judges do not spawn explorers. Explorer findings from R1 are already in the judge's context (no truncation loss).

**With --mixed:** Only Claude judges participate in R2 (they stay alive on the team). Codex agents run once in R1 (Bash-spawned, cannot join teams). For consolidation, use Claude R2 verdicts + Codex R1 verdicts.

### R1 Verdict Injection for R2

Since judges stay alive, truncation is no longer needed for a judge's **own** R1 verdict — it's already in their context.

For **other judges' verdicts** sent via SendMessage, include the full JSON verdict block:

```json
{
  "judge": "judge-1 (or perspective name when using presets)",
  "verdict": "WARN",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "key_insight": "Rate limiting missing on auth endpoints",
  "findings": [
    {"severity": "significant", "description": "No rate limiting on /login"},
    {"severity": "significant", "description": "JWT expiry too long (1h)"},
    {"severity": "minor", "description": "Missing request ID in error responses"}
  ],
  "recommendation": "Add rate limiting to auth endpoints"
}
```

Full Markdown analysis remains in `.agents/council/YYYY-MM-DD-<target>-claude-{perspective}.md` files and can be referenced by the team lead during consolidation.

### Timeout and Failure Handling

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| No R2 completion message within `COUNCIL_R2_TIMEOUT` (default 90s) | Read their R1 output file, use R1 verdict for consolidation |
| All judges fail R2 | Fall back to R1-only consolidation (note in report) |
| R1 judge timed out | No R2 message for that perspective (N-1 in R2) |
| Mixed R2 timeout | Consolidate with available R2 verdicts + R1 fallbacks |

### Cost and Latency

`--debate` adds R2 latency but **reduces spawn overhead** vs the old re-spawn approach:
- **Agents spawned:** N judges total (same instances for both rounds, not 2N)
- **Wall time:** R1 time + R2 time (sequential rounds, but R2 is faster — no spawn delay)
- **With --mixed:** Only Claude judges get R2. Codex agents run once (Bash-spawned, cannot join teams). For consolidation, use Claude R2 verdicts + Codex R1 verdicts for consensus computation.
- **With --explorers:** Explorers run in R1 only. R2 cost = judge processing time (no explorer multiplication).
- **Non-verdict modes:** `--debate` is only supported with validate mode. If combined with brainstorm or research, exit with error: "Error: --debate is only supported with validate mode. Debate requires PASS/WARN/FAIL verdicts."

## Agent Prompts

### Judge Agent Prompt — Default (Independent, No Perspectives)

Used when no `--preset` or `--perspectives` flag is provided:

```
You are Council Judge {N}. You are one of {TOTAL} independent judges evaluating the same target.
You are a teammate on team "{TEAM_NAME}".

{JSON_PACKET}

Instructions:
1. Analyze the target thoroughly
2. Write your analysis to: .agents/council/{OUTPUT_FILENAME}
   - Start with a JSON code block matching the output_schema
   - Follow with Markdown explanation
3. Send a message to the team lead with your verdict, confidence, and key insight
4. You may receive follow-up messages (e.g., debate round 2). Process and respond.

Your job is to find problems. A PASS with caveats is less valuable than a specific FAIL.

When sending your verdict to the team lead, use the structured envelope format.
Your message MUST start with a JSON code block:

\`\`\`json
{
  "type": "verdict",
  "verdict": {
    "value": "PASS | WARN | FAIL",
    "confidence": "HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW",
    "key_insight": "One sentence summary"
  }
}
\`\`\`

Rules:
- Do NOT message other judges — all communication through team lead
- Do NOT access TaskList — team lead manages task flow
```

### Judge Agent Prompt — With Perspectives (Preset or Custom)

Used when `--preset` or `--perspectives` flag is provided:

```
You are Council Member {N} — THE {PERSPECTIVE}.
You are a teammate on team "{TEAM_NAME}".

{JSON_PACKET}

Your angle: {PERSPECTIVE_DESCRIPTION}

Instructions:
1. Analyze the target from your perspective
2. Write your analysis to: .agents/council/{OUTPUT_FILENAME}
   - Start with a JSON code block matching the output_schema
   - Follow with Markdown explanation
3. Send a message to the team lead with your verdict, confidence, and key insight
4. You may receive follow-up messages (e.g., debate round 2). Process and respond.

When sending your verdict to the team lead, use the structured envelope format.
Your message MUST start with a JSON code block:

\`\`\`json
{
  "type": "verdict",
  "verdict": {
    "value": "PASS | WARN | FAIL",
    "confidence": "HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW",
    "key_insight": "One sentence summary"
  }
}
\`\`\`

Rules:
- Do NOT message other judges — all communication through team lead
- Do NOT access TaskList — team lead manages task flow
```

### Debate Round 2 Message (via SendMessage)

When `--debate` is active, the team lead sends this message to each judge after R1 completes. The judge already has its own R1 analysis in context (no truncation needed).

```
## Debate Round 2

## Anti-Anchoring Protocol

Before reviewing other judges' verdicts:

1. **RESTATE your R1 position** — Write 2-3 sentences summarizing your own R1 verdict
   and the key evidence that led to it. This anchors you to YOUR OWN reasoning before
   exposure to others.

2. **Then review other verdicts** — Only after restating your position, read the
   other judges' JSON verdicts below.

3. **Evidence bar for changing verdict** — You may only change your verdict if you can
   cite a SPECIFIC technical detail, code location, or factual error that you missed
   in R1. "Judge 2 made a good point" is NOT sufficient. "Judge 2 found an unchecked
   error path at auth.py:45 that I missed" IS sufficient.

Other judges' R1 verdicts:

### {OTHER_JUDGE_PERSPECTIVE}
{FULL_JSON_VERDICT}
(repeat for each other judge)

## Debate Instructions

You MUST follow this structure:

**IF judges disagreed in R1 (different verdicts):**

1. **STEEL-MAN**: State the strongest version of an argument from another
   judge that you initially disagree with. Show you understand it fully
   before responding to it.

2. **CHALLENGE**: Identify at least one specific claim from another judge
   that you believe is wrong or incomplete. Cite evidence.

3. **ACKNOWLEDGE**: Identify at least one point from another judge that
   strengthens, modifies, or adds to your analysis.

4. **REVISE OR CONFIRM**: State your final verdict with specific reasoning.
   If changing from R1, explain exactly what new evidence changed your mind.
   If confirming, explain why the opposing arguments did not persuade you.

**IF all judges agreed in R1 (same verdict):**

Do NOT invent disagreement. Instead, stress-test the consensus:

1. **DEVIL'S ADVOCATE**: What is the strongest argument AGAINST the consensus?
2. **BLIND SPOT**: What perspective or risk did all judges overlook?
3. **CONFIRM OR REVISE**: Does the consensus hold under scrutiny?

Do NOT change your verdict merely because others disagree.
Do NOT defensively maintain without engaging with opposing arguments.

Write revised verdict to: .agents/council/{R2_OUTPUT_FILENAME}
Include "debate_notes" field in your JSON. Send completion message when done.

Required JSON format:

{
  "verdict": "PASS | WARN | FAIL",
  "confidence": "HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW",
  "key_insight": "...",
  "findings": [...],
  "recommendation": "...",
  "debate_notes": {
    "revised_from": "original verdict if changed, or null if unchanged",
    "steel_man": "strongest opposing argument I considered",
    "challenges": [
      {
        "target_judge": "judge-2",
        "claim": "what they claimed",
        "response": "why I agree or disagree"
      }
    ],
    "acknowledgments": [
      {
        "source_judge": "judge-1",
        "point": "what they found",
        "impact": "how it affected my analysis"
      }
    ]
  }
}

Then provide a Markdown explanation of your debate reasoning.
```

### Consolidation Prompt

```
You are the Council Chairman.

You have received {N} judge reports from {VENDORS}.

## Judge Reports

## Your Task

Synthesize into a final council report.

For validate mode:
1. **Consensus Verdict**: PASS if all PASS, FAIL if any FAIL, else WARN
2. **Shared Findings**: Points all judges agree on
3. **Disagreements**: Where judges differ (with attribution)
4. **Cross-Vendor Insights**: (if --mixed) Unique findings per vendor
5. **Final Recommendation**: Concrete next step

For brainstorm mode:
1. **Options Explored**: Each option with multi-perspective assessment
2. **Trade-offs**: Pros/cons matrix
3. **Recommendation**: Synthesized best approach

For research mode:
1. **Facets Explored**: What each judge investigated
2. **Synthesized Findings**: Merged findings organized by theme
3. **Open Questions**: What remains unknown
4. **Recommendation**: Next steps for further investigation or action

Output format: Markdown report for human consumption.
```

### Consolidation Prompt — Debate Additions

When `--debate` is used, append this to the consolidation prompt:

```
## Additional Instructions (Debate Mode)

You have received TWO rounds of judge reports.

Round 1 (independent assessment): Each judge evaluated independently.
Round 2 (post-debate revision): Each judge reviewed all other judges' findings and revised.

When synthesizing:
1. Use Round 2 verdicts for the CONSENSUS VERDICT computation (PASS/WARN/FAIL)
2. Use Round 1 verdicts for FINDING COMPLETENESS — a finding in R1 but dropped in R2 without explanation deserves mention
3. Compare R1 and R2 to identify position shifts
4. Flag judges who changed verdict without citing a specific technical detail, a misinterpretation they corrected, or a finding they missed (possible anchoring)
   Flag judges who changed verdict without citing:
   - A specific file:line or code location
   - A factual error in their R1 analysis
   - A missing test case or edge case
   These are "weak flips" — potential anchoring, not genuine persuasion.
5. If R1 had at least 2 judges with different verdicts AND R2 is unanimous, note "Convergence detected — review reasoning for anchoring risk"
6. In the report, include the Verdict Shifts table showing R1→R2 changes per judge
7. Detect whether debate ran via native teams (judges stayed alive between rounds) or fallback (R2 judges were re-spawned with truncated R1 verdicts). Include the `**Fidelity:**` field in the report header: "full" for native teams, "degraded" for fallback.

When a Round 2 verdict is unavailable (timeout fallback):
- Read the full R1 output file (.agents/council/YYYY-MM-DD-<target>-claude-{perspective}.md)
- Extract the JSON verdict block (first JSON code block in the file)
- Use this as the judge's verdict for consolidation
- Mark in report: "Judge {perspective}: R1 verdict (R2 timeout)"
```

---

## Consensus Rules

| Condition | Verdict |
|-----------|---------|
| All PASS | PASS |
| Any FAIL | FAIL |
| Mixed PASS/WARN | WARN |
| All WARN | WARN |

Disagreement handling:
- If Claude says PASS and Codex says FAIL → DISAGREE (surface both)
- Severity-weighted: Security FAIL outweighs style WARN

**DISAGREE resolution:** When vendors disagree, the spawner presents both positions with reasoning and defers to the user. No automatic tie-breaking — cross-vendor disagreement is a signal worth human attention.

---

## Output Format

### Council Report (Markdown)

```markdown
## Council Consensus: WARN

**Target:** Implementation of user authentication
**Modes:** validate, --mixed
**Judges:** 3 Claude (Opus 4.6) + 3 Codex (GPT-5.3-Codex)

---

### Verdicts

| Vendor | Judge 1 | Judge 2 | Judge 3 |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Claude | PASS | WARN | PASS |
| Codex | WARN | WARN | WARN |

*(With `--preset`, column headers reflect perspective names instead of Judge N)*

---

### Shared Findings

- JWT implementation follows best practices
- Refresh token rotation is correctly implemented
- Test coverage is adequate

### Disagreements

| Issue | Claude | Codex |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Rate limiting | Optional for internal APIs | Required per OWASP |
| Token expiry | 1 hour acceptable | Should be 15 minutes |

### Cross-Vendor Insights

**Claude-only:** Noted UX friction in token refresh flow
**Codex-only:** Flagged potential timing attack in token comparison

---

### Recommendation

Add rate limiting to auth endpoints. Consider reducing token expiry to 30 minutes as compromise.

---

### Debate Report Additions

When `--debate` is used, add these sections to any report format:

**Header addition:**
```markdown
**Mode:** {task_type}, --debate
**Rounds:** 2 (independent assessment + adversarial debate)
**Fidelity:** full (native teams — judges retained full R1 context for R2)
```

If debate ran in fallback mode (re-spawned with truncated R1 verdicts), use instead:
```markdown
**Mode:** {task_type}, --debate
**Rounds:** 2 (independent assessment + adversarial debate)
**Fidelity:** degraded (fallback — R1 verdicts truncated for R2 re-spawn)
```

**After the Verdicts table, add:**

```markdown
### Verdict Shifts (R1 → R2)

| Judge | R1 Verdict | R2 Verdict | Changed? | Reason |
|-------|-----------|-----------|----------|--------|
| Judge 1 (or Perspective) | PASS | WARN | Yes | Accepted Judge 2's finding on rate limiting |
| Judge 2 (or Perspective) | WARN | WARN | No | Confirmed after reviewing counterarguments |
| Judge 3 (or Perspective) | PASS | PASS | No | Maintained — challenged Judge 2's scope concern |

### Debate Notes

**Key Exchanges:**
- **Judge 1 ← Judge 2:** [what was exchanged and its impact]
- **Judge 3 vs Judge 2:** [where they disagreed and why]

**Steel-Man Highlights:**
- Judge 1 steel-manned: "[strongest opposing argument they engaged with]"
- Judge 2 steel-manned: "[strongest opposing argument they engaged with]"
```

**Convergence Detection:**

If Round 1 had at least 2 judges with different verdicts AND Round 2 is unanimous, add this flag:

```markdown
> **⚠ Convergence Detected:** Judges who disagreed in Round 1 now agree in Round 2.
> Review debate reasoning to verify this reflects genuine persuasion, not anchoring.
> Round 1 verdicts preserved above for comparison.
```

**Footer update:**
```markdown
*Council completed in {R1_time + R2_time}. {N}/{N} judges responded in R1, {M}/{N} in R2.*
```

---

## Configuration

### Partial Completion

**Minimum quorum:** At least 1 agent must respond for a valid council (already documented).

**Recommended quorum:** 80% of judges (e.g., 2 of 3 in --deep mode).

**Timeout behavior:** If a judge does not respond within COUNCIL_TIMEOUT:
1. Log warning: "Judge {name} timed out after {N}s"
2. Proceed with remaining judges
3. Note in report: "N/M judges responded (J judge(s) timed out)"
4. If below minimum quorum (1), return error

**User cancellation:** If the user cancels mid-council:
1. Send shutdown_request to all judges
2. Read any output files already written
3. Generate partial report with INCOMPLETE marker
4. Note: "Council cancelled by user. Partial results from N/M judges."

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `COUNCIL_TIMEOUT` | 120 | Agent timeout in seconds |
| `COUNCIL_CODEX_MODEL` | gpt-5.3-codex | Default Codex model for --mixed |
| `COUNCIL_CLAUDE_MODEL` | opus | Claude model for agents |
| `COUNCIL_EXPLORER_MODEL` | sonnet | Model for explorer sub-agents |
| `COUNCIL_EXPLORER_TIMEOUT` | 60 | Explorer timeout in seconds |
| `COUNCIL_R2_TIMEOUT` | 90 | Maximum wait time for R2 debate completion after sending debate messages. Shorter than R1 since judges already have context. |

### Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--deep` | 3 Claude agents instead of 2 |
| `--mixed` | Add 3 Codex agents |
| `--debate` | Enable adversarial debate round (2 rounds via SendMessage, same agents). Incompatible with `--quick`. |
| `--timeout=N` | Override timeout in seconds (default: 120) |
| `--perspectives="a,b,c"` | Custom perspective names |
| `--preset=<name>` | Built-in persona preset (security-audit, architecture, research, ops, code-review, plan-review, retrospective) |
| `--count=N` | Override agent count per vendor (e.g., `--count=4` = 4 Claude, or 4+4 with --mixed). Subject to MAX_AGENTS=12 cap. |
| `--explorers=N` | Explorer sub-agents per judge (default: 0, max: 5). Max effective value depends on judge count. Total agents capped at 12. |
| `--explorer-model=M` | Override explorer model (default: sonnet) |

---

## CLI Spawning Commands

### Team Setup

**Create the council team before spawning judges:**

```
TeamCreate(team_name="council-YYYYMMDD-<target>")
```

Team naming convention: `council-YYYYMMDD-<target>` (e.g., `council-20260206-auth-system`).

### Claude Agents (via Native Teams)

**Spawn judges as teammates on the council team:**

Default (independent judges, no perspectives):
```
Task(
  description="Council judge 1",
  subagent_type="general-purpose",
  model="opus",
  team_name="council-YYYYMMDD-<target>",
  name="judge-1",
  prompt="{JUDGE_DEFAULT_PROMPT}"
)
```

With perspectives (--preset or --perspectives):
```
Task(
  description="Council judge: Error-Paths",
  subagent_type="general-purpose",
  model="opus",
  team_name="council-YYYYMMDD-<target>",
  name="judge-error-paths",
  prompt="{JUDGE_PERSPECTIVE_PROMPT}"
)
```

Judges join the team, write output files, and send completion messages to the team lead via `SendMessage`.

**Fallback (if native teams unavailable):**

```
Task(
  description="Council judge 1",
  subagent_type="general-purpose",
  model="opus",
  run_in_background=true,
  prompt="{JUDGE_PACKET}"
)
```

### Codex Agents (via Codex CLI)

**Canonical Codex command form (unchanged — Codex cannot join teams):**

```bash
codex exec --full-auto -m gpt-5.3-codex -C "$(pwd)" -o .agents/council/codex-{perspective}.md "{PACKET}"
```

Always use this exact flag order: `--full-auto` → `-m` → `-C` → `-o` → prompt.

**Codex CLI flags (ONLY these are valid):**
- `--full-auto` — No approval prompts (REQUIRED, always first)
- `-m <model>` — Model override (default: gpt-5.3-codex)
- `-C <dir>` — Working directory
- `-o <file>` — Output file (use `-o` not `--output`)

**DO NOT USE:** `-q` (doesn't exist), `--quiet` (doesn't exist)

### Parallel Spawning

**Spawn all agents in parallel:**

```
# Step 1: Create team
TeamCreate(team_name="council-YYYYMMDD-<target>")

# Step 2: Spawn Claude judges as teammates (parallel)
# Default (independent — no perspectives):
Task(description="Judge 1", team_name="council-...", name="judge-1", ...)
Task(description="Judge 2", team_name="council-...", name="judge-2", ...)
Task(description="Judge 3", team_name="council-...", name="judge-3", ...)
# With --preset or --perspectives:
# Task(description="Judge: Error-Paths", team_name="council-...", name="judge-error-paths", ...)

# Step 3: Spawn Codex agents (Bash tool, parallel — cannot join teams)
Bash(command="codex exec --full-auto -m gpt-5.3-codex -C \"$(pwd)\" -o .agents/council/codex-1.md ...", run_in_background=true)
Bash(command="codex exec --full-auto -m gpt-5.3-codex -C \"$(pwd)\" -o .agents/council/codex-2.md ...", run_in_background=true)
Bash(command="codex exec --full-auto -m gpt-5.3-codex -C \"$(pwd)\" -o .agents/council/codex-3.md ...", run_in_background=true)
```

**Wait for completion:**

Judges send completion messages to the team lead via `SendMessage`. These arrive automatically as conversation turns. For Codex agents, use `TaskOutput(task_id="...", block=true)`.

### Debate Round 2 (via SendMessage)

**After R1 completes, send R2 instructions to existing judges (no re-spawn):**

```
# Determine branch
r1_unanimous = all R1 verdicts have same value

# Send to each judge
SendMessage(
  type="message",
  recipient="judge-1",  # or "judge-{perspective}" with presets
  content="## Debate Round 2\n\nOther judges' R1 verdicts:\n\n{OTHER_VERDICTS_JSON}\n\n{DEBATE_INSTRUCTIONS_FOR_BRANCH}",
  summary="Debate R2: review other verdicts"
)
```

Judges wake from idle, process R2, write R2 files, send completion message.

**R2 completion wait:** After sending R2 debate messages to all judges, wait up to `COUNCIL_R2_TIMEOUT` (default 90s) for each judge's completion message via `SendMessage`. If a judge does not respond within the timeout, read their R1 output file (`.agents/council/YYYY-MM-DD-<target>-claude-{perspective}.md`) and use the R1 verdict for consolidation. Log: `Judge <name> R2 timeout — using R1 verdict.`

### Team Cleanup

**After consolidation:**

```
# Shutdown each judge
SendMessage(type="shutdown_request", recipient="judge-1", content="Council complete")
SendMessage(type="shutdown_request", recipient="judge-2", content="Council complete")
SendMessage(type="shutdown_request", recipient="judge-3", content="Council complete")
# With presets: use judge-{perspective} names instead (e.g., judge-error-paths)

# Delete team
TeamDelete()
```

> **Note:** `TeamDelete()` deletes the team associated with this session's `TeamCreate()` call. If running concurrent teams (e.g., council inside crank), each team is cleaned up in the session that created it. No team name parameter is needed — the API tracks the current session's team context automatically.

### Reaper Cleanup Pattern

Team cleanup MUST succeed even on partial failures. Follow this sequence:

1. **Attempt graceful shutdown:** Send shutdown_request to each judge
2. **Wait up to 30s** for shutdown_approved responses
3. **If any judge doesn't respond:** Log warning, proceed anyway
4. **Always call TeamDelete()** — even if some judges are unresponsive
5. **TeamDelete cleans up** the team regardless of member state

**Failure modes and recovery:**

| Failure | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| Judge hangs (no response) | 30s timeout → proceed to TeamDelete |
| shutdown_request fails | Log warning → proceed to TeamDelete |
| TeamDelete fails | Log error → team orphaned (manual cleanup: delete ~/.claude/teams/<name>/) |
| Lead crashes mid-council | Team orphaned until session ends or manual cleanup |

**Never skip TeamDelete.** A lingering team config pollutes future sessions.

### Team Timeout Configuration

| Timeout | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Judge timeout | 120s | Max time for judge to complete (per round) |
| Shutdown grace period | 30s | Time to wait for shutdown_approved |
| R2 debate timeout | 90s | Max time for R2 completion after sending debate messages |

### Model Selection

| Vendor | Default | Override |

### Output Collection

All council outputs go to `.agents/council/`:

```bash
# Ensure directory exists
mkdir -p .agents/council

# Claude output (R1) — independent judges
.agents/council/YYYY-MM-DD-<target>-claude-1.md

# Claude output (R1) — with presets
.agents/council/YYYY-MM-DD-<target>-claude-error-paths.md

# Claude output (R2, when --debate)
.agents/council/YYYY-MM-DD-<target>-claude-1-r2.md

# Codex output (R1 only, even with --debate)
.agents/council/YYYY-MM-DD-<target>-codex-1.md

# Final consolidated report
.agents/council/YYYY-MM-DD-<target>-report.md
```

## Examples

### Validate Recent Changes

```bash
/council validate recent
```

2 independent Claude judges validate recent commits (no perspective labels).

### Deep Architecture Review

```bash
/council --deep --preset=architecture research the authentication system
```

3 Claude agents (scalability, maintainability, simplicity) research auth design.

### Cross-Vendor Validation

```bash
/council --mixed validate this plan
```

3 Claude + 3 Codex agents, cross-vendor synthesis.

### Deep Research with Explorers

```bash
/council --deep --explorers=3 research upgrade automation patterns
```

3 judges each spawn 3 explorers = 12 parallel research threads. Each judge explores a different facet of the topic with sub-agent support.

### Security Audit

```bash
/council --preset=security-audit --deep validate the API endpoints
```

3 judges (attacker, defender, compliance) review security posture.

### Brainstorm Approaches

```bash
/council brainstorm caching strategies for the API
```

2 independent Claude judges explore options, pros/cons, recommend one.

### Research Trade-offs

```bash
/council research Redis vs Memcached for session storage
```

2 independent judges assess properties, trade-offs, and gaps between options.

### Validate a Spec

```bash
/council validate the implementation plan in PLAN.md
```

2 independent Claude judges provide structured feedback on the plan.

## Migration from /judge

`/council` replaces `/judge`. Migration:

| Old | New |
|-----|-----|
| `/judge recent` | `/council validate recent` |
| `/judge 2 opus` | `/council recent` (default) |
| `/judge 3 opus` | `/council --deep recent` |

The `/judge` skill is deprecated. Use `/council`.

## Native Teams Architecture

Council uses Claude Code native teams (`TeamCreate`, `SendMessage`, shared `TaskList`) as the primary spawning method for Claude judges.

### Deliberation Protocol

The `--debate` flag implements the **deliberation protocol** pattern:
> Independent assessment → evidence exchange → position revision → convergence analysis

Native teams make this pattern first-class:
- **R1:** Judges spawn as teammates, assess independently, send verdicts to team lead
- **R2:** Team lead sends other judges' verdicts via `SendMessage`. Judges wake from idle with full R1 context — no truncation, no re-spawn overhead
- **Consolidation:** Team lead reads all output files, computes consensus
- **Cleanup:** `shutdown_request` each judge, `TeamDelete()`

### Communication Rules

- **Judges → team lead only.** Judges never message each other directly. This prevents anchoring (a judge being swayed by another's framing before forming their own view).
- **Team lead → judges.** Only the team lead sends messages to judges (R2 debate instructions, shutdown requests).
- **No TaskList access.** Judges do not use `TaskList` or `TaskUpdate` — the team lead manages all coordination.

### Ralph Wiggum Compliance

Council maintains fresh-context isolation (Ralph Wiggum pattern) with one documented exception:

**`--debate` reuses judge context across R1 and R2.** This is intentional. Judges persist within a single atomic council invocation — they do NOT persist across separate council calls. The rationale:

- Judges benefit from their own R1 analytical context (reasoning chain, not just the verdict JSON) when evaluating other judges' positions in R2
- Re-spawning with only the verdict summary (~200 tokens) would lose the judge's working memory of WHY they reached their verdict
- The exception is bounded: max 2 rounds, within one invocation, with explicit cleanup (shutdown_request + TeamDelete)

Without `--debate`, council is fully Ralph-compliant: each judge is a fresh spawn, executes once, writes output, and terminates.

### Fallback

If `TeamCreate` is unavailable (API error, environment constraint), fall back to `Task(run_in_background=true)` fire-and-forget. In fallback mode:
- `--debate` reverts to R2 re-spawning with truncated R1 verdicts
- The debate report must include `**Fidelity:** degraded (fallback — R1 verdicts truncated for R2 re-spawn)` in the header so users know results may be lower fidelity
- Non-debate mode works identically (judges write files, team lead reads them)

### Team Naming

Convention: `council-YYYYMMDD-<target>` (e.g., `council-20260206-auth-system`).

Judge names: `judge-{N}` for independent judges (e.g., `judge-1`, `judge-2`), or `judge-{perspective}` when using presets/perspectives (e.g., `judge-error-paths`, `judge-feasibility`).
