2. **Documentation URL**: Pylon public article URL
3. **Channels**: Which announcement types to generate (from config.yaml)
4. **Optional context**: Key benefits, target audience, additional details

## Process

### Step 1: Research Feature

Use the Task tool to understand the feature deeply:

**What to find:**

1. **Feature Purpose:**

   - Who is it for?
   - Why is it valuable?

2. **Key Capabilities:**

   - What makes it unique?
   - How does it help users?

3. **User Benefits:**

   - Reduced friction

4. **Target Audience:**

### Step 2: Determine Announcement Channels

Check config.yaml for enabled channels:

announcements:
  channels:
    - slack

```

**Generate announcements for each enabled channel.**

# New: Dashboards

Hello,

We're excited to announce Dashboards, a powerful new way to visualize and track your team's workflows in real-time.

## What are Dashboards?

Dashboards give you instant visibility into the metrics that matter most to your team. Instead of digging through data or running manual reports, you can now see key performance indicators at a glance and spot trends before they become issues.

## Key Capabilities

**Real-Time Metrics**
Track your team's performance as it happens. Dashboards update automatically, so you always have the latest information without refreshing or waiting for scheduled reports.

**Drag-and-Drop Customization**
Build the perfect dashboard for your needs in seconds. Add, remove, and rearrange widgets to focus on what matters most to you and your team.

**Smart Insights**
Get actionable recommendations based on your data. Our analytics engine surfaces trends, anomalies, and opportunities you might otherwise miss.

**Team Collaboration**
Share dashboards with your team or create role-specific views. Everyone sees the information they need, presented the way they need it.

**Export and Reporting**
Generate reports directly from your dashboards for stakeholder updates, retrospectives, or compliance needs.

## Who Should Use This?

Dashboards are perfect for managers and team leads who need to monitor progress, identify bottlenecks, and make data-driven decisions quickly. Whether you're tracking project milestones, monitoring workflow efficiency, or managing team workload, Dashboards help you stay on top of what's happening.

## Getting Started

Ready to try it? Access Dashboards from your main menu under "Analytics". Your first dashboard is automatically created with recommended widgets, but you can customize it however you like.

For detailed instructions, widget explanations, and best practices, check out our [documentation](https://yourproduct-kb.help.usepylon.com/articles/dashboards).

## What's Next?

We're continuously improving Dashboards based on your feedback. Have suggestions for new widgets, better visualizations, or additional features? Reply to this email or reach out to our support team.
