# Create Slash Command Guide

This skill helps you create custom Claude Code slash commands - reusable prompts stored as Markdown files that can be invoked with `/command-name` syntax. Slash commands are ideal for frequently-used prompts that you want to trigger explicitly.

## Quick Start

When creating a new slash command, follow this workflow:

1. **Identify the purpose** - What reusable prompt do you need?
2. **Choose scope** - Project-level (.claude/commands/) or personal (~/.claude/commands/)?
3. **Select name** - Clear, descriptive filename without .md extension
4. **Design arguments** - Will it use $ARGUMENTS, $1/$2/$3, or none?
5. **Add frontmatter** - Optional metadata (description, tools, model)
6. **Write prompt** - The markdown content that becomes the prompt
7. **Test invocation** - Verify command works with various arguments

## Basic Syntax

Commands are invoked with:
```
/command-name [arguments]
```

The command name comes from the filename without `.md` extension.

## File Locations

### Project Commands (.claude/commands/)
- **Scope:** Project-specific, shared with team via git
- **Label:** Shows as "(project)" in help listing
- **Use for:** Team workflows, project conventions, shared prompts

```bash
# Create project command
echo "Review this code for security vulnerabilities" > .claude/commands/security-review.md
```

**Example structure:**
```
.claude/commands/
├── review.md           # /review
├── optimize.md         # /optimize
├── test.md            # /test
└── frontend/
    └── component.md   # /component (project:frontend)
```

### Personal Commands (~/.claude/commands/)
- **Scope:** Available across all projects
- **Label:** Shows as "(user)" in help listing
- **Use for:** Personal productivity, individual workflows, cross-project utilities

```bash
# Create personal command
echo "Explain this code in simple terms" > ~/.claude/commands/explain.md
```

**Example structure:**
```
~/.claude/commands/
├── explain.md         # /explain (user)
├── refactor.md        # /refactor (user)
└── snippets/
    └── doc.md         # /doc (user:snippets)
```

## Argument Handling

### No Arguments
Simple commands that don't need input:

```markdown
Review the current codebase for potential improvements and suggest optimizations.
```

Usage: `/review`

### All Arguments with $ARGUMENTS
Captures everything passed to the command:

```markdown
Fix issue #$ARGUMENTS following our coding standards and best practices.
```

Usage:
- `/fix-issue 123`
- `/fix-issue 123 high-priority security`

### Positional Arguments with $1, $2, $3, etc.
Access specific arguments by position:

```markdown
Review PR #$1 with priority $2 and assign to $3 for review.
```

Usage: `/review-pr 456 high alice`

**Benefits:**
- Access arguments in different parts of the prompt
- Provide defaults for missing arguments
- Build structured commands with specific parameter roles
- Clearer intent for multi-parameter commands

### Combining Arguments
Use both positional and all arguments:

```markdown
Create a $1 feature called "$2" with the following requirements:

$ARGUMENTS
```

Usage: `/create-feature backend "user authentication" JWT tokens, role-based access, password hashing`

## Frontmatter Configuration

Add optional metadata at the top of your command file:

```markdown
---
allowed-tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash
argument-hint: <issue-number> [priority]
description: Fix GitHub issue following coding standards
model: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
---

Your command prompt content goes here...
```

### Frontmatter Fields

**allowed-tools:** Restrict which tools Claude can use
```yaml
allowed-tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash
allowed-tools: Bash(git add:*), Bash(git status:*), Bash(git commit:*)
```

**argument-hint:** Show expected arguments in autocomplete
```yaml
argument-hint: <file-path>
argument-hint: <pr-number> [priority] [assignee]
argument-hint: [message]
```

**description:** Brief command description (overrides first line)
```yaml
description: Create a git commit with proper formatting
```

**model:** Specific model to use for this command
```yaml
model: claude-3-5-haiku-20241022      # Fast, cheap
model: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022     # Balanced
model: claude-opus-4-20250514         # Advanced
```

**disable-model-invocation:** Prevent auto-invocation via SlashCommand tool
```yaml
disable-model-invocation: true
```

## Advanced Features

### File References with @
Include file contents in your command:

```markdown
---
description: Review code implementation
---

Review the implementation in @src/utils/helpers.js and compare it with @src/utils/legacy.js.

Identify:
- Code quality improvements
- Performance optimizations
- Security vulnerabilities
```

Usage: `/review-implementation`

### Bash Command Execution with !
Execute bash commands and include output (requires allowed-tools):

```markdown
---
allowed-tools: Bash(git add:*), Bash(git status:*), Bash(git commit:*)
description: Create a git commit
---

Create a git commit with the following context:

**Current Status:**
!`git status`

**Recent Changes:**
!`git diff HEAD`

**Commit Message:** $ARGUMENTS
```

Usage: `/commit "Add user authentication feature"`

### Extended Thinking
Trigger extended reasoning by including keywords in the command content:

```markdown
---
description: Analyze complex architectural decisions
---

Please use extended thinking to analyze the following architectural decision:

$ARGUMENTS

Consider:
- Scalability implications
- Maintenance overhead
- Team expertise requirements
- Long-term technical debt
```

### Namespacing with Subdirectories
Organize commands in subdirectories (affects description, not command name):

```
.claude/commands/
├── git/
│   ├── commit.md     # /commit (project:git)
│   └── review.md     # /review (project:git)
└── frontend/
    └── component.md  # /component (project:frontend)
```

The subdirectory appears in the description but doesn't change the command invocation.

## Slash Commands vs Skills

### When to Use Slash Commands

**Characteristics:**
- Explicit invocation required (`/command`)
- Quick, frequently-used prompts
- Simple prompt snippets
- Single-file capabilities
- Manual control over execution

**Best for:**
- Code review workflows (`/review`)
- Quick explanations (`/explain`)
- Frequent operations (`/optimize`, `/test`)
- Personal productivity shortcuts
- Team-standardized prompts

### When to Use Skills

**Characteristics:**
- Automatic discovery based on context
- Claude decides when to invoke
- Complex workflows with multiple steps
- Multiple files (scripts, templates, docs)
- Advanced capabilities

**Best for:**
- PDF processing (auto-invoked when user mentions PDFs)
- API documentation generation (auto-invoked for API tasks)
- Complex multi-step workflows
- Capabilities requiring external scripts
- Knowledge organized across multiple files

### Can They Coexist?

**Yes!** Use both approaches:
- **Commands:** Explicit, manual shortcuts (`/review-pr`)
- **Skills:** Automatic, context-driven capabilities (PDF extraction)

## Best Practices Checklist

When creating a slash command:

- [ ] Filename is descriptive and uses kebab-case
- [ ] File location matches scope (project vs personal)
- [ ] Description frontmatter is clear and concise
- [ ] Arguments are well-documented with argument-hint
- [ ] Prompt content is specific and actionable
- [ ] File references (@) use correct paths
- [ ] Bash commands (!) have proper tool restrictions
- [ ] Model selection matches complexity (haiku/sonnet/opus)
- [ ] Command tested with various argument combinations
- [ ] Related commands organized in subdirectories
- [ ] No sensitive data (credentials, API keys) in commands
- [ ] Clear examples in comments or description

## Testing Slash Commands

### 1. Verify Command Appears

List all available commands:
```bash
# In Claude Code
/help
```

Look for your command in the output.

### 2. Test Basic Invocation

```bash
/your-command
```

Verify the prompt expands correctly.

### 3. Test with Arguments

```bash
/your-command arg1
/your-command arg1 arg2 arg3
```

Verify argument substitution works.

### 4. Test File References

If using `@file.txt`, verify the file exists and is readable.

### 5. Test Bash Commands

If using `!command`, verify:
- Command executes successfully
- Output is captured correctly
- Tool restrictions are appropriate

## Common Issues

**Command not appearing:**
- Check filename has `.md` extension
- Verify file is in correct location (.claude/commands/ or ~/.claude/commands/)
- Restart Claude Code to reload commands

**Arguments not substituting:**
- Ensure `$ARGUMENTS`, `$1`, `$2` syntax is correct
- Check for extra spaces or special characters
- Verify arguments are passed when invoking

**File references not working:**
- Confirm file path is correct (relative to project root)
- Check file exists and is readable
- Verify `@` prefix is present

**Bash commands failing:**
- Add `allowed-tools: Bash` to frontmatter
- Verify command works independently
- Check tool restriction patterns (e.g., `Bash(git *)`)

**Description not showing:**
- Add `description` field in frontmatter
- Ensure frontmatter YAML is valid (opening/closing `---`)

## Migration from Skills

Converting a skill to a slash command:

**Skill (automatic invocation):**
```markdown
---
name: code-explainer
description: Explain code in simple terms when user asks
---

# Code Explainer
Instructions for explaining code...
```

**Slash Command (explicit invocation):**
```markdown
---
description: Explain code in simple terms
---

Explain this code in simple, beginner-friendly terms:

$ARGUMENTS

Include:
- What the code does
- How it works
- Why it's structured this way
- Common use cases
```

Usage: `/explain`

## Security Considerations

**Avoid:**
- Hardcoding credentials or API keys
- Network calls without encryption
- Destructive commands without confirmation
- Accessing sensitive files unnecessarily

**Safe practices:**
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Validate file paths before access
- Restrict bash command patterns
- Log command execution for audit trails

## Advanced Patterns

### Template-Based Commands

```markdown
---
description: Create component from template
---

Create a new $1 component named $2:

**Template:**
@templates/$1-template.tsx

**Destination:**
src/components/$2/

Generate files:
1. Component implementation
2. Test file
3. Styles
4. Documentation
5. Storybook story
```

Usage: `/create-component button UserProfileButton`

### Multi-Step Workflows

```markdown
---
allowed-tools: Bash, Read, Write, Edit
description: Complete feature implementation workflow
---

Implement feature: $ARGUMENTS

Workflow:
1. Create feature branch
2. Generate boilerplate code
3. Implement core logic
4. Add tests
5. Update documentation
6. Run quality checks
7. Create PR

Execute each step with confirmation.
```

Usage: `/feature-workflow "user authentication"`

### Context-Rich Commands

```markdown
---
allowed-tools: Bash(git *), Read
description: Comprehensive code review with full context
---

Review code with full context:

**Project Structure:**
!`find . -type f -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.tsx" | head -20`

**Recent Changes:**
!`git log --oneline -10`

**Modified Files:**
!`git diff --name-only HEAD~5..HEAD`

**Code to Review:**
$ARGUMENTS

Provide comprehensive feedback considering project context.
```

## Key Principles

1. **Descriptive names** - Clear, action-oriented command names
2. **Explicit invocation** - Users trigger commands intentionally
3. **Argument clarity** - Use argument-hint for discoverability
4. **Scope appropriately** - Project commands for team, personal for you
5. **Tool restrictions** - Only grant necessary tool access
6. **Model selection** - Match model to task complexity
7. **Organization** - Use subdirectories for related commands
8. **Documentation** - Clear descriptions and argument hints
9. **Testing** - Verify with various inputs before sharing
10. **Security** - Never hardcode sensitive data

## Workflow Summary

When user asks to create a slash command:

1. **Clarify purpose** - What prompt should be reusable?
2. **Choose scope** - Project or personal command?
3. **Design arguments** - $ARGUMENTS, $1/$2/$3, or none?
4. **Select name** - Descriptive, kebab-case filename
5. **Add frontmatter** - Description, tools, model, argument-hint
6. **Write prompt** - Clear, actionable command content
7. **Add features** - File references (@), bash commands (!)
8. **Test thoroughly** - Various arguments, edge cases
9. **Document usage** - Examples in comments or description
10. **Share if needed** - Commit project commands to git

Remember: Slash commands are for explicit, manual invocation of frequently-used prompts. Use skills for automatic, context-driven capabilities.
