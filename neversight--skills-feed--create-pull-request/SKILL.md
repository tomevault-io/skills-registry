# Create Pull Request

This skill guides you through creating a well-structured GitHub pull request that follows project conventions and best practices.

## Prerequisites Check

Before proceeding, verify the following:

### 1. Verify clean working directory

```bash
git status
```

If there are uncommitted changes, ask the user whether to:
- Commit them as part of this PR
- Stash them temporarily
- Discard them (with caution)

## Gather Context

### 1. Identify the current branch

```bash
git branch --show-current
```

If you're on `main` or `master`, create a feature branch automatically:

1. **Decide the branch name** using, in order of preference:
   - **Issue number + slug**: If an issue number is available from conversation context, use `fix/<issue>-<short-slug>` or `feat/<issue>-<short-slug>` (e.g. `fix/42-auth-timeout`, `feat/123-add-login`).
   - **Change content**: If no issue number, infer type and slug from changed files: `git status`, `git diff --stat`, or `git diff` to derive a short kebab-case slug (e.g. `fix/memory-leak-handler`, `docs/update-readme`).
2. **Create and switch to the branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b <branch-name>
   ```
   Use a type prefix (`fix/`, `feat/`, `docs/`, `refactor/`, `chore/`) that matches the change. Keep the slug short and lowercase with hyphens.

If already on a feature branch, proceed to the next step.

### 2. Find the base branch

```bash
git remote show origin | grep "HEAD branch"
```

This is typically `main` or `master`.

### 3. Analyze recent commits relevant to this PR

```bash
git log origin/main..HEAD --oneline --no-decorate
```

Review these commits to understand:
- What changes are being introduced
- The scope of the PR (single feature/fix or multiple changes)
- Whether commits should be squashed or reorganized

### 4. Review the diff

```bash
git diff origin/main..HEAD --stat
```

This shows which files changed and helps identify the type of change.

## Information Gathering

Before creating the PR, you need the following information. Check if it can be inferred from:
- Conversation context (user-mentioned issue numbers)
- Branch name (e.g., `fix/issue-123`, `feature/123-new-login`)
- Changed files and their content

If any critical information is missing, use `ask_followup_question` to ask the user:

### Required Information

1. **Related Issue Number**: Look in this order—(1) conversation context (user-mentioned issue numbers), (2) branch name patterns (e.g. `issue-123`, `123-new-login`). If not found, do not ask the user; omit or use a placeholder in the PR body.
2. **Description**: What problem does this solve? Why were these changes made?
3. **Type of Change**: Bug fix, new feature, breaking change, refactor, cosmetic, documentation, or workflow
4. **Test Procedure**: How was this tested? What could break?

## Git Best Practices

Before creating the PR, consider these best practices:

### Commit Hygiene

1. **Atomic commits**: Each commit should represent a single logical change
2. **Clear commit messages**: Follow conventional commit format when possible
3. **No merge commits**: Prefer rebasing over merging to keep history clean

### Branch Management

1. **Rebase on latest main** (if needed):
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git rebase origin/main
   ```

2. **Squash if appropriate**: If there are many small "WIP" commits, consider interactive rebase:
   ```bash
   git rebase -i origin/main
   ```
   Only suggest this if commits appear messy and the user is comfortable with rebasing.

### Push Changes

Ensure all commits are pushed:
```bash
git push origin HEAD
```

If the branch was rebased, you may need:
```bash
git push origin HEAD --force-with-lease
```

## PR Title Format (Conventional Commits)

PR titles MUST follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>
```

### Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `feat` | A new feature |
| `fix` | A bug fix |
| `docs` | Documentation only changes |
| `refactor` | A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature |
| `chore` | Other changes that don't modify src or test files |

### Examples

- `feat(auth): add OAuth2 login support`
- `fix: resolve memory leak in event handler`
- `docs: update API documentation`
- `refactor(utils): simplify date formatting logic`

## Create the Pull Request

**IMPORTANT**: Read and use the PR template at `.github/pull_request_template.md`. The PR body format must **strictly match** the template structure. Do not deviate from the template format.

When filling out the template:
- Replace `#XXXX` with the actual issue number, or keep as `#XXXX` if no issue exists (for small fixes)
- Fill in all sections with relevant information gathered from commits and context
- Mark the appropriate "Type of Change" checkbox(es)
- Complete the "Pre-flight Checklist" items that apply

### Create PR with gh CLI

```bash
gh pr create --title "PR_TITLE" --body "PR_BODY" --base main
```

Alternatively, create as draft if the user wants review before marking ready:
```bash
gh pr create --title "PR_TITLE" --body "PR_BODY" --base main --draft
```

## Post-Creation

After creating the PR:

1. **Display the PR URL** so the user can review it
2. **Remind about CI checks**: Tests and linting will run automatically
3. **Suggest next steps**:
   - Add reviewers if needed: `gh pr edit --add-reviewer USERNAME`
   - Add labels if needed: `gh pr edit --add-label "bug"`

## Error Handling

### Common Issues

1. **No commits ahead of main**: The branch has no changes to submit
   - Ask if the user meant to work on a different branch

2. **Branch not pushed**: Remote doesn't have the branch
   - Push the branch first: `git push -u origin HEAD`

3. **PR already exists**: A PR for this branch already exists
   - Show the existing PR: `gh pr view`
   - Ask if they want to update it instead

4. **Merge conflicts**: Branch conflicts with base
   - Guide user through resolving conflicts or rebasing

## Summary Checklist

Before finalizing, ensure:
- [ ] Working directory is clean
- [ ] All commits are pushed
- [ ] Branch is up-to-date with base branch
- [ ] Related issue number is identified, or placeholder is used
- [ ] PR title follows Conventional Commits format
- [ ] PR description follows the template exactly
- [ ] Appropriate type of change is selected
- [ ] Pre-flight checklist items are addressed
