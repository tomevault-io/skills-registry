# Creative Strategist Skill

## Overview

Creative Strategist helps you define your visual direction before generating assets. This skill ensures all your creative outputs maintain consistent style and aesthetic.

**Keywords**: visual direction, creative strategy, brand aesthetics, style guide, visual identity, creative planning, mood boards

## Core Methodology

Your creative strategy has three layers:

1. **Visual Research** — Find inspiration and reference styles
2. **Style Definition** — Define your unique visual direction
3. **Consistency Framework** — Ensure all assets match

## Visual Research Process

### Step 1: Identify Your Aesthetic

Answer these questions:

- **Primary Style**: Photorealistic, minimalist, maximalist, illustrative, abstract?
- **Color Palette**: What colors define your brand?
- **Mood**: Professional, playful, serious, energetic, calm?
- **Target Audience**: What aesthetics appeal to them?
- **Industry Standards**: What do competitors use?

### Step 2: Gather References

Create a mood board with:
- 5-10 reference images from your industry
- 5-10 reference images from outside your industry (inspiration)
- Color palettes that resonate
- Typography and design elements
- Photography styles and compositions

### Step 3: Identify Common Patterns

What do your references have in common?
- Lighting style (natural, studio, dramatic, soft)
- Color temperature (warm, cool, neutral)
- Composition (centered, rule of thirds, dynamic)
- Texture and detail level
- Emotional tone

## Style Definition Framework

### Define Your Visual Direction

**Brand Aesthetic Profile:**

```
Primary Style: [photorealistic/minimalist/illustrative/abstract/maximalist]
Color Palette: [list 3-5 primary colors]
Mood: [professional/playful/serious/energetic/calm/luxurious/casual]
Lighting: [natural/studio/dramatic/soft/mixed]
Composition: [centered/rule of thirds/dynamic/symmetrical/asymmetrical]
Detail Level: [minimal/moderate/detailed/hyper-detailed]
Texture: [smooth/textured/mixed]
Target Audience: [description]
Unique Elements: [what makes yours different]
```

### Create Your Style Guide

Document:
1. **Visual Examples** — 3-5 reference images
2. **Color Codes** — Hex codes for your palette
3. **Typography** — Font choices and usage
4. **Photography Style** — Lighting, composition, mood
5. **Illustration Style** — If applicable
6. **Prohibited Elements** — What NOT to do
7. **Consistency Rules** — How to maintain style

## Consistency Framework

### The 3-Part Consistency Check

Before generating assets, verify:

1. **Style Match** — Does it match my aesthetic?
2. **Quality Level** — Is it the right quality?
3. **Brand Alignment** — Does it represent my brand?

### Style Variations

You can have multiple styles for different contexts:

- **Primary Style** — Main brand aesthetic
- **Secondary Style** — Alternative for variety
- **Accent Style** — Special occasions or campaigns

## Claude Code Integration

### How to Use with Claude Code

When you ask Claude to generate assets, it will use this skill to:

1. **Read your style guide** from the Creative Strategist
2. **Craft detailed prompts** based on your aesthetic
3. **Call the automation system** to generate images
4. **Save organized assets** to your project

### Setup Instructions for Claude Code

**Step 1: Ensure automation system is installed**

```bash
# The automation system should be in your project:
# vibe-creative-automation/
#   ├── fal_api.py
#   ├── creative_cli.py
#   ├── claude_integration.py
#   └── requirements.txt
```

**Step 2: Set environment variable**

```bash
export FAL_API_KEY="your_fal_api_key_here"
```

**Step 3: Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install requests
```

### Claude Code Example: Generate Assets Using Your Style

```python
# Claude Code will use this pattern to generate assets

from claude_integration import generate_product, generate_social, generate_brand

# Your Creative Strategist style guide (define this once)
YOUR_STYLE = {
    "primary_style": "photorealistic",
    "color_palette": ["#FF6B35", "#004E89", "#F7F7F7"],
    "mood": "professional and energetic",
    "lighting": "studio lighting with rim light",
    "composition": "centered with dynamic elements",
    "detail_level": "highly detailed",
    "target_audience": "tech professionals aged 25-45"
}

# Generate product photo using your style
result = generate_product(
    product_name="Your Product",
    description="Your product description here",
    style=f"{YOUR_STYLE['primary_style']}, {YOUR_STYLE['mood']}, {YOUR_STYLE['lighting']}",
    num_variations=3
)

print(f"Generated: {result['images']}")
```

### How Claude Code Uses This Skill

When you ask: **"Generate 3 product photos for my luxury watch"**

Claude will:

1. **Read Creative Strategist** to get your style guide
2. **Extract your aesthetic** (photorealistic, luxury, professional, etc.)
3. **Craft detailed prompt** like:
   ```
   "A luxury leather watch with gold accents, photorealistic, 
   professional and elegant, studio lighting with rim light, 
   centered composition, highly detailed, 4K, sharp focus"
   ```
4. **Call automation system** to generate images
5. **Save to organized folder** like `assets/product-photography/luxury-watch/`
6. **Show you results** with file paths
