# Conversion Rate Optimization

Orchestrates conversion optimization across the user journey.

## Routing

Identify the conversion context and load appropriate patterns:

| Context | Reference | Triggers |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| Marketing pages, landing pages, pricing | `references/page-patterns.md` | "page not converting", "improve landing page" |
| Forms (non-signup) | `references/form-patterns.md` | "form friction", "contact form", "lead capture" |
| Signup/registration | `references/signup-patterns.md` | "signup dropoff", "registration friction" |
| Post-signup onboarding | `references/onboarding-patterns.md` | "activation rate", "first-run experience" |
| Paywalls, upgrade screens | `references/paywall-patterns.md` | "convert free to paid", "upgrade modal" |
| Popups, modals, banners | `references/popup-patterns.md` | "exit intent", "email popup" |

## Workflow

1. **Identify stage**: Which part of the funnel?
2. **Load patterns**: Read relevant reference file
3. **Assess current state**: What exists today?
4. **Apply framework**: Use patterns for analysis
5. **Output recommendations**: Prioritized by impact

## Common Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Mobile Optimization
- Touch targets 44px+
- Appropriate keyboard types
- Single-column layouts
- Sticky CTAs

### Trust Signals
- Social proof near conversion points
- Privacy assurances
- Security badges where relevant
- Clear expectations

### Friction Reduction
- Minimize required fields
- Smart defaults
- Progressive disclosure
- Clear error handling

### Measurement
For any CRO work, ensure tracking:
- Funnel step completion rates
- Drop-off points
- Field-level analytics for forms
- Device/source segmentation

## Output Format

### Quick Wins
Changes implementable same-day with high confidence.

### High-Impact Changes
Bigger changes requiring more effort but significant improvement.

### Test Hypotheses
Ideas worth A/B testing rather than assuming.

## Expert Panel Review (MANDATORY)

**Before returning CRO recommendations, run expert panel review on proposed changes.**

See: `ui-skills/references/expert-panel-review.md`

1. Have 10 advertorial experts score the optimizations 0-100
2. Each provides specific improvement feedback
3. **If average < 90:** Iterate on recommendations
4. **Only return when 90+ average achieved**

Key reviewers for CRO:

- **Wroblewski** - Mobile and form UX
- **Cialdini** - Persuasion psychology
