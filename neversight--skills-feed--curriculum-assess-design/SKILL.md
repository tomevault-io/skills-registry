# Assessment Blueprint & Rubric Design

Design valid assessments aligned to learning objectives and create rubrics with clear performance criteria following backwards design principles.

## When to Use

Automatically activate when the user:
- Needs to design assessments for learning objectives
- Asks "create assessment blueprint"
- Wants rubrics for assignments or projects
- Requests "align assessments to objectives"
- Says "how should I assess [learning objective]"
- Needs formative or summative assessment planning

## Required Inputs

- **Learning Objectives**: From `/curriculum.design` or user-provided
- **Educational Level**: K-5, 6-8, 9-12, undergraduate, graduate, or post-graduate
- **Assessment Purpose**: Formative, summative, diagnostic, or authentic
- **Constraints** (optional): Time limits, format requirements, accessibility needs

## Workflow

### 1. Load Learning Objectives

Read curriculum design artifact to get:
- All learning objectives with IDs (e.g., LO-1.1, LO-1.2)
- Bloom's taxonomy levels for each
- Standards alignments
- Performance expectations

### 2. Map Objectives to Assessment Types

For each objective, determine appropriate assessment method based on Bloom's level:

**Remember/Understand**:
- Multiple choice
- Matching
- Short answer
- Fill-in-the-blank
- Labeling diagrams

**Apply**:
- Problem sets
- Demonstrations
- Simulations
- Lab activities
- Case applications

**Analyze**:
- Compare/contrast essays
- Diagramming relationships
- Categorization tasks
- Error analysis
- Data interpretation

**Evaluate**:
- Critiques
- Judgments with justification
- Recommendation reports
- Peer review
- Editorial analysis

**Create**:
- Projects
- Designs
- Research papers
- Portfolios
- Original artifacts

### 3. Create Assessment Blueprint

Document the complete assessment strategy:

```markdown
# Assessment Blueprint: [TOPIC]

**Educational Level**: [Level]
**Based on**: [Link to curriculum design]
**Blueprint Date**: [Date]

## Assessment Philosophy

**Approach**: [Formative-heavy, summative-focused, mastery-based, etc.]

**Balance**:
- Formative Assessment: [Percentage]%
- Summative Assessment: [Percentage]%
- Authentic/Performance: [Percentage]%

**Alignment Principle**: Every learning objective has at least one directly aligned assessment item

## Assessment Map

## Assessment Validity & Alignment

### Constructive Alignment Check

✅ **Objectives → Assessments**: Every objective has aligned assessment
✅ **Bloom's Match**: Assessment types match cognitive levels
✅ **Content Validity**: Assessments measure intended learning
✅ **Authenticity**: Real-world application where appropriate

### Alignment Matrix

|  | LO-1.1 | LO-1.2 | LO-1.3 | LO-2.1 | LO-2.2 |
|--|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Quiz #1** | ✓ | ✓ |  |  |  |
| **Unit 1 Exam** | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |  |  |
| **Lab Report** |  |  | ✓ | ✓ |  |
| **Final Project** | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

## Accessibility & UDL Considerations

- [Option 2]: [Description]
- [Option 3]: [Description]

**Accommodations Available**:
- Extended time
- Read-aloud
- Scribe
- Simplified language
- Visual supports
- Alternative formats

### Bias Review

**Potential Barriers Identified**:
- [Barrier 1]: [Mitigation strategy]
- [Barrier 2]: [Mitigation strategy]

## Assessment Item Specifications

### Item Type 1: Multiple Choice

**Objective**: [LO-X.X]
**Quantity**: [Number of items]
**Bloom's Level**: [Level]

**Stem Format**: [Question style]
**Options**: [Number of distractors]
**Time per Item**: [Estimated minutes]

### Item Type 2: [Type]

[Same structure for each assessment type]

## Grading Workflow

1. **Formative Assessments**: Quick feedback, no formal grade or completion only
2. **Summative Assessments**: Apply rubrics, provide criterion-level feedback
3. **Authentic Tasks**: Use analytic rubrics, conference with students
4. **Final Grades**: Weighted average per assessment schedule

## Next Steps

1. Use `/curriculum.develop-items` to create actual assessment items based on this blueprint
2. Use `/curriculum.develop-content` to create lesson plans aligned to assessments
3. Use `/curriculum.review-pedagogy` to verify alignment after development

**Artifact Metadata**:
- **Artifact Type**: Assessment Blueprint
- **Topic**: [Topic]
- **Level**: [Level]
- **Total Assessments**: [Count]
- **Rubrics Created**: [Count]
- **Alignment Verified**: [Yes/No]
- **Next Phase**: Item Development or Content Development
```

### 4. Rubric Quality Standards

Ensure each rubric includes:

✅ **Clear Criteria**: Specific, important aspects of performance
✅ **Distinct Levels**: 3-5 performance levels (4 is standard)
✅ **Descriptive Language**: Observable indicators, not vague terms
✅ **Positive Framing**: Describe what IS present, not just what's missing
✅ **Student-Friendly**: Language students can understand and use for self-assessment
✅ **Actionable Feedback**: Students know how to improve

### 5. Assessment Type Selection Guide

Use this logic to recommend assessment types:

```python
if blooms_level in ["Remember", "Understand"]:
    if level in ["K-5", "6-8"]:
        recommend "Selected response (MC, matching) + some short answer"
    else:
        recommend "Mixed format with emphasis on application"

elif blooms_level == "Apply":
    if level in ["K-5"]:
        recommend "Demonstrations, hands-on tasks, simple problems"
    else:
        recommend "Problem sets, case applications, simulations"

elif blooms_level == "Analyze":
    recommend "Essays, diagrams, comparative analysis, data interpretation"

elif blooms_level == "Evaluate":
    recommend "Critiques, justified judgments, recommendation reports"

elif blooms_level == "Create":
    recommend "Projects, designs, research papers, portfolios, original artifacts"
```

### 6. Output Format

**Human-Readable** (default):
- Formatted markdown with tables
- Write to: `curriculum-artifacts/[topic]-assessment-blueprint.md`

**JSON Format** (use `--format json`):
```json
{
  "artifact_type": "assessment_blueprint",
  "topic": "string",
  "level": "string",
  "assessments": [
    {
      "name": "string",
      "type": "formative|summative|authentic",
      "objectives": ["LO-1.1", "LO-1.2"],
      "blooms_levels": ["Remember", "Apply"],
      "weight": 15,
      "rubric": {
        "type": "analytic|holistic",
        "criteria": [
          {
            "name": "string",
            "exemplary": "descriptor",
            "proficient": "descriptor",
            "developing": "descriptor",
            "beginning": "descriptor",
            "points": 4
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### 7. CLI Interface

## Composition with Other Skills

**Input from**:
- `/curriculum.design` - Learning objectives drive assessment design

**Output to**:
- `/curriculum.develop-items` - Blueprint specifies items to create
- `/curriculum.develop-content` - Assessments inform instruction
- `/curriculum.review-pedagogy` - Alignment verification
- `/curriculum.grade-assist` - Rubrics used for grading

## Error Handling

- **No learning objectives**: Cannot create blueprint without objectives
- **Missing Bloom's levels**: Infer from objective wording
- **Invalid assessment type**: Suggest appropriate type for cognitive level
- **Rubric criteria unclear**: Use best practices for common task types

## Exit Codes

- **0**: Success - Assessment blueprint and rubrics created
- **1**: Invalid educational level
- **2**: Cannot load learning objectives
- **3**: Assessment type not appropriate for Bloom's level
- **4**: Insufficient information to create rubrics
