# Learning Objectives & Curriculum Architecture Design

Create measurable learning objectives aligned to Bloom's Taxonomy and design comprehensive curriculum architecture for systematic instruction.

## When to Use

Automatically activate when the user:
- Needs to write learning objectives for a topic
- Asks "create learning objectives for [topic]"
- Wants to design curriculum scope and sequence
- Requests "backwards design" or "curriculum architecture"
- Says "organize this content into units"
- Needs UDL-aligned curriculum structure

## Required Inputs

- **Research Artifacts**: Output from `/curriculum.research` (optional but recommended)
- **Topic**: Subject matter to design curriculum for
- **Educational Level**: K-5, 6-8, 9-12, undergraduate, graduate, or post-graduate
- **Duration**: Course length (e.g., "6 weeks", "1 semester", "1 year")
- **Learning Goals** (optional): High-level outcomes the user wants

## Workflow

### 1. Load Research Context

If available, read research report to understand:
- Core concepts to cover
- Standards to align with
- Prerequisites students should have
- Recommended pedagogical approach

### 2. Write Learning Objectives

Create objectives following these principles:

**Structure**: [Audience] will [Measurable Verb] [What] [How/Context] [Criteria]

Example: "*Students* will *analyze* *photosynthesis diagrams* *by identifying and labeling components* *with 80% accuracy*"

**Bloom's Taxonomy Verbs by Level**:

- **Remember** (K-5 emphasis): define, identify, list, name, recall, recognize, state
- **Understand** (K-8 emphasis): describe, explain, summarize, paraphrase, classify, compare
- **Apply** (6-12 emphasis): demonstrate, use, solve, implement, execute, carry out
- **Analyze** (9-12, undergrad): differentiate, organize, attribute, compare, contrast, deconstruct
- **Evaluate** (undergrad, grad): critique, judge, defend, justify, assess, appraise
- **Create** (grad, post-grad): design, construct, generate, produce, plan, compose

**Level-Appropriate Cognitive Distribution**:

- **K-5**: 60% Remember/Understand, 30% Apply, 10% Analyze
- **6-8**: 40% Remember/Understand, 40% Apply, 20% Analyze
- **9-12**: 30% Understand/Apply, 40% Analyze, 30% Evaluate/Create
- **Undergraduate**: 20% Understand/Apply, 40% Analyze, 40% Evaluate/Create
- **Graduate**: 10% Analyze, 40% Evaluate, 50% Create
- **Post-Graduate**: 90% Create, 10% Evaluate

**Objective Categories**:

1. **Content Objectives** (Knowledge): What students will know
2. **Skill Objectives** (Performance): What students will be able to do
3. **Affective Objectives** (optional): Attitudes, values, dispositions

### 3. Organize by Scope & Sequence

Create hierarchical structure:

```
Course/Program
├── Unit 1: [Theme]
│   ├── Lesson 1.1: [Topic]
│   │   └── Learning Objectives (3-5)
│   ├── Lesson 1.2: [Topic]
│   │   └── Learning Objectives (3-5)
│   └── Unit Assessment
├── Unit 2: [Theme]
│   └── [Similar structure]
└── Final Assessment
```

**Sequencing Principles**:
- Simple → Complex
- Concrete → Abstract
- Known → Unknown
- Skills before application
- Concepts before analysis

### 4. Create Curriculum Architecture Document

Generate comprehensive design:

```markdown
# Curriculum Design: [TOPIC]

**Educational Level**: [Level]
**Duration**: [Timeframe]
**Design Date**: [Date]
**Based on Research**: [Link to research artifact if available]

## Course/Unit Overview

**Purpose**: [Why this curriculum exists, what gap it fills]

**Big Ideas**: [2-3 overarching concepts students will understand]

3. **LO-1.3** [Bloom's Level: Apply] - Students will [verb] [content] [context] [criteria]
   - **Standard**: [Aligned standard code]
   - **Assessment**: [How this will be assessed]

[Continue for all objectives in unit]

### Unit 2: [Title] ([Duration])

[Same structure as Unit 1]

## Curriculum Scope & Sequence

**Artifact Metadata**:
- **Artifact Type**: Curriculum Design
- **Topic**: [Topic]
- **Level**: [Level]
- **Total Objectives**: [Count]
- **Duration**: [Timeframe]
- **Bloom's Distribution**: [Percentage at each level]

```

### 5. Validate Objectives

Check each objective for:
- ✅ Measurable action verb (not "understand" alone, but "demonstrate understanding by...")
- ✅ Clear, specific content
- ✅ Observable/assessable outcome
- ✅ Appropriate Bloom's level for grade
- ✅ Aligned to standards (if provided)
- ✅ Realistic for timeframe

### 6. Output Format

**Human-Readable** (default):
- Formatted markdown as shown
- Write to file: `curriculum-artifacts/[topic]-design.md`

**JSON Format** (use `--format json`):
```json
{
  "artifact_type": "curriculum_design",
  "topic": "string",
  "level": "string",
  "duration": "string",
  "units": [
    {
      "unit_number": 1,
      "title": "string",
      "duration": "string",
      "learning_objectives": [
        {
          "id": "LO-1.1",
          "blooms_level": "Remember",
          "objective": "full text",
          "standard": "standard code",
          "assessment_type": "string"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "bloom_distribution": {
    "remember": 20,
    "understand": 25,
    "apply": 30,
    "analyze": 15,
    "evaluate": 5,
    "create": 5
  }
}
```

### 7. CLI Interface

```bash
# With research artifact
/curriculum.design --research "photosynthesis-grade5-research.md" --duration "3 weeks"

# Without research (standalone)
/curriculum.design "quadratic equations" --level "9-12" --duration "4 weeks" --goals "Students will solve, graph, and apply quadratics"

# JSON output
/curriculum.design "neural networks" --level "graduate" --duration "1 semester" --format json

# Help
/curriculum.design --help
```

## Educational Level Adaptations

### K-5
- 3-4 objectives per lesson (simpler focus)
- Heavy emphasis on Remember/Understand/Apply
- Concrete, observable outcomes
- Short lesson durations (30-45 min)

### 6-8
- 4-5 objectives per lesson
- Balance Foundation + Analysis
- Bridge concrete/abstract
- Standard lesson durations (45-50 min)

### 9-12
- 5-6 objectives per lesson
- Emphasis on Analyze/Evaluate
- Abstract reasoning expected
- Extended lesson durations (50-90 min)

### Undergraduate
- 4-6 objectives per week/module
- Emphasize Analyze/Evaluate/Create
- Discipline-specific thinking
- Self-directed learning expected

### Graduate/Post-Graduate
- 3-5 objectives per course
- Heavy emphasis on Create
- Original synthesis and research
- Expertise-level performance

## Composition with Other Skills

**Input from**:
- `/curriculum.research` - Research report informs objectives and structure

**Output to**:
- `/curriculum.assess-design` - Objectives drive assessment design
- `/curriculum.develop-content` - Objectives guide lesson plan creation
- `/curriculum.develop-items` - Objectives specify what items should assess

## Error Handling

- **No research artifact**: Proceed with user-provided topic, warn about missing context
- **Duration too short**: Warn user objectives may not fit timeframe, suggest adjustment
- **Invalid Bloom's level**: Correct to appropriate level for grade
- **Too many/few objectives**: Adjust to recommended range for level

## Exit Codes

- **0**: Success - Curriculum design generated
- **1**: Invalid educational level
- **2**: Duration format invalid
- **3**: Cannot load research artifact (if specified)
- **4**: Insufficient information to create objectives
