# Multimedia & Activity Script Writing

Create engaging scripts and designs for educational videos, presentations, and interactive learning experiences aligned to objectives.

## When to Use

- Write educational video scripts
- Create presentation slide outlines
- Design interactive activities
- Develop multimedia elements
- Script demonstrations or tutorials

## Required Inputs

- **Learning Objectives**: What multimedia will teach
- **Content Source**: Lesson plans or curriculum design
- **Format**: Video, slides, interactive, animation
- **Duration**: Target length
- **Educational Level**: K-5 through post-graduate

## Workflow

### 1. Analyze Learning Context

Understand:
- Objective and Bloom's level
- Target audience characteristics
- Delivery mode (live, recorded, self-paced)
- Technical constraints

### 2. Generate Video Scripts

```markdown
# Video Script: [TITLE]

**Objective**: [LO-X.X]
**Duration**: [Minutes:Seconds]
**Level**: [Educational level]
**Format**: [Lecture, demonstration, animated, etc.]

## Production Notes

**Visuals Needed**: [B-roll, animations, diagrams, text overlays]
**Audio**: [Music, sound effects, voice-over style]
**Pacing**: [Slow/moderate/fast based on complexity]

## Script

### Opening (0:00-0:30)

**[VISUAL: Hook image or animation]**

**NARRATOR**:
"Have you ever wondered why leaves change color in fall? Today, we're going to explore the amazing process of photosynthesis and discover why plants are green."

**[TEXT OVERLAY: "Photosynthesis: How Plants Make Food"]**

### Segment 1: Introduction to Chloroplasts (0:30-2:00)

**[VISUAL: Animated cell with chloroplast highlighted]**

**NARRATOR**:
"Inside every plant cell are tiny structures called chloroplasts. Think of them as the plant's kitchen – this is where food is made. Let's zoom in and see what's happening inside."

**[ANIMATION: Zoom into chloroplast structure]**

**NARRATOR**:
"Chloroplasts contain a special green pigment called chlorophyll. This pigment is the key to photosynthesis – and it's also why plants look green to us."

**[PAUSE FOR PROCESSING - 2 seconds]**

### Segment 2: The Process (2:00-4:30)

**[VISUAL: Diagram showing inputs/outputs]**

**NARRATOR**:
"Photosynthesis is like a recipe. Let's look at the ingredients plants need..."

[Continue with clear, engaging narration]

### Checks for Understanding (Throughout)

**[At 2:30]** "Pause and think: What do you think would happen if there was no sunlight?"

**[At 4:00]** "Let's review: Can you name the three things plants need for photosynthesis?"

### Closing (5:30-6:00)

**NARRATOR**:
"Now you know how plants make their own food through photosynthesis. Next time you see a green plant, remember the amazing chemistry happening inside every leaf!"

**[TEXT OVERLAY: Key vocabulary terms]**

## Accessibility

- **Captions**: Full transcript provided
- **Audio Description**: "Animation shows chloroplast structure with labeled parts"
- **Visual Clarity**: High contrast, clear diagrams
- **Pacing**: Slower for complex concepts, pause points

## Assessment Connection

This video prepares students for [Assessment item or activity]
```

### 3. Create Presentation Outlines

```markdown
# Presentation: [TITLE]

**Objective**: [LO-X.X]
**Slides**: [Number]
**Duration**: [Minutes]
**Level**: [Grade/Level]

## Slide-by-Slide Outline

### Slide 1: Title
**Visual**: [Background image]
**Text**: "[Title]"
**Speaker Notes**: "Welcome students. Today we're learning about..."

### Slide 2: Hook Question
**Visual**: [Engaging image]
**Text**: "Why do leaves change color?"
**Interactive**: Poll or think-pair-share
**Speaker Notes**: "Ask students to share their ideas before revealing answer."

### Slide 3: Learning Objectives
**Visual**: [Simple background]
**Text**: "By the end of today, you will be able to:
- Explain what photosynthesis is
- Identify the role of chlorophyll
- Describe inputs and outputs"

**Speaker Notes**: "Read objectives aloud, emphasize 'you will be able to' to set expectations."

[Continue for each slide with visuals, text, interactions, and detailed speaker notes]

## Interactive Elements

- **Slide 5**: Poll - "What do plants need for photosynthesis?"
- **Slide 8**: Turn and talk - "Explain to your partner why chlorophyll is green"
- **Slide 12**: Quick draw - "Sketch a simple diagram of photosynthesis"

## Accessibility

- Clear fonts (min 24pt)
- High contrast
- Alt text for all images
- No essential information in color alone
```

### 4. Design Interactive Activities

```markdown
# Interactive Activity: [TITLE]

**Objective**: [LO-X.X]
**Type**: [Simulation, game, drag-drop, etc.]
**Duration**: [Minutes]
**Platform**: [Web, app, physical]

## Activity Overview

**Purpose**: [What students will learn by doing]

**Mechanics**: [How the interaction works]

**Feedback**: [How students know if they're correct]

## Activity Flow

### Step 1: Introduction Screen
**Display**: "Welcome! In this activity, you'll build a functioning plant cell..."
**Instructions**: [Clear, simple directions]
**Button**: "Start"

### Step 2: Main Interaction
**Task**: Drag organelles into correct positions
**Feedback**:
- Correct: "Great! The chloroplast goes here because..."
- Incorrect: "Not quite. Remember chloroplasts are responsible for..."
**Hints Available**: [Progressive help system]

### Step 3: Challenge Level
**Task**: Adjust light levels and observe photosynthesis rate
**Data Display**: [Graph showing rate changes]
**Reflection Prompt**: "What happened when you changed the light? Why?"

### Step 4: Summary & Assessment
**Display**: Results and key takeaways
**Export**: Option to save work or share
**Next Steps**: "Try the advanced challenge" or "Return to lesson"
