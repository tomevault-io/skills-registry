# Curriculum Research & Standards Alignment

Research subject matter and provide comprehensive analysis for curriculum design including standards alignment, prerequisite mapping, and pedagogical recommendations.

## When to Use

Automatically activate when the user:
- Starts curriculum development for a new topic
- Asks "research [topic] for [grade level]"
- Needs educational standards alignment (Common Core, NGSS, etc.)
- Requests prerequisite skill analysis
- Says "what learning theory should I use for [topic]"
- Needs interdisciplinary connections identified

## Required Inputs

- **Topic**: Subject matter to research (e.g., "photosynthesis", "quadratic equations", "Renaissance history")
- **Educational Level**: K-5, 6-8, 9-12, undergraduate, graduate, or post-graduate
- **Standards Framework** (optional): Specific standards to align with (e.g., "Common Core Math", "NGSS", "AP Biology")

## Workflow

### 1. Gather Topic and Level

```bash
# User provides topic and level
Topic: [user specified]
Level: [K-5 | 6-8 | 9-12 | undergraduate | graduate | post-graduate]
Standards: [optional: Common Core, NGSS, state standards, discipline framework]
```

### 2. Conduct Subject Matter Research

Use WebSearch to gather:
- **Core Concepts**: Foundational ideas, terminology, definitions
- **Scope & Boundaries**: What's included/excluded at this level
- **Common Misconceptions**: Student difficulties, conceptual barriers
- **Real-World Applications**: Relevance, career connections, authentic contexts
- **Interdisciplinary Connections**: Links to other subjects

### 3. Align to Educational Standards

Use WebSearch to identify:
- **Relevant Standards**: Specific standards codes and descriptions
  - K-12: Common Core (Math/ELA), NGSS (Science), state standards, C3 Framework (Social Studies)
  - Undergraduate: Discipline-specific accreditation standards (ABET, APA, etc.)
  - Graduate: Professional competency frameworks, research methodologies
- **Performance Expectations**: What students should know and be able to do
- **Cognitive Levels**: Bloom's taxonomy levels expected at this grade/level
- **Assessment Boundaries**: What's assessable vs. out of scope

### 4. Map Prerequisites

Analyze and document:
- **Required Prior Knowledge**: Concepts students must already understand
- **Skill Dependencies**: Procedural skills needed before this topic
- **Cognitive Readiness**: Developmental appropriateness
- **Prerequisite Sequence**: Order in which foundational topics should be taught
- **Gap Identification**: Common missing prerequisites to address

### 5. Recommend Learning Theories & Approaches

Based on topic and level, recommend:
- **Primary Learning Theory**: Constructivism, cognitivism, connectivism, behaviorism, etc.
- **Instructional Approaches**: Direct instruction, inquiry-based, problem-based, project-based, etc.
- **Pedagogical Strategies**: Scaffolding, modeling, think-alouds, collaborative learning, etc.
- **Engagement Tactics**: Hooks, real-world connections, student choice, authentic tasks
- **Assessment Philosophy**: Formative vs summative emphasis, authentic assessment, mastery-based, etc.

Create a structured document with:

```markdown

## Composition with Other Skills

This skill outputs research artifacts that feed into:
- `/curriculum.design` - Uses research to inform learning objectives
- `/curriculum.assess-design` - Uses standards for assessment alignment
- `/curriculum.develop-content` - Uses concepts, misconceptions, and pedagogical recommendations

## Error Handling

- **No search results**: Broaden search, try related terms, inform user if topic is too obscure
- **Standards not found**: Suggest closest framework, document assumption
- **Level mismatch**: Warn if topic typically taught at different level, provide guidance
- **Ambiguous topic**: Ask user for clarification on scope

## Output Example

User: "Research photosynthesis for grade 5"

Output: Complete research report with:
- Core concepts (light energy, chloroplasts, glucose production, oxygen release)
- NGSS standards (5-PS3-1, 5-LS1-1, 5-LS2-1)
- Prerequisites (plant structure, energy basics, cycles in nature)
- Recommended approach (Inquiry-based with hands-on investigation)
- Common misconceptions (plants eat soil, only leaves do photosynthesis)
- Real-world connections (food production, climate, oxygen generation)

File saved to: `curriculum-artifacts/photosynthesis-grade5-research.md`

## Exit Codes

- **0**: Success - Research report generated
- **1**: Invalid educational level specified
- **2**: Topic too vague - needs clarification
