# Dashlane Skill

Password manager with dark web monitoring and VPN.

## Quick Install

```bash
curl -sSL https://canifi.com/skills/dashlane/install.sh | bash

Or manually:
```bash

## Setup

Configure via [canifi-env](https://canifi.com/setup/scripts):

## Privacy & Authentication

**Your credentials, your choice.** Canifi LifeOS respects your privacy.

### Option 1: Manual Browser Login (Recommended)
If you prefer not to share credentials with Claude Code:
1. Complete the [Browser Automation Setup](/setup/automation) using CDP mode
2. Login to the service manually in the Playwright-controlled Chrome window

### Option 2: Environment Variables
If you're comfortable sharing credentials, you can store them locally:
