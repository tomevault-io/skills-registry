## Workflows

### Standard Enrichment

- [ ] (Optional) Check balance: `mcp__x402__get_wallet_info`
- [ ] Use `mcp__x402__discover_api_endpoints(url="https://enrichx402.com")` to list all endpoints
- [ ] Use `mcp__x402__check_endpoint_schema(url="...")` to see expected parameters and pricing
- [ ] Call endpoint with `mcp__x402__fetch`
- [ ] Parse and present results

```
mcp__x402__fetch(
  url="https://enrichx402.com/api/apollo/people-enrich",
  method="POST",
  body={"email": "user@company.com"}
)
```

## Person Enrichment

Enrich a person using any available identifier:

```
mcp__x402__fetch(
  url="https://enrichx402.com/api/apollo/people-enrich",
  method="POST",
  body={
    "email": "john@company.com",
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Doe",
    "organization_name": "Acme Inc",
    "domain": "company.com",
    "linkedin_url": "https://linkedin.com/in/johndoe"
  }
)
```

**Input options** (provide any combination):
- `email` - Email address (most reliable)
- `linkedin_url` - LinkedIn profile URL
- `first_name` + `last_name` - Name (works better with domain/org)
- `organization_name` or `domain` - Helps match the right person

**Returns**: Name, title, company, employment history, location, social profiles, phone numbers.

## Company Enrichment

Enrich a company by domain:

```
mcp__x402__fetch(
  url="https://enrichx402.com/api/apollo/org-enrich",
  method="POST",
  body={
    "domain": "stripe.com"
  }
)
```

**Returns**: Company name, industry, employee count, revenue estimates, funding info, technologies used, social links.

## People Search

Search for people matching criteria:

```
mcp__x402__fetch(
  url="https://enrichx402.com/api/apollo/people-search",
  method="POST",
  body={
    "q_keywords": "software engineer",
    "person_titles": ["CTO", "VP Engineering"],
    "organization_domains": ["google.com", "meta.com"],
    "person_locations": ["San Francisco, CA"]
  }
)
```

**Search filters**:
- `q_keywords` - Keywords to search
- `person_titles` - Job title filters
- `organization_domains` - Company domains
- `person_locations` - Location filters
- `person_seniorities` - Seniority levels

## Company Search

Search for companies matching criteria:

```
mcp__x402__fetch(
  url="https://enrichx402.com/api/apollo/org-search",
  method="POST",
  body={
    "q_keywords": "fintech",
    "organization_locations": ["New York, NY"],
    "organization_num_employees_ranges": ["51-200", "201-500"]
  }
)
```

## LinkedIn Scraping (Clado)

Get full LinkedIn profile data:

```
mcp__x402__fetch(
  url="https://enrichx402.com/api/clado/linkedin-scrape",
  method="POST",
  body={
    "linkedin_url": "https://linkedin.com/in/johndoe"
  }
)
```

**Returns**: Experience history, education, skills, certifications, recommendations, connection count.

## Contact Recovery (Clado)

Find missing email or phone:

```
mcp__x402__fetch(
  url="https://enrichx402.com/api/clado/contacts-enrich",
  method="POST",
  body={
    "linkedin_url": "https://linkedin.com/in/johndoe",
    "email": "john@example.com"
  }
)
```

**Returns**: Validated email addresses and phone numbers with confidence scores.

## Bulk Operations

Process up to 10 records in one request:

```
mcp__x402__fetch(
  url="https://enrichx402.com/api/apollo/people-enrich/bulk",
  method="POST",
  body={
    "people": [
      { "email": "person1@company.com" },
      { "email": "person2@company.com" },
      { "linkedin_url": "https://linkedin.com/in/person3" }
    ]
  }
)
```

For companies:

```
mcp__x402__fetch(
  url="https://enrichx402.com/api/apollo/org-enrich/bulk",
  method="POST",
  body={
    "organizations": [
      { "domain": "company1.com" },
      { "domain": "company2.com" }
    ]
  }
)
```

## Cost Optimization

### Field Filtering

Reduce costs by excluding unneeded fields:

```
body={
  "email": "john@company.com",
  "excludeFields": ["employment_history", "photos", "phone_numbers"]
}
```

Common fields to exclude:
- `employment_history` - Past jobs (often large)
- `photos` - Profile images
- `phone_numbers` - If you only need email
- `social_profiles` - If you don't need social links

### Bulk vs Individual

- **Individual**: $0.0495 per record
- **Bulk (10)**: $0.495 total = $0.0495 per record

Bulk is the same price per record but faster for multiple items.

### Search Before Enrich

Use search endpoints ($0.02) to find the right records before enriching ($0.0495):

1. Search for candidates: `/api/apollo/people-search`
2. Review results, pick the right match
3. Enrich only the matches you need

## Parallel Calls

When enriching multiple independent records, make calls in parallel:

```
# These can run simultaneously since they're independent
mcp__x402__fetch(url=".../people-enrich", body={"email": "a@co.com"})
mcp__x402__fetch(url=".../people-enrich", body={"email": "b@co.com"})
```

Or use bulk endpoints for the best efficiency.


## Handling missing data

If any query fails to return the data you are looking for, revist the list of available APIs.

Oftentimes, if apollo is missing data, clado will have it, and vice versa.

If those still fail, use built-in WebSearch and WebFetch tools to find additional information like a company domain name or LinkedIn URL, and then use that data to make more targeted queries.
