# DataForSEO Backlinks API

## Provenance

This is an experimental project to test how OpenCode, plugged into frontier LLMs (OpenAI GPT-5.2), can help generate high-fidelity agent skill files for API integrations.

## When to Apply

- "get backlinks for domain/url", "referring domains", "anchors report"
- "monitor new and lost backlinks", "link velocity", "timeseries backlinks"
- "bulk backlink checks", "bulk ranks", "spam score checks"
- "competitor backlink research", "link gap analysis"

## Integration Contract (Language-Agnostic)

See `references/REFERENCE.md` for the shared DataForSEO integration contract (auth, status handling, task lifecycle, sandbox, and .ai responses).


### Live-first Endpoints

- Backlinks endpoints are typically Live-first and support pagination-like controls (e.g., result limits) and filtering/sorting.
- The Index endpoint provides up-to-the-moment information about the backlinks database.
## Steps

1) Identify the exact endpoint(s) in the official docs for this use case.
2) Choose execution mode:
   - Live (single request) for interactive queries
   - Task-based (post + poll/webhook) for scheduled or high-volume jobs
3) Build the HTTP request:
   - Base URL: `https://api.dataforseo.com/`
   - Auth: HTTP Basic (`Authorization: Basic base64(login:password)`) from https://docs.dataforseo.com/v3/auth/
   - JSON body exactly as specified in the endpoint docs
4) Execute and validate the response:
   - Check top-level `status_code` and each `tasks[]` item status
   - Treat any `status_code != 20000` as a failure; surface `status_message`
5) For task-based endpoints:
   - Store `tasks[].id`
   - Poll `tasks_ready` then fetch results with `task_get` (or use `postback_url`/`pingback_url` if supported)
6) Return results:
   - Provide a normalized summary for the user
   - Include the raw response payload for debugging

## Inputs Checklist

- Credentials: DataForSEO API login + password (HTTP Basic Auth)
- Target: keyword(s) / domain(s) / URL(s) / query string (depends on endpoint)
- Targeting (if applicable): location + language, device, depth/limit
- Time window (if applicable): date range, trend period, historical flags
- Output preference: regular vs advanced vs html (if the endpoint supports it)

## Example (cURL)

```bash
curl -u "${DATAFORSEO_LOGIN}:${DATAFORSEO_PASSWORD}"   -H "Content-Type: application/json"   -X POST "https://api.dataforseo.com/v3/<group>/<path>/live"   -d '[
    {
      "<param>": "<value>"
    }
  ]'
```

Notes:
- Replace `<group>/<path>` with the exact endpoint path from the official docs.
- For task-based flows, use the corresponding `task_post`, `tasks_ready`, and `task_get` endpoints.
