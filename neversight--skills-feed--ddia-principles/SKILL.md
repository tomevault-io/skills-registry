# DDIA Principles

Apply Kleppmann's principles to make informed decisions about data systems.

## Core Framework: The Three Concerns

Every data system decision maps to these concerns:

1. **Reliability** - System works correctly despite faults
2. **Scalability** - System handles growth in data, traffic, or complexity
3. **Maintainability** - System remains operable and evolvable over time

When reviewing designs or making technology choices, evaluate against all three.

## Quick Decision Patterns

### Database Selection

| Need | Start With | Graduate To |
|------|------------|-------------|
| General CRUD, transactions | PostgreSQL | PostgreSQL (it scales further than you think) |
| Document-shaped data, flexible schema | PostgreSQL JSONB | MongoDB if document model is primary |
| Key-value, caching | Redis | Redis Cluster |
| Full-text search | PostgreSQL FTS | Elasticsearch when FTS is primary workload |
| Time-series, metrics | TimescaleDB | ClickHouse at scale |
| Graph relationships | PostgreSQL + recursive CTEs | Neo4j when traversals dominate |

**Default recommendation**: PostgreSQL. It handles more use cases than people realize. Only move to specialized databases when PostgreSQL becomes the bottleneck for a specific workload.

### Consistency vs Availability

Use this when designing distributed features:

```
Strong consistency needed?
├── Yes (money, inventory, unique constraints)
│   └── Use transactions, accept higher latency
│   └── Single leader or consensus protocol
└── No (feeds, caches, analytics)
    └── Eventual consistency acceptable
    └── Can use multi-leader or leaderless
```

### When to Add a Message Queue

Add a queue when:
- Tasks take >100ms and user doesn't need immediate result
- Need to decouple producers from consumers
- Need retry logic with backoff
- Processing can be delayed during load spikes

Don't add a queue just because "microservices." A direct function call or HTTP request is simpler when synchronous processing works.

## Architecture Review Checklist

When reviewing a data system design, ask:

### Data Model
- [ ] Does the data model match how data is queried? (Not just how it's structured logically)
- [ ] Are relationships handled appropriately? (Normalize for integrity, denormalize for read performance)
- [ ] Is there a clear schema evolution strategy?

### Reliability
- [ ] What happens when the database is unavailable?
- [ ] What happens when a downstream service times out?
- [ ] Are writes idempotent where possible?
- [ ] Is there a backup/restore strategy?

### Consistency
- [ ] What consistency guarantees does the system actually need?
- [ ] Where are the transaction boundaries?
- [ ] What happens during partial failures?

### Scalability
- [ ] What's the expected data growth rate?
- [ ] Which operations will become slow first?
- [ ] Are there natural partition keys if sharding becomes needed?

## Code Review Lens

When reviewing code that handles data:

### Red Flags
- Read-modify-write without transactions or optimistic locking
- Assuming network calls will succeed
- Silent data loss on errors
- Unbounded queries without pagination
- N+1 query patterns
- Mixing business logic with data access in ways that prevent batching

### Patterns to Encourage
- Explicit transaction boundaries
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Idempotency keys for mutations
- Cursor-based pagination for large datasets
- Bulk operations where applicable

## Technology Trade-offs Reference

For detailed analysis of specific technology choices, see:
- [references/storage-engines.md](references/storage-engines.md) - LSM vs B-tree, when each shines
- [references/replication.md](references/replication.md) - Leader-based vs leaderless, consistency models
- [references/encoding.md](references/encoding.md) - JSON vs binary formats, schema evolution

## Common Anti-Patterns

### "We need microservices"
Before splitting into services, ask: Is the complexity of distributed transactions worth it? Monoliths with good module boundaries often serve startups better.

### "Let's use Kafka"
Kafka is powerful but operationally complex. For most startups: PostgreSQL LISTEN/NOTIFY, Redis Streams, or a managed queue (SQS, Cloud Pub/Sub) are simpler starting points.

### "We'll just cache everything"
Caching adds complexity: invalidation, consistency, cold starts. First optimize queries, add indexes, denormalize read models. Cache as a last resort.

### "NoSQL for scale"
Modern PostgreSQL with proper indexing handles more than most startups will ever need. Choose NoSQL for data model fit, not scale anxiety.

## Practical Guidance

### For New Systems
1. Start with PostgreSQL
2. Use transactions for data integrity
3. Add caching/queues only when measured need arises
4. Design for the data access patterns you have, not ones you might have

### For Growing Systems
1. Profile before optimizing
2. Vertical scaling is simpler than horizontal—use it first
3. Partition by natural boundaries when needed
4. Consider read replicas before complex architectures

### For System Rewrites
1. Strangler fig pattern over big bang
2. Keep data in sync during migration
3. Verify with shadow reads/writes
4. Roll back capability is essential
