# Deploy to Main

Automates the complete deployment workflow for pushing changes to production.

## Workflow

4. **Deploy**: Push directly to main to trigger production deployment
5. **Confirm**: Provide deployment status

## Commands

```bash
# Build project
npm run build

# Check status
git status
git log --oneline -3

# Commit (if changes exist)
git add -A
git commit -m "chore: <descriptive message>"

# Push directly to main
git push origin main
```

## When to Use

- "deploy to main"
