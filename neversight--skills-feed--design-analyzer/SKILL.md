# Design Analyzer Skill

## Purpose
Extract technical requirements from design references (Figma URLs, screenshots, mockups) for CMS component implementation.

## Philosophy

Accurate design-to-code translation requires systematic extraction of technical specifications.

### Core Beliefs

1. **Precision Over Interpretation**: Extract exact values, don't guess or estimate
2. **Accessibility from the Start**: Check contrast and touch targets during analysis
3. **Responsive by Default**: Design for mobile first, enhance for desktop
4. **Document Technical Decisions**: Record exact colors, spacing, typography for reproducibility

### Why Design Analysis Matters

- **Pixel-Perfect Implementation**: Faithful translation of designer intent
- **Consistent Experiences**: Same colors, spacing, typography across components
- **Accessibility Compliance**: Catch contrast and touch target issues early
- **Developer Efficiency**: Clear specs eliminate guesswork

## When This Skill Activates

This skill automatically activates when:
- User mentions **Figma URL** or Figma design
- User **uploads an image** file (.png, .jpg, .jpeg, .webp, .svg)
- User says phrases like:
  - "implement this design"
  - "create a component from this mockup"
  - "build this layout"
  - "convert this design to [WordPress/Drupal]"
- User asks to analyze visual design elements
- User references a "screenshot" or "wireframe"

## Decision Framework

Before analyzing a design, determine:

### What's the Design Source?

1. **Figma URL** → Extract artboard structure, exact values from design tokens
2. **Screenshot/Image** → Visual analysis, estimate values, measure ratios
3. **Wireframe** → Structure only, minimal styling details
4. **Partial mockup** → Analyze what's visible, note missing context

### What's the Target Platform?

**WordPress**:
- Map to **native blocks** (Group, Heading, Paragraph, Buttons, Image, Columns)
- Output: Block pattern PHP file + SCSS
- Focus: Block composition and responsive classes

**Drupal**:
- Map to **paragraph fields** (text, image, link, entity reference)
- Output: Paragraph type YAML + Twig + SCSS
- Focus: Field structure and view modes

### What Components Are Visible?

**Layout patterns**:
- Hero sections → Full-width container with content overlay
- Card grids → Repeating cards with consistent spacing
- Feature lists → Icon + heading + text patterns
- Navigation → Header with menu items

**Interactive elements**:
- Buttons → Identify all button states (default, hover, focus, active)
- Forms → Note input types, labels, validation states
- Links → Check text links vs. button styles

### What Technical Specs Are Needed?

**Always extract**:
- ✅ **Colors** - Hex values, opacity, contrast ratios
- ✅ **Typography** - Font families, sizes, weights, line heights
- ✅ **Spacing** - Margins, padding, gaps (in px or rem)
- ✅ **Layout** - Grid columns, flex direction, alignment

**Check for accessibility**:
- ✅ **Contrast ratios** - Calculate for all text (4.5:1 minimum)
- ✅ **Touch targets** - Verify buttons ≥ 44x44px on mobile
- ✅ **Focus indicators** - Note if visible focus states exist

### What Responsive Behavior?

**Analyze breakpoints**:
- **Mobile (< 768px)** - Stacked layout, larger touch targets
- **Tablet (768-1023px)** - Mixed layout, medium spacing
- **Desktop (1024px+)** - Full layout, smaller relative spacing

**Common responsive patterns**:
- Columns → Stack on mobile, side-by-side on desktop
- Font sizes → Smaller base on mobile, larger on desktop
- Images → Full width on mobile, constrained on desktop

## Capabilities

### Design Input Processing
- **Figma URLs**: Extract node IDs, artboard names, frame structure
- **Screenshots**: Analyze visual hierarchy, layout patterns, UI components
- **Mockups**: Identify design system elements, spacing, typography
- **Wireframes**: Extract structure and content relationships

### Component Identification
- Recognize common patterns: heroes, CTAs, cards, galleries, slideshows
- Map sections to CMS components (WordPress blocks, Drupal paragraphs)
- Identify reusable patterns vs. unique implementations
- Detect interactive elements requiring JavaScript

### Technical Extraction
- **Colors**: Extract hex codes, identify primary/secondary/accent colors
- **Typography**: Font families, sizes, weights, line-heights
- **Spacing**: Margins, padding, gaps (in px, rem, or relative units)
- **Layout**: Grid systems, flexbox patterns, column structures
- **Breakpoints**: Responsive design requirements
- **Interactions**: Hover states, animations, transitions

## Analysis Process

### 1. Initial Assessment

Ask clarifying questions:
```
What type of component is this?
- WordPress block pattern?
- Drupal paragraph type?
- Custom theme component?

What's the primary purpose?
- Hero section?
- Content display?
- Interactive element?
- Navigation?
```

### 2. Visual Hierarchy Analysis

Examine and document:
```
Layout Structure:
- Sections and their relationships
- Container widths (full-width, contained, etc.)
- Visual hierarchy (what's most prominent)

Content Elements:
- Headings (identify h1, h2, h3 levels)
- Body text and captions
- Images and media placement
- Buttons and CTAs
- Icons and decorative elements
```

### 3. Component Mapping

#### For WordPress:
```
Map to Core Blocks:
- Group: Container/wrapper
- Cover: Full-width sections with background images
- Heading: H1-H6 headings
- Paragraph: Body text
- Buttons/Button: CTAs
- Image: Individual images
- Gallery: Image collections
- Columns/Column: Multi-column layouts
- Spacer: Vertical spacing
- Separator: Dividers
```

#### For Drupal:
```
Map to Paragraph Fields:
- Text (plain): Short text fields
- Text (formatted, long): Body/description fields
- Link: CTA buttons, navigation
- Entity reference (Media): Images, videos
- Boolean: Toggle features
- List (text): Select options
- Entity reference (Taxonomy): Categories/tags
```

### 4. Responsive Behavior Planning

Determine how layout changes:
```
Mobile (320px-767px):
- Single column layouts
- Stacked elements
- Larger touch targets
- Simplified navigation

Tablet (768px-1023px):
- 2-column layouts where appropriate
- Adjusted typography
- Moderate spacing

Desktop (1024px+):
- Multi-column layouts
- Full typography scale
- Maximum spacing
- Hover states prominent
```

### 5. Styling Requirements

Extract specific values:
```
Colors:
  primary: #HEXCODE
  secondary: #HEXCODE
  text: #HEXCODE
  background: #HEXCODE

Typography:
  heading-1: [size]px / [line-height] / [weight]
  heading-2: [size]px / [line-height] / [weight]
  body: [size]px / [line-height] / [weight]

Spacing:
  section-padding: [value]
  element-margin: [value]
  gap: [value]
```

### 6. Accessibility Requirements

Identify needs:
```
Semantic Structure:
- Proper heading hierarchy
- Landmark regions
- Form labels
- Button text

ARIA Needs:
- Labels for icon-only buttons
- Descriptions for complex widgets
- Live regions for dynamic content
- Hidden content for screen readers

Contrast:
- Check all text against backgrounds
- Verify minimum 4.5:1 for body text
- Verify minimum 3:1 for large text/UI
```

### 7. Interactive Elements

Document behavior:
```
For each interactive element:
- What triggers it (click, hover, focus)
- What changes (visual, content, navigation)
- Animation/transition details
- Keyboard interaction requirements
- Accessible alternatives
```

## Output Format

- Accessibility: Need alt text for background image, ensure text contrast

Ready to generate the block pattern. Shall I proceed?
```

## Best Practices

1. **Ask Before Assuming**: If design intent is unclear, ask the user
2. **Be Specific**: Provide exact values (px, rem, hex codes)
3. **Think Mobile-First**: Always consider mobile layout first
4. **Check Accessibility**: Flag potential issues early
5. **Document Interactions**: Don't overlook hover states and animations
6. **Map to Native Components**: Prefer platform-native solutions

## Common Patterns Recognition

Learn to quickly identify these patterns:

- **Hero**: Full-width section, background image, overlaid text, CTA
- **Card Grid**: Repeating items, image + text, equal heights
- **CTA Banner**: Contrasting background, centered text, prominent button
- **Testimonial**: Quote, author info, possibly image
- **Slideshow**: Multiple items, navigation arrows, pagination dots
- **Feature List**: Icons, headings, descriptions, grid/list layout
- **Team Grid**: Photos, names, titles, bio text

For each pattern, know the typical WordPress blocks or Drupal fields needed.
