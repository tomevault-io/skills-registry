<objective>
Systematically audit SwiftUI/UIKit interfaces against Apple Human Interface Guidelines using three complementary design perspectives, identifying violations and providing actionable fixes with code examples.
</objective>

<essential_principles>
## The Three Perspectives

Every HIG audit applies these complementary lenses:

**1. Clarity Perspective** — "Does the interface communicate clearly?"
- Content is paramount, UI defers to it
- Every element has a purpose
- Users know what they can do without instructions
- Information hierarchy is obvious

**2. Consistency Perspective** — "Does this feel like an Apple platform app?"
- Standard UI elements and familiar patterns
- Navigation follows platform conventions
- Gestures work as expected
- Components appear in expected locations

**3. Deference Perspective** — "Does the UI stay out of the way?"
- Subtle backgrounds, restrained branding
- Content is the hero
- Controls recede when not needed
- No visual competition with content

**Golden Rule:** "Deference makes an app beautiful by ensuring the content stands out while the surrounding visual elements do not compete with it." — Apple HIG
</essential_principles>

<workflow>
## Step 1: Context Reconnaissance

Before evaluating any UI, gather project intelligence:

1. **Check project type** — What kind of app is this?
   - Productivity tool → Emphasize Clarity + Consistency
   - Media/content app → Emphasize Deference
   - Creative tool → Balance all three
   - Utility → Emphasize Clarity

2. **Scan for common patterns**
   ```
   Search for:
   - Hardcoded colors (.white, .black, Color(red:...))
   - Fixed font sizes (.system(size: 17))
   - Missing accessibility labels
   - Custom touch targets under 44pt
   - Animations without Reduce Motion checks
   ```

3. **Identify platform targets** — iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, visionOS?

4. **Perform HIG Gap Analysis**
   Search for these anti-patterns:
   - `Color(red:` or `Color(hex:` without asset catalog fallback
   - `.font(.system(size:` without `relativeTo:`
   - `Button` or `Image` without `.accessibilityLabel`
   - `.frame(width:` or `.frame(height:` under 44 for interactive elements
   - `withAnimation` without `@Environment(\.accessibilityReduceMotion)`

**After reconnaissance, present findings and ask user to confirm context weighting before full audit.**

## Step 2: Full Audit

Read the audit checklist, then read perspective-specific references based on project type:

| Project Type | Primary Refs | Secondary Refs |
|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| Productivity | clarity.md, consistency.md | accessibility.md |
| Media/Content | deference.md, colors.md | typography.md |
| Creative | all three perspectives | platform-specific.md |
| Utility | clarity.md, accessibility.md | consistency.md |

**Always include:** accessibility.md review (mandatory for every audit)

## Step 3: Output Format

Present findings with this structure:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  HIG AUDIT SUMMARY                      │
│  Project: [name] | Platform: [target]   │
│  Critical: X | Important: Y | Minor: Z  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

## Overall Assessment
[2-3 sentence summary of HIG compliance]

## Clarity Perspective
### Working Well
- [items that support clear communication]

### Issues Found
- [specific violations with file:line references]

### Perspective Summary
[How well does the UI communicate its purpose?]

---

## Consistency Perspective
### Working Well
- [items following platform conventions]

### Issues Found
- [specific violations with file:line references]

### Perspective Summary
[How well does this feel like a native app?]

---

## Deference Perspective
### Working Well
- [items that let content shine]

### Issues Found
- [specific violations with file:line references]

### Perspective Summary
[How well does the UI stay out of the way?]

---

## Combined Recommendations

| Priority | Issue | Fix | Effort |
|----------|-------|-----|--------|
| Critical | [issue] | [solution] | [Low/Med/High] |
| Important | [issue] | [solution] | [Low/Med/High] |
| Minor | [issue] | [solution] | [Low/Med/High] |

## Quick Reference
- Clarity: [focused on X]
- Consistency: [focused on Y]
- Deference: [focused on Z]
```
</workflow>

<severity_levels>
## Issue Classification

**Critical (Must Fix)**
- Accessibility violations (contrast, touch targets, missing labels)
- Platform convention breaks (non-standard navigation, gestures)
- Dynamic Type not supported
- Reduce Motion not respected

**Important (Should Fix)**
- Hardcoded colors without dark mode variants
- Fixed font sizes
- Inconsistent spacing/alignment
- Missing semantic colors

**Context-Dependent**
- Branding placement
- Custom animations
- Non-standard controls (may be intentional)

**Nice to Have**
- Optical alignment refinements
- Material thickness optimization
- Platform-specific polish
