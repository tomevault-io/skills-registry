# Design Workflow

Create distinctive, non-generic UI. Avoids AI slop (purple gradients, cookie-cutter layouts).

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the design skill to create distinctive, non-generic UI."

<important>
**This skill is user-interactive. Do NOT spawn agents to do design work.**

- This skill walks through design decisions WITH the user — it's collaborative, not delegated
- There is no `arc:design:designer` agent — design creation happens through this skill
- `arc:review:designer` exists but is for REVIEWING implementations AFTER they're built, not for creating designs
- If asked to "design X", follow this skill's phases; don't try to spawn an agent
</important>

---

## Phase 0: Load References (MANDATORY)

**You MUST read these files before proceeding. Do not skip this step.**

<mandatory_references>
**Read ALL of these using the Read tool:**

1. `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/frontend-design.md` — Fonts, anti-patterns, design review checklist. **Critical.**
2. `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/design-philosophy.md` — Timeless principles from Refactoring UI
3. `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/ascii-ui-patterns.md` — Wireframe syntax and patterns

**Then load interface rules:**
4. `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/rules/interface/index.md` — Interface rules index

**And relevant domain rules based on what you're designing:**
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/rules/interface/design.md` — Visual principles
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/rules/interface/colors.md` — Color palettes
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/rules/interface/spacing.md` — Spacing system
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/rules/interface/typography.md` — Typography rules
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/rules/interface/layout.md` — Layout patterns, z-index
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/rules/interface/animation.md` — If motion is involved
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/rules/interface/forms.md` — If designing forms
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/rules/interface/interactions.md` — Touch, keyboard, hover patterns
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/rules/interface/marketing.md` — If designing marketing pages
</mandatory_references>

<progress_context>
**Use Read tool:** `docs/progress.md` (first 50 lines)

Check for related prior design work and aesthetic decisions.
</progress_context>

## Phase 1: Visual Reconnaissance

**Before designing anything, see what exists.**

### If Redesigning Existing UI:

**Use Chrome MCP to capture current state:**

```
1. mcp__claude-in-chrome__tabs_context_mcp (get available tabs)
2. mcp__claude-in-chrome__tabs_create_mcp (create new tab if needed)
3. mcp__claude-in-chrome__navigate to the local dev URL
4. mcp__claude-in-chrome__computer action=screenshot
```

**Analyze the screenshot against the Design Review Checklist from frontend-design.md:**
- Does it have any Red Flags (AI slop indicators)?
- What's the current aesthetic direction (if any)?
- What's working? What's not?

**Report findings to user:** "Here's what I see in the current UI: [observations]. The main issues are: [problems]."

### If Designing From Scratch:

- Confirm dev server is running (or will be)
- Ask if there's any existing brand/style guide to reference
- Check if there are reference designs or inspiration URLs to screenshot

---

## Phase 2: Gather Direction

Ask these questions **one at a time**:

### Question 1: Tone
"What tone fits this UI?"
- Minimal, bold, playful, editorial, luxury, brutalist, retro, organic, industrial, art deco, soft/pastel

### Question 2: Memorable Element
"What should be memorable about this?"
- The animation? Typography? Layout? A specific interaction? Color? Photography style?

### Question 3: Existing Constraints
"Any existing brand/style to match, or fresh start?"

### Question 4: Inspiration
"Any reference designs or inspiration?"
- If provided, **screenshot them immediately using Chrome MCP** for visual reference

### Question 5: UI Chrome
"Should this have standard website chrome (header, footer, navigation), or feel more like an app?"

Consider:
- **Standard website chrome** — Fixed header with logo/nav, footer with links. Good for content sites, marketing pages, multi-page experiences where users need to navigate.
- **App-like experience** — Minimal or no persistent chrome. Content takes full focus. Good for tools, dashboards, immersive experiences, single-purpose flows.
- **Hybrid** — Minimal header (maybe just a logo), no footer. Common for SaaS apps.

**The default shouldn't always be "header + footer".** If the experience is focused (a tool, a game, a single flow), standard chrome can feel clunky and distract from the core experience. Let the purpose guide the frame.

---

## Phase 3: Research Inspiration (Optional)

**Use WebFetch to explore curated design examples based on the chosen direction.**

This phase is optional but recommended when:
- Starting from scratch with no existing references
- The user wants to see examples matching their chosen tone
- You need concrete visual patterns to inform decisions

### Siteinspire (Website/Homepage Design)

Siteinspire curates high-quality website designs. Use WebFetch to explore based on the chosen tone:

```
WebFetch URL patterns by tone:
- Minimal:    https://www.siteinspire.com/websites?style=minimal
- Bold:       https://www.siteinspire.com/websites?style=bold
- Playful:    https://www.siteinspire.com/websites?style=playful
- Editorial:  https://www.siteinspire.com/websites?style=editorial
- Luxury:     https://www.siteinspire.com/websites?style=luxury
- Brutalist:  https://www.siteinspire.com/websites?style=brutalist
- Retro:      https://www.siteinspire.com/websites?style=retro
- Organic:    https://www.siteinspire.com/websites?style=organic

By page type:
- Homepage:   https://www.siteinspire.com/websites?page=homepage
- Portfolio:  https://www.siteinspire.com/websites?page=portfolio
- E-commerce: https://www.siteinspire.com/websites?page=e-commerce
- Blog:       https://www.siteinspire.com/websites?page=blog
```

**WebFetch prompt:** "List the website names, their URLs, and a brief description of their visual style. Focus on typography choices, color palettes, and layout patterns."

### Mobbin (UI/Mobile Design Patterns)

Mobbin collects UI patterns from real apps. Use for component and interaction inspiration:

```
WebFetch URL patterns:
- iOS apps:     https://mobbin.com/browse/ios/apps
- Android:      https://mobbin.com/browse/android/apps
- Web apps:     https://mobbin.com/browse/web/apps

By screen type:
- Onboarding:   https://mobbin.com/browse/ios/screens?screen=onboarding
- Dashboard:    https://mobbin.com/browse/ios/screens?screen=dashboard
- Settings:     https://mobbin.com/browse/ios/screens?screen=settings
- Profile:      https://mobbin.com/browse/ios/screens?screen=profile
- Search:       https://mobbin.com/browse/ios/screens?screen=search
```

**WebFetch prompt:** "List the apps shown and describe their UI patterns—navigation style, card layouts, typography hierarchy, and interaction patterns."

### Research Workflow

1. **Based on user's chosen tone**, fetch 1-2 relevant Siteinspire pages
2. **Based on what you're designing** (homepage, dashboard, form), fetch relevant Mobbin screens
3. **Summarize findings** to user: "I found these patterns that match your direction: [observations]"
4. **Ask:** "Any of these resonate? Should I explore a specific site further with Chrome MCP?"

### Deep Dive with Chrome MCP

If a specific example catches interest, use Chrome MCP for detailed inspection:

```
1. mcp__claude-in-chrome__navigate to the specific site URL
2. mcp__claude-in-chrome__computer action=screenshot
3. Analyze: typography, colors, spacing, layout patterns
4. Report specific values observed (font names, hex colors, spacing)
```

**Note:** WebFetch provides quick overview; Chrome MCP provides detailed visual inspection. Use both strategically.

---

## Phase 4: Make Concrete Visual Decisions

**Capture SPECIFIC visual decisions, not conceptual themes.**

Apply knowledge from the loaded references to make these decisions:

### Typography Selection
Using the font recommendations from `frontend-design.md`:
- **Display font:** [specific font name]
- **Body font:** [specific font name]
- **Mono font (if needed):** [specific font name]

**Never use:** Roboto, Arial, system-ui defaults, Instrument Serif (AI slop)

### Color Palette
- **Background:** [specific hex, e.g., #0a0a0a]
- **Surface/card:** [specific hex]
- **Text primary:** [specific hex]
- **Text secondary:** [specific hex]
- **Accent:** [specific hex]
- **Accent hover:** [specific hex]

**Never use:** Purple-to-blue gradients (AI cliché)

### Spacing System
Define the scale being used:
- **Base unit:** 4px or 8px
- **Common values:** 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64
- **Component padding:** [e.g., 16px default, 24px for cards]
- **Section spacing:** [e.g., 64px between major sections]

### Motion Philosophy
- **Where animation is used:** [specific locations]
- **Animation style:** [e.g., ease-out for enters, springs for interactive]
- **Duration range:** [e.g., 150-300ms]

---

## Phase 5: ASCII Wireframe

**Create ASCII wireframes before any code.** Use patterns from `ascii-ui-patterns.md`.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Logo        [Search...]    [Menu]  │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                     │
│  [Main Content Area]                │
│                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Include:**
1. Primary layout structure
2. Key interactive elements
3. Mobile version if responsive
4. States: empty, loading, error (where relevant)

**Ask:** "Does this layout feel right before I continue?"

---

## Phase 6: Produce Design Document

**Create the design direction document at `docs/plans/design-[component-name].md`:**

```markdown
# Design Direction: [Component/Page Name]

## Aesthetic Direction
- **Tone:** [chosen - e.g., "minimal", "bold", "editorial"]
- **Memorable element:** [specific - e.g., "oversized typography", "micro-interactions on hover"]

## Typography
- **Display:** [font name] — [where used]
- **Body:** [font name] — [where used]
- **Mono:** [font name] — [where used, if applicable]

## Color Palette
| Role | Value | Usage |
|------|-------|-------|
| Background | #0a0a0a | Page background |
| Surface | #1a1a1a | Cards, panels |
| Text primary | #fafafa | Headings, body |
| Text secondary | #a1a1a1 | Labels, hints |
| Accent | #f59e0b | CTAs, links |
| Accent hover | #fbbf24 | Hover states |

## Spacing
- Base unit: 8px
- Component padding: 16px (small), 24px (medium), 32px (large)
- Section gaps: 48px (tight), 64px (normal), 96px (generous)

## Motion
- Page transitions: fade, 200ms ease-out
- Interactive elements: spring (stiffness: 400, damping: 25)
- Hover states: 150ms ease-out

## Layout

### Desktop
[ASCII wireframe]

### Mobile
[ASCII wireframe]

## Implementation Notes
- [Any specific technical considerations]
- [Component library preferences]
- [Animation library: CSS-only vs motion/react]

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- [Specific things NOT to do for this design]
```

---

## Phase 7: Verify Against Checklist

**Run the Design Review Checklist from frontend-design.md:**

### Red Flags (must be zero)
- [ ] Uses default system fonts
- [ ] Purple-to-blue gradient present
- [ ] White background + gray cards throughout
- [ ] Could be mistaken for generic AI output

### Green Flags (should have most)
- [ ] Clear aesthetic direction documented
- [ ] Typography is deliberate
- [ ] At least one memorable element
- [ ] Layout has unexpected decisions

**If any Red Flags are present, revise before proceeding.**

---

## Phase 8: Hand Off

**Use AskUserQuestion tool:**
```
Question: "Design documented. What's next?"
Header: "Next step"
Options:
  1. "Create detailed plan" (Recommended) — Run /arc:detail for task breakdown
  2. "Save and stop" — Return to this later
```

**IMPORTANT: Do NOT automatically invoke other skills.**

- **If option 1:** Tell user: "Design saved. Run `/arc:detail` to create implementation tasks."
- **If option 2:** Tell user: "Design saved to `docs/plans/design-[name].md`. Return anytime."

---

## During Implementation (Reference for /arc:implement)

When implementing this design (via /arc:implement), use Chrome MCP continuously:

### After Every Significant Change
```
mcp__claude-in-chrome__computer action=screenshot
```

### Check Responsive Behavior
```
mcp__claude-in-chrome__resize_window width=375 height=812  # Mobile
mcp__claude-in-chrome__computer action=screenshot
mcp__claude-in-chrome__resize_window width=1440 height=900 # Desktop
mcp__claude-in-chrome__computer action=screenshot
```

### Verify Against Design Doc
- Does the typography match what was specified?
- Are the colors exactly as documented?
- Does spacing feel consistent with the system?
- Is the memorable element actually memorable?

**Never commit UI code without visually verifying it looks correct.**

---

## Anti-Patterns (Quick Reference)

From `frontend-design.md`:

**🚫 Never use sparkles/stars to denote AI features.** Overused, meaningless, dated.

**🚫 Never propose conceptual themes with metaphors.** No "Direction: Darkroom / Metaphor: Photo emerging from developer bath". Instead: "Dark background (#0a0a0a) with warm red accents (#dc2626)."

**🚫 Never use these:**
- Roboto/Arial/system-ui defaults
- Purple-to-blue gradients
- White backgrounds with gray cards
- Rounded corners on everything
- Mixed icon styles

---

<arc_log>
**After completing this skill, append to the activity log.**
See: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/arc-log.md`

Entry: `/arc:design — [Component/page] design ([aesthetic direction])`
</arc_log>

<success_criteria>
Design is complete when:
- [ ] All mandatory references were loaded and applied
- [ ] Current UI was screenshotted (if redesigning)
- [ ] Aesthetic direction established with SPECIFIC values
- [ ] Typography selected from recommended fonts
- [ ] Color palette defined with hex values
- [ ] Spacing system documented
- [ ] ASCII wireframes created and approved
- [ ] Design document saved to docs/plans/
- [ ] Red flag checklist passed (zero red flags)
- [ ] Progress journal updated
</success_criteria>

## Interop

- Produces design doc consumed by **/arc:implement**
- Can invoke **web-design-guidelines** skill for compliance review (if available)
- Uses **Chrome MCP** (`mcp__claude-in-chrome__*`) for visual capture throughout
- Uses **WebFetch** to research design inspiration from Siteinspire and Mobbin
- References feed into implementation to maintain design fidelity
