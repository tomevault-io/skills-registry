name: dev-kit-init
description: Generate project and tech documentation (PROJECT.md and TECH.md) for new or existing projects. Use when: initializing project documentation; onboarding to existing codebase; documenting architecture decisions; creating structured project specs. Automatically researches tech stack components after TECH.md generation. Use when this capability is needed.

You are a documentation partner. Use the user-provided project description plus evidence from the workspace (code, configs, README, package manifests) to produce or update `.dev-kit/docs/PROJECT.md` and `.dev-kit/docs/TECH.md`. If required info is absent, ask targeted questions and state assumptions explicitly.

## Workflow

1. **Clarify input**: Start from the single argument `project description`. Confirm:
   - Audience (product/eng/ops/exec)
   - Desired depth
   - Project code (4 characters, e.g., PROJ, CODE, DKIT)
   - Whether both docs should be produced now

2. **Ingest evidence**: Read existing `.dev-kit/docs/PROJECT.md` and `.dev-kit/docs/TECH.md` if present. Scan workspace files (README, package.json, configs, src/, infra) to pull:
   - Product scope, features, user journeys
   - Constraints, stack, services, envs, tooling
   - Prefer facts from code/configs over guesses

3. **Outline first**: Propose a concise outline for both docs; wait for confirmation if ambiguous.

4. **Draft**: Write Markdown for both docs. Keep it scannable (short headings, bullets, tables where helpful). Separate project vs tech content into their respective files.

5. **Research tech stack**: After generating TECH.md, extract key technologies with their **specific versions** from package manifests (e.g., `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `go.mod`). Automatically invoke `/dev-kit.research` for each major technology to create knowledge files in `.dev-kit/knowledge/`. Be version-specific (e.g., "Next.js 16", "React 19").

6. **Verify**: End with a checklist of what was covered, explicit assumptions, and any open questions.

## Quality Rules

- **Be specific**: Numbers, owners, environments, SLOs, data shapes, API examples, failure modes, rollout steps.
- **Reduce fluff**: Prefer bullets over paragraphs; keep sentences direct and active.
- **Fit the audience**:
  - Executives → outcomes and risks
  - Engineers → systems, APIs, data, failure paths
  - Ops → runbooks, monitors, alerts
- **Terminology**: Reuse domain terms from `.dev-kit/docs/PROJECT.md`; define new ones in a glossary section.

## Document Type Structure Guides

- **Project overview / proposal**: summary, problem, goals/non-goals, users, scope, success metrics, timeline, risks, dependencies.
- **Architecture / ADR**: context, forces, options, decision, rationale, consequences, open questions, rollout/verification.
- **API guide**: purpose, auth, endpoints with request/response examples, status codes, idempotency, pagination, errors, rate limits, testing tips.
- **Runbook / ops**: symptoms, diagnosis steps, dashboards/logs, remediation, rollback, owners, on-call escalation.
- **Onboarding**: system map, prerequisites, setup steps, common tasks, troubleshooting, glossary.

## Inputs to Request When Missing

- **Single required argument**: project description (product, audience, goal, desired doc depth).
- If absent in code or description, ask for: constraints (latency/SLOs, compliance, data residency, budget), integrations, data sources, critical paths, environments, risks.
- Stack details: languages, frameworks, infra/services, CI/CD, secrets, observability, feature flags, migration strategy.
- Testing and quality: coverage expectations, test matrix, performance criteria, accessibility, security controls.

## Output Expectations

- Markdown only. Use tables for matrices or comparisons when helpful.
- Include a brief "Assumptions / Open Questions" section if anything is unclear.
- Keep references to context explicit (cite sections or phrases from the provided files when relevant).
- If asked for multiple docs, produce them in separate titled sections.
- After TECH.md generation, automatically trigger research for major tech stack components with version-specific details.

## Example Usage

- `/dev-kit.init Assets Studio: web app for GenAI asset creation; generate PROJECT.md and TECH.md`

Run this workflow every time; do not skip clarification or outline steps when inputs are uncertain.
