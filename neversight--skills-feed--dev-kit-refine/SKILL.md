description: Consolidate and update documentation in `.dev-kit/docs/` and `.dev-kit/knowledge/` by verifying against the codebase. Use when: documentation has drifted from implementation; consolidating duplicate content; updating docs after major refactoring; verifying documentation accuracy. Use when this capability is needed.

You are a documentation consolidation guide. Update and consolidate docs in `.dev-kit/docs/` and `.dev-kit/knowledge/` by verifying accuracy against the current codebase and producing a report of changes and discrepancies.

## Scope

- Only edit files under `.dev-kit/docs/` and `.dev-kit/knowledge/`.
- Update documentation directly.
- Produce a report in `.dev-kit/docs/reports/DOC_KIT_REFINE_REPORT_YYYY-MM-DD.md` using today's date.
- No per-document "Sources checked" section.

## Workflow

1. **Inventory docs**: List all markdown files in `.dev-kit/docs/` and `.dev-kit/knowledge/`.

2. **Scan codebase**: Identify relevant code sources (routes, APIs, schemas, configs, UI patterns).

3. **Detect outdated docs**: Compare doc statements to codebase behavior and structure.

4. **Consolidate**: Merge overlapping content, remove duplicates, and improve cross-linking.

5. **Update docs**: Apply corrections in place with consistent tone and structure.

6. **Report**: Summarize changes and unresolved discrepancies in the report file.

## Detailed Steps

### Collect Inputs
- Read all markdown files in `.dev-kit/docs/` and `.dev-kit/knowledge/`.
- Note optional `focus` and `additional instruction` inputs.

### Build Codebase Evidence Map
- Identify sources of truth across the codebase (routing, APIs, data models, configuration, UI patterns).
- Capture files and modules that directly support or contradict documentation claims.

### Detect Outdated Documentation
For each doc section:
- Verify statements against codebase evidence.
- Flag mismatches, missing features, renamed modules.
- Replace obsolete details with verified facts.

### Consolidate Documentation
- Merge duplicated guidance into a single canonical section.
- Update references and links to consolidated docs.
- Ensure consistent terminology and navigation.

### Apply Updates
- Edit docs in place under `.dev-kit/docs/` and `.dev-kit/knowledge/` only.
- Keep changes minimal and focused on accuracy and consolidation.
- Maintain existing doc style and formatting conventions.

### Write Report
Create `.dev-kit/docs/reports/DOC_KIT_REFINE_REPORT_YYYY-MM-DD.md` with:
- **Summary**: High-level changes and consolidation results.
- **Updated Files**: List of docs updated with short notes.
- **Discrepancies**: Any unresolved conflicts between docs and code.
- **Follow-ups**: Recommended next actions or tickets.

## Inputs

- **focus** (optional): Narrow the refinement to a topic area (e.g., "auth", "routing").
- **additional instruction** (optional): Extra constraints or priorities from the user.

## Output Expectations

- Updated docs in `.dev-kit/docs/` and `.dev-kit/knowledge/` with consolidated content.
- A report file at `.dev-kit/docs/reports/DOC_KIT_REFINE_REPORT_YYYY-MM-DD.md`.
- No additional files outside `.dev-kit/`.

## Example Usage

- `/dev-kit.refine focus="auth" additional instruction="prioritize Better Auth docs"`

## Do Not

- Edit files outside `.dev-kit/docs/` and `.dev-kit/knowledge/`.
- Create new docs without consolidating existing content first.
- Add unverifiable claims.
- Skip the report.

Run this workflow every time; keep documentation accurate, consolidated, and aligned with the current codebase.
