# Developer Career Ladder

Design comprehensive engineering career ladders with clear competency frameworks, promotion criteria, and evidence templates.

## Purpose

Create career ladders that:
- Define expectations for each engineering level
- Provide transparent promotion pathways
- Establish consistent evaluation criteria
- Guide career development conversations
- Support fair, evidence-based promotions

## Career Ladder Structure

### Level Definitions

**Individual Contributor (IC) Track:**

| Level | Title | Years Exp | Scope | Impact |
|-------|-------|-----------|-------|--------|
| L3 | Junior Engineer | 0-2 | Individual tasks | Team |
| L4 | Engineer | 2-5 | Features | Team |
| L5 | Senior Engineer | 5-8 | Projects | Multiple teams |
| L6 | Staff Engineer | 8-12 | Initiatives | Org/Product |
| L7 | Senior Staff | 12-15 | Strategic | Company |
| L8 | Principal | 15+ | Vision | Industry |

**Management Track:**

| Level | Title | Years Exp | Team Size | Scope |
|-------|-------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| M4 | Engineering Manager | 5+ | 4-8 ICs | Single team |
| M5 | Senior EM | 8+ | 8-12 | Multiple teams |
| M6 | Director | 10+ | 15-30 | Department |
| M7 | Senior Director | 12+ | 30-60 | Large org |
| M8 | VP Engineering | 15+ | 60+ | Engineering org |

### Competency Framework

**Three Core Competencies:**
1. **Technical Excellence** (varies by level)
2. **Leadership & Influence** (increases with level)
3. **Collaboration & Impact** (increases with level)

**Senior Engineer (L5) Example:**

```json
{
  "level": "L5",
  "title": "Senior Engineer",
  "competencies": {
    "technical": {
      "weight": 0.60,
      "expectations": [
        "Designs and implements complex systems independently",
        "Makes sound architectural decisions for team's domain",
        "Debugs issues across stack/services",
        "Writes high-quality, maintainable code",
        "Considers scale, performance, reliability"
      ],
      "evidence_examples": [
        "Led migration to new database with zero downtime",
        "Designed caching layer that reduced latency 70%",
        "Implemented monitoring that caught 3 production issues before customer impact"
      ]
    },
    "leadership": {
      "weight": 0.25,
      "expectations": [
        "Mentors 2-3 junior/mid engineers",
        "Leads technical design for medium-large projects",
        "Influences technical decisions beyond own team",
        "Improves team processes and practices"
      ],
      "evidence_examples": [
        "Mentored 2 engineers who were promoted",
        "Led design review process improvement, reduced time 30%",
        "Presented technical deep-dive at engineering all-hands"
      ]
    },
    "collaboration": {
      "weight": 0.15,
      "expectations": [
        "Partners effectively with PM, design, data",
        "Communicates technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders",
        "Drives consensus on technical decisions",
        "Contributes to engineering culture"
      ],
      "evidence_examples": [
        "Led cross-functional project with PM and design",
        "Wrote technical blog post (external or internal)",
        "Organized engineering book club"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Promotion Packet Template

```markdown
# Promotion Packet: [Name] → [Target Level]

## Summary
[1 paragraph: why this person is ready for next level]

## Competency Evidence
