# Developer Feedback Collector

Design structured feedback collection processes that generate actionable, specific, and balanced input for performance reviews and growth conversations.

## Purpose

Create feedback systems that:
- Generate specific, example-based feedback
- Identify themes across multiple inputs
- Balance positive and constructive feedback
- Protect psychological safety
- Enable data-driven performance discussions

## Core Process

### 1. Design Feedback Prompts

**Structured Question Framework:**

```markdown
## Technical Excellence
- What technical contributions has [Name] made that stand out?
- Where could [Name] improve technically?
- Specific example: [Describe situation]

## Collaboration & Communication
- How effectively does [Name] work with others?
- Example of strong collaboration: [Describe]
- Area for growth in collaboration: [Describe]

## Leadership & Impact
- How does [Name] influence beyond their immediate work?
- Example of leadership: [Describe]
- Growth opportunity in leadership: [Describe]

## Overall
- What should [Name] continue doing?
- What should [Name] start/stop doing?
- One specific development suggestion: [Describe]
```

**Prompt Design Principles:**
- Ask for specific examples, not generalizations
- Balance positive and constructive
- Frame constructively (growth opportunities, not failures)
- Use behavioral language (observable actions)
- Avoid leading questions

### 2. Collect Feedback

**Who to Ask:**
- Direct manager (required)
- Peers (3-5 engineers at similar level)
- Cross-functional partners (PM, design, etc.)
- Skip-level manager (for senior+)
- Mentees (if applicable)

**Collection Methods:**
- Written surveys (async, allows reflection)
- 1:1 conversations (deeper context)
- Anonymous (for honest constructive feedback)
- Attributed (for accountability and follow-up)

**Best Practice:** Mix of attributed and anonymous for balanced input

### 3. Synthesize Themes

**Synthesis Process:**
1. Read all feedback inputs
2. Identify recurring themes (3+ mentions = pattern)
3. Group examples by theme
4. Note outlier feedback (1-off mentions)
5. Look for contradictions (investigate causes)

**Output Structure:**

```json
{
  "employee": "Name",
  "feedback_period": "Q4 2025",
  "respondents": 8,
  "themes": [
    {
      "category": "Technical Excellence",
      "theme": "Strong system design skills",
      "frequency": 6,
      "examples": [
        "Designed scalable caching architecture for API - reduced latency 60%",
        "Led database migration with zero downtime"
      ],
      "type": "strength"
    },
    {
      "category": "Collaboration",
      "theme": "Could improve communication in PRs",
      "frequency": 4,
      "examples": [
        "PR comments sometimes terse, hard to understand reasoning",
        "Could explain design decisions more clearly in code review"
      ],
      "type": "growth_area"
    }
  ],
  "actionable_items": [
    "Continue driving architectural initiatives",
    "Work on PR communication: explain *why* in code review comments"
  ]
}
```

### 4. Deliver Feedback

**Delivery Framework (Manager → Employee):**

```markdown
## Feedback Summary: [Name] - [Period]

### Key Strengths
[Theme 1 with examples]
[Theme 2 with examples]

### Growth Opportunities
[Theme 1 with examples and specific suggestions]
[Theme 2 with examples and specific suggestions]

### Action Plan
1. [Specific action]: [Why] → [How to measure success]
2. [Specific action]: [Why] → [How to measure success]

### Next Steps
- [Discuss in 1:1 on DATE]
- [Set goals for next period]
```

**Delivery Best Practices:**
- Start with strengths (build confidence)
- Be specific (examples, not vague criticisms)
- Focus on behaviors (changeable) not traits (fixed)
- Collaborative tone (partner in growth)
- Forward-looking (action plan, not dwelling on past)

## Using Supporting Resources

### Templates
- **`templates/feedback-prompts.json`** - Question bank by competency
- **`templates/synthesis-template.md`** - Theme identification framework

### Scripts
- **`scripts/synthesize-feedback.py`** - Auto-detect themes from responses
- **`scripts/anonymize.py`** - Remove identifying information
