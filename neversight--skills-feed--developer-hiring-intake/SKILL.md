# Developer Hiring Intake

Transform unstructured hiring needs into comprehensive, structured intake documents that ensure legal compliance, clear expectations, and effective recruiting strategies.

## Purpose

This skill guides the creation of standardized hiring intake documents for engineering roles. Intake documents serve as the foundation for job descriptions, recruiting strategies, interview loops, and offer packages. A well-structured intake prevents miscommunication, ensures legal compliance, and improves hiring outcomes.

## When to Use

Invoke this skill when:
- Starting a new engineering role requisition
- Replacing a departing team member
- Planning headcount for next quarter/year
- Converting contractor role to full-time
- Creating backfill requisition

## Core Process

### 1. Gather Role Context

Collect essential information about the role:

**Role Identity:**
- Job title (use standard industry titles: "Senior Backend Engineer", not "Code Ninja")
- Team and department
- Reporting structure (who the role reports to)
- Location requirements (remote, hybrid, specific office)

**Business Context:**
- Why is this role needed? (new headcount, backfill, team growth)
- What problem does this role solve?
- What happens if the role remains unfilled?
- Target start date and urgency level

**Team Structure:**
- Current team size
- Team distribution (locations, timezones)
- Related roles that interface with this position
- Team growth trajectory

### 2. Define Requirements

Create clear, legally-compliant requirements:

**Must-Have Requirements (Non-Negotiable):**
- Technical skills with proficiency levels (e.g., "5+ years Python production experience")
- Domain expertise (e.g., "distributed systems", "frontend frameworks")
- Behavioral competencies (e.g., "cross-functional collaboration")
- Legal requirements (work authorization, certifications)

**Nice-to-Have Requirements (Differentiators):**
- Bonus technical skills
- Industry experience
- Specific tool familiarity
- Advanced degrees or certifications

**Legal Compliance Check:**
- Avoid protected class references (age, race, gender, etc.)
- Use years of experience cautiously (can indicate age bias)
- Focus on skills and outcomes, not demographic characteristics
- Review jurisdiction-specific requirements (see `references/legal-compliance.md`)

### 3. Map Competencies

Define success criteria across competency areas:

**Technical Competency (Weight: typically 60-70%):**
- Core technical skills required
- Complexity of problems to solve
- Technical decision-making scope
- Code quality expectations

**Leadership Competency (Weight: typically 10-30%):**
- Mentoring expectations
- Technical leadership scope
- Influence beyond immediate team
- Strategic contributions

**Collaboration Competency (Weight: typically 10-20%):**
- Cross-functional work requirements
- Communication expectations
- Stakeholder management
- Team dynamics fit

Assign weights to competencies based on role level and team needs. Total weights must equal 100%.

### 4. Define Compensation

Establish competitive, equitable compensation:

**Base Salary Range:**
- Research market rates (use `references/compensation-research.md`)
- Consider: level, location, company stage, market conditions
- Define range with 15-25% spread (e.g., $180k-220k)
- Document competitive positioning (market rate, below, above)

**Equity/Stock Options:**
- Percentage or option count
- Vesting schedule (typically 4 years, 1-year cliff)
- Refresh policy

**Total Compensation:**
- Calculate total comp including equity, benefits
- Compare to market benchmarks
- Justify any below-market positioning

**Legal Considerations:**
- Comply with pay transparency laws (required in CA, CO, NY, WA, etc.)
- Document compensation rationale
- Ensure internal equity (similar roles, similar pay)

### 5. Plan Timeline

Create realistic hiring timeline:

**Key Milestones:**
- Intake approval date
- Job description completion
- Sourcing start date
- Interview loop availability
- Target offer date
- Target start date

**Interview Capacity:**
- Interviewers available per week
- Interview slots per week
- Estimated weeks from screen to offer
- Buffer for scheduling, decision-making

**Urgency Assessment:**
- Critical role (blocks major initiatives): expedited process
- Important role (team growth): standard process
- Future planning (building pipeline): extended process

### 6. Generate Structured Output

Produce JSON intake document conforming to schema:

```json
{
  "role": {
    "title": "string",
    "level": "string (Junior/Mid/Senior/Staff/Principal)",
    "team": "string",
    "department": "string",
    "reports_to": "string",
    "location": "string",
    "employment_type": "string (Full-time/Contract/Part-time)"
  },
  "business_context": {
    "role_type": "string (new_headcount/backfill/conversion)",
    "business_need": "string",
    "impact_if_unfilled": "string",
    "urgency": "string (critical/high/medium/low)"
  },
  "requirements": {
    "must_have": ["array of strings"],
    "nice_to_have": ["array of strings"],
    "years_experience": "string (e.g., '5-8 years')",
    "education": "string or null"
  },
  "competencies": {
    "technical": {
      "weight": 0.70,
      "description": "string",
      "key_skills": ["array"]
    },
    "leadership": {
      "weight": 0.20,
      "description": "string",
      "expectations": ["array"]
    },
    "collaboration": {
      "weight": 0.10,
      "description": "string",
      "expectations": ["array"]
    }
  },
  "compensation": {
    "base_range": "string (e.g., '$180k-220k')",
    "equity_range": "string",
    "total_comp_target": "string",
    "market_positioning": "string (market-rate/below/above)",
    "rationale": "string"
  },
  "timeline": {
    "target_start_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "intake_approval_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "sourcing_start_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "interview_slots_per_week": 5,
    "estimated_weeks_to_offer": 4
  },
  "metadata": {
    "created_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "created_by": "string",
    "approved_by": "string or null",
    "version": "1.0"
  }
}
```

Save output to `intake-{role-title}-{date}.json`.

### 7. Validate and Review

Run validation checks using `scripts/validate-intake.py`:

```bash
python scripts/validate-intake.py intake-senior-backend-2026-01-22.json
```

Validation checks:
- ✓ Schema compliance
- ✓ No protected class language
- ✓ Competency weights sum to 1.0
- ✓ Compensation range is reasonable (15-25% spread)
- ✓ Timeline is realistic (not too aggressive)
- ✓ Required fields populated

Review checklist:
- [ ] Role title uses industry-standard terminology
- [ ] Requirements focus on skills/outcomes, not demographics
- [ ] Compensation is competitive and internally equitable
- [ ] Timeline accounts for team interview capacity
- [ ] Business need clearly articulated
- [ ] Approval chain documented
