# Developer Interview Loop Design

Design structured, fair, and effective interview loops that assess engineering candidates across technical, leadership, and collaboration competencies.

## Purpose

Create interview loops that:
- Assess all competencies from role scorecard
- Minimize bias through structured questions
- Provide excellent candidate experience
- Enable data-driven hiring decisions
- Comply with employment law

## When to Use

Invoke when:
- Creating new interview process for role
- Redesigning existing interview loop
- Standardizing interviews across team
- Training new interviewers
- Ensuring legal compliance in assessments

## Core Process

### 1. Map Competencies to Interview Stages

Based on role scorecard, design loop structure:

**Standard Engineering Loop:**

| Stage | Duration | Competency | Interviewer(s) | Format |
|-------|----------|------------|----------------|--------|
| Recruiter Screen | 30 min | Basic fit, communication | Recruiter | Phone/Video |
| Technical Screen | 60 min | Technical (coding) | Engineer | Live coding |
| Coding Interview | 90 min | Technical (algorithms, problem-solving) | 2 Engineers | Whiteboard/CoderPad |
| System Design | 60 min | Technical (architecture) | Senior+ Engineer | Whiteboard |
| Behavioral | 45 min | Leadership, Collaboration | Hiring Manager | Structured Q&A |
| Team Fit | 45 min | Collaboration, Culture | Team member | Conversational |

**Total Time:** 5-6 hours

**Competency Coverage:**
- Technical: 70% (Screen + Coding + Design)
- Leadership: 15% (Behavioral)
- Collaboration: 15% (Behavioral + Team Fit)

### 2. Create Interview Rubrics

For each interview stage, define:

**Rubric Structure:**
```json
{
  "interview_stage": "System Design Interview",
  "duration_minutes": 60,
  "competencies_assessed": ["Technical Architecture", "Communication"],
  "evaluation_criteria": [
    {
      "criterion": "Problem decomposition",
      "weight": 0.3,
      "scoring": {
        "5": "Breaks down complex system into clear components with trade-offs",
        "3": "Identifies major components, some gaps in analysis",
        "1": "Struggles to decompose problem"
      }
    },
    {
      "criterion": "Scale considerations",
      "weight": 0.25,
      "scoring": {
        "5": "Proactively discusses scaling, bottlenecks, data volumes",
        "3": "Addresses scale when prompted",
        "1": "Does not consider scale"
      }
    },
    {
      "criterion": "Communication clarity",
      "weight": 0.2,
      "scoring": {
        "5": "Clearly explains thinking, uses diagrams effectively",
        "3": "Communicates adequately with some prompting",
        "1": "Difficult to follow reasoning"
      }
    },
    {
      "criterion": "Technical depth",
      "weight": 0.25,
      "scoring": {
        "5": "Deep understanding of databases, caching, queuing, etc.",
        "3": "Solid fundamentals, some depth",
        "1": "Surface-level understanding"
      }
    }
  ],
  "pass_threshold": 3.0,
  "strong_hire_threshold": 4.0
}
```

**Scoring Scale (1-5):**
- 5: Exceptional - exceeds expectations for level
- 4: Strong - clearly meets expectations
- 3: Adequate - meets minimum bar
- 2: Weak - concerns about fit
- 1: Poor - does not meet bar

### 3. Develop Structured Questions

Create question banks with consistent rubrics:

**Behavioral Interview Questions (STAR Method):**

Must assess: Leadership, Collaboration

**Leadership Questions:**
- "Tell me about a time you mentored a junior engineer. What was your approach?"
- "Describe a situation where you had to influence a technical decision you weren't directly responsible for."
- "Give an example of when you improved a team process or practice."

**Collaboration Questions:**
- "Describe a time you disagreed with a teammate on a technical approach. How did you resolve it?"
- "Tell me about working with a difficult stakeholder. How did you manage the relationship?"
- "Give an example of when you had to explain a complex technical concept to a non-technical audience."

**STAR Evaluation:**
- Situation: Context clearly described?
- Task: Responsibility/goal clear?
- Action: Specific actions taken?
- Result: Measurable outcome?

**Technical Questions (Coding):**

Create bank organized by difficulty:

```markdown
## Easy (Warm-up, Junior level)
- Two Sum
- Valid Palindrome
- Reverse String

## Medium (Core assessment, Mid-Senior)
- Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
- Merge Intervals
- LRU Cache

## Hard (Senior+ differentiation)
- Serialize/Deserialize Binary Tree
- Word Ladder
- Design In-Memory File System
```

**Anti-Pattern:** Don't just test algorithm memorization. Assess:
- Problem-solving approach
- Code quality and organization
- Testing and edge cases
- Communication while coding

### 4. Train Interviewers

Ensure consistent, fair interviews:

**Interviewer Calibration:**
- Shadow 3-5 interviews before conducting independently
- Compare scores with experienced interviewers
- Attend calibration sessions quarterly
- Review unconscious bias training

**Interview Guidelines:**
- Use structured questions from question bank
- Take detailed notes during interview
- Score immediately after interview
- Don't be influenced by other interviewers' feedback until debrief

**Red Flags to Avoid:**
- Asking questions about protected characteristics
- Making hiring decisions based on "gut feeling"
- Asking different questions to different candidates
- Failing to document decision rationale

### 5. Plan Logistics

**Scheduling:**
- Book interview rooms/video links in advance
- Send calendar invites with prep materials
- Include 15-min buffer between interviews
- Provide candidate with schedule and interviewer info

**Candidate Experience:**
- Send confirmation email with loop details
- Provide parking/office directions
- Assign "candidate host" for day-of coordination
- Offer water, snacks, breaks
- Set expectations: duration, format, what to prepare

**Interviewer Preparation:**
- Share candidate resume 24hrs before interview
- Provide interview rubric and questions
- Clarify which competency to assess
- Set expectation to submit feedback within 24hrs

### 6. Conduct Debrief

**Debrief Structure:**
- Each interviewer presents score + rationale (2-3 min)
- Discuss discrepancies (if 2+ point difference)
- Hiring manager summarizes consensus
- Make decision: Strong Hire / Hire / No Hire / Strong No Hire

**Decision Framework:**
- Strong Hire: All interviews ≥ 4.0, move to offer immediately
- Hire: Average ≥ 3.5, no red flags
- No Hire: Average < 3.0 or any critical red flag
- Strong No Hire: Multiple poor interviews, clear misfit

**Anti-Bias Techniques:**
- Hiring manager speaks last (avoid anchoring)
- Focus on evidence, not impressions
- Reference specific rubric criteria
- Challenge "culture fit" concerns for specificity

### 7. Generate Loop Documentation

Output comprehensive interview guide:

```json
{
  "role": "Senior Backend Engineer",
  "loop_structure": [
    {
      "stage": "Recruiter Screen",
      "duration_minutes": 30,
      "interviewer_type": "Recruiter",
      "competencies": ["Basic qualification", "Communication"],
      "key_questions": ["Why interested in role?", "Salary expectations?"],
      "pass_criteria": "Meets must-haves, good communication"
    },
    {
      "stage": "Technical Screen",
      "duration_minutes": 60,
      "interviewer_type": "Engineer (any level)",
      "competencies": ["Coding fundamentals"],
      "problem": "Medium difficulty coding problem",
      "pass_criteria": "Solves problem with hints, clean code"
    }
  ],
  "rubrics": {
    "coding_interview": { /* detailed rubric */ },
    "system_design": { /* detailed rubric */ },
    "behavioral": { /* detailed rubric */ }
  },
  "interviewer_training": {
    "required_shadowing": 3,
    "calibration_frequency": "quarterly",
    "bias_training_required": true
  },
  "decision_criteria": {
    "strong_hire_threshold": 4.0,
    "hire_threshold": 3.5,
    "must_pass_all_competencies": true
  }
}
```

Save to `interview-loop-{role}-{date}.json`.

## Legal Compliance

**Prohibited Questions:**
- Age, birthdate, graduation year
- Marital status, children, pregnancy
- Disability, health conditions
- Religion, national origin, race
- Arrest record (in most states)

**Best Practices:**
- Ask same questions to all candidates
- Focus on job-related scenarios
- Document scoring immediately
- Train interviewers on bias
