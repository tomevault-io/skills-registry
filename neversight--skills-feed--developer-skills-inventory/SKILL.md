# Developer Skills Inventory

Map team skills, identify gaps against roadmap needs, and create targeted training plans.

## Purpose

- Inventory current team capabilities
- Identify skill gaps vs. product roadmap
- Prioritize training and hiring
- Plan knowledge transfer and documentation
- Reduce key person dependencies

## Skills Matrix Template

```json
{
  "team": "Platform Engineering",
  "assessment_date": "2026-01-22",
  "skills": [
    {
      "category": "Backend",
      "skills": [
        {
          "name": "Python",
          "team_coverage": {
            "expert": ["Alice", "Bob"],
            "proficient": ["Carol", "Dave"],
            "learning": ["Eve"],
            "none": []
          },
          "criticality": "high",
          "roadmap_need": "high"
        },
        {
          "name": "Go",
          "team_coverage": {
            "expert": [],
            "proficient": ["Alice"],
            "learning": ["Bob"],
            "none": ["Carol", "Dave", "Eve"]
          },
          "criticality": "medium",
          "roadmap_need": "high",
          "gap": "Need 2 experts for Q2 microservices rewrite"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "training_plan": [
    {
      "skill": "Go",
      "priority": "high",
      "action": "2 engineers to complete Go training by Q2",
      "budget": "$2,000",
      "timeline": "12 weeks"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Gap Analysis Process

1. Map current skills (self-assessment + manager review)
2. Map roadmap requirements
3. Identify gaps (skill needed but lacking)
4. Prioritize (criticality × timeline)
5. Plan mitigation (training, hiring, vendors)

## Using Supporting Resources

### Templates
- **`templates/skills-matrix.json`** - Team skills inventory
- **`templates/training-plan.md`** - Structured training roadmap

### Scripts
- **`scripts/gap-analysis.py`** - Auto-identify skill gaps
