# Developing OpenAI Agents SDK Agents

Comprehensive workflow-driven skill for building production-ready agentic AI applications with the OpenAI Agents SDK.

<essential_principles>

## Core Concepts

**Agents are LLMs with structure**: An agent combines an LLM with instructions (system prompt), tools (functions it can call), handoffs (delegation targets), and optional guardrails (validators).

**Minimal abstractions**: The SDK provides primitives (Agent, tool, run) rather than heavyweight frameworks. You compose behavior through code, not configuration.

**Context injection**: Tools and instructions receive RunContext, enabling dependency injection of user data, database connections, or other runtime context without global state.

**Handoffs transfer ownership**: When one agent hands off to another, the target agent becomes the active conversational participant. This differs from tools (manager pattern) where the calling agent maintains control.

**Guardrails run in parallel**: Input guardrails can validate user input concurrently with the LLM call, reducing latency. Output guardrails check responses before returning them.

**Structured output is typed**: Using Zod schemas for outputType gives you compile-time type safety and runtime validation of agent responses.

**Human-in-the-loop is first-class**: Tools with needsApproval create interruptions that your code handles explicitly, enabling approval workflows without special infrastructure.

## Design Principles

**Start simple, add complexity as needed**: Begin with a single agent and basic tools. Add handoffs, guardrails, and orchestration only when requirements justify them.

**Test with real LLM calls**: Mocking LLMs hides emergent behavior. Use small models (gpt-4.1-mini) or cached prompts for fast iteration, but always test end-to-end.

**Make instructions specific**: Vague prompts ("be helpful") produce vague behavior. Specify the agent's role, available information, decision criteria, and output format.

**Tools are for actions, not data**: Don't create tools just to return static information. Put reference data in instructions or context. Tools should execute side effects or retrieve dynamic data.

**Fail explicitly**: Return error strings from tools rather than throwing exceptions. This lets the LLM see what went wrong and potentially retry with different parameters.

**Trace everything**: Enable tracing in development to understand agent decision-making. The SDK's built-in tracing shows tool calls, handoffs, and model reasoning.

What would you like to do with OpenAI Agents SDK?

Common activities:
- Build a new agent or multi-agent system
- Add tools (functions) to an existing agent
- Implement agent handoffs (delegation)
- Add guardrails (validation)
- Debug agent behavior (unexpected actions, loops, errors)
- Review or optimize existing agent code
- Set up tracing and observability
- Implement human-in-the-loop approval flows
- Integrate with MCP servers
- Structure agent output with Zod schemas
