# Development Router

Routes development-related tasks to appropriate specialized skills.

## Subcategories

### Frontend Development
```yaml

skills:
  - terminal: TUI/CLI interfaces with high design quality
  - component: Claude Code configuration components
  - sc:implement: Feature implementation with persona activation
```

### Backend Development
```yaml
triggers: [api, server, database, auth, REST, GraphQL, microservice, endpoint]
skills:
  - sc:build: Build and compile projects
  - sc:design: System architecture and API design
  - mcp-builder: MCP server development
```

### Fullstack / Infrastructure
```yaml

skills:
  - sc:workflow: Implementation workflows from PRDs
  - sc:task: Complex task execution with persistence
```
