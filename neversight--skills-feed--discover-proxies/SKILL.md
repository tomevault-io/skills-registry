# Proxies Skills Discovery

Provides automatic access to comprehensive proxy and messaging skills.

## When This Skill Activates

This skill auto-activates when you're working with:
- Forward/reverse proxies
- HTTP proxy configuration
- Nginx, Traefik, Envoy, Caddy
- Load balancing
- SSL/TLS termination
- HTTP caching and CDN
- Cache invalidation
- NATS messaging
- Service mesh patterns

## Available Skills

### Quick Reference

The Proxies category contains 7 skills:

1. **forward-proxy** - Forward proxy fundamentals, HTTP CONNECT, SOCKS protocols
2. **reverse-proxy** - Reverse proxy patterns, load balancing, SSL termination
3. **nginx-configuration** - Nginx setup, locations, upstreams, caching, SSL
4. **traefik-configuration** - Traefik dynamic config, middleware, Let's Encrypt
5. **envoy-proxy** - Envoy architecture, filters, clusters, observability
6. **cache-control** - HTTP caching, cache headers, CDN patterns, invalidation
7. **nats-messaging** - NATS pub/sub, request-reply, JetStream, clustering

cat ~/.claude/skills/proxies/envoy-proxy.md
cat ~/.claude/skills/proxies/cache-control.md
cat ~/.claude/skills/proxies/nats-messaging.md
```

## Common Workflows

### Setting Up Reverse Proxy
```bash
# Reverse proxy → Nginx/Traefik → Caching
cat ~/.claude/skills/proxies/reverse-proxy.md
cat ~/.claude/skills/proxies/nginx-configuration.md
cat ~/.claude/skills/proxies/cache-control.md
```

### Cloud-Native Proxy Stack
```bash
# Traefik → Service discovery → Let's Encrypt
cat ~/.claude/skills/proxies/traefik-configuration.md
cat ~/.claude/skills/proxies/reverse-proxy.md
```

### Service Mesh and Observability
```bash
# Envoy → Advanced routing → Messaging
cat ~/.claude/skills/proxies/envoy-proxy.md
cat ~/.claude/skills/proxies/nats-messaging.md
```

### Caching and CDN Optimization
```bash
# HTTP caching → CDN patterns → Nginx
cat ~/.claude/skills/proxies/cache-control.md
cat ~/.claude/skills/proxies/nginx-configuration.md
cat ~/.claude/skills/proxies/reverse-proxy.md
```

### Microservices Communication
```bash
# NATS → Load balancing → Proxy patterns
cat ~/.claude/skills/proxies/nats-messaging.md
cat ~/.claude/skills/proxies/reverse-proxy.md
cat ~/.claude/skills/proxies/envoy-proxy.md
```
