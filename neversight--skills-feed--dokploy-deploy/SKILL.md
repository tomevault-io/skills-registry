# Dokploy Deployment

This skill enables you to manage and deploy applications to a Dokploy instance. Dokploy is an open-source PaaS (Platform as a Service) that simplifies deployment on your own VPS.

## Prerequisites

- Access to a Dokploy instance.
- Dokploy CLI installed (`npm install -g dokploy`).
- API Token (generated from Dokploy Dashboard > Settings > Profile).

## How to Deploy

### 1. Using Dokploy CLI

If the CLI is available in the environment:

```bash
# Login
dokploy login --host <your-dokploy-host> --token <your-token>

# Create a Project (if not exists)
dokploy project create --name <project-name>

# Create an Application
dokploy app create --name <app-name> --projectName <project-name>

# Deploy
dokploy app deploy --name <app-name> --projectName <project-name>
```

### 2. Manual Deployment via Dashboard

1. Navigate to your Dokploy host (e.g., `http://vps-ip:3000`).
2. Create or select a **Project**.
3. Add a new **Service** > **Application**.
4. Connect your **Git Repository** (GitHub/GitLab) or use a **Docker Image**.
5. Configure **Nixpacks** or **Dockerfile** for the build.
6. Click **Deploy**.

## Best Practices

- **Environment Variables**: Always use the Dokploy dashboard or CLI to set secrets. Do not commit `.env` files.
- **Health Checks**: Configure health checks in the Dokploy dashboard to ensure zero-downtime deployments.
- **Nixpacks**: Prefers Nixpacks for automatic language detection and build optimization.

## Triggering via API

You can trigger a deployment programmatically using a POST request to the Dokploy API:

```text
POST https://<your-dokploy-host>/api/deployments/deploy
Authorization: Bearer <your-token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "applicationId": "<your-application-id>"
}
```
