# Drupal.org Issue Helper

Quick assistance with drupal.org issue templates, formatting, contributing patches/fixes, and best practices for effective bug reports and feature requests.

## When to Use This Skill

Activate this skill when the user:
- Asks "how do I write a bug report?"
- Mentions "drupal.org issue template"
- Needs help formatting an issue description
- Asks about issue categories or priorities
- Wants to understand drupal.org issue best practices
- Says "I have a patch" or "I created a fix"
- Wants to "contribute back" or "contribute upstream"
- Asks "how do I submit my fix to drupal.org?"
- Mentions "I fixed a bug in a contrib module"
- Wants to contribute code changes to a drupal.org project

## Quick Note on Creating Issues

**drupal.org has no write API** - issue creation requires the web UI.

Use `/drupal-issue create {project}` for a guided workflow that:
1. Generates properly formatted HTML content
2. Copies title to clipboard
3. Opens browser to the issue form
4. Guides you through submission

Or manually create issues at: `https://www.drupal.org/node/add/project-issue/{project}`

## Contributing a Patch or Fix Back to Drupal.org

If you've already created a fix locally and want to contribute it back, here's the workflow:

### Step 1: Create an Issue First

Before submitting code, you need an issue on drupal.org:
1. Search existing issues to avoid duplicates
2. Use `/drupal-issue create {project}` to create a new issue
3. Note the issue number (e.g., `3569261`)

### Step 2: Create a Merge Request

Use `/drupal-mr {project} {issue_number}` which will:
1. Clone the project to `~/.cache/drupal-contrib/{project}/`
2. Guide you to create an issue fork on drupal.org
3. Set up the branch `{issue_number}-{description}`
4. Push your changes and provide the MR URL

### Step 3: Apply Your Local Changes

If your fix is in a different location (e.g., your project's `vendor/` or `web/modules/contrib/`):

```bash
# Option A: Copy changed files
cp /path/to/your/fix/SomeClass.php ~/.cache/drupal-contrib/{project}/src/

# Option B: Create a patch from your changes and apply it
cd /path/to/your/project
git diff web/modules/contrib/{module} > ~/fix.patch
cd ~/.cache/drupal-contrib/{project}
git apply ~/fix.patch

# Option C: Cherry-pick if you committed locally
git format-patch -1 HEAD --stdout > ~/fix.patch
cd ~/.cache/drupal-contrib/{project}
git am ~/fix.patch
```

### Step 4: Commit and Push

```bash
cd ~/.cache/drupal-contrib/{project}
git add .
git commit -m "Issue #{issue_number}: Description of fix"
git push {project}-{issue_number} {branch_name}
```

### Quick Contribution Workflow

For a complete guided workflow that handles issue + MR together:
```bash
/drupal-contribute {project}
```

### Example: Contributing a Bug Fix

```
User: "I fixed a bug in the paragraphs module where nested items weren't saving correctly. How do I contribute this back?"

Workflow:
1. /drupal-issue create paragraphs
   → Creates issue, returns #3569999
2. /drupal-mr paragraphs 3569999
   → Sets up branch, you copy your fix, push
3. Complete MR in browser
4. Update issue status to "Needs review"
```

## Official drupal.org HTML Issue Template

drupal.org expects issue descriptions in **HTML format** with specific headings. Use this exact structure:

```html
<h3 id="summary-problem-motivation">Problem/Motivation</h3>
{problem_description}

<h4 id="summary-steps-reproduce">Steps to reproduce</h4>
{steps_if_bug}

<h3 id="summary-proposed-resolution">Proposed resolution</h3>
{proposed_solution}

<h3 id="summary-remaining-tasks">Remaining tasks</h3>
{remaining_tasks_checklist}

<h3 id="summary-ui-changes">User interface changes</h3>
{ui_changes_or_none}

<h3 id="summary-api-changes">API changes</h3>
{api_changes_or_none}

<h3 id="summary-data-model-changes">Data model changes</h3>
{data_model_changes_or_none}
```

## Issue Categories

| Category | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|
| **Bug report** | Something doesn't work as expected |
| **Feature request** | New functionality needed |
| **Task** | Work item that's not a bug or feature |
| **Support request** | Need help using the module |
| **Plan** | Strategic planning for the project |

## Priority Levels

| Priority | Definition |
|----------|------------|
| **Critical** | Data loss, security issue, or complete breakage with no workaround |
| **Major** | Significant impact but workaround exists |
| **Normal** | Standard priority for most issues |
| **Minor** | Nice to have, cosmetic issues, minor improvements |

## Bug Report Template

Use this complete template for bug reports:

```html
<h3 id="summary-problem-motivation">Problem/Motivation</h3>
{Clearly describe what's wrong. What did you expect to happen vs. what actually happened?}

<h4 id="summary-steps-reproduce">Steps to reproduce</h4>
1. {First step - be specific}
2. {Second step}
3. {Third step}
4. {Observe the bug}

<h3 id="summary-proposed-resolution">Proposed resolution</h3>
{How should this be fixed?}

<h3 id="summary-remaining-tasks">Remaining tasks</h3>
- [ ] Confirm the bug can be reproduced
- [ ] Write the fix
- [ ] Add test coverage
- [ ] Review and merge

<h3 id="summary-ui-changes">User interface changes</h3>
None

<h3 id="summary-api-changes">API changes</h3>
None

<h3 id="summary-data-model-changes">Data model changes</h3>
None
```

### Bug Report Best Practices

1. **Be specific** - "The form doesn't work" is unhelpful; "Clicking Save on the settings form shows a WSOD" is useful
2. **Include versions** - Always mention Drupal core, module, and PHP versions
3. **Provide steps** - Make it reproducible
4. **Show error messages** - Copy exact error text, don't paraphrase
5. **Attach screenshots** - Visual bugs need visual evidence
6. **Check if it's a duplicate** - Search existing issues first

## Feature Request Template

```html
<h3 id="summary-problem-motivation">Problem/Motivation</h3>
{Why is this feature needed? What problem does it solve?}

<h3 id="summary-proposed-resolution">Proposed resolution</h3>
{How should this feature work? Be as specific as possible.}

<h3 id="summary-remaining-tasks">Remaining tasks</h3>
- [ ] Design the approach
- [ ] Implement the feature
- [ ] Add test coverage
- [ ] Update documentation

<h3 id="summary-ui-changes">User interface changes</h3>
{Will there be new admin pages, form fields, or UI elements?}

<h3 id="summary-api-changes">API changes</h3>
{Any new hooks, services, or public methods?}

<h3 id="summary-data-model-changes">Data model changes</h3>
{New database tables, fields, or configuration schema?}
```

### Feature Request Best Practices

1. **Explain the "why"** - Help maintainers understand the use case
2. **Be specific** - Vague requests are hard to implement
3. **Consider existing patterns** - Follow Drupal conventions
4. **Offer to help** - Maintainers appreciate contributors
5. **Accept alternatives** - Your solution might not be the best one

## Task Template

```html
<h3 id="summary-problem-motivation">Problem/Motivation</h3>
{What needs to be done and why?}

<h3 id="summary-proposed-resolution">Proposed resolution</h3>
{Approach to completing the task}

<h3 id="summary-remaining-tasks">Remaining tasks</h3>
- [ ] {Specific, testable task 1}
- [ ] {Specific, testable task 2}
- [ ] {Specific, testable task 3}
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] Documentation updated

<h3 id="summary-ui-changes">User interface changes</h3>
{If applicable, or "None"}

<h3 id="summary-api-changes">API changes</h3>
{If applicable, or "None"}

<h3 id="summary-data-model-changes">Data model changes</h3>
{If applicable, or "None"}
```

## Support Request Template

```html
<h3 id="summary-problem-motivation">Problem/Motivation</h3>
{What are you trying to do? What's not working as expected?}

**Environment**:
- Drupal version: {version}
- Module version: {version}
- PHP version: {version}

**What I've tried**:
1. {Approach 1}
2. {Approach 2}

<h3 id="summary-proposed-resolution">Proposed resolution</h3>
{What specific help or guidance do you need?}

<h3 id="summary-remaining-tasks">Remaining tasks</h3>
- [ ] Get answer/guidance
- [ ] Implement solution

<h3 id="summary-ui-changes">User interface changes</h3>
N/A

<h3 id="summary-api-changes">API changes</h3>
N/A

<h3 id="summary-data-model-changes">Data model changes</h3>
N/A
```

## Title Best Practices

### Good Titles

- "Form validation fails when field is empty"
- "Add support for CKEditor 5 plugins"
- "PHP 8.2 deprecation warning in EntityViewBuilder"
- "Missing translation for 'Save' button"

### Bad Titles

- "It doesn't work" (too vague)
- "URGENT!!! HELP!!!" (not descriptive)
- "Bug" (meaningless)
- "Question" (doesn't describe the question)

### Title Formula

```
{Action/Problem} + {Context/Location} + {Condition (optional)}

Examples:
- "Form validation fails when required field is empty"
- "Add bulk export option to admin views"
- "WSOD on node save with paragraphs enabled"
```

## Issue Status Flow

```
Active → Needs work → Needs review → RTBC → Fixed → Closed
    ↑         ↓
    └─────────┘
```

| Status | Who Sets | Meaning |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **Active** | Reporter | Issue is open, being worked on |
| **Needs work** | Reviewer | Changes requested |
| **Needs review** | Contributor | Ready for review |
| **RTBC** | Community | Reviewed, ready to commit |
| **Fixed** | Maintainer | Committed to codebase |
| **Closed** | Anyone | Various close reasons |

## Quick Examples

### Example 1: Concise Bug Report

```
User: "I found a bug where the paragraphs module crashes on save"

Title: WSOD when saving node with nested paragraphs
```

```html
<h3 id="summary-problem-motivation">Problem/Motivation</h3>
Saving a node with more than 3 levels of nested paragraphs causes a white screen of death.

<h4 id="summary-steps-reproduce">Steps to reproduce</h4>
1. Create a paragraph type with a nested paragraphs field
2. Create content with 4+ levels of nesting
3. Click Save

<h3 id="summary-proposed-resolution">Proposed resolution</h3>
Investigate recursion limit in paragraph rendering.

<h3 id="summary-remaining-tasks">Remaining tasks</h3>
- [ ] Confirm reproduction
- [ ] Investigate root cause
- [ ] Implement fix
- [ ] Add test

<h3 id="summary-ui-changes">User interface changes</h3>
None

<h3 id="summary-api-changes">API changes</h3>
None

<h3 id="summary-data-model-changes">Data model changes</h3>
None
```

### Example 2: Feature Request

```
User: "I want to suggest adding a feature to export paragraphs"

Title: Add ability to export paragraph configurations as YAML
```

```html
<h3 id="summary-problem-motivation">Problem/Motivation</h3>
Developers need to share paragraph type configurations between sites. Currently, this requires manually recreating configurations or using Features module.

<h3 id="summary-proposed-resolution">Proposed resolution</h3>
Add a "Export" tab to paragraph types that generates YAML configuration that can be imported via drush or admin UI.

<h3 id="summary-remaining-tasks">Remaining tasks</h3>
- [ ] Design export format
- [ ] Implement export functionality
- [ ] Add import functionality
- [ ] Add drush commands
- [ ] Document workflow

<h3 id="summary-ui-changes">User interface changes</h3>
- New "Export" tab on paragraph type edit page
- YAML textarea with copy button
- Import form at /admin/structure/paragraphs/import

<h3 id="summary-api-changes">API changes</h3>
- New service: paragraphs.config_exporter
- New drush command: paragraphs:export

<h3 id="summary-data-model-changes">Data model changes</h3>
None
```

### Example 3: Quick Status Update

```
User: "How do I mark my issue as ready for review?"

Status changes:
1. Go to your issue page
2. Scroll to the status field (usually near bottom)
3. Change from "Active" or "Needs work" to "Needs review"
4. Add a comment explaining what's ready for review
5. Click Save

Best practice: Include a summary of changes in your comment when changing to "Needs review".
```

### Example 4: Contributing a Local Fix

```
User: "I fixed a PHP 8.2 deprecation warning in the webform module. How do I contribute this back?"

Response:
Great! Here's how to contribute your fix:

1. **Create an issue** (if one doesn't exist):
   /drupal-issue create webform

   Use this title format: "PHP 8.2 deprecation warning in [ClassName]"
   Category: Bug report
   Priority: Normal (or Major if it causes errors)

2. **Create a merge request**:
   /drupal-mr webform {issue_number}

   This clones the project and sets up your branch.

3. **Apply your fix**:
   cd ~/.cache/drupal-contrib/webform
   # Copy your fixed file or apply your patch
   git add .
   git commit -m "Issue #{issue_number}: Fix PHP 8.2 deprecation warning in ClassName"
   git push webform-{issue_number} {branch_name}

4. **Complete the MR** in your browser when the URL opens.

5. **Update issue status** to "Needs review" on drupal.org.

Tip: In your issue description, include the exact deprecation warning message
and the PHP/Drupal versions where you tested the fix.
```

### Example 5: Already Have a Patch File

```
User: "I have a .patch file that fixes an issue. How do I submit it?"

Response:
Modern drupal.org workflow uses merge requests instead of patch files, but you can
still apply your patch:

1. **Create or find the issue** on drupal.org for your fix

2. **Set up the MR environment**:
   /drupal-mr {project} {issue_number}

3. **Apply your patch**:
   cd ~/.cache/drupal-contrib/{project}
   git apply /path/to/your/fix.patch

   If that fails, try:
   git apply --3way /path/to/your/fix.patch

4. **Commit and push**:
   git add .
   git commit -m "Issue #{issue_number}: Description of fix"
   git push {project}-{issue_number} {branch_name}

5. **Complete the MR** in browser.

Note: If you just want to share the patch without creating an MR, you can attach
the .patch file directly to the issue as a comment. However, merge requests are
preferred as they enable automated testing.
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **No version info** - Always include Drupal and module versions
2. **No steps to reproduce** - Bugs without repro steps often get closed
3. **Duplicate issues** - Search before creating
4. **Wrong project** - Make sure you're creating the issue on the correct project
5. **Mixing issues** - One issue per bug/feature
6. **No follow-up** - Respond to maintainer questions
7. **Using Markdown instead of HTML** - drupal.org expects HTML format
8. **Submitting patches without an issue** - Always create an issue first, then attach code
9. **Using patches instead of MRs** - Merge requests are preferred; they enable automated testing
