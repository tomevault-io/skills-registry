# Elysia Core Backend

## Overview

Create a minimal, production-ready Elysia backend skeleton with auth, database, MCP, and security defaults. Follow the official generator workflow and then apply the standardized file structure and contents.

## Workflow

1. Confirm the target location and whether this is a brand-new scaffold or an existing Elysia server. If files already exist, avoid clobbering without explicit user approval.
2. Use the official Elysia generator with latest templates and Bun installs: `bun create elysia@latest <target>`. Do not hand-roll the project or keep stale generated dependencies.
3. Apply the exact folder structure, file contents, and package scripts from the reference guide.
4. Add required environment variables to `.env` and call out secrets that must be user-provided.
5. If the user requests, run migration commands and start the dev server.
6. Verify security defaults: CORS allowlist, CSRF protection on non-auth routes, security headers. Ensure MCP is wired via `elysia-mcp` plugin and not a raw `McpServer`.
