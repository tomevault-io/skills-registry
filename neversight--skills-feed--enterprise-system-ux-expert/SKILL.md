## 2. Expert Personas by Domain

### Executive Personas (Cross-Domain)

- **Needs**: Self-service reports, streamlined approvals, team dashboards

**End User / Clerk (Generic)**

- **Pain points**: Too many screens, unclear policies, context switching
- **Needs**: Single screen for tasks, smart defaults, clear guidance

**IT Administrator**

## 3. Enterprise Software Patterns

### Legacy ERP Pattern (SAP/Oracle)
**Characteristics**:
- Transaction-code based navigation
- Dense screens (50+ fields)
- Powerful but requires specialists
- Policy = configuration tables
- Training measured in weeks

**Anti-patterns to avoid**:
- Memorized codes (T-codes, menu paths)
- Modal dialog stacks
- Cryptic error messages
- "Save" then "Post" then "Release" multi-step commits

### Modern SaaS Pattern (Salesforce/Workday)
**Characteristics**:
- Web-based, role-based dashboards
- Customizable but within limits
- Workflow builders (visual)
- Better UX, still complex

**Patterns to borrow**:
- Record-centric views (contact card, account page)
- Inline editing
- Activity timelines
- Saved views/filters

### AI-Native Pattern (Target State)
**Characteristics**:
- Intent-based interaction (natural language)
- Policy execution, not policy following
- Proactive guidance (not reactive errors)
- Learn from usage

**Differentiators**:
- User states what they want, system handles how
- Policies are natural language, not config
- AI surfaces exceptions, user handles only those
- Zero training for basic tasks

## 4. Corporate Policy Categories

### Universal Policy Types

**1. Approval Workflows**
```
Purchase > $5,000 → Manager approval
Purchase > $25,000 → Director + Finance approval
New vendor → Procurement review required
Contract > $50,000 → Legal review
```

**2. Segregation of Duties**
```
Requester ≠ Approver
Creator ≠ Reviewer
Initiator ≠ Releaser
```

**3. Timing & SLA Controls**
```
Expenses submitted within 30 days
Invoices processed within 3 business days
Support tickets responded within 4 hours
Performance reviews completed by [date]
```

**4. Data Quality & Documentation**
```
All records must have description
Transactions > $1,000 require attachment
Customer contacts require email OR phone
Project codes required for time entries
```

**5. Automation Triggers**
```
Overdue task → Escalate to manager
Contract 30 days to renewal → Alert owner
Inventory below threshold → Create PO
New hire accepted → Trigger onboarding workflow
```

### Policy Design Principles

1. **Express intent, not mechanics**: "Large purchases need VP approval" not "If amount > 10000 AND dept_code IN (...)..."

2. **Visible before violation**: User knows policy BEFORE they hit a wall

3. **Audit trail automatic**: Every policy evaluation logged without extra work

4. **Exceptions with explanation**: Override allowed with documented reason

5. **Living document**: Policy changes should be instant, not IT projects

## 5. UX Review Framework

### A. Task Efficiency

| Metric | Good | Bad |
|--------|------|-----|
| Primary task completion | 1-2 screens | 5+ screens |
| Information lookup | Natural search | Filter maze |
| Record creation | Smart defaults | All fields required |
| Status check | Visible inline | Run a report |

### B. Policy Visibility

| Metric | Good | Bad |
|--------|------|-----|
| When shown | Before user acts | After rejection |
| How expressed | Natural language | Config tables |
| Predictability | Clear thresholds | Hidden triggers |
| Change process | Admin conversation | IT ticket |

### C. Error Prevention

| Metric | Good | Bad |
|--------|------|-----|

## 7. Review Checklist

### End User Interface
- [ ] Can user accomplish top 3 tasks in <30 seconds?
- [ ] Are policies visible before user takes action?
- [ ] Does the AI feel helpful or robotic?
- [ ] Is error handling graceful?

### Policy Maker / Admin Interface
- [ ] Can policies be created in natural language?
- [ ] Is there confirmation of policy interpretation?
- [ ] Can admin see policy execution history?
- [ ] Are policy conflicts/overlaps surfaced?
- [ ] Is policy editing intuitive?

### Manager / Executive Interface
- [ ] Does dashboard show what matters without clicking?
- [ ] Are exceptions surfaced proactively?
- [ ] Can reports be generated conversationally?
- [ ] Is drill-down intuitive?

### Overall System
- [ ] Does it feel like "magic" or "software"?
- [ ] Is the AI agent trustworthy?
- [ ] Does this replace a human process or add to it?
- [ ] What's the learning curve?
- [ ] What would make an executive say "finally"?

## 8. Common Anti-Patterns

### "Form Fatigue"
Too many required fields upfront.
**Fix**: Smart defaults, progressive disclosure, AI extraction.

### "Approval Black Hole"
Submit and disappear into queue with no visibility.
**Fix**: Status visible to submitter, estimated time, nudge capability.

### "Policy Surprise"
User completes work, then gets rejected for policy violation.
**Fix**: Show policy BEFORE user invests effort.

### "Report Archaeology"
Finding information requires running reports, exporting, filtering.
**Fix**: Natural language queries, inline data, smart search.

### "The IT Ticket Wall"
Any configuration change requires IT involvement.
**Fix**: Self-service policy creation with guardrails.

### "Context Switch Tax"
Information needed is in another system/screen.
**Fix**: Unified interface, embedded context, smart linking.

### "Notification Overload"
Everything triggers alerts, nothing is prioritized.
**Fix**: AI-prioritized exceptions, digest summaries, user preferences.

### "Training Debt"
System requires formal training to use.
**Fix**: Contextual help, progressive complexity, intent-based interface.

## 9. Output Format

When reviewing enterprise interfaces, structure feedback as:

```
## [Persona] Review: [System/Interface Name]

### Domain
[Finance/CRM/HRM/Operations/etc.]

### What's Working
- [Specific positive observations]

### Critical Issues
- [Blocking problems that must be fixed]

### Improvement Opportunities
- [Nice-to-haves that would elevate experience]

### Competitive Comparison
- [How this compares to existing solutions in the domain]

### AI-Native Gap Analysis
- [What would make this truly AI-native vs. "AI-assisted"]

### Recommendation
[Prioritized next steps]
```

---

## 10. Role-Play Prompts

Use these to get specific persona feedback:

**Executive**:
- "Review this as a CFO seeing it in a board presentation"
- "What would a COO think during a demo?"

**Manager**:
- "How would a sales manager use this daily?"
- "Would an HR director trust this for compliance?"

**End User**:
- "Review as an AP clerk processing 50 invoices/day"
- "How would a new sales rep onboard to this?"

**IT/Admin**:
- "What would a sys admin think about maintaining this?"
- "How would IT feel about user requests for changes?"

**Auditor/Compliance**:
- "How would an auditor evaluate the controls here?"
- "What compliance gaps would a regulator find?"

---

## 11. Key Principle

**The goal of AI-native enterprise software is to make policies execute themselves, not to make users execute policies.**

```
Traditional: User learns policy → User follows policy → System records
AI-Native:   User states intent → AI applies policy → User confirms
```

Every review should ask: **"Does this move us toward intent-based operations, or are we just putting lipstick on forms?"**
