### Style Selection Guide

### Options

| Option | Values | Default |
|--------|--------|---------|
| `-t, --type` | realistic, illustration, flat, anime, watercolor, oil-painting, pixel-art, sketch, 3d-render, corporate, minimal, pop-art | flat |

npx ergon image gen "abstract geometric logo" -t minimal -a 1:1 -o logo.png
```

## Image Editing

```bash
npx ergon image edit [options] <file> <prompt>
```

Edit instructions in natural language:
- Background change: "change background to sunset beach"
- Style transfer: "make it look like watercolor painting"
- Object removal: "remove the person on the left"
- Color adjustment: "make colors more vibrant"

```bash
npx ergon image edit photo.jpg "change background to blue sky"
npx ergon image edit portrait.png "convert to anime style"
```

## Video Generation (with Audio)

Veo 3.1 generates videos **with synchronized audio**. Include audio/sound instructions directly in the prompt.

```bash
npx ergon video gen [options] <theme>
```

### Prompt Structure for Audio-Video

Include sound descriptions in your prompt:

```bash
# Sound effects included
npx ergon video gen "cat meowing and playing with a ball, soft purring sounds"

# Music/ambient audio
npx ergon video gen "sunset timelapse over ocean, with calming wave sounds and soft piano music"

# Dialogue/voice
npx ergon video gen "person saying 'welcome to our channel' with friendly tone, waving at camera"
```

### Image-to-Video

Animate a static image with motion and sound:

```bash
npx ergon video gen "character starts dancing to upbeat music" -i character.png
npx ergon video gen "logo reveals with whoosh sound effect" -i logo.png
```

### Options

| Option | Values | Default |
|--------|--------|---------|
| `-i, --input` | image file | - |
| `-d, --duration` | 5-8 seconds | 8 |
| `-a, --aspect-ratio` | 16:9, 9:16 | 16:9 |
| `--fast` | use Veo 3.1 Fast | false |

Vertical video for TikTok/Reels: `-a 9:16`

## Narration Generation

For voice-only audio without video, use narration command.

```bash
npx ergon narration gen [options] <text>
```

### Character and Acting Direction

Use `-c` (character) and `-d` (direction) for expressive voice:

```bash
# Character defines WHO is speaking
npx ergon narration gen "Let's go on an adventure!" -c "energetic young girl"

# Direction defines HOW they speak
npx ergon narration gen "The results are in..." -c "news anchor" -d "serious, building suspense"

# Combined for full expression
npx ergon narration gen "Yay! We did it!" -c "excited child" -d "jumping with joy, high energy"
```

### Voice Selection

| Voice | Character |
|-------|-----------|
| Kore | Female, versatile (default) |
| Aoede | Female, warm |
| Charon | Male, deep |
| Fenrir | Male, strong |
| Puck | Neutral, playful |

### Options

| Option | Values | Default |
|--------|--------|---------|
| `-v, --voice` | Kore, Aoede, Charon, Fenrir, Puck | Kore |
| `-c, --character` | character description | - |
| `-d, --direction` | acting direction | - |
| `--speed` | 0.25-4.0 | 1.0 |
| `-l, --lang` | ja, en, zh, ko, etc. | ja |

## Workflow Patterns

### Generate, then Edit
```bash
npx ergon image gen "product photo of headphones" -t realistic
npx ergon image edit headphones.png "add soft shadow, white background"
```

### Image to Animated Video
```bash
npx ergon image gen "mascot character standing" -t anime -a 1:1
npx ergon video gen "mascot waves and says hello cheerfully" -i mascot.png
```

### Preview Before Generation
```bash
npx ergon image gen "complex scene" --dry-run  # Check settings
npx ergon video gen "expensive render" --dry-run  # Verify before API call
```

## Common Options

All commands support:
- `--json` - JSON output for scripting
- `--dry-run` - Preview settings without API call
- `-o, --output <path>` - Specify output path
