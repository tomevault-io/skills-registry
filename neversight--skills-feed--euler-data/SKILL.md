description: Developer tools and data access guide for Euler Finance V2. This skill should be used when querying vault data via Lens contracts, fetching historical data from subgraphs, accessing contract interfaces, or deploying vaults via Euler Creator. Triggers on tasks involving VaultLens, OracleLens, subgraph queries, ABIs, or no-code deployment. Use when this capability is needed.

# Euler Lens & Data Agent Skill

Developer tools and data access guide for Euler Finance V2. Covers Lens contracts, subgraphs, interfaces, and deployment tools.

## When to Apply

Reference these guidelines when:
- Querying account positions and health using AccountLens
- Querying vault data using Lens contracts (VaultLens, OracleLens, IRMLens, UtilsLens)
- Tracking active accounts via Euler subgraph
- Looking up contract addresses and ABIs
- Building dashboards or analytics for Euler
- Integrating with Euler from frontends or bots

## Rule Categories

| Rule | Impact | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `tools-lens` | MEDIUM | Query vault, account, and oracle data via Lens contracts |
| `tools-subgraphs` | MEDIUM | Track active accounts and vault factories via subgraph |
| `tools-interfaces` | MEDIUM | Contract addresses and ABI references |

## Quick Reference

### Lens Contracts

- **AccountLens** - Query account positions, liquidity, health factor, time to liquidation (TTL)
- **VaultLens** - Query vault state, configuration, LTVs, IRM info
- **OracleLens** - Check oracle configuration and prices
- **IRMLens** - Interest rate model details and calculations
- **UtilsLens** - Utility functions: APY calculations, token balances, allowances
- **EulerEarnVaultLens** - Query EulerEarn vault data and strategies

### Subgraphs

The subgraph is intentionally minimal - use Lens contracts for detailed data:

- **Vault** - Track which factory created each vault
- **TrackingActiveAccount** - Active accounts indexed by address prefix (first 19 bytes)
- **TrackingVaultBalance** - Per-account vault balances and debt (at the time of the last update)

## Companion Skills

- `euler-vaults` - Core vault operations, EVC, risk management
- `euler-irm-oracles` - Oracle adapters and interest rate models
- `euler-earn` - Yield aggregation vaults
- `euler-advanced` - Hooks, flash loans, fee flow

## How to Use

Read individual rule files for detailed explanations and code examples:

```

rules/tools-subgraphs.md
rules/tools-interfaces.md
```
