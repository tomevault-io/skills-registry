# EulerEarn Agent Skill

EulerEarn yield aggregation guide for Euler Finance. Covers vault creation, strategy management, and role-based governance.

## When to Apply

Reference these guidelines when:
- Creating EulerEarn yield aggregation vaults
- Managing strategies (caps, queues, reallocation)
- Configuring roles (owner, curator, guardian, allocator)
- Using PublicAllocator for permissionless reallocation
- Setting up timelocked governance
- Monitoring strategy APYs and allocation

## Rule Categories

| Rule | Impact | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `earn-create-vault` | MEDIUM | Deploy EulerEarn yield aggregation vaults |
| `earn-manage-strategies` | MEDIUM | Manage strategies and allocations |

## Quick Reference

### Role Permissions

| Role | Capabilities |
|------|-------------|
| Owner | All actions, set other roles, set fee |
| Curator | Manage caps, submit removals, allocator actions |
| Guardian | Revoke pending changes, emergency stops |
| Allocator | Set queues, reallocate funds |

### Key Concepts

1. **Meta-Vaults** - ERC-4626 vaults that allocate across strategies
2. **Supply Queue** - Order for depositing into strategies
3. **Withdraw Queue** - Order for withdrawing from strategies
4. **Timelocked Governance** - Cap increases require timelock
5. **PublicAllocator** - Permissionless reallocation with flow caps

## Companion Skills

- `euler-vaults` - Core vault operations, EVC, risk management
- `euler-irm-oracles` - Oracle adapters and interest rate models
- `euler-advanced` - Hooks, flash loans, fee flow
- `euler-data` - Lens contracts and data querying

## How to Use

Read individual rule files for detailed explanations and code examples:
