# Euler IRM & Oracles Agent Skill

Oracle integration and Interest Rate Model guide for Euler Finance V2 protocol. Covers oracle adapters, price routing, and IRM configuration.

## When to Apply

Reference these guidelines when:
- Deploying oracle adapters (Chainlink, Pyth, Chronicle, RedStone)
- Configuring EulerRouter for price resolution
- Setting up cross-currency pricing with CrossAdapter
- Querying asset prices from oracles
- Understanding Interest Rate Model types and selection
- Configuring IRM parameters for vaults

## Rule Categories

| Rule | Impact | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `oracle-deploy` | HIGH | Deploy oracle adapters for various price sources |
| `oracle-configure-router` | HIGH | Configure EulerRouter for price resolution |
| `oracle-get-price` | HIGH | Query asset prices from oracles |
| `irm-models` | HIGH | Understand and configure Interest Rate Models |

## Quick Reference

### Oracle Adapters

- **ChainlinkOracle** - For major pairs (ETH/USD, BTC/USD)
- **PythOracle** - Pull-based, requires price updates before use
- **ChronicleOracle** - MakerDAO ecosystem (requires whitelisting)
- **FixedRateOracle** - For stablecoins (1:1 rates)
- **CrossAdapter** - Chain through intermediate assets
- **LidoOracle** - For wstETH/stETH exchange rate
- **RateProviderOracle** - For Balancer Rate Providers

### Interest Rate Models

- **Linear Kink IRM** - Standard two-slope model with utilization-based rates
- **Linear Kinky IRM** - Non-linear acceleration after kink using shape parameter
- **Adaptive Curve IRM** - Self-adjusting based on market conditions
- **Fixed Cyclical Binary** - For binary rate transitions

## Companion Skills

- `euler-vaults` - Core vault operations, EVC, risk management
- `euler-earn` - Yield aggregation vaults
- `euler-advanced` - Hooks, flash loans, fee flow
- `euler-data` - Lens contracts and data querying

## How to Use

Read individual rule files for detailed explanations and code examples:

```
rules/oracle-deploy.md
rules/oracle-configure-router.md
rules/oracle-get-price.md
rules/irm-models.md
```
