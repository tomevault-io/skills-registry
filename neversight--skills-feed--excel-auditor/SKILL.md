description: Analyze unknown or inherited Excel files to understand what they do, document their purpose, audit formulas for errors, and assess maintainability risk. Use when: (1) User uploads an Excel file asking 'what does this do?', (2) User needs to understand an inherited/legacy spreadsheet, (3) User wants formula auditing or error detection, (4) User asks about spreadsheet risk, complexity, or documentation, (5) User mentions 'inherited', 'legacy', 'undocumented', or 'someone left' regarding Excel files. Use when this capability is needed.

# Excel Auditor

Analyze unknown Excel files to understand purpose, audit formulas, detect errors, and generate documentation.

## Core Workflow

### 1. Extract Structure
Run the structure extraction script on the uploaded file:

```bash
python scripts/extract_structure.py /mnt/user-data/uploads/<filename>.xlsx
```

This produces JSON with: sheets, named ranges, tables, external links, data validation rules, conditional formatting, and VBA presence.

### 2. Extract Formulas
Run formula extraction to build dependency graph:

```bash
python scripts/extract_formulas.py /mnt/user-data/uploads/<filename>.xlsx
```

This produces JSON with: all formulas, cell dependencies, calculation chains, and formula complexity metrics.

### 2b. Validate Extraction Output
Before proceeding, verify JSON output contains expected keys:
- Structure: `sheets`, `named_ranges`, `tables`, `external_links`, `data_validation`, `conditional_formatting`, `vba_present`
- Formulas: `formulas`, `dependencies`, `calculation_chain`, `complexity_metrics`

If keys are missing or malformed, note limitations in final report.

### 3. Semantic Analysis
With structure and formula data, perform semantic analysis:

**Purpose Detection**: Infer file purpose from:
- Sheet names and structure patterns
- Named range naming conventions
- Formula patterns (financial, statistical, lookup-heavy)
- Data shapes and header labels

**Pattern Recognition**: Match against known archetypes (see references/patterns.md):
- Financial models (DCF, budget, P&L)
- Operational trackers (inventory, scheduling, CRM)
- Reporting templates (dashboards, KPI rollups)
- Data transformation pipelines

### 4. Error Detection
Identify issues in order of severity:

| Category | Issues | Severity |
|----------|--------|----------|
| **Hard Errors** | #REF!, #DIV/0!, #VALUE!, #N/A, #NAME?, #NULL!, #NUM!; Circular references (unless intentional); Broken external links | Critical - file is broken |
| **Soft Errors** | Hardcoded values that should be inputs; Inconsistent formula patterns; Volatile function overuse (NOW, TODAY, RAND, INDIRECT, OFFSET); Missing IFERROR on lookups; Implicit intersection risks | Warning - file works but fragile |
| **Smells** | Magic numbers; Excessive nesting (>3 levels); Very long formulas (>200 chars); Mixed units without labels; Color-coded logic without legend; Hidden sheets with active dependencies | Info - maintainability concerns |

### 5. Generate Report
Produce structured output using the template in `references/report_template.md`.

## Output Formats

**Default**: Markdown report in chat
**On request**: Generate .md or .docx file with full report
**On request**: Annotated copy of Excel with comments on flagged cells

## Handling Edge Cases

**Very Large Files (>10MB)**:
- Sample analysis of first 1000 formulas
- Focus on structure and high-level patterns
- Note that full audit requires sampling

**Password Protected**:
- Cannot audit, inform user

**VBA Present**:
- Note VBA exists but cannot audit macro logic
- Flag as elevated risk for maintainability

**Binary .xls Format**:
- Attempt conversion or note limitations

## Error Response Templates

When no issues found:
> "This file appears well-structured with no formula errors detected. [summary of what it does]"

When issues found:
> "I found [N] issues requiring attention. The most critical: [top issue]. Full audit below."

When file is severely broken:
> "This file has significant structural issues that prevent complete analysis. [list blocking issues]"
