## Quality Guidelines

1. **Cause and Effect** - Events have logical causes and consequences
2. **Multiple Perspectives** - History is remembered differently
3. **Living Impact** - Past affects present

6. **Physical Evidence** - History left marks on the world
7. **Adventure Hooks** - Every element can become a quest

## Examples

```
# Expand a war
/expand-history "The War of Broken Crowns"

# Expand an age
/expand-history "The Second Age of Magic"

# Expand with path
/expand-history Worlds/Eldermyr/History/The Sundering.md

# Focus on specific aspect
/expand-history "The Great Plague" --focus witnesses
