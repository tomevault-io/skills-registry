# Explaining Rules Skill

<identity>
Explaining Rules - Explains applicable coding rules by querying the rule index dynamically. Discovers all 1,081+ rules without hard-coding.
</identity>

<capabilities>
- User asks "What rules apply to this file?"
- Explaining coding standards to team members
- Onboarding new developers
- Understanding rule coverage for a project
- Reviewing which rules are active
</capabilities>

<instructions>
<execution_process>

### Step 1: Identify Available Skills

Discover available skills by scanning the skills directory:

```bash
ls .claude/skills/
```

Skills contain domain-specific coding standards and best practices.

**Note**: Skills are self-contained in `.claude/skills/[skill-name]/SKILL.md`

### Step 2: Analyze Target File or Query

Determine what needs explanation:

- **File path**: Analyze file extension, imports, and directory structure
- **Technology stack**: User mentions specific technologies
- **General query**: User asks about rules in general

### Step 3: Detect Technologies

For file-based queries, detect technologies using:

- File extension (`.tsx` -> TypeScript, React)
- Import statements (`next` -> Next.js, `react` -> React)
- Directory structure (`app/` -> Next.js App Router)
- Framework-specific patterns

Match file patterns to relevant skills (e.g., `.tsx` files → react-expert, typescript-expert).

### Step 4: Find Matching Skills

Match technologies to expert skills:

| Technology | Skill                 |
| ---------- | --------------------- |
| React, JSX | react-expert          |
| TypeScript | typescript-expert     |
| Next.js    | nextjs-expert         |
| Python     | python-backend-expert |
| Node.js    | nodejs-expert         |
| Database   | database-expert       |
| Testing    | testing-expert        |

### Step 5: Load Relevant Skills

Read the matching skill files:

```bash
cat .claude/skills/[skill-name]/SKILL.md
```

Focus on 3-5 most relevant skills for the query.

### Step 6: Explain Skills

For each relevant skill, explain:

- **What it covers**: Main purpose and scope
- **Why it applies**: Connection to the file/query
- **Key requirements**: Most important standards
- **Examples**: Code examples showing compliance
  </execution_process>

<best_practices>

1. **Be Specific**: Explain why each rule applies, not just what it says
2. **Prioritize**: Master rules first, then archive rules
3. **Use Examples**: Show code examples from the rule files
4. **Progressive Disclosure**: Load only relevant rules, not all 1,081
5. **Context-Aware**: Adapt explanation to user's experience level
   </best_practices>
   </instructions>

<formatting_example>
**Output Format**

Structure explanations clearly:

```markdown
## Skills Applicable to [file/query]

**Technologies Detected**: [list]

### Matching Skills

- **[Skill Name]**: [brief description]
  - **Applies because**: [reason]
  - **Key requirements**: [list]
  - **Example**: [code snippet]
```

</formatting_example>
</examples>

## Rules

- Scan skills directory to find applicable skills
- Explain why skills apply, not just what they say
- Focus on 3-5 most relevant skills

## Memory Protocol (MANDATORY)

**Before starting:**

```bash
cat .claude/context/memory/learnings.md
```

**After completing:**

- New pattern -> `.claude/context/memory/learnings.md`
- Issue found -> `.claude/context/memory/issues.md`
- Decision made -> `.claude/context/memory/decisions.md`

> ASSUME INTERRUPTION: Your context may reset. If it's not in memory, it didn't happen.
