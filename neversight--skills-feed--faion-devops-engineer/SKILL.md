# DevOps Engineer Orchestrator

**Communication: User's language. Config/code: English.**

## Purpose

Orchestrates DevOps activities by coordinating two specialized sub-skills:
- **faion-infrastructure-engineer** - Infrastructure, cloud, containerization
- **faion-cicd-engineer** - CI/CD, monitoring, security, operations

---

## Sub-Skills

### faion-infrastructure-engineer
**Focus:** Infrastructure provisioning, containerization, orchestration, cloud platforms

**Methodologies (30):**
- Docker (6): containerization, Compose, patterns, optimization
- Kubernetes (6): basics, resources, deployment, Helm
- Terraform & IaC (6): basics, modules, state, patterns
- AWS (7): foundations, services, EC2/ECS, Lambda, S3, networking
- GCP (6): basics, patterns, compute, Cloud Run, storage, networking

**When to use:**
- Docker containers and multi-stage builds
- Kubernetes deployments and Helm charts
- Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
- AWS/GCP cloud infrastructure setup
- Container orchestration

---

### faion-cicd-engineer
**Focus:** CI/CD pipelines, monitoring, observability, security, operations

**Methodologies (28):**
- CI/CD & GitOps (7): GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, ArgoCD
- Monitoring (5): Prometheus, Grafana, ELK, AIOps
- Security (6): secrets, SSL/TLS, security as code, nginx, load balancing
- Backup & Cost (4): backup strategies, FinOps
- Modern Practices (2): Platform Engineering, DORA metrics
- Azure (2): compute, networking
- Optimization (2): Docker optimization

**When to use:**
- CI/CD pipeline setup
- Monitoring and observability
- Logging and alerting
- Security and secrets management
- Backup and disaster recovery
- Cost optimization
- GitOps workflows

| AWS | infrastructure-engineer | Most services, enterprise |
| GCP | infrastructure-engineer | Kubernetes, ML, BigQuery |
| Azure | cicd-engineer | Microsoft ecosystem |

### CI/CD Tools
| Tool | Sub-Skill | Best For |
|------|-----------|----------|
| GitHub Actions | cicd-engineer | GitHub repos, simple pipelines |
| GitLab CI | cicd-engineer | GitLab repos, full DevOps |
| Jenkins | cicd-engineer | Complex pipelines, self-hosted |
| ArgoCD | cicd-engineer | GitOps, K8s deployments |

### Monitoring

## Orchestration Logic

### Single Sub-Skill Tasks
If task clearly belongs to one domain, invoke that sub-skill directly.

### Multi Sub-Skill Tasks
For tasks spanning both domains, coordinate sequentially:
1. infrastructure-engineer for cloud/container setup
2. cicd-engineer for pipeline/monitoring setup
