# SDD Execution Sub-Skill

**Execution, quality, and learning phase of Specification-Driven Development.**

**Communication: User's language. Docs/code: English.**

---

## Philosophy

**Quality → Execution → Reflection → Learning** - continuous improvement through systematic gates and memory.

---

## Scope

This sub-skill handles:
- Task execution workflows
- Quality gates (L1-L6)
- Code review cycles
- Reflexion learning (PDCA)
- Pattern/mistake memory
- Context management
- Task parallelization

## Quality Gates

| Level | Phase | Checkpoint |
|-------|-------|------------|
| L1 | Spec | Requirements complete + feasible |
| L2 | Design | Architecture sound + scalable |
| L3 | Impl-Plan | Tasks atomic + 100k compliant |
| L4 | Task | Pre-execution validation |
| L5 | Completion | Tests pass + requirements met |
| L6 | Integration | System-level validation |

---

## Reflexion Cycle

```
PLAN → DO → CHECK → ACT
  |      |      |      |
 spec  execute review learn
              (gates) (memory)
```
