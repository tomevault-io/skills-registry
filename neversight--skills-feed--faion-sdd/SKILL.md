# SDD Domain Skill (Orchestrator)

**Communication: User's language. Docs/code: English.**

---

## Philosophy

**"Intent is the source of truth"** - specification is the main artifact, code is just its implementation.

**No Time Estimates:** Use complexity levels (Low/Medium/High) and token estimates (~Xk) instead.

---

## Architecture

This skill orchestrates 2 sub-skills:

| Sub-Skill | Scope | Methodologies |
|-----------|-------|---------------|
| **faion-sdd-planning** | Specs, design docs, impl-plans, tasks, templates, workflows | 28 |
| **faion-sdd-execution** | Quality gates, reflexion, patterns, memory, code review, context | 20 |

**Total:** 48 methodologies

---

## Workflow Overview

```
CONSTITUTION → SPEC → DESIGN → IMPL-PLAN → TASKS → EXECUTE → DONE
      |          |        |          |          |         |        |
   project    feature  technical   100k rule   atomic   agent    learn
   principles  intent   approach   compliance   units  execution reflect
```

## When to Use Which Sub-Skill

### Use faion-sdd-planning for:
- Writing specifications (WHAT + WHY)
- Creating design documents (HOW)
- Breaking down implementation plans (TASKS)
- Task creation from impl-plans
- Template usage
- Workflow navigation

### Use faion-sdd-execution for:
- Task execution workflows
- Quality gate validation (L1-L6)
- Code review cycles
- Reflexion learning (PDCA)
- Pattern/mistake memory management
- Context management strategies
- Task parallelization analysis
