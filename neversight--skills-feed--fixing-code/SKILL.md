# Fix All Issues

Execute until clean. Parallel analysis, sequential fixes.

**Use TodoWrite** to track these 5 phases:

1. Run validation
2. Parallel analysis (spawn agents)
3. Collect analysis results
4. Sequential fixes
5. Final verification

---

## Phase 1: Run Validation

```bash
make lint 2>&1 | head -100
make test 2>&1 | head -100
```

No Makefile? Detect language and run:

- **Go**: `golangci-lint run ./... 2>&1 | head -100 && go test -race ./... 2>&1 | head -100`
- **Python**: `ruff check . 2>&1 | head -100 && pytest 2>&1 | head -100`
- **TypeScript**: `bun lint 2>&1 | head -100 && bun test 2>&1 | head -100`
- **Web (HTML/CSS/JS)**: `bunx html-validate "**/*.html" 2>&1 | head -50 && bunx stylelint "**/*.css" 2>&1 | head -50 && bunx eslint "**/*.js" 2>&1 | head -50`

**If all pass**: Report "All checks pass" → stop.

---

## Phase 2: Parallel Analysis (Read-Only)

**Spawn ALL relevant language agents IN ONE MESSAGE for parallel execution:**

Based on detected languages with issues, spawn analysis agents:

```
Task(
  subagent_type="go-qa",
  run_in_background=true,
  description="Go issue analysis",
  prompt="Analyze these Go issues. DO NOT FIX - analysis only.
  Issues:
  {lint/test output}

  Return structured analysis:
  - Root cause for each issue
  - Suggested fix approach
  - File:line references
  - Priority (critical/important/minor)"
)

Task(
  subagent_type="py-qa",
  run_in_background=true,
  description="Python issue analysis",
  prompt="Analyze these Python issues. DO NOT FIX - analysis only.
  Issues:
  {lint/test output}

  Return structured analysis:
  - Root cause for each issue
  - Suggested fix approach
  - File:line references
  - Priority (critical/important/minor)"
)

Task(
  subagent_type="web-qa",
  run_in_background=true,
  description="Web frontend issue analysis",
  prompt="Analyze these web frontend issues. DO NOT FIX - analysis only.
  Issues:
  {lint/test output}

  Return structured analysis:
  - Root cause for each issue
  - Suggested fix approach
  - File:line references
  - Priority (critical/important/minor)"
)
```

---

## Phase 3: Collect Analysis Results

```
TaskOutput(task_id=<go_qa_id>, block=true)
TaskOutput(task_id=<py_qa_id>, block=true)
TaskOutput(task_id=<web_qa_id>, block=true)
```

Merge and prioritize issues:

1. Critical (blocking): Fix first
2. Important (quality): Fix second
3. Minor (style): Fix if time permits

---

## Phase 4: Sequential Fixes

**Fix issues ONE AT A TIME to avoid conflicts:**

For each issue (prioritized order):

1. Read the file
2. Apply fix using Edit tool
3. Verify fix didn't break anything: `make lint && make test` or equivalent

**If fix causes new issues**: Revert and try alternative approach.

---

## Phase 5: Final Verification

```bash
make lint && make test
```

**Loop back to Phase 2** if issues remain.

---

## Exit Criteria

- Build passes
- All tests pass
- Zero lint errors

## Output

```
FIX COMPLETE
============
Analysis: {N} issues identified by {M} agents
Fixed: {X} issues
Remaining: {Y} non-blocking (if any)
Status: CLEAN | NEEDS ATTENTION

Changes:
- file1.go:42 - Fixed null pointer check
- file2.py:15 - Added missing type hint
```

---

**Execute validation now.**
