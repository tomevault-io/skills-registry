# flightclaw

## Install

npx skills add jackculpan/flightclaw
```

Or manually:

```bash
bash skills/flightclaw/setup.sh
```

## Scripts

### Search Flights
Find flights for a specific route and date.

```bash
python skills/flightclaw/scripts/search-flights.py LHR JFK 2025-07-01
python skills/flightclaw/scripts/search-flights.py LHR JFK 2025-07-01 --cabin BUSINESS
python skills/flightclaw/scripts/search-flights.py LHR JFK 2025-07-01 --return-date 2025-07-08
python skills/flightclaw/scripts/search-flights.py LHR JFK 2025-07-01 --stops NON_STOP --results 10
```

Arguments:
- `origin` - IATA airport code (e.g. LHR, JFK, SFO)
- `destination` - IATA airport code
- `date` - Departure date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `--return-date` - Return date for round trips (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `--cabin` - ECONOMY (default), PREMIUM_ECONOMY, BUSINESS, FIRST
- `--stops` - ANY (default), NON_STOP, ONE_STOP, TWO_STOPS
- `--results` - Number of results (default: 5)

### Track a Flight
Add a route to the price tracking list and record the current price.

```bash
python skills/flightclaw/scripts/track-flight.py LHR JFK 2025-07-01
python skills/flightclaw/scripts/track-flight.py LHR JFK 2025-07-01 --target-price 400
python skills/flightclaw/scripts/track-flight.py LHR JFK 2025-07-01 --return-date 2025-07-08 --cabin BUSINESS
```

Arguments:
- Same as search-flights, plus:
- `--target-price` - Alert when price drops below this amount

### Check Prices
Check all tracked flights for price changes. Designed to run on a schedule (cron).

```bash
python skills/flightclaw/scripts/check-prices.py
python skills/flightclaw/scripts/check-prices.py --threshold 5
```

Arguments:
- `--threshold` - Percentage drop to trigger alert (default: 10)

Output: Reports price changes for tracked flights. Highlights drops and alerts when target prices are reached.

### List Tracked Flights
Show all flights being tracked with current vs original prices.

```bash
python skills/flightclaw/scripts/list-tracked.py
```

## Currency

Prices are returned in the user's local currency based on their IP location. The currency is auto-detected from the Google Flights API response and displayed with the correct symbol (e.g. $, £, ฿, €). Tracked flights store the currency code in `tracked.json`.

## Data

Price history is stored in `skills/flightclaw/data/tracked.json` and persists via R2 backup.
