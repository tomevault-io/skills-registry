# Flow Optimization

Flow is the state of complete immersion where users lose track of time and feel in control. Protecting it is a design responsibility.

## Evidence Tiers

```
[Research]   — Peer-reviewed studies, controlled experiments
[Expert]     — Nielsen Norman Group, recognized UX authorities
[Case Study] — Documented examples from major products
[Convention] — Industry practice, limited formal validation

Multiple tags = stronger evidence: [Research][Expert]
Mixed findings noted as: [Research — Mixed]
```

## Flow State Foundations

**[Research]** Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi developed flow theory through decades of research starting in the 1970s. He studied artists, athletes, surgeons, and chess players to identify common characteristics of optimal experiences.

### Conditions for Flow

**[Research]** Well-replicated findings show flow requires:

| Condition | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Clear goals** | User knows what success looks like |
| **Immediate feedback** | Results visible right away |
| **Challenge-skill balance** | Not too easy, not too hard |
| **Sense of control** | User directs, system responds |

When these conditions are met, people report:
- Intense concentration
- Merging of action and awareness
- Loss of self-consciousness
- Distorted sense of time

## Interruption Cost

**[Research — Nuanced]** Gloria Mark's research at UC Irvine studied workplace interruptions.

**What the research actually shows:**
- Average time spent on any single event before switching: ~3 minutes
- 82% of interrupted work is resumed the same day
- Interrupted work correlates with higher stress

**Caution:** The commonly cited "23 minutes to recover" comes from interviews, not published papers. Mark's actual published research (*The Cost of Interrupted Work*, CHI 2008) shows different, more complex findings. The cost of interruption varies significantly by context.

**Takeaway:** Interruptions are costly, but the exact cost depends on task complexity, interruption type, and individual differences.

## Critical Patterns

### flow-1: No Unprompted Interruptions

**[Expert]** Nielsen Norman's heuristics emphasize user control. Interrupting users with unrequested information violates this principle.

**Flow-breaking:**
```
[User is typing]
[Modal appears: "You have 3 unread notifications!"]
```

**Flow-preserving:**
```
[User is typing]
[Subtle badge updates in corner]
[User checks when ready]
```

**Exception:** Imminent data loss or security issues.

### flow-2: Maintain Context Across Actions

**[Convention]** Preserve user state when they navigate away and return.

**Flow-breaking:**
```
[User fills half a form]
[Clicks link to check something]
[Returns — form is empty]
```

**Flow-preserving:**
```
[User fills half a form]
[Clicks link to check something]
[Returns — form state preserved]
```

**Preserve:** scroll position, form state, selection, expanded sections.

### flow-3: Batch Related Decisions

**[Research]** Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller) supports reducing the number of decision points. Each decision consumes working memory.

**Flow-breaking:**
```
[Modal 1: Choose format]
[Modal 2: Choose quality]
[Modal 3: Choose destination]
```

**Flow-preserving:**
```
[Single screen with all export options]
```

### flow-4: Escape Hatches Everywhere

**[Expert]** Nielsen's Heuristic #3: "User control and freedom." Users should always be able to back out, cancel, or undo.

**Flow-breaking:**
```
[User clicks wrong option]
[No way back — must restart]
```

**Flow-preserving:**
```
[User clicks wrong option]
[Back button / Undo / Cancel available]
```

Control creates confidence. Confidence enables flow.

## High-Impact Patterns

### flow-5: Reduce Mode Switching

**[Convention]** Keep users in one mental mode. Switching between editing, viewing, and configuring has cognitive cost.

**High switching cost:**
```
[Edit in one screen]
[Preview in another]
[Settings in a third]
```

**Low switching cost:**
```
[Edit with live preview]
[Settings in sidebar]
```

### flow-6: Keyboard Shortcuts for Power Users

**[Convention]** Once users are in flow, hands shouldn't leave keyboard.

- Provide shortcuts for frequent actions
- Show hints (e.g., "⌘K to search")
- Keep shortcuts discoverable but not intrusive

### flow-7: Sensible Defaults

**[Research]** Related to choice overload research (Iyengar & Lepper). Reducing decisions preserves cognitive resources.

Every decision that doesn't need user input is flow preserved:
- Pre-select the most common option
- Remember previous choices
- Infer from context when possible

## Anti-Patterns

| Pattern | Why It Breaks Flow | Evidence |
|---------|-------------------|----------|
| Modal dialogs for non-critical info | Forces attention shift | [Expert] NNg |
| Auto-playing media | Hijacks audio/visual focus | [Convention] |
| Pagination for continuous content | Breaks reading rhythm | [Convention] |
| Required fields revealed one-by-one | Multiple error cycles | [Expert] NNg |
| Session timeouts without warning | Loses work unexpectedly | [Convention] |

## Nuanced Patterns

### Hamburger Menus: Trade-offs

**Status:** Not a myth, but has real costs
**Evidence:** [Research][Expert] — NNg study with 179 participants across 6 sites

**What research shows:**

- **Discoverability cut almost in half** when navigation is hidden
- **Task time increases** and perceived difficulty rises
- **However:** Most users now recognize the hamburger icon (improved since 2010s)
- **Mobile penalty is smaller** than desktop penalty

**The trade-off:**
- Hidden nav saves screen space
- But adds interaction cost (extra tap to see options)
- Features hidden in hamburger menus are less likely to be discovered

**Guidance:**

| Situation | Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------|
| 4 or fewer nav items | Show visible links |
| 5+ nav items on mobile | Hamburger acceptable, but show key items visibly |
| Desktop | Avoid hamburger; space isn't as constrained |
| Feature discovery matters | Don't hide in hamburger |

**Improve hamburger if used:**
- Add "MENU" label next to icon
- Use contrasting color
- Place in expected location (top-left or top-right)
