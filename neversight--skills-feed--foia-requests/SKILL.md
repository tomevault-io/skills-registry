RE: Freedom of Information Act Request

Dear FOIA Officer:

Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552, I request access to and copies of:

[DESCRIBE RECORDS SPECIFICALLY]

**Scope and timeframe:**
- Date range: [START DATE] to [END DATE]
- Offices/divisions: [SPECIFIC OFFICES if known]
- Keywords: [RELEVANT SEARCH TERMS]

**Format requested:**
I request records in electronic format (PDF, native format) delivered via email to [your email] or via an online portal.

**Fee waiver request:**
I request a waiver of all fees associated with this request. Disclosure is in the public interest because:
- [Explain how information contributes to public understanding]
- [Explain why you are positioned to disseminate information]
- [State if affiliated with news organization or research institution]

Alternatively, if fees cannot be waived, I am willing to pay up to $[AMOUNT] for processing. Please contact me before exceeding this amount.

**Expedited processing request (if applicable):**
I request expedited processing because:
- [Urgent need to inform the public about actual or alleged government activity]
- [Imminent threat to life or physical safety]

**Contact information:**
Please contact me at [email] or [phone] if you have questions or need clarification about this request.

I expect a response within 20 business days as required by law.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
```

### Request drafting best practices

```markdown
## Effective request strategies

### Be specific but not too narrow
BAD: "All documents about climate change"
BAD: "The email from John Smith on March 15, 2024 at 2:47 PM"
GOOD: "Emails between [Office] and [External Party] regarding [Topic] from [Date Range]"

### Use agency terminology
- Research how agency categorizes information
- Use their document type names (memos, briefings, reports)
- Reference specific programs or initiatives by official name
- Include relevant file numbers if known

### Define your terms
- Specify what you mean by "communications" (emails, texts, calls?)
- Define "records" (include drafts? attachments?)
- Clarify "regarding" vs "mentioning" vs "primarily about"

### Request specific record types
- Emails and email attachments
- Calendar entries and meeting invites
- Text messages and messaging apps
- Memoranda and briefing papers
- Contracts and invoices
- Meeting minutes and notes
- Policies and procedures
- Correspondence (letters, faxes)
```

## Tracking and managing requests

### Request tracking system

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from datetime import date, timedelta
from enum import Enum
from typing import Optional

class RequestStatus(Enum):
    DRAFTED = "drafted"
    SUBMITTED = "submitted"
    ACKNOWLEDGED = "acknowledged"
    PROCESSING = "processing"
    PARTIAL_RESPONSE = "partial_response"
    COMPLETED = "completed"
    APPEALED = "appealed"
    LITIGATION = "litigation"
    CLOSED = "closed"

@dataclass
class FOIARequest:
    id: str
    agency: str
    date_submitted: date
    description: str
    status: RequestStatus = RequestStatus.DRAFTED

    # Tracking
    tracking_number: Optional[str] = None
    assigned_officer: Optional[str] = None
    estimated_completion: Optional[date] = None

    # Fees
    fee_estimate: Optional[float] = None
    fee_waiver_requested: bool = True
    fee_waiver_granted: Optional[bool] = None

    # Timeline
    acknowledgment_date: Optional[date] = None
    response_dates: list[date] = None

    # Documents
    pages_received: int = 0
    pages_withheld: int = 0
    exemptions_cited: list[str] = None

    # Appeals
    appeal_deadline: Optional[date] = None
    appeal_filed: Optional[date] = None

    @property
    def statutory_deadline(self) -> date:
        """Federal FOIA: 20 business days from submission."""
        # Simplified - should account for business days
        return self.date_submitted + timedelta(days=28)

    @property
    def is_overdue(self) -> bool:
        return date.today() > self.statutory_deadline and self.status in [
            RequestStatus.SUBMITTED,
            RequestStatus.ACKNOWLEDGED,
            RequestStatus.PROCESSING
        ]

# Tracking spreadsheet structure
TRACKING_COLUMNS = [
    'request_id',
    'agency',
    'date_submitted',
    'tracking_number',
    'description',
    'status',
    'statutory_deadline',

    'pages_received',
    'exemptions_cited',
    'fee_amount',
    'appeal_deadline',
    'notes'
]
```

### Follow-up communication templates

```markdown
## Status inquiry (after 20+ business days)

Subject: Status Inquiry - FOIA Request [Tracking Number]

Dear FOIA Officer:

I am writing to inquire about the status of my Freedom of Information Act request submitted on [DATE], assigned tracking number [NUMBER].

Under FOIA, agencies must respond within 20 business days. As of today, [X] business days have elapsed.

Please provide:
1. Current status of my request
2. Estimated completion date
3. Any fee estimates
4. Name of assigned processor

I can be reached at [contact info].

Sincerely,
[Name]
```

```markdown
## Fee waiver appeal

Subject: Appeal of Fee Waiver Denial - Request [Number]

Dear FOIA Appeals Officer:

I appeal the denial of my fee waiver request dated [DATE] for request [NUMBER].

The denial was improper because:

1. **Public interest**: [Explain how disclosure serves public interest]

2. **Ability to disseminate**: [Describe your platform/audience]
   - Publication: [name, circulation/readership]
   - Previous FOIA-based reporting: [examples]
   - Planned use of records: [specific plans]

3. **Commercial interest**: I have no commercial interest in these records. [Or: My commercial interest is minimal compared to public benefit because...]

4. **Comparison**: Similar requests have received fee waivers. See: [examples if available]

I request the fee waiver be granted or, alternatively, that fees be limited to [amount].

Sincerely,
[Name]
```

## Handling responses

### Response review checklist

```markdown
## Initial response review

### Administrative check
- [ ] Response received by deadline?
- [ ] Tracking number matches
- [ ] Request description accurate
- [ ] All requested record types addressed

### Completeness assessment
- [ ] All date ranges covered?
- [ ] All offices/divisions searched?
- [ ] Search terms used listed?
- [ ] Any referrals to other agencies?

### Exemption analysis
For each exemption claimed:
- [ ] Specific exemption cited (e.g., "Exemption 6")
- [ ] Explanation provided for each withholding
- [ ] Foreseeable harm articulated?
- [ ] Segregable portions released?

### Document review
- [ ] Page count matches stated total
- [ ] Documents legible
- [ ] Redactions clearly marked
- [ ] Index provided (Vaughn index if applicable)

### Fee assessment
- [ ] Charges match estimate?
- [ ] Itemized breakdown provided?
- [ ] Fee category correct (media, educational, commercial, other)?
```

### Redaction analysis

```markdown
## Understanding redactions

### Types of redactions
- (b)(1) - National security [black bar with exemption]
- (b)(5) - Deliberative process [often overused]
- (b)(6) - Personal privacy [names, contact info]
- (b)(7)(A) - Law enforcement investigation
- (b)(7)(C) - Law enforcement privacy

### Challenging over-redaction
Questions to ask:
1. Is entire document withheld or just portions?
2. Are routine details redacted unnecessarily?
3. Is information already public elsewhere?
4. Is the exemption correctly applied?
5. Was foreseeable harm test applied?

### Building your case
- Compare with similar released documents
- Check if information is already public
- Note inconsistent redaction patterns
- Document segregability arguments
```

## Appeals process

### Federal FOIA appeal template

```markdown
[Your Name]
[Address]
[Date]

Chief FOIA Officer / FOIA Appeals Office
[Agency Name]
[Address]

RE: Administrative Appeal of FOIA Request [Tracking Number]

Dear Appeals Officer:

Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6), I appeal the [partial denial / full denial / inadequate search / fee waiver denial] of my FOIA request dated [original date], tracking number [number].

**Original request:**
[Brief description of what you requested]

**Agency response:**
On [date], the agency [describe response - denied, partially released, etc.]

**Grounds for appeal:**

[Choose applicable grounds:]

**1. Improper exemption claim**
The agency improperly invoked Exemption [X] because:
- [Specific argument about why exemption doesn't apply]
- [Legal precedent if known]
- [Foreseeable harm not demonstrated]

**2. Inadequate search**
The agency failed to conduct an adequate search because:
- [Specific offices not searched]
- [Relevant record systems overlooked]
- [Search terms too narrow]

**3. Failure to segregate**
The agency failed to release non-exempt portions as required. Specifically:
- [Identify documents where segregation possible]

**4. Fee waiver improperly denied**
[See fee waiver appeal template above]

**Relief requested:**
I request that the agency:
1. Release all improperly withheld records
2. Conduct additional searches of [specific locations]
3. Provide a detailed justification for any continued withholdings
4. Grant my fee waiver request

I expect a response within 20 business days.

Sincerely,
[Name]
```

### Appeal deadlines by jurisdiction

| Jurisdiction | Appeal deadline | Where to file |
|--------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Federal FOIA | 90 days from response | Agency appeals office |
| New Jersey OPRA | 45 days | Government Records Council |
| New York FOIL | 30 days | Agency appeals officer |
| California PRA | No admin appeal | Direct to court |
| [Add your state] | [Deadline] | [Location] |

## Advanced strategies

### Multi-agency requests

```markdown
## Coordinated request strategy

When a topic spans multiple agencies:

1. **Map the agencies involved**
   - Which agencies have jurisdiction?
   - Which offices within agencies?
   - Are there inter-agency communications?

2. **Sequence requests strategically**
   - Start with agency most likely to release
   - Use released documents to refine subsequent requests
   - Reference other agencies' releases in appeals

3. **Cross-reference responses**
   - Compare what different agencies release
   - Note discrepancies in redactions
   - Use one agency's release to challenge another's withholding

4. **Track coordination**
   - Document all request/response dates
   - Note referrals between agencies
   - Build timeline of events from multiple sources
```

### Document production management

```markdown
## Large production workflow

For responses with 100+ pages:

### Organization system
/FOIA_[Agency]_[Topic]/
├── 01_Request_Materials/
│   ├── original_request.pdf
│   ├── acknowledgment.pdf
│   └── correspondence/
├── 02_Responses/
│   ├── response_2024-01-15/
│   ├── response_2024-02-20/
│   └── final_response/
├── 03_Analysis/
│   ├── document_index.xlsx
│   ├── redaction_log.xlsx
│   └── key_documents/
├── 04_Appeals/
│   └── appeal_2024-03-01.pdf
└── 05_Notes/
    └── research_notes.md

### Document indexing
For each document, track:
- Bates number (if assigned)
- Date of document
- Author/recipient
- Document type
- Subject/summary
- Exemptions applied
- Relevance rating (1-5)
- Follow-up needed?
```
