# Fragno Integration

## Overview

Fragno is a framework-agnostic, type-safe full-stack TypeScript toolkit that enables building
portable full-stack libraries called "fragments". Fragments include backend routes, (optional)
client hooks and (optional) database integration.

Important: Before integrating any first-party fragment, always fetch its docs with `curl`. Use the
same search endpoint to find the right page, then fetch the full Markdown docs:

- `curl -s "https://fragno.dev/api/search?query=forms"`
- `curl -L "https://fragno.dev/docs/forms/quickstart" -H "accept: text/markdown"`

This skill will aid you to integrate a Fragment into an application. To do this we have to mount the
Fragment's backend routes, migrate/generate the database schema, and initialize the client-side
hooks.

## High-level Workflow

1. Install the Fragment
2. Mount the Fragment's backend routes
3. Initialize the client-side hooks
4. (Optionally) Database integration
5. (Optionally) Setup middleware for Fragment-defined routes (based on the user's authentication
   system)
6. (Optionally) Create a custom fetcher for the Fragment (e.g. for authentication headers)
7. Integrate the Fragment into frontend and backend where it makes sense

## Integration Workflow

### 1. Install the Fragment Package

Install the Fragment package via the user's npm-compatible package manager.

### 2. Create a Server-Side Fragment Instance

1. Find the most logical place, usually a central module in the application. If the user is already
   using Fragments, follow the same patterns.
2. Find the Fragment's main entrypoint function, e.g.
   `import { createFormsFragment } from "@fragno-dev/forms";`
3. Pass the Fragment-specific config (API keys, callbacks, etc.)
4. Determine if the Fragment needs a database: this is the case when the main function requires a
   `DatabaseAdapter` parameter.

### 3. Initialize the Database (If Required)

1. Determine the user's database system (should be any of the following, otherwise tell the user
   that installation WILL NOT be possible):
   - PostgreSQL (or PGLite), MySQL, SQLite (or Cloudflare Durable Objects)
   - Kysely, Drizzle, Prisma, (or no ORM)
2. Install `@fragno-dev/db` and `@fragno-dev/cli`.
3. Create a `databaseAdapter` in a central place.
   1. Import Dialect from `@fragno-dev/db/dialects`
   2. Import DriverConfig from `@fragno-dev/db/drivers`
4. Determine the method of migration generation:
   - For Drizzle and Prisma, schemas can be generated for use with the ORM's own migration tool.
   - For Kysely or no ORM, SQL migrations can be generated for use with the Fragno CLI.
5. Use the Fragno CLI to generate the schema file or migrations: (note that input can be more than
   one file)
   - `npx fragno-cli db generate lib/comment-fragment-server.ts --output migrations/001.sql`
   - `npx fragno-cli db generate lib/comment-fragment-server.ts --format drizzle --output schema/fragno-schema.ts`
   - `npx fragno-cli db generate lib/comment-fragment-server.ts --format prisma --output prisma/schema/fragno.prisma`
6. Integrate the schema with the ORM (e.g. by updating the Drizzle config)

### 4. Mount the Fragment's Backend Routes

Fragment's use web standard Request/Response objects, so they can be mounted in any framework that
supports them. There is also the framework-specific `handlersFor` function.

1. Determine what the Fragment's mount route is. The default is usually `/api/${fragmentName}`.
2. Determine the framework-specific way to mount the backend routes in the right location (example
   below)

Next.js example:

```ts title="app/api/example-fragment/[...all]/route.ts"
// This uses the Next.js file-based routing pattern.
import { createExampleFragmentInstance } from "@/lib/example-fragment-server";

const exampleFragment = createExampleFragmentInstance();
export const { GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE } = exampleFragment.handlersFor("next-js");
```

React Router v7 (Remix) example:

```ts title="app/routes/api/example-fragment.tsx"
import type { Route } from "./+types/example-fragment";
import { createExampleFragmentInstance } from "@/lib/example-fragment-server";

export async function loader({ request }: Route.LoaderArgs) {
  return await createExampleFragmentInstance().handler(request);
}

export async function action({ request }: Route.ActionArgs) {
  return await createExampleFragmentInstance().handler(request);
}
```

For Node.js (Express/Node.js) a separate package is required: `@fragno-dev/node`.

### 5. Create a Client-Side Integration

1. Create a client-side integration module in a central location.
2. Import the client creator from the fragment's **framework-specific export** (e.g. `/react`,
   `/vue`, `/svelte`, `/solid`, `/vanilla`).
3. If the backend routes are mounted on a non-default path, pass `mountRoute` to the client creator:
   ```typescript
   ...
   export const exampleFragment = createExampleFragmentClient({
      baseUrl: "/",
      mountRoute: "/custom/api/example-fragment",
   });
   ```
4. Use the fragment hooks/composables in UI components.

### 6. Optional steps

1. Create Fragno Fragment-specific route middleware to implement authentication (or other features).
   See `./references/middleware.md`.
2. Create a custom fetcher for the Fragment (e.g. for authentication headers). See
   `./references/client-customization.md`.
3. Configure a durable hooks dispatcher for fragments that use durable hooks (background retries,
   scheduled hooks). See `./references/dispatchers.md`.

### 7. Present options to user

- Determine what frontend hooks are available
- Determine what backend routes are available
- Determine what service methods are available

Present these to the user to come up with a plan for further deep integration into their
application.

## First-party Fragments (FP)

Use these fragments when you need their domain-specific features. Always `curl` the fragment docs
before wiring anything.

### Auth (`@fragno-dev/auth`)

Definition: Minimal email/password auth with session cookies and DB-backed users/sessions.

Use when: you need a simple, self-hosted auth flow (sign-up/sign-in/sign-out, session, roles) and
can store credentials in your database.

Reference: `./references/first-party-fragments/auth.md`.

Docs lookup: `curl -s "https://fragno.dev/api/search?query=auth%20fragment"`.

### Forms (`@fragno-dev/forms`)

Definition: JSON Schema and JSON Forms-based form builder plus response collection stored in your
database.

Use when: you need schema-driven forms, admin-managed form lifecycle, and stored submissions.

Reference: `./references/first-party-fragments/forms.md`.

Docs: `curl -L "https://fragno.dev/docs/forms/quickstart" -H "accept: text/markdown"`.

### Stripe (`@fragno-dev/stripe`)

Definition: Stripe subscription management with webhook-backed local state and client mutators.

Use when: your app sells subscriptions and you want built-in checkout, upgrade, cancel, and admin
hooks.

Reference: `./references/first-party-fragments/stripe.md`.

Docs: `curl -L "https://fragno.dev/docs/stripe/quickstart" -H "accept: text/markdown"`.

### Workflows (`@fragno-dev/workflows`)

Definition: Durable, long-running workflows with steps, timers, retries, and event waits backed by
your database.

Use when: you need reliable multi-step processes and an HTTP API/CLI to manage instances.

Reference: `./references/first-party-fragments/workflows.md`.

Docs: `curl -L "https://fragno.dev/docs/workflows/quickstart" -H "accept: text/markdown"`.

### Upload (`@fragno-dev/upload`)

Definition: Full-stack uploads with a normalized file model, S3/R2 or filesystem storage adapters,
and client helpers for direct or server-streamed uploads.

Use when: you need file uploads with progress tracking and storage-backed file metadata.

Reference: `./references/first-party-fragments/upload.md`.

Docs: `curl -L "https://fragno.dev/docs/upload/quickstart" -H "accept: text/markdown"`.
