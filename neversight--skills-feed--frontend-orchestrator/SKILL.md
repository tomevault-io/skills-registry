# Frontend Design Orchestrator

## Overview

The Frontend Design Orchestrator is your strategic guide for applying the philosophy of "uncommon care" to your digital product. Rather than randomly applying design skills, this orchestrator helps you understand where your application stands, what matters most right now, and which skills to deploy in what sequence.

This skill embodies the principle: **"Reduce until it's clear, refine until it's right."** It helps you identify what's essential for your current stage and focuses your effort there first.

## The 13 Frontend Design Skills

Your complete design system includes:

**Foundation Layer:**
1. **design-foundation** — Design tokens, system structure, principles
2. **design-engineer-mindset** — Bridge design and implementation, code as material

**Visual Layer:**
3. **layout-system** — Responsive layouts, grids, flexbox, container queries
4. **typography-system** — Type scales, hierarchy, readability
5. **color-system** — Color theory, accessibility, theming
6. **visual-hierarchy-refactoring** — Size, weight, contrast, whitespace, Gestalt principles

**Component Layer:**
7. **component-architecture** — Atomic design, composition, variants, documentation

**Interaction Layer:**
8. **interaction-physics** — Momentum, gestures, animation principles, implicit input
9. **loading-states** — Skeleton screens, spinners, progress bars, empty states
10. **error-handling-recovery** — Error messages, recovery workflows, graceful degradation
11. **performance-optimization** — Perceived latency, optimistic UI, Core Web Vitals

**Quality Layer:**
12. **accessibility-excellence** — WCAG compliance, semantic HTML, inclusive design
13. **frontend-orchestrator** — This skill - strategic coordination and sequencing

## Core Methodology: Design Maturity Assessment

Every application exists at one of five design maturity levels. Understanding your level is the first step to improvement.

### The Five Maturity Levels

**Level 1: Functional MVP**
Your application works. Users can accomplish their core goals. But the experience feels rough, inconsistent, or confusing. Design feels like an afterthought. This is where most startups begin.

**Level 2: Consistent Foundation**
You've established basic consistency. Components look similar, colors are somewhat coordinated, spacing has some logic. But the system isn't documented, and new features often break the pattern. Accessibility is partial or missing.

**Level 3: System-Driven**
You have a documented design system with tokens, components, and clear patterns. New features follow the system. Accessibility is integrated. But the system might feel generic, lacking personality or delight. Interactions feel mechanical.

**Level 4: Refined Experience**
Your system is mature and well-executed. Every detail has been considered. Interactions feel smooth and intentional. Accessibility is excellent. Users notice the care. But the experience might not yet feel timeless or anticipatory.

**Level 5: Transcendent Design**
This is rare. Your product doesn't just work well—it feels loved. The experience anticipates user needs. Every interaction delights. The design feels timeless, not trendy. Users recommend it not because they have to, but because they want to.

## The Orchestrator's Diagnostic Process

### Step 1: Current State Assessment

Before recommending skills, the orchestrator asks these diagnostic questions:

**Foundation Questions:**
- What is your primary goal right now? (Shipping fast, improving retention, reducing support tickets, building brand love?)
- How many users are actively using your product?
- What's your team's design maturity? (No designer, junior designer, experienced designer, design team?)
- How much technical debt do you have in your UI/CSS?

**Design System Questions:**
- Do you have a documented design system?
- Are you using a CSS framework (Tailwind, CSS-in-JS, vanilla CSS)?
- How consistent is your current design across the application?
- Do you have design tokens or design system documentation?

**User Experience Questions:**
- What's your biggest user frustration right now?
- How many accessibility issues have been reported?
- What's your mobile experience like compared to desktop?
- Do users comment on the feel or polish of your product?

**Interaction Questions:**
- How much thought has gone into animations and transitions?
- Do users understand what actions are available to them?
- How clear is your error messaging and feedback?
- Do interactions feel responsive and intentional?

**Performance Questions:**
- How fast does your application feel?
- Do users complain about loading times?
- Are there perceived performance issues?
- Do you measure Core Web Vitals?

### Step 2: Gap Analysis

Based on the assessment, the orchestrator identifies which skills will have the highest impact on your specific situation.

| Current State | Highest Impact Skill | Why | Secondary Skills |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Functional MVP, no system | design-foundation | Establishing a foundation prevents future technical debt and enables faster, more consistent development. | layout-system, typography-system, design-engineer-mindset |
| Inconsistent design, partial system | design-foundation | Documenting and formalizing what exists prevents regressions and enables team alignment. | component-architecture, color-system, visual-hierarchy-refactoring |
| System exists, but feels generic | interaction-physics | Adding intentionality to interactions transforms a functional product into one that feels loved. | typography-system, accessibility-excellence, performance-optimization |
| Good system, poor accessibility | accessibility-excellence | Accessibility is foundational and affects all other skills. Fixing it first ensures all future work is accessible. | component-architecture, interaction-physics, error-handling-recovery |
| Mature system, needs refinement | interaction-physics, visual-hierarchy-refactoring | Refinement happens at the margins—in the details of how things move, feel, and communicate. | performance-optimization, loading-states, design-engineer-mindset |
| Users confused by interactions | error-handling-recovery, loading-states | Clear feedback and error messages reduce support tickets and improve confidence. | interaction-physics, performance-optimization |
| Slow perceived performance | performance-optimization | Perceived speed dramatically affects user satisfaction and retention. | loading-states, interaction-physics, design-engineer-mindset |

## How to Use This Skill with Claude Code

### Automatic Skill Invocation

After assessing the user's situation and recommending a path, **ask the user if they want you to automatically invoke the recommended skills in sequence**. For example:

```
"Based on your assessment, I recommend Path B with these skills:
1. design-foundation
2. visual-hierarchy-refactoring
3. component-architecture
...

Would you like me to run these skills now? I'll invoke each one in sequence to analyze your codebase and provide specific recommendations."
```

If the user agrees, **invoke each recommended skill using the /skill-name command** (e.g., `/design-foundation`, `/interaction-physics`). Work through them in the recommended order, applying each skill's methodology to the user's specific codebase.

### Get a Personalized Roadmap

```
"I'm using the frontend-orchestrator skill. Can you help me:
- Assess my current design maturity
- Identify my biggest pain points
- Recommend a skill sequence
- Then run the recommended skills automatically"
```

### Diagnose Design Issues

```
"My users are complaining about [issue]. Using the orchestrator:
- What's the root cause?
- Which skills would help?
- What should I prioritize?"
```

### Plan a Design System

```
"Can you help me plan a design system using the orchestrator?
- Assess my current state
- Recommend a path
- Create a step-by-step guide
- Estimate effort for each skill"
```

## Key Principles

**1. Start Where You Are**
Don't try to implement all skills at once. Start with the highest-impact skill for your situation.

**2. Build Momentum**
Early wins create confidence and buy-in for continued improvement.

**3. Iterate, Don't Perfectionism**
Each skill can be refined later. Get the basics right first.

**4. Measure Progress**
Track improvements in user satisfaction, support tickets, and retention.

**5. Celebrate Refinement**
The journey from MVP to transcendent design is a marathon, not a sprint.
