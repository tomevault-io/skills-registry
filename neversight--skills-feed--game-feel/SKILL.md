# Game Feel Skill

A framework for understanding, measuring, and creating satisfying game controls based on Steve Swink's comprehensive analysis.

## Core Definition

**Game feel** is the tactile, kinesthetic sense of manipulating a virtual object. It's the sensation of control—that visceral feeling of steering, jumping, and interacting that exists somewhere between player and game.

> "Game feel is an invisible art. If a designer's done their job correctly, the player will never notice it. It will just seem right."

---

## The Three Building Blocks

Game feel requires all three elements working together:

| Element | Definition | Without It |
|---------|------------|------------|
| **Real-Time Control** | Continuous, immediate response to input | Feels like giving orders, not controlling |
| **Simulated Space** | Collision and physics in a virtual world | No sense of physical interaction |
| **Polish** | Effects that emphasize interactions | Flat, lifeless, unconvincing |

---

## Human Perception Thresholds

### The Correction Cycle
Players perceive, think, and act in ~240ms cycles:
- Perceptual processor: ~100ms
- Cognitive processor: ~70ms  
- Motor processor: ~70ms

### Critical Thresholds

| Threshold | Value | Effect |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| **Motion illusion** | 10+ fps | Below this, no sense of movement |
| **Smooth motion** | 30+ fps | Movement feels fluid |
| **Instantaneous response** | <50ms | Feels like direct control |
| **Noticeable lag** | 100-200ms | Sluggish but usable |
| **Broken control** | >240ms | Player notices delay, feel breaks down |

> "At 50ms response, the game feels like an extension of your body. Above 100ms, you notice lag. Above 240ms, real-time control is broken."

**See**: `references/perception-thresholds.md`

## The Six Metrics of Game Feel

### 1. Input
The physical device and signals it sends.

**Measure**: Sensitivity, states, signal types (Boolean vs continuous), physical ergonomics

### 2. Response
How input maps to game state changes.

**Measure**: Direct vs indirect mapping, simulation complexity, ADSR envelopes

### 3. Context  
The spatial environment providing meaning to motion.

**Measure**: Object spacing relative to avatar speed, collision density, level layout

### 4. Polish
Effects that emphasize and sell interactions.

**Measure**: Particles, screen shake, animation sync, sound design

### 5. Metaphor
What the game represents and expectations it creates.

**Measure**: Realism vs abstraction, player expectations, genre conventions

### 6. Rules
Game rules that affect moment-to-moment feel.

**Measure**: Health systems, risk/reward, state changes, ability unlocks

**See**: `references/six-metrics.md`

## The ADSR Envelope for Game Feel

Borrowed from audio synthesis, describes how response changes over time:

```
     Sustain ___________
    /                   \
   / Attack      Decay   \ Release
  /                       \
_/                         \_____
```

| Phase | Description | Example (Mario Jump) |
|-------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Attack** | Time to reach full response | Jump force ramps up as button held |
| **Decay** | Settling to sustained level | Initial burst settles |
| **Sustain** | Maintained level while input held | Maximum jump height maintained |
| **Release** | Falloff after input stops | Gravity takes over on release |

**Key insight**: Most "floaty" vs "tight" feelings come from Attack and Release times.

**See**: `references/adsr-tuning.md`

---

## Common Feel Vocabulary

| Term | Meaning | Typical Cause |
|------|---------|---------------|
| **Tight** | Precise, immediate response | Short attack, high acceleration, low release |
| **Floaty** | Loose, delayed, drifty | Long attack/release, high inertia |
| **Responsive** | Does what you want immediately | <100ms response, direct mapping |
| **Sluggish** | Delayed, heavy feeling | >150ms response, long attack |
| **Slippery** | Hard to stop precisely | Low friction, long release |
| **Sticky** | Hard to start moving | High friction, long attack |
| **Weighty** | Sense of mass and momentum | Acceleration curves, gravity strength |
| **Snappy** | Quick state transitions | Short attack AND release |

---

## Simulation Fundamentals

### Position vs Velocity vs Acceleration

| Level | What Changes | Feel |
|-------|--------------|------|
| **Set Position** | Teleport directly | Stiff, robotic (Donkey Kong) |
| **Set Velocity** | Change speed directly | Responsive but unnatural |
| **Apply Force** | Add acceleration | Fluid, physical (Mario, Asteroids) |

### The Asteroids Principle
**Separate thrust from rotation** for expressive space-feel:
- Rotation: Direct, instant (no simulation)
- Thrust: Adds force in facing direction (simulated)
- Result: Ship feels on-the-edge-of-control but never actually out of control

### The Mario Principle  
**Separate horizontal and vertical systems**:
- Horizontal: Acceleration, max speed, deceleration, run modifier
- Vertical: Jump force, gravity, fall gravity (3x normal!), terminal velocity
- Button hold time affects jump height (with min/max limits)

**See**: `references/simulation-recipes.md`

---

## The Mario Jump Recipe

The most-analyzed jump in game history:

### Horizontal Movement
```
Walk acceleration → Walk max speed
Run acceleration → Run max speed (B held)
Air acceleration (reduced)
Deceleration (same for walk/run)
```

### Vertical Movement
```
Initial jump force (instant, large)
Gravity (constant, moderate)
Jump button hold → extends upward force (with max time)
Early release → force artificially set to low value
Apex detection → gravity triples for descent
Terminal velocity cap
```

### The "Hack" That Makes It Work
When player releases jump early:
1. Check if upward velocity > threshold
2. If yes, instantly set velocity to preset low value
3. This creates consistent arc shapes regardless of release timing

**See**: `references/mario-mechanics.md`

---

## Polish That Matters

### The Three-Tier Impact System
Light / Medium / Hard impacts each get:
- Distinct animation
- Distinct sound
- Distinct visual effect (particles, screen shake)

### Sound-Motion Harmony
- Rising pitch = rising motion (Mario's jump sound)
- Impact sounds match visual scale
- Footsteps sync with animation frames
- Material-specific sounds (metal, grass, stone)

### Crossover Sensation
Multiple mechanics should feel bound by the same physics:
- Swimming feels floaty *because* running feels grounded
- Flying defies *the same gravity* that affects jumping
- Contrast creates perceived consistency

**See**: `references/polish-effects.md`

---

## Context: Level Design for Feel

### Spatial Relationships Must Match Mechanics
- Jump heights → platform heights
- Run speed → corridor widths  
- Stopping distance → gap sizes before hazards

### The "Just Right" Principle
Objects should be spaced so the intended move *just barely* works:
- Long Jump gaps: exactly Long Jump distance
- Triple Jump heights: exactly Triple Jump apex
- Creates sense of mastery when executed

### Soft Boundaries
Use physics to guide, not walls to block:
- Steep inclines cause sliding (Mario 64)
- Water slows movement
- Winds push in intended directions

> "Players don't feel the direct intervention of the designer. The limit feels like a logical consequence rather than an overt constraint."

**See**: `references/spatial-context.md`

## Debugging Feel Problems

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| "Floaty" | Long attack/release times | Shorten acceleration curves |
| "Sluggish" | High response lag | Reduce input-to-display latency |
| "Slippery" | Low deceleration | Increase friction/deceleration |
| "Stiff" | No acceleration curve | Add attack phase to movement |
| "Unresponsive" | Input not registering | Check input polling rate |
| "Unpredictable" | Variable trajectories | Use fixed special-move arcs |
| "Weightless" | Weak gravity | Increase fall gravity especially |

---

## Principles of Good Game Feel

1. **Predictable special moves** — Fixed trajectories for precision maneuvers
2. **Variable basic moves** — Expressive range for moment-to-moment control
3. **Consistent abstraction** — Simple physics, but self-consistent
4. **Exceed metaphor expectations** — Feel more real than graphics suggest
5. **Polish harmonizes** — Sound, visual, animation tell same story
6. **Context matches capability** — Level design respects avatar limits
7. **Response < 100ms** — Maintain instantaneous feel
8. **Contrast creates variety** — Different mechanics feel different

## Key Mantras

- **"The game should feel like an extension of your body."**
- **"Separate systems, consistent world."** — Independent mechanics, unified physics.
- **"Exceed the metaphor."** — Feel better than it looks.
- **"Fixed for precision, variable for expression."** — Special moves vs basic moves.
- **"Polish is not optional."** — Effects sell the interaction.
- **"240ms is the wall."** — Response time ceiling for real-time control.
