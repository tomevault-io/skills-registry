# Gemini Canvas Skill

## Overview
Claude can use Gemini Canvas at gemini.google.com for collaborative document creation, code editing, and visual content development. Canvas provides a side-by-side workspace for iterative writing and coding with AI assistance.

## Quick Install

```bash
curl -sSL https://canifi.com/skills/gemini-canvas/install.sh | bash
```

Or manually:
```bash
cp -r skills/gemini-canvas ~/.canifi/skills/
```

## Setup

Configure via [canifi-env](https://canifi.com/setup/scripts):

```bash
# First, ensure canifi-env is installed:
# curl -sSL https://canifi.com/install.sh | bash

canifi-env set GOOGLE_EMAIL "your-email@gmail.com"
```

## Privacy & Authentication

**Your credentials, your choice.** Canifi LifeOS respects your privacy.

### Option 1: Manual Browser Login (Recommended)
If you prefer not to share credentials with Claude Code:
1. Complete the [Browser Automation Setup](/setup/automation) using CDP mode
2. Login to the service manually in the Playwright-controlled Chrome window
3. Claude will use your authenticated session without ever seeing your password

### Option 2: Environment Variables
If you're comfortable sharing credentials, you can store them locally:
```bash
canifi-env set SERVICE_EMAIL "your-email"
canifi-env set SERVICE_PASSWORD "your-password"
```

**Note**: Credentials stored in canifi-env are only accessible locally on your machine and are never transmitted.

        "Create a project proposal for [topic]"
        Iterates with suggestions, refines structure,
        exports final document.
```

### Example 2: Code Development
```
User: "Use Canvas to build a Python web scraper"
Claude: Opens Canvas in code mode, develops scraper:
        Initial implementation, then iterates to add
        error handling, logging, and documentation.
```

### Example 3: Refine Content
```
User: "Help me improve this blog post in Canvas"
Claude: Pastes content into Canvas, requests improvements:
        "Improve clarity, add transitions, enhance introduction"
        Returns polished version.
```

### Example 4: Technical Documentation

User: "Create API documentation for my endpoints"
Claude: Uses Canvas to structure documentation:
        Endpoint descriptions, parameters, examples,
        error codes. Exports formatted documentation.
```

## Authentication Flow
1. Claude navigates to gemini.google.com via Playwright MCP
2. Authenticates with GOOGLE_EMAIL if needed
3. Handles 2FA if prompted (notifies user via iMessage)
4. Accesses Canvas feature

## Canvas Workflow
```
1. Navigate to gemini.google.com
2. Start conversation or select Canvas mode
3. Create initial content with prompt
4. Review in side-by-side canvas view
5. Request iterations and improvements
6. Apply suggested changes
7. Export or copy final content
```

## Selectors Reference
```javascript
// Chat input
'[aria-label="Enter a prompt here"]' or 'rich-textarea'

// Canvas panel
'.canvas-editor' or '.canvas-content'

// Canvas toggle
'[aria-label="Canvas"]' or canvas mode button

// Code block
'.code-block' or 'pre code'

// Copy button
'[aria-label="Copy"]'

// Apply changes
'[aria-label="Apply"]'

// Undo/Redo
'[aria-label="Undo"]'
'[aria-label="Redo"]'

// Export options
'[aria-label="Export"]'
```

## Canvas Modes
```
Writing Mode:
- Long-form documents
- Essays and articles
- Reports and proposals
- Creative writing

Code Mode:
- Python, JavaScript, etc.

```

## Error Handling
- **Login Failed**: Retry 3 times, notify user via iMessage
- **Session Expired**: Re-authenticate automatically
- **Canvas Not Available**: Fall back to regular chat mode
- **Content Too Long**: Split into sections, process iteratively
