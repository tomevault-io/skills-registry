# Gemini File API

Upload and manage files for use with Gemini models through executable scripts, supporting images, audio, video, PDFs, and other file types.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need to:
- Upload images for multimodal analysis
- Upload videos for content processing
- Upload PDFs for document analysis
- Upload audio for transcription or processing
- Pre-upload files for batch operations
- Check file processing status
- List and manage uploaded files
- Use files with other Gemini skills (text, image, etc.)

## Available Scripts

### scripts/upload.py
**Purpose**: Upload files to Gemini File API

**When to use**:
- Uploading any file for Gemini processing
- Preparing files for multimodal generation
- Uploading documents for analysis
- Batch file preparation

**Key parameters**:
| Parameter | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `path` | File path (required) | `image.jpg` |
| `--name`, `-n` | Display name | `"my-document"` |
| `--wait`, `-w` | Wait for processing | Flag |

**Output**: File name, URI, and status information

## Workflows

### Workflow 1: Basic File Upload
```bash
python scripts/upload.py image.jpg
```
- Best for: Quick uploads, simple files
- Output: File name and URI for API use
- State: PROCESSING or ACTIVE

### Workflow 2: Upload with Custom Name
```bash
python scripts/upload.py document.pdf --name "Quarterly Report Q4 2026"
```
- Best for: Organizing files, tracking uploads
- Use when: Original filename not descriptive enough
- Display name appears in file listings

### Workflow 3: Upload and Wait for Processing
```bash
python scripts/upload.py video.mp4 --wait
```
- Best for: Large files, videos, audio
- Waits for file to be ACTIVE state
- Use when: You need to use file immediately after upload

### Workflow 4: Upload Image for Analysis
```bash
# 1. Upload image
python scripts/upload.py photo.png --name "product-shot"

# 2. Use with gemini-text for analysis
python skills/gemini-text/scripts/generate.py "Describe this image" --image photo.png
```
- Best for: Image analysis, captioning, visual Q&A
- Combines with: gemini-text for multimodal processing

### Workflow 5: Upload PDF for Content Extraction
```bash
# 1. Upload PDF
python scripts/upload.py research-paper.pdf --name "AI-Research-Paper" --wait

# 2. Extract content with gemini-text
python skills/gemini-text/scripts/generate.py "Extract key findings from this document" --image research-paper.pdf
```
- Best for: Document processing, content extraction
- Combines with: gemini-text for analysis

### Workflow 6: Upload Multiple Files for Batch
```bash
# 1. Upload multiple files
for file in *.jpg; do
    python scripts/upload.py "$file"
done

# 2. Create batch job using uploaded files (gemini-batch skill)
```
- Best for: Preparing files for batch processing
- Combines with: gemini-batch for bulk operations

### Workflow 7: Upload Audio for Transcription
```bash
# 1. Upload audio
python scripts/upload.py interview.mp3 --name "interview-001" --wait

# 2. Process with gemini-text (if transcription available)
python skills/gemini-text/scripts/generate.py "Transcribe and summarize this audio" --image interview.mp3
```
- Best for: Audio processing, transcription, podcast analysis
- Combines with: gemini-text for audio analysis

### Workflow 8: Upload Video for Content Analysis
```bash
# 1. Upload video (may take time)
python scripts/upload.py product-demo.mp4 --name "demo-video" --wait

# 2. Analyze with gemini-text
python skills/gemini-text/scripts/generate.py "Analyze this product demo video" --image product-demo.mp4
```
- Best for: Video analysis, content summarization
- Note: Videos may require significant processing time

## Parameters Reference

### Supported File Types

| Type | Extensions | Max Size | Processing Time |
|------|------------|----------|-----------------|
| Images | jpg, jpeg, png, gif, webp | 20MB | Seconds |
| Audio | mp3, wav, aac, flac | 25MB | Seconds-minutes |
| Video | mp4, mov, avi, webm | 2GB | Minutes-hours |
| Documents | pdf, txt | 50MB | Seconds-minutes |

### MIME Types

Script auto-detects based on extension:
- Images: image/jpeg, image/png, image/gif, image/webp
- Audio: audio/mpeg, audio/wav
- Video: video/mp4, video/quicktime, video/webm
- Documents: application/pdf, text/plain

### File States

| State | Description | Ready for Use |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| `PROCESSING` | File is being analyzed | No |
| `ACTIVE` | File is ready | Yes |
| `FAILED` | Processing failed | No |

## Output Interpretation

### Upload Response
```
Uploading photo.png...
Uploaded: files/abc123...
URI: gs://generation-tmp/abc123...
State: PROCESSING
```
- File name: Use in API calls
- URI: Internal Google Cloud Storage reference
- State: PROCESSING = wait, ACTIVE = ready

### With --wait Flag
```
Uploading video.mp4...
Uploaded: files/xyz789...
URI: gs://generation-tmp/xyz789...
State: PROCESSING
Waiting for processing...
Still processing...
File ready!
```
- Script polls until state is ACTIVE
- Use for large files requiring processing
- May take minutes for videos

### Using Uploaded Files
Once uploaded, reference file by name:
```bash
# With gemini-text
python skills/gemini-text/scripts/generate.py "Analyze" --image <uploaded-file-path>
```

## Common Issues

### "google-genai not installed"
```bash
pip install google-genai
```

### "File not found"
- Verify file path is correct
- Use absolute paths if relative paths fail
- Check file extension matches supported types

### "File too large"
- Check size limits for file type
- Compress images/videos if possible
- Split large files into smaller parts

### "Unsupported file type"
- Check supported extensions
- Convert to supported format if possible
- Images: jpg, png, gif, webp
- Videos: mp4, mov, avi, webm

### "Processing failed"
- Check file is not corrupted
- Try re-uploading the file
- Verify file format is valid
- Check API quota limits

### "File still processing" (without --wait)
- File state is PROCESSING, not ACTIVE
- Use `--wait` flag or check status later
- Large files (especially videos) take time
- Processing can take minutes to hours

## Best Practices

### Upload Strategy
- Use `--wait` for files you'll use immediately
- Skip `--wait` for batch uploads to save time
- Use descriptive `--name` for organization
- Keep track of file names for later use

### File Organization
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Include dates or versions in names
- Group related files together
- Document file names in your code

### Performance Tips
- Upload multiple files in parallel (separate processes)
- Pre-upload files for batch operations
- Check file state before using in API calls
- Delete old files to manage storage

### Error Handling
- Check return state after upload
- Retry failed uploads
- Verify file integrity before upload
- Log file names for audit trails

### Integration with Other Skills
- **gemini-text**: Multimodal analysis, document processing
- **gemini-image**: Generate images based on uploaded reference
- **gemini-batch**: Use uploaded files in batch jobs
- **gemini-embeddings**: Create embeddings from file content

### File Lifecycle
- Upload → PROCESSING → ACTIVE → Use in API
- Delete old files to free storage
- Files may expire after certain period
- Download important files for backup

## Related Skills

- **gemini-text**: Analyze uploaded files with text generation
- **gemini-image**: Create images based on uploaded references
- **gemini-batch**: Use uploaded files in batch processing
- **gemini-embeddings**: Generate embeddings from file content

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Basic upload
python scripts/upload.py image.jpg

# With custom name
python scripts/upload.py document.pdf --name "My Document"

# Wait for processing
python scripts/upload.py video.mp4 --wait

# Multiple files
for file in *.jpg; do python scripts/upload.py "$file"; done
```

## File Management API

While not in scripts, you can also manage files via Python:

```python
from google import genai

client = genai.Client()

# List all files
for file in client.files.list():
    print(f"{file.name}: {file.display_name} ({file.state})")

# Get file info
file = client.files.get(name="files/abc123...")
print(f"State: {file.state}")

# Delete file
client.files.delete(name="files/abc123...")
```
