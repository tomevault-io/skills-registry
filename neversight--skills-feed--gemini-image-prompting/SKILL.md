## 3D Model Reference Sheets (For Roblox Building)

Use these prompts to generate multi-view concept art that you can then build programmatically in Roblox using Parts.

### Why Multi-View Sheets?

When building 3D models from Parts in Roblox, you need to know:
- **Proportions** from multiple angles
- **Part breakdown** - which boxes/shapes make up the model
- **Colors** for each section
- **Size ratios** between components

A 3x3 or orthographic grid gives you all the reference you need.

## Workflow: Simple Props vs Complex Models

When generating Roblox model reference sheets, use different approaches based on complexity:

### Complex Models (Individual Reference Sheets)
Use the full 8-view grid (or 3x3 with details) for:
- **Characters/Creatures**: Dragon, Horse, Robot, Zombie, Ghost, Skeleton
- **Buildings**: Houses, Towers, Churches, Castles, Windmills
- **Vehicles**: Cars, Tanks, Mechs, Boats
- **Large Props**: Treasure Chests (with interior), Furniture with details

Why: These need multiple angles to understand proportions, part breakdown, and construction details.

### Simple Props (Pack Reference Sheets)
Generate multiple items in a single image for:
- **Small Props**: Torches, Barrels, Crates, Buckets, Sacks
- **Decor Items**: Candles, Rope coils, Shields, Lanterns
- **Food Items**: Apples, Bread, Cheese, Meat
- **Nature Items**: Rocks, Bushes, Flowers, Logs

**Pack Template:**
```
Create a props reference sheet showing 6-8 simple items in Roblox stud style.

Layout: 2 rows of items, each shown in 3/4 view

Items:
1. [Item 1] - [brief description]
2. [Item 2] - [brief description]
3. [Item 3] - [brief description]
4. [Item 4] - [brief description]
5. [Item 5] - [brief description]
6. [Item 6] - [brief description]

Style requirements:
- Blocky low-poly shapes (rectangular boxes only)
- Classic Roblox stud texture on surfaces
- Vibrant solid colors
- White background
- Each item labeled with name
- Show relative size between items

Theme: [THEME NAME]
Colors: [COLOR PALETTE]
```

**Example Pack Prompt (Medieval Props):**
```
Create a props reference sheet showing 8 medieval items in Roblox stud style.

Layout: 2 rows of 4 items, each shown in 3/4 view

Items:
1. Wall Torch - wooden handle, orange flame
2. Wooden Barrel - brown with dark bands
3. Crate - light wood, nailed shut
4. Grain Sack - tan/beige, tied top
5. Water Bucket - grey metal, wooden handle
6. Candle - white wax, yellow flame, puddle base
7. Rope Coil - tan/brown, coiled on ground
8. Wooden Shield - round, metal boss center

Style requirements:
- Blocky low-poly shapes (rectangular boxes only)
- Classic Roblox stud texture on surfaces
- Vibrant solid colors (browns, greys, warm accents)
- White background
- Each item labeled with name
- Show relative size between items

Theme: Medieval/Fantasy Village
Colors: Reddish brown wood, dark stone grey metal, warm orange flames
```

### Workflow Summary
| Complexity | Reference Type | Items per Image |
|------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Complex (dragon, building) | 8-view grid | 1 model |
| Simple (torch, barrel) | Props pack sheet | 6-8 items |
