3. **Character-Driven** - Politics happens through people
4. **Dynamic Potential** - Situations can change
5. **Adventure Integration** - PCs can affect outcomes
6. **Multiple Scales** - International to court intrigue
7. **Realistic Complexity** - Not too simple, not too tangled

## Examples

```
# Generate politics for a world
/generate-politics "Eldermyr"

# Focus on specific aspect
/generate-politics "The Crownlands" --focus "succession"

# Analyze specific relationship
/generate-politics "Valdros" --focus "[[Kingdom A]] vs [[Kingdom B]]"
```
