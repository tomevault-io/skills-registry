# Generating Sounds with AI

Help users create UI sounds from scratch using the Web Audio API, even without audio engineering knowledge. Focus on translating their descriptions into working code.

## When to Apply

Reference these guidelines when:
- User wants to create sounds without audio files
- User describes how they want something to "sound" or "feel"
- Iterating on audio parameters based on user feedback
- Building interactive tools for sound experimentation

## Key Principle

Users know what sounds "right"—they just can't implement it. Your job is to translate descriptions like "more mechanical" or "too harsh" into parameter changes.

## Building Blocks

### For Percussive Sounds (Clicks, Taps)
Use **filtered noise**, not oscillators:

```typescript
// Short noise burst with exponential decay
const buffer = ctx.createBuffer(1, ctx.sampleRate * 0.008, ctx.sampleRate);
const data = buffer.getChannelData(0);
for (let i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
  data[i] = (Math.random() * 2 - 1) * Math.exp(-i / 50);
}

// Bandpass filter for "clicky" character
const filter = ctx.createBiquadFilter();
filter.type = "bandpass";
filter.frequency.value = 4000; // Higher = brighter
filter.Q.value = 3; // Higher = more focused
```

### For Tonal Sounds (Pops, Confirmations)
Use **oscillators with pitch movement**:

```typescript
osc.type = "sine"; // or "triangle" for softer
osc.frequency.setValueAtTime(400, t);
osc.frequency.exponentialRampToValueAtTime(150, t + 0.04);
```

### For Natural Decay
Always use **exponential ramps**, not linear:

```typescript
// Good - sounds natural
gain.gain.exponentialRampToValueAtTime(0.001, t + 0.05);

// Bad - sounds artificial
gain.gain.linearRampToValueAtTime(0, t + 0.05);
```

## Translating User Descriptions

| User Says | Parameter Change |
|-----------|------------------|
| "too harsh" | Lower filter frequency, reduce Q |
| "too muffled" | Higher filter frequency |
| "too long" | Shorter duration, faster decay |
| "cuts off abruptly" | Use exponential decay, not linear |
| "more mechanical" | Higher Q, faster decay |
| "softer" | Lower gain, triangle wave instead of sine |
| "more present" | Higher filter frequency (4000-6000Hz) |
| "cheap/thin" | Add layers, increase duration slightly |

## Common Sound Patterns

### Click (Button, Toggle)
- Duration: 5-15ms
- Filter: Bandpass 3000-5000Hz
- Q: 2-4
- Decay: Fast (divisor 30-60)

### Pop (Confirmation)
- Source: Sine oscillator
- Pitch: 400Hz → 150Hz over 40ms
- Decay: Medium

### Error
- Source: Two detuned oscillators (180Hz, 190Hz)
- Direction: Falling pitch
- Filter: Lowpass to soften

### Whoosh (Transition)
- Source: Noise with sine envelope
- Filter: Sweeping bandpass (4000Hz → 1500Hz)

## AudioContext Management

Always reuse a single context:

```typescript
let audioContext: AudioContext | null = null;

function getAudioContext(): AudioContext {
  if (!audioContext) {
    audioContext = new AudioContext();
  }
  if (audioContext.state === "suspended") {
    audioContext.resume();
  }
  return audioContext;
}
```

## Iteration Strategy

1. Start with a basic implementation
2. Ask user to describe what they hear vs. what they want
3. Make one parameter change at a time
4. Build interactive tools with sliders when doing extensive tuning
5. Save presets that work

## What You Can't Do

You can't hear the sounds. Always ask:
- "Does this sound closer to what you want?"
- "Is it too [long/short/harsh/muffled]?"
- "What feels off about it?"

Let the user's ears guide the iteration.
