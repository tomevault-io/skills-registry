# What is prompt optimization?

Prompt optimization is the process of improving the quality of prompts used in language models. It is often done manually, but increasingly their are frameworks (such as DSPy) being used to use LLMs to do this.

In essence, the process involves the user providing a dataset and a grader or reward model to judge an LLM's output. A prompt's performance on the dataset is measured, the gaps in in its performance identified, and a new prompt is then proposed and tested. This runs in a loop until an end state is reached.

# What is GEPA?

GEPA (which stands for GEnetic PAreto) is a prompt optimization algorithm that follows the process above. It is increasingly a popular approach to prompt optimization, and utilizes two key strategic choices compared to other algorithms:
1. **Text Feedback:** most prompt optimization algorithms and RL simply use a scalar reward. GEPA however also uses textual feedback, including log traces, which can be used to identify the root cause of issues in a prompt. This makes it particularly well suitable for LLM as Judges, which may not be well calibrated from a score perspective but can provide high quality text feedback identifying what needs to be improved.
2. **Pareto Frontiers:** GEPA does not simply select the best overall prompt based on score, but checks for which prompt dominates other candidate prompts on most test cases in the validation dataset. Through this, you are more likely to find a prompt that performs reliably on a wider variety of cases, rather than one that might simply spike on some scenarios but underperform on others.

# The goal for this skill

Help users improve their prompts using our [custom implementation of GEPA](https://github.com/raveeshbhalla/dspy-gepa-logger). Ask them for a dataset and create a grader for them (if they don't already have one), then optimize the prompt.

Our custom GEPA implementation forks the original library to provide observability into its run. The Github repo also packages a webserver which is used to visualize the process.

## Workflow (follow in order)

0) Validate prerequisites
- Check that required tools are installed:
  - Python 3.8+: `python --version`
  - Node.js 20.19+: `node --version` (Prisma requirement)
  - npm: `npm --version`
  - git: `git --version`
- If any are missing, provide installation instructions for the user's OS.

1) Ensure repo is cloned and installed
- Confirm if it's ok to clone `dspy-gepa-logger` repo to the current folder (if not, ask where to clone it).
- Clone it from https://github.com/raveeshbhalla/dspy-gepa-logger.git
- Install in editable mode so `gepa_observable` imports work from any folder.
- See `references/repo-setup.md`.

2) Confirm data location
- Look in the current folder for csv, json or jsonl files.
  - Confirm with the user that if that's the file they want to use for optimization.
  - If not, ask where the data file lives and move it to the current folder.

3) Inspect data and define the task schema
- Load a small sample (first ~5–10 rows).
- Ask the user to map which fields are **inputs** and which are **expected outputs**.
  - Show them the fields and some sample values so they have an idea of what data they're working with.
- Identify optional **metadata** fields (IDs, timestamps, categories, etc.).
- Decide the output type (single field, multi-field, structured JSON, etc.).
- For messy columns, propose a normalized mapping and confirm.
- See `references/data-mapping.md` for question prompts and mapping patterns.

4) Collect model + budget preferences
- **IMPORTANT**: Use AskUserQuestion tool if available for better interactivity
- Ask for:
  - **Task LM** (what they'll use in production - can be smaller/cheaper like gpt-5-mini, claude-4-5-haiku)
  - **Reflective/Judge LM** (recommend stronger model like gpt-5.2, claude-4-5-sonnet)
  - **Budget**: `auto=light|medium|heavy` OR `max_full_evals` OR `max_metric_calls`. Default to `auto=light`
  - Whether to attach the web dashboard (default: yes)
  - Project/run name
  - Seed prompt (user can provide some text, rubrics or point to a file to extract from)
- If unclear, propose sensible defaults based on your web search and confirm.

5) Create `.env.local` and verify API key
- Create `<user-folder>/optimizer-script/.env.local` with template:
  ```
  OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...  # User must replace with actual key
  TASK_LM=openai/gpt-5-mini
  REFLECTIVE_LM=openai/gpt-5.2
  JUDGE_LM=openai/gpt-5.2
  ```
- **⚠️ CRITICAL**: Inform the user they MUST manually edit this file and add their actual API key
- The placeholder `your_openai_api_key_here` will cause authentication errors
- If using other providers (Anthropic, etc.), add those keys too (see `references/env.md`)
- Keep the reflective LM and judge LM the same unless the user explicitly splits them
- **WAIT** for user confirmation that they've added their API key before proceeding to verify that it can be found

6) Build DSPy objects
- Create `dspy.Example` list from the dataset and call `.with_inputs(...)`.
- Define a `dspy.Signature` from input/output fields.
- Choose a simple `dspy.Module` (e.g., `ChainOfThought` or `Predict`).
- See `references/data-mapping.md` for patterns.

7) Create a grader that can be used as the "metric with feedback" for the GEPA run
- Check if the dataset provided has any "expected" columns.
  - If not, ask the user to provide some context for the rubric to be used- Prefer rule-based metrics when ground truth is clean.
- Otherwise use an LLM judge with strong feedback text.
- Metric must return `dspy.Prediction(score=float, feedback=str)`.
- For LLM judges, define a DSPy `Signature` (e.g., `JudgeSig`) and call
  `dspy.ChainOfThought(JudgeSig)` to get structured outputs
- See `references/metrics.md` for templates.

8) Split dataset (train/val/test)
- If dataset <100, skip test set.
- Ensure valset is representative but not too large for budget.
- Use a fixed seed for reproducibility.

9) Generate demo scripts (split files)
- Create `<user-folder>/optimizer-script/` and copy **all files** from `assets/gepa-demo/` into it.
- Edit `gepa_demo_data.py`, `gepa_demo_program.py`, `gepa_demo_metric.py` to match the dataset.
- Ensure the runner `gepa-demo-script.py` keeps CLI args for:
  - `--seed-prompt`
  - `--auto` or `--max-full-evals` or `--max-metric-calls`
  - `--server-url`
  - `--project-name`
  - `--log-dir`
  - `--train-ratio`/`--val-ratio`
- Keep all paths relative to `optimizer-script/`.

10) Run a pre-optimization smoke test
- Run `python <user-folder>/optimizer-script/gepa-demo-eval.py --data-file <path>`.
- Confirm the program runs, metric returns `score` + `feedback`, and outputs look sane.
- This validates data mapping, program wiring, and metric behavior before full optimization.
- Also run with `--use-llm-judge`. If scores are all zero, the judge output
  is likely malformed or not being parsed.

11) Start the web dashboard
- Follow `references/web-dashboard.md` to start the server from the **cloned repo** `web/` directory.
- Ensure `npx prisma generate` is run before `npx prisma migrate deploy`
- Keep the terminal window open - the server must stay running
- Verify server is running at http://localhost:3000
- If server stops, restart with: `cd web && npm run dev`

12) Run the optimizer
- **BEFORE starting**: Ask user to open http://localhost:3000 in their browser to watch live progress
- Run `python <user-folder>/optimizer-script/gepa-demo-script.py ...` with the server URL
- Inform user this will take 2-10 minutes depending on budget and dataset size
- Progress will appear in both:
  - Terminal output (text logs)
  - Web dashboard (visual charts and tables)
- Don't close terminal while optimization is running
- After completion, verify runs appear in the dashboard
- If the CLI times out, the run may still be active. Check the dashboard
  before restarting.

13) Sanity check + handoff
- Run a small test input through the optimized program.
- Show where outputs/logs live.
- Verify final accuracy improvement in the database or dashboard.
- Provide next steps:
  - Tune budgets (`auto=medium` or `auto=heavy` for better results)
  - Refine judge rubric in the metric
  - Add more training data
  - Test on held-out test set if available
  - Deploy optimized prompt to production

## Troubleshooting

**To start completely fresh:**
```bash
# Stop web server
pkill -f "next dev"

# Remove directories
rm -rf optimizer-script dspy-gepa-logger

# Clear database (if needed)
rm dspy-gepa-logger/web/dev.db

# Start from step 0
```

**Common issues:**

1. **"Incorrect API key" error**
   - Edit `optimizer-script/.env.local` with your actual API key
   - Replace `your_openai_api_key_here` with `sk-...`

2. **"Cannot find module '.prisma/client'" error**
   - Run `npx prisma generate` in the `web/` directory
   - Then run `npx prisma migrate deploy`

3. **"Port 3000 already in use" error**
   - Stop existing server: `lsof -i :3000` then kill the process
   - Or use a different port in the web server config

4. **Web server stops unexpectedly**
   - Check the background process: `lsof -i :3000`
   - Restart: `cd web && npm run dev`
   - Keep terminal window open while optimization runs

5. **"temperature not supported" error**
   - Update model name or check if model requires `temperature=1.0`
   - Edit the generated scripts to adjust temperature

6. **No data showing in dashboard**
   - Verify server is running: http://localhost:3000
   - Check database has records: `sqlite3 web/dev.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Run;"`
   - Ensure `--server-url http://localhost:3000` was passed to optimizer

## Using AskUserQuestion Tool

When available, use the AskUserQuestion tool for better interactivity:
- Step 3: Ask about input/output field mapping
- Step 4: Present model choices with descriptions
- Step 5: Confirm API key is added
- Step 12: Confirm user opened browser before starting optimization

This creates a more guided, interactive experience.

7. **"listen EPERM" / port bind errors**
   - Some sandboxed shells cannot bind to ports without elevated permissions.
   - Retry starting the server with an escalated command or run it in a user shell.
