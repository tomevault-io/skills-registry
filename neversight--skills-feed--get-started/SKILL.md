## Environment Detection and Configuration

Many skills depend on Python or Node.js environments. Before installing skills, ensure your system is configured with these tools.

### Detect Current Environment

Run the following commands to check your environment:

```bash
# Check Python
python3 --version || python --version

# Check Node.js
node -v

# Check npm
npm -v
```

### Install Python Environment (via uv)

If you don't have Python or need a better Python package manager, we recommend using **uv** (a modern Python package manager):

```bash
# Install uv
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# After installation, restart your terminal or run
source $HOME/.cargo/env

# Verify installation
uv --version

# Use uv to install Python (if needed)
uv python install 3.12

# Use uv to create a virtual environment
uv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
```

**Why choose uv?**
- ⚡ Extremely fast package installation (10-100x faster than pip)
- 🔒 Better dependency resolution and locking
- 🎯 Unified Python version and package management
- 🚀 Written in Rust, excellent performance

### Install Node.js Environment (via nvm)

If you don't have Node.js, we recommend using **nvm** (Node Version Manager) for installation:

```bash
# 1. Download and install nvm
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.3/install.sh | bash

# 2. Restart your terminal or run the following command to load nvm
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"

# 3. Install the latest LTS version of Node.js
nvm install 24

# 4. Set default version
nvm alias default 24

# 5. Verify installation
node -v   # Should show v24.x.x
npm -v    # Should show 11.x.x
```

**Why choose nvm?**
- 🔄 Easily switch between different Node.js versions
- 📦 Each project can use a different Node version
- 🎯 No sudo permission needed to install global packages
- 🛡️ Avoid system-level Node.js version conflicts

### Environment Configuration Checklist

Before installing skills, ensure the following conditions are met:

- [ ] **Python 3.10+** or **uv** installed
- [ ] **Node.js 18+** installed
- [ ] **npm or pnpm** package manager available
- [ ] **curl** command available (for downloading installation scripts)
- [ ] Terminal has network access

### Common Environment Issues

#### macOS Users
```bash
# If curl is not available, install via Homebrew
brew install curl

# If you encounter permission issues, ensure you're not using system-level Python/Node
which python3  # Should point to ~/.local/bin or virtual environment
which node     # Should point to ~/.nvm directory
```

#### Linux Users
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt update
sudo apt install curl

# Ensure bash or zsh configuration files are updated
# nvm and uv paths should be in ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
```

#### Windows Users
We recommend using WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux) or Git Bash, then follow the Linux installation method.

### Verify Environment Configuration

Run the following commands to ensure all tools are working properly:

```bash
# Complete environment check
echo "=== Python ==="
python3 --version 2>/dev/null || echo "Python not found"
uv --version 2>/dev/null || echo "uv not found"

echo -e "\n=== Node.js ==="
node -v 2>/dev/null || echo "Node.js not found"
npm -v 2>/dev/null || echo "npm not found"
nvm --version 2>/dev/null || echo "nvm not found"

echo -e "\n=== Tools ==="
curl --version 2>/dev/null | head -n 1 || echo "curl not found"
```

**If all checks pass, you're ready to start installing and using skills!** 🎉
