# Git Commit and Push

Stage changes, create a conventional commit, and push to origin in one workflow.

## When to Use

- Ready to save changes to GitHub
- Work is complete and tested
- Any request to "commit and push" or "save changes"

## Workflow

### 1. Check Current State

```bash
git status
git branch --show-current
```

### 2. Review Changes

```bash
git diff
# or if files already staged:
git diff --staged
```

### 3. Stage Files

**Stage all changes:**
```bash
git add .
```

**Stage specific files:**
```bash
git add path/to/file1 path/to/file2
```

**Stage by pattern:**
```bash
git add src/components/*.tsx
```

### 4. Create Conventional Commit

Analyze the diff to determine type and scope:

```bash
git commit -m "<type>[optional scope]: <description>"
```

**Types:**
- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation
- `style:` - Formatting
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `perf:` - Performance
- `test:` - Tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance

**Examples:**
```bash
git commit -m "feat(auth): add OAuth2 login flow"
git commit -m "fix(api): resolve null pointer exception"
git commit -m "docs: update README with setup instructions"
```

### 5. Push to Origin

**Push current branch:**
```bash
git push
```

**First push (set upstream):**
```bash
git push -u origin HEAD
```

### 6. Verify

```bash
git log --oneline -3
git status
```

## Complete Examples

**Commit and push all changes:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add dark mode toggle"
git push
```

**Commit specific files:**
```bash
git add src/auth.ts src/middleware.ts
git commit -m "feat(auth): implement JWT verification"
git push
```

**Commit with body:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat(search): add elasticsearch integration

- Configure ES client
- Add search endpoint
- Implement result ranking

Closes #234"
git push
```

## Git Safety Protocol

- NEVER commit secrets (.env, credentials)
- NEVER run `git push --force` to main/master
- NEVER use `--no-verify` unless explicitly asked
- If commit fails due to hooks, fix issues and create NEW commit

## Best Practices

- Commit related changes together
- Write clear, imperative commit messages
- Keep commits atomic (one logical change)
- Push frequently to back up work
- Verify CI passes after push
