# Git Log - Commit & Documentation

Generate structured commit messages and maintain comprehensive git log documentation for the VRP toolkit project.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- Preparing to commit changes to the repository
- Reviewing git history to understand recent changes
- Maintaining the project's change documentation
- Need quick reference for common git commands
- Want to ensure consistent commit message formatting

## Core Workflow: Commit & Log

### Step 1: Analyze Changes
Before committing, analyze the current changes:
```bash
git status
git diff --staged  # If changes already staged
git diff           # If changes not staged
```

**Key questions to answer:**
- What files were modified/added/deleted?
- What is the nature of changes (feature, bug fix, docs, refactor)?
- What scope is affected (e.g., architecture, setup, migration)?

### Step 2: Generate Commit Message
Based on the changes, generate a commit message following Conventional Commits format:

**Format:** `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`

**Common types for this project:**
- `feat`: New feature or functionality
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring (no behavior change)
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks, dependency updates
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)

**Common scopes for this project:**
- `architecture`: Changes to overall architecture
- `migration`: File migrations from SDR_stochastic
- `setup`: Project setup, installation, dependencies
- `alns`: ALNS algorithm changes
- `pdptw`: PDPTW problem definition
- `data`: Data layer changes
- `visualization`: Visualization tools
- `tutorials`: Tutorial notebooks

**Subject guidelines:**
- Use imperative mood: "add" not "added" or "adds"
- First letter lowercase
- No period at end
- Keep under 50 characters if possible

**Body (optional but recommended):**
- Explain what changed and why
- Use bullet points for multiple changes
- Reference issues or related work

**Examples:**
```
feat(architecture): implement unified Solver interface for problem-algorithm separation

- Create VRPProblem, VRPSolution, Solver abstract base classes
- Implement ALNSSolver adapter pattern
- Update quickstart tutorial to demonstrate new interface
```

```
chore: update migration progress (9/9 files)

- Update CLAUDE.md completed tasks section
- Add migration entry to MIGRATION_LOG.md
- Update progress statistics
```

### Step 3: Maintain Git Log Documentation
After committing, update the git log documentation file (`.claude/GIT_LOG.md`):

**File structure:**
```markdown
# Git Log - VRP Toolkit Project

*Comprehensive record of all commits with detailed information.*

## Recent Commits (newest first)

### 2026-01-01 - feat(architecture): implement unified Solver interface
**Hash:** 4569fa1
**Author:** [Author Name]
**Date:** 2026-01-01 12:34:56

**Changes:**
- Created base.py module with abstract base classes
- Implemented adapter pattern for backward compatibility
- Updated quickstart tutorial

**Files modified:**
- vrp_toolkit/algorithms/base.py
- vrp_toolkit/algorithms/alns/solver.py
- tutorials/01_quickstart.ipynb

### 2025-12-31 - chore: update migration progress (9/9)
**Hash:** 9590014
**Author:** [Author Name]
**Date:** 2025-12-31 10:20:30

**Changes:**
- Updated CLAUDE.md with completed migration status
- Added final migration entry to MIGRATION_LOG.md

**Files modified:**
- .claude/CLAUDE.md
- .claude/MIGRATION_LOG.md
```

**Update process:**
1. Extract commit information: `git log -1 --pretty=format:"%H|%an|%ad|%s" --date=iso`
2. Get changed files: `git show --name-only --pretty=format:"" HEAD`
3. Format entry using template above
4. Add to top of "Recent Commits" section in `.claude/GIT_LOG.md`
5. Keep only last 20-30 commits in main section (archive older ones if needed)

### Step 4: Execute Commit
Provide the user with exact commands to execute:

```bash
# Stage changes
git add [file1] [file2] ...

# Commit with generated message
git commit -m "feat(architecture): implement unified Solver interface

- Create VRPProblem, VRPSolution, Solver abstract base classes
- Implement ALNSSolver adapter pattern
- Update quickstart tutorial to demonstrate new interface"

# Push to remote (if desired)
git push
```

## Quick Command Reference

### Status & Diff
```bash
git status -s          # Short status
git diff               # Unstaged changes
git diff --staged      # Staged changes
git diff HEAD~1        # Compare with previous commit
```

### Commit Operations
```bash
git commit -am "msg"   # Stage tracked files and commit
git commit --amend     # Amend last commit
git commit --amend --no-edit  # Amend without changing message
```

### Branch Operations
```bash
git checkout -b feature-name  # Create and switch branch
git switch -c feature-name    # Modern equivalent
git branch -d branch-name     # Delete local branch
```

### History & Log
```bash
git log --oneline -10         # Last 10 commits, one line
git log --oneline --graph --all  # Graphical history
git show HEAD                 # Show last commit details
```

### Undo & Reset
```bash
git restore --staged file.py  # Unstage file
git restore file.py           # Discard unstaged changes
git reset --soft HEAD~1       # Undo commit, keep changes
```

## Integration with Other Skills

**update-progress:** After updating CLAUDE.md and MIGRATION_LOG.md, use git-workflow to commit the documentation updates.

**migrate-module:** After migrating files, use git-workflow to commit the migrated code.

**build-session-context:** Read GIT_LOG.md to understand recent changes when starting a session.

**update-task-board:** Use GIT_LOG.md to track completion of development tasks.

## Project-Specific Patterns

### Migration Commits
```bash
git add vrp_toolkit/problems/pdptw.py
git commit -m "feat(migration): migrate instance.py to pdptw.py

- Extract generic Instance class
- Add type hints and docstrings
- Create basic test suite"
```

### Progress Update Commits
```bash
git add .claude/CLAUDE.md .claude/MIGRATION_LOG.md
git commit -m "chore: update migration progress (5/9 files)

- Mark instance.py migration as completed
- Update progress statistics
- Add detailed migration entry"
```

### Tutorial/Example Commits
```bash
git add tutorials/01_quickstart.ipynb
git commit -m "docs: add quickstart tutorial

- Show basic instance creation
- Demonstrate ALNS solving
- Include visualization examples"
```

## GIT_LOG.md Maintenance

### Initial Setup
If `.claude/GIT_LOG.md` doesn't exist, create it with the structure above.

### Regular Updates
After each commit, update GIT_LOG.md with the new commit information.

### Archive Strategy
- Keep last 20 commits in "Recent Commits" section
- Move older commits to "Archive" section at bottom
- Consider monthly archives if volume is high

### Automation Notes
When AI uses this skill, it should:
1. Analyze current git changes
2. Generate appropriate commit message
3. Show user exact commands to execute
4. After commit, update GIT_LOG.md with new entry
5. Keep GIT_LOG.md organized and readable

## Troubleshooting

### Empty Commit Message
If commit message seems generic, ask:
- What specific functionality was added/fixed?
- Which files were most significantly changed?
- What problem does this change solve?

### Multiple Change Types
If changes include mixed types (e.g., feat and fix):
- Create separate commits if possible
- If must combine, use most significant type and explain in body

### Missing GIT_LOG.md
If file doesn't exist, create it with current commit history:
```bash
# Get last 20 commits for initial log
git log --oneline -20
```
