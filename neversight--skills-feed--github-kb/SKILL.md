# GitHub Knowledge Base Explorer

## Installation

Add via Claude Code plugin marketplace:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add lecion/github-kb
```

## Configuration

Set the `GITHUB_KB_ROOT` environment variable to customize the working directory.

## Working Directory

Dynamic path based on `GITHUB_KB_ROOT` environment variable (default: `~/github-kb/`).

## Knowledge Base Management

### CLAUDE.md Location

The knowledge base index is located at `{GITHUB_KB_ROOT}/CLAUDE.md`. This file indexes all explored repositories.

### CLAUDE.md Format

```markdown
# Claude Code 知识库

本目录包含 X 个 GitHub 项目，涵盖...领域描述

---

## Category Name

### [project-name](/project-name)
Brief description of the project
```

### Updating CLAUDE.md

When cloning or exploring a new repository, update CLAUDE.md to maintain consistency:

- Add the project under an appropriate category
- Include project name (linked to its directory) and brief description
- Update the project count in the header

## Workflow

### 1. Knowledge Base Lookup (First Step)

When user asks about a repository:

1. Read `{GITHUB_KB_ROOT}/CLAUDE.md` to check if the project exists
2. If found, explore the existing directory using Read, Glob, and Grep tools
3. If not found, proceed to clone

### 2. Cloning New Repositories

When user wants to explore a new repo or the repo doesn't exist:

```bash
cd {GITHUB_KB_ROOT}
git clone <repo-url>
```

- Use HTTPS or SSH based on repo accessibility
- Default clone directory is always `{GITHUB_KB_ROOT}`

### 3. Exploring and Analyzing

After cloning or when working with existing repos:

- Use the Task tool with Explore agent for comprehensive code analysis
- Use Glob/Read/Grep for targeted on: architecture, exploration
- Focus implementation details, technical decisions, key files

### 4. Maintaining the Knowledge Base

After successful exploration:

- Update CLAUDE.md with new project entry
- Include accurate category and description
- Ensure links and formatting are correct

## Categories for CLAUDE.md

Common categories for organizing projects:

- **Web Frameworks** - Frontend/backend frameworks
- **DevOps Tools** - CI/CD, deployment, infrastructure
- **Machine Learning** - ML libraries, models, tools
- **Mobile Development** - iOS, Android, cross-platform
- **Utilities** - CLI tools, productivity
- **Databases** - Database clients, ORMs
- **APIs & Services** - API clients, SDKs
- **Other** - Projects that don't fit other categories

## Environment Variables

| Variable        | Description                | Default        |
|-----------------|----------------------------|----------------|
| `GITHUB_KB_ROOT` | Root directory for clones  | `~/github-kb/` |

## Examples

```markdown
# Clone a new repository
cd $GITHUB_KB_ROOT
git clone https://github.com/example/repo.git

# Explore an existing repository
Task tool -> Explore agent -> analyze repo structure

# Update knowledge base
Edit CLAUDE.md -> add new project entry
```

## Backward Compatibility

Existing users don't need any configuration changes. The default path maintains backward compatibility.
