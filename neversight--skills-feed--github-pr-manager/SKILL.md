# GitHub PR Manager

## Instructions

### When to Invoke This Skill
- Creating a pull request after implementing changes
- Checking status of an existing PR (mergeable, checks, reviews)
- Merging an approved PR
- Validating PR state before operations

### Capabilities

1. **Create Pull Request**
   - Generate PR from current branch
   - Create descriptive title and body
   - Link to related issues
   - Add appropriate labels

2. **View PR Status**
   - Check if PR is open/closed/merged
   - Verify mergeable state
   - Review CI check status
   - Check review approvals

3. **Merge Pull Request**
   - Squash merge with single commit
   - Validate before merging
   - Branch cleanup handled externally

### Standard Workflows

#### Creating a PR

1. **Verify Current Branch**
   ```bash
   git branch --show-current
   ```
   Ensure you're on a feature branch, not main/master

2. **Push Branch** (if not already pushed)
   ```bash
   git push -u origin HEAD
   ```

3. **Create PR**
   ```bash
   gh pr create --title "<type>: <description>" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
   ## Summary
   Resolves #<issue_number>

   <Brief description of changes>

   ## Changes Made

   )"
   ```

#### Checking PR Status

1. **Fetch PR Information**
   ```bash
   gh pr view <pr_number> --json state,mergeable,statusCheckRollup,reviewDecision
   ```

2. **Interpret Results**
   - `state`: "OPEN", "CLOSED", "MERGED"
   - `mergeable`: "MERGEABLE", "CONFLICTING", "UNKNOWN"
   - `reviewDecision`: "APPROVED", "CHANGES_REQUESTED", "REVIEW_REQUIRED"

#### Merging a PR

1. **Validate PR State**
   ```bash
   gh pr view <pr_number> --json headRefName,state,mergeable
   ```
   - Verify state is "OPEN"
   - Verify mergeable is "MERGEABLE"
   - Extract branch name for cleanup

2. **Perform Squash Merge**
   ```bash
   gh pr merge <pr_number> --squash
   ```
   This will:
   - Squash all commits into one
   - Merge to main/master

   **Important**: Do NOT use `--delete-branch` flag and do NOT switch back to main. Branch cleanup and worktree disposal are handled by the orchestrator after the PR is merged.

### Error Handling

**Authentication Issues:**
- Run: `gh auth status`
- If not authenticated: `gh auth login`

**PR Not Mergeable:**
- Check for conflicts: Inform user to resolve merge conflicts
- Check for failing CI: Wait for checks to pass
- Check for required reviews: Request reviews from team

**Worktree Environment:**
- Workers operate in isolated git worktrees
- Do NOT attempt to delete branches or switch to main after merging
- Worktree cleanup is handled by the orchestrator after PR merge
- Focus only on the merge operation itself

### PR Title and Body Standards

**Title Format:**
```
<type>: <brief description>
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `perf`

**Body Format:**
```markdown
## Summary
Resolves #<issue>

<1-2 sentence description>

## Changes Made
- <Bullet list of key changes>

## Testing
- <How changes were tested>
- <Manual test steps if needed>

## Screenshots (if UI changes)
<Optional screenshots>

## Examples

### Example 1: Create PR from feature branch
```
User: "Create a PR for this feature"
Action:
1. Verify on feature branch
2. Push if needed
3. Create PR with structured body linking to issue
Output: PR URL and number
```

### Example 2: Check PR status before merging
```
User: "Is PR #123 ready to merge?"
Action:
1. Fetch PR status
2. Check mergeable state, CI status, reviews
Output: "PR #123 is ready to merge" or list blockers
```

### Example 3: Merge approved PR
```
User: "Merge PR #123"
Action:
1. Validate PR state (gh pr view 123 --json headRefName,state,mergeable)
2. Squash merge (gh pr merge 123 --squash)
Output: "PR #123 merged successfully. Worktree cleanup will be handled by orchestrator."
```
