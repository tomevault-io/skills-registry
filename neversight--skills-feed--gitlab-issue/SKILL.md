# GitLab Issue Management

Create, retrieve, update, and manage GitLab issues with comprehensive context integration and structured workflows.

## GitLab Instance Configuration

This skill is configured for a self-hosted GitLab instance:
- **GitLab URL:** https://gitlab-erp-pas.dedalus.lan
- All project identifiers, URLs, and references should use this self-hosted instance
- Ensure you have appropriate access credentials configured for this GitLab server

## When to Use This Skill

Activate this skill when:
- The user wants to create a new GitLab issue
- The user asks to view or retrieve issue details
- The user needs to update an existing issue
- The user wants to list issues in a project
- The user mentions managing issues, tickets, or tasks in GitLab
- The user wants to close, reopen, or modify issue properties
- The user needs to link issues to merge requests

## Critical Rules

**IMPORTANT: Always confirm project_id before creating or modifying issues**

**Always use descriptive issue titles and provide structured descriptions**

**Never create duplicate issues - search existing issues first when appropriate**

## Workflow

### 1. Gather Context

First, collect information about the current project and context:

- Identify the project (project_id or URL-encoded path)
- Understand the type of issue (bug, feature, task, etc.)
- Gather relevant labels, milestones, and assignees if applicable

### 2. Project Verification

Before any operation, verify the project exists and you have the correct identifier:

**Self-hosted GitLab Instance:** https://gitlab-erp-pas.dedalus.lan

Use `gitlab-mcp(get_project)` to:
- Confirm project exists on the self-hosted GitLab instance
- Get project details (default branch, visibility, etc.)
- Understand project structure
- Verify project path format (e.g., "namespace/project")

### 3. Issue Operations

#### Creating a New Issue

When creating issues, gather complete context:

**Required Information:**
- `project_id`: Project identifier (e.g., "namespace/project" or numeric ID)
- `title`: Clear, descriptive issue title

**Optional but Recommended:**
- `description`: Detailed description in Markdown format
- `labels`: Array of label names (e.g., ["bug", "priority::high"])
- `assignee_ids`: Array of user IDs to assign
- `milestone_id`: Milestone ID to associate
- `due_date`: Due date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- `confidential`: Boolean for sensitive issues

**Human-in-the-Loop - Ask for Context**

Always use AskUserQuestion to clarify issue details:

```
Question: "What type of issue is this?"
Options:
- "Bug report - something is not working correctly"
- "Feature request - new functionality needed"
- "Task - work item to complete"
- "Documentation - documentation needs update"
- "Other - let me describe it"
```

**Issue Description Template:**

Structure descriptions for clarity:

```markdown
## Summary
[Brief description of the issue]

## Current Behavior
[What is happening now - for bugs]

## Expected Behavior
[What should happen - for bugs]

## Steps to Reproduce
[For bugs - numbered steps]

## Acceptance Criteria
[For features/tasks - what defines "done"]

## Additional Context
[Screenshots, logs, related issues, etc.]
```

#### Retrieving Issue Details

Use `gitlab-mcp(get_issue)` with:
- `project_id`: Project identifier
- `issue_iid`: Internal issue ID (the number shown in GitLab, e.g., #42)

This returns complete issue information including:
- Title and description
- State (opened/closed)
- Labels and milestone
- Assignees and author
- Created/updated timestamps
- Related merge requests

#### Listing Issues

Use `gitlab-mcp(list_issues)` with filters:
- `project_id`: Project identifier
- `state`: "opened", "closed", or "all"
- `labels`: Filter by labels
- `milestone`: Filter by milestone title
- `assignee_id`: Filter by assignee
- `search`: Search in title and description
- `order_by`: Sort by "created_at", "updated_at", "priority", etc.
- `sort`: "asc" or "desc"
- `per_page`: Results per page (max 100)

#### Updating an Issue

When updating issues, only provide changed fields:

Use `gitlab-mcp(update_issue)` with:
- `project_id`: Project identifier
- `issue_iid`: Internal issue ID
- Plus any fields to update (title, description, labels, state_event, etc.)

**State Changes:**
- `state_event: "close"` - Close the issue
- `state_event: "reopen"` - Reopen the issue

### 4. Linking to Merge Requests

To find related merge requests:

Use `gitlab-mcp(list_merge_requests)` with filters to find MRs that reference the issue:
- Search for issue number in MR titles/descriptions
- Check MR descriptions for "Closes #XX" or "Fixes #XX" patterns

### 5. Execute Operations (Requires Confirmation)

**CRITICAL: Confirm with user before creating or modifying issues**

After gathering all information, present a summary for user approval:

```
Creating issue in project: namespace/project
Title: [title]
Description: [summary]
Labels: [labels]
Assignee: [assignee]

Proceed with issue creation?
```

## Issue Type Templates

### Bug Report

```markdown

## Environment
- Version: [version]
- OS: [operating system]
- Browser: [if applicable]

## Steps to Reproduce

## Important Notes

- **Self-hosted GitLab:** All operations use https://gitlab-erp-pas.dedalus.lan
- **Always verify project access** - Ensure you have permission to create/modify issues on the self-hosted instance
- **Use labels consistently** - Follow project labeling conventions
- **Be specific in titles** - Prefix with [BUG], [FEATURE], [TASK] for clarity
- **Include reproduction steps** - Essential for bug reports
- **Define acceptance criteria** - Clear "definition of done" for features/tasks
- **Link related issues** - Use "Related to #XX" or "Blocks #XX" in descriptions
- **Mention users with @username** - For visibility and notifications
- **Use milestones** - Associate issues with releases or sprints when applicable

## GitLab Issue Best Practices

### Writing Effective Titles
- Be concise but descriptive
- Include issue type prefix: [BUG], [FEATURE], [TASK], [DOCS]
- Mention affected component if applicable
- Avoid vague titles like "Fix bug" or "Update code"

### Structuring Descriptions
- Use Markdown formatting for readability
- Include all relevant context upfront
- Add screenshots or logs when helpful
- Link to related issues, MRs, or documentation
- Use task lists for trackable sub-items

### Label Strategy
- Use scoped labels (e.g., `priority::high`, `status::in-progress`)
- Combine type labels (`bug`, `feature`) with area labels (`frontend`, `api`)
- Keep label taxonomy consistent across projects

### Assignment and Workflow
- Assign issues to specific team members
- Use milestones for sprint/release planning
- Update issue status as work progresses
- Close issues with reference to fixing MR: "Closes #XX"
