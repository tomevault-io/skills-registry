# Genre: Battle Royale

Expert blueprint for Battle Royale games with zone mechanics, large-scale networking, and survival gameplay.

## NEVER Do

- **NEVER sync all 100 players every frame** — Use relevancy system: only sync players within visual range. Far players update at 4Hz, nearby at 20Hz+.
- **NEVER make zone center fully random** — New circle must overlap significantly with old circle, or players teleport. Limit offset to `current_radius - target_radius`.
- **NEVER use client-side hit detection** — Client says "I shot at direction X", Server validates "Did it hit?". Prevents cheating.
- **NEVER spawn loot without pooling** — 1000+ loot items cause GC spikes. Pool loot pickups and reuse instances.
- **NEVER forget VisibilityNotifier3D for distant players** — Disable `_process()` and AnimationPlayer for players behind or far away. Saves 60-80% CPU.

## Available Scripts

> **MANDATORY**: Read the appropriate script before implementing the corresponding pattern.

### [kill_feed_bus.gd](scripts/kill_feed_bus.gd)
Global elimination signal bus with match stat tracking. Single emission point for UI/logging, sorted killer rankings for end-game summary.

### [storm_system.gd](scripts/storm_system.gd)
Dynamic zone shrinking with damage interpolation. Tweens center/radius smoothly, scales damage by zone size for end-game intensity.

---

## Core Loop
1.  **Deploy**: Player chooses a landing spot from an air vehicle.
2.  **Loot**: Player scavenges weapons and armor.
3.  **Move**: Player runs to the safe zone to avoid taking damage.
4.  **Engage**: Player fights others they encounter.
5.  **Survive**: Player attempts to be the last one standing.

## Skill Chain

| Phase | Skills | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 1. Net | `godot-multiplayer-networking` | Authoritative server, lag compensation |
| 2. Map | `godot-3d-world-building`, `level-of-detail` | Large terrain, chunking, distant trees |
| 3. Items | `godot-inventory-system` | Managing backpack, attachments, armor |
| 4. Combat | `shooter-mechanics`, `ballistics` | Projectile physics, damage calculation |
| 5. Logic | `game-manager` | Managing the Storm/Zone state |

## Architecture Overview

### 1. The Zone Manager (The Storm)
Manages the shrinking safe area.

```gdscript
# zone_manager.gd
extends Node

@export var phases: Array[ZonePhase]
var current_phase_index: int = 0
var current_radius: float = 2000.0
var target_radius: float = 2000.0
var center: Vector2 = Vector2.ZERO
var target_center: Vector2 = Vector2.ZERO
var shrink_speed: float = 0.0

func start_next_phase() -> void:
    var phase = phases[current_phase_index]
    target_radius = phase.end_radius
    # Pick new center WITHIN current circle but respecting new radius
    var random_angle = randf() * TAU
    var max_offset = current_radius - target_radius
    var offset = Vector2.RIGHT.rotated(random_angle) * (randf() * max_offset)
    target_center = center + offset
    
    shrink_speed = (current_radius - target_radius) / phase.shrink_time

func _process(delta: float) -> void:
    if current_radius > target_radius:
        current_radius -= shrink_speed * delta
        center = center.move_toward(target_center, (shrink_speed * delta) * (center.distance_to(target_center) / (current_radius - target_radius)))
```

### 2. Loot Spawner
Efficiently populating the world.

```gdscript
# loot_manager.gd
func spawn_loot() -> void:
    for spawn_point in get_tree().get_nodes_in_group("loot_spawns"):
        if randf() < spawn_point.spawn_chance:
            var item_id = loot_table.roll_item()
            var loot_instance = loot_scene.instantiate()
            loot_instance.setup(item_id)
            add_child(loot_instance)
```

### 3. Deployment System
Transitioning from plane to ground.

```gdscript
# player_controller.gd
enum State { IN_PLANE, FREEFALL, PARACHUTE, GROUNDED }

func _physics_process(delta: float) -> void:
    match current_state:
        State.FREEFALL:
            velocity.y = move_toward(velocity.y, -50.0, gravity * delta)
            move_and_slide()
            if position.y < auto_deploy_height:
                deploy_parachute()
```

## Key Mechanics Implementation

### Zone Damage
Checking if player is outside the circle.

```gdscript
func check_zone_damage() -> void:
    var dist = Vector2(global_position.x, global_position.z).distance_to(ZoneManager.center)
    if dist > ZoneManager.current_radius:
        take_damage(ZoneManager.dps * delta)
```

### Networking Optimization
You cannot sync 100 players every frame.
*   **Relevancy**: Only send updates for players within visual range.
*   **Frequency**: Update far-away players at 4Hz, nearby at 20Hz+ (Server Tick).
*   **Snapshot Interpolation**: Client buffers headers to play them back smoothly.

## Godot-Specific Tips

*   **MultiplayerSynchronizer**: Use `replication_interval` to lower bandwidth for distant objects.
*   **VisibilityNotifier3D**: Critical. Disable `_process` and AnimationPlayer for players behind you or far away.
*   **Occlusion Culling**: Essential for large maps with buildings. Bake occlusion data.
*   **HLOD**: Use Hierarchical Level of Detail for terrain and large structures.

## Common Pitfalls

1.  **Too Main Loot**: Too much loot causes lag. **Fix**: Use object pooling for loot pickups.
2.  **Camping**: Players hide forever. **Fix**: The Zone forces movement. Also, anti-camping mechanics like "scan reveals" (optional).
3.  **Cheating**: Client-side hit detection. **Fix**: Authoritative server logic. Client says "I shot at direction X", Server calculates "Did it hit?".
