# Genre: Racing

Expert blueprint for racing games balancing physics, competition, and sense of speed.

## NEVER Do

- **NEVER rigid camera attachment** — Camera locked to car causes motion sickness. Use lerp with slight delay for smooth follow.
- **NEVER skip sense of speed** — Increase FOV as speed increases, add camera shake, wind lines, motion blur. Tunnel vision breaks immersion.
- **NEVER make physics overly realistic** — "Floaty" arcade feel is often more fun than simulation. Increase gravity 2-3x, adjust wheel friction.
- **NEVER forget checkpoints** — Without validation, players exploit shortcuts. Enforce checkpoint sequence to complete laps.
- **NEVER ignore rubber-banding** — AI that's too far ahead/behind makes races boring. Adjust AI speed dynamically based on player distance.

## Available Scripts

> **MANDATORY**: Read the appropriate script before implementing the corresponding pattern.

### [spline_ai_controller.gd](scripts/spline_ai_controller.gd)
Path3D-based racing AI. Projects position onto curve, calculates look-ahead for steering, applies throttle based on target speed vs velocity.

---

## Core Loop
1.  **Race**: Player controls a vehicle on a track.
2.  **Compete**: Player overtakes opponents or beats the clock.
3.  **Upgrade**: Player earns currency/points to buy parts/cars.
4.  **Tune**: Player adjusts vehicle stats (grip, acceleration).
5.  **Master**: Player learns track layouts and optimal lines.

## Skill Chain

| Phase | Skills | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 1. Physics | `physics-bodies`, `vehicle-wheel-3d` | Car movement, suspension, collisions |
| 2. AI | `navigation`, `steering-behaviors` | Opponent pathfinding, rubber-banding |
| 3. Input | `input-mapping` | Analog steering, acceleration, braking |
| 4. UI | `progress-bars`, `labels` | Speedometer, lap timer, minimap |
| 5. Feel | `camera-shake`, `godot-particles` | Speed perception, tire smoke, sparks |

## Architecture Overview

### 1. Vehicle Controller
Handling the physics of movement.

```gdscript
# car_controller.gd
extends VehicleBody3D

@export var max_torque: float = 300.0
@export var max_steering: float = 0.4

func _physics_process(delta: float) -> void:
    steering = lerp(steering, Input.get_axis("right", "left") * max_steering, 5 * delta)
    engine_force = Input.get_axis("back", "forward") * max_torque
```

### 2. Checkpoint System
Essential for tracking progress and preventing cheating.

```gdscript
# checkpoint_manager.gd
extends Node

var checkpoints: Array[Area3D] = []
var current_checkpoint_index: int = 0
signal lap_completed

func _on_checkpoint_entered(body: Node3D, index: int) -> void:
    if index == current_checkpoint_index + 1:
        current_checkpoint_index = index
    elif index == 0 and current_checkpoint_index == checkpoints.size() - 1:
        complete_lap()
```

### 3. Race Manager
high-level state machine.

```gdscript
# race_manager.gd
enum State { COUNTDOWN, RACING, FINISHED }
var current_state: State = State.COUNTDOWN

func start_race() -> void:
    # 3.. 2.. 1.. GO!
    await countdown()
    current_state = State.RACING
    start_timer()
```

## Key Mechanics Implementation

### Drifting
Arcade drifting usually involves faking physics. Reduce friction or apply a sideways force.

```gdscript
func apply_drift_mechanic() -> void:
    if is_drifting:
        # Reduce sideways traction
        wheel_friction_slip = 1.0 
        # Add slight forward boost on exit
    else:
        wheel_friction_slip = 3.0 # High grip
```

### Rubber Banding AI
Keep the race competitive by adjusting AI speed based on player distance.

```gdscript
func update_ai_speed(ai_car: VehicleBody3D, player: VehicleBody3D) -> void:
    var dist = ai_car.global_position.distance_to(player.global_position)
    if ai_car_is_ahead_of_player(ai_car, player):
        ai_car.max_speed = base_speed * 0.9 # Slow down
    else:
        ai_car.max_speed = base_speed * 1.1 # Speed up
```

## Godot-Specific Tips

*   **VehicleBody3D**: Godot's built-in node for vehicle physics. It's decent for arcade, but for sims, you might want a custom RayCast suspension.
*   **Path3D / PathFollow3D**: Excellent for simple AI traffic or fixed-path racers (on-rails).
*   **AudioBus**: Use the `Doppler` effect on the AudioListener for realistic passing sounds.
*   **SubViewport**: Use for the rear-view mirror or minimap texture.

## Common Pitfalls

1.  **Floaty Physics**: Cars feel like they are on ice. **Fix**: Increase gravity scale (2x-3x) and adjust wheel friction. Realism < Fun.
2.  **Bad Camera**: Camera is rigidly attached to the car. **Fix**: Use a `Marker3D` with a `lerp` script to follow the car smoothly with a slight delay.
3.  **Tunnel Vision**: No sense of speed. **Fix**: Increase FOV as speed increases, add camera shake, wind lines, and motion blur.
