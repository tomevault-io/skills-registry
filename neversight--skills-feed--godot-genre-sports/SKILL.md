# Genre: Sports

## Available Scripts

### [sports_ball_physics.gd](scripts/sports_ball_physics.gd)
Expert ball physics with drag, magnus effect (curve), and proper bounce handling.

## Core Loop
1.  **Possession**: Player or AI controls the ball/puck
2.  **Maneuver**: Player avoids opponents (dribble, pass)
3.  **Strike**: Player attempts to score (shoot, dunk)
4.  **Defend**: Opposing team tries to steal or block
5.  **Score**: Points determine winner after time

## NEVER Do in Sports Games

- **NEVER parent ball to player transform** — Ball must be physics-based, not child node. Parenting = magnetic stick feel, unrealistic. Use `apply_central_impulse()` for dribble touches.
- **NEVER make all AI chase the ball** — Kindergarten soccer problem. Use formation slots: only 1-2 players press ball, others cover space/mark opponents.
- **NEVER use perfect instant goalkeeper reflexes** — Add reaction time delay (0.2-0.5s) and error rate based on shot speed. Instant = unfair, frustrating.
- **NEVER ignore animation root motion for player movement** — Sports need realistic momentum/turning. Teleporting to animation end position breaks feel. Use `AnimationTree` root motion.
- **NEVER use single collision shape for player body** — Head, torso, legs need separate hitboxes for realistic ball contact (headers vs foot shots).
- **NEVER allow ball to clip through goalposts** — Use Continuous CD (`continuous_cd`) for fast-moving ball. Standard discrete physics = tunneling at high speeds.

## Skill Chain

| Phase | Skills | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 1. Physics | `physics-bodies`, `vehicle-wheel-3d` | Ball bounce, friction, player collisions |
| 2. AI | `steering-behaviors`, `godot-state-machine-advanced` | Formations, marking, flocking |
| 3. Anim | `godot-animation-tree-mastery` | Blended running, shooting, tackling |
| 4. Input | `input-mapping` | Contextual buttons (Pass/Tackle share button) |
| 5. Camera | `godot-camera-systems` | Dynamic broadcast view, zooming on action |

## Architecture Overview

### 1. The Ball (Physics Core)
The most important object. Must feel right.

```gdscript
# ball.gd
extends RigidBody3D

@export var drag_coefficient: float = 0.5
@export var magnus_effect_strength: float = 2.0

func _integrate_forces(state: PhysicsDirectBodyState3D) -> void:
    # Apply Air Drag
    var velocity = state.linear_velocity
    var speed = velocity.length()
    var drag_force = -velocity.normalized() * (drag_coefficient * speed * speed)
    state.apply_central_force(drag_force)
    
    # Magnus Effect (Curve)
    var spin = state.angular_velocity
    var magnus_force = spin.cross(velocity) * magnus_effect_strength
    state.apply_central_force(magnus_force)
```

### 2. Team AI (Formations)
AI players don't just run at the ball. They run to *positions* relative to the ball/field.

```gdscript
# team_manager.gd
extends Node

enum Strategy { ATTACK, DEFEND }
var current_strategy: Strategy = Strategy.DEFEND
var formation_slots: Array[Node3D] # Markers parented to a "Formation Anchor"

func update_tactics(ball_pos: Vector3) -> void:
    # Move the entire formation anchor
    formation_anchor.position = lerp(formation_anchor.position, ball_pos, 0.5)
    
    # Assign best player to each slot
    for player in players:
        var best_slot = find_closest_slot(player)
        player.set_target(best_slot.global_position)
```

### 3. Match Manager
The referee logic.

```gdscript
# match_manager.gd
var score_team_a: int = 0
var score_team_b: int = 0
var match_timer: float = 300.0
enum State { KICKOFF, PLAYING, GOAL, END }

func goal_scored(team: int) -> void:
    if team == 0: score_team_a += 1
    else: score_team_b += 1
    current_state = State.GOAL
    play_celebration()
    await get_tree().create_timer(5.0).timeout
    reset_positions()
    current_state = State.KICKOFF
```

## Key Mechanics Implementation

### Contextual Input
"A" button does different things depending on context.

```gdscript
func _unhandled_input(event: InputEvent) -> void:
    if event.is_action_pressed("action_main"):
        if has_ball:
            pass_ball()
        elif is_near_ball:
            slide_tackle()
        else:
            switch_player()
```

### Steering Behaviors
For natural movement (Seek, Flee, Arrive).

```gdscript
func seek(target_pos: Vector3) -> Vector3:
    var desired_velocity = (target_pos - global_position).normalized() * max_speed
    var steering = desired_velocity - velocity
    return steering.limit_length(max_force)
```

## Godot-Specific Tips

*   **NavigationServer3D**: Essential for avoiding obstacles (other players/referee).
*   **AnimationTree (BlendSpace2D)**: Crucial for sports. You need smooth blending between Idle -> Walk -> Jog -> Sprint in all directions.
*   **PhysicsMaterial**: Tune `bounce` and `friction` on the Ball and Field colliders carefully.

## Common Pitfalls

1.  **AI Bunching**: All 22 players running at the ball (Kindergarten Soccer). **Fix**: Use Formation Slots. Only 1-2 players "Press" the ball; others cover space.
2.  **Magnetic Ball**: Ball sticks to player too perfectly. **Fix**: Use a "Dribble" mechanic where the player kicks the ball slightly ahead physics-wise, rather than parenting it.
3.  **Unfair Goalies**: Goalie reacts instantly. **Fix**: Add a "Reaction Time" delay and "Error Rate" based on shot speed/stats.
