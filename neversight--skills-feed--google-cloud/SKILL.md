# Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

## Core Capabilities

Provides expert guidance for Google Cloud Platform across all major services:

1. **Compute Services** - Compute Engine (VMs), Cloud Run, Cloud Functions, App Engine
2. **Container & Kubernetes** - Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Artifact Registry, Cloud Build
3. **Storage Services** - Cloud Storage (buckets), Persistent Disk, Filestore
4. **Database Services** - Cloud SQL, Cloud Spanner, Firestore, Bigtable, Memorystore
5. **Data & Analytics** - BigQuery, Dataflow, Dataproc, Pub/Sub, Composer
6. **Networking** - VPC, Cloud Load Balancing, Cloud CDN, Cloud Armor, Cloud Interconnect
7. **Security & IAM** - Identity and Access Management, Secret Manager, Cloud KMS, Security Command Center
8. **Infrastructure as Code** - Terraform Google provider, Deployment Manager, Config Connector

## Key Principles

## General Best Practices

- **Follow least privilege** - Use IAM roles with minimal required permissions
- **Enable monitoring** - Configure Cloud Monitoring and Logging for all services
- **Use managed services** - Prefer GKE Autopilot, Cloud SQL, Cloud Run over self-managed
- **Implement IaC** - Use Terraform or Deployment Manager for reproducible infrastructure
- **Tag resources** - Apply labels for cost allocation and organization
- **Design for HA** - Use regional resources and multi-zone deployments
- **Secure by default** - Enable encryption, use private IPs, configure VPC Service Controls
- **Optimize costs** - Use committed use discounts, autoscaling, and appropriate resource sizing

### Architecture Patterns

- **Multi-tier applications**: VPC + Cloud Load Balancer + GKE/Cloud Run + Cloud SQL
- **Data pipelines**: Pub/Sub → Dataflow → BigQuery with Cloud Storage staging
- **Serverless APIs**: Cloud Run + Cloud SQL + Secret Manager + Cloud Armor
- **Hybrid connectivity**: VPN or Cloud Interconnect + Shared VPC + Private Google Access

### When to Use What

- **Compute Engine**: Full VM control, Windows workloads, lift-and-shift migrations
- **GKE**: Containerized applications, microservices, Kubernetes workloads
- **Cloud Run**: Stateless HTTP services, event-driven processing, auto-scaling needs
- **Cloud Functions**: Event handlers, webhooks, simple integrations
- **Cloud SQL**: Relational databases with minimal management
- **Cloud Spanner**: Global distributed SQL, strong consistency across regions
- **BigQuery**: Data warehouse, analytics, large-scale SQL queries
- **Firestore**: Document database, real-time sync, mobile/web apps
