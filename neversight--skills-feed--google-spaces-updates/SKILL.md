# Google Spaces Updates

**Status**: Production Ready
**Last Updated**: 2026-01-09

Post updates to a team Google Chat Space via webhook.

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Setup (first time per project)

Run `/google-spaces-updates setup` or manually create `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "project": {
    "name": "my-project",
    "repo": "github.com/org/my-project"
  },
  "team": {
    "chat_webhook": "https://chat.googleapis.com/v1/spaces/SPACE_ID/messages?key=KEY&token=TOKEN",
    "members": ["Deepinder", "Joshua", "Raquel"]
  }
}
```

### 2. Post an update

```
"Post deployment update to team"
"Tell the team about the new feature"
"Ask the team about the auth approach"
```

---

## How It Works

### Step 1: Check for project settings

Look for `.claude/settings.json` in the current project directory:

```bash
cat .claude/settings.json 2>/dev/null || echo "NOT_FOUND"
```

If NOT_FOUND, ask the user:
> "This project doesn't have Google Spaces configured. Would you like me to set it up? I'll need the webhook URL for your team's Google Space."

Then create the file using the template in `templates/settings-template.json`.

### Step 2: Determine update type

Based on the command or context, determine the update type:

| Type | When to use |
|------|-------------|
| `deployment` | After pushing to production/staging, deploying to Vercel/etc |
| `bugfix` | After fixing a bug, especially one reported by team |
| `feature` | After completing a feature that's ready for review/use |
| `question` | When blocked or need team input on a decision |
| `custom` | For anything else |

### Step 3: Gather context

Collect relevant information to include:

```bash
# Recent commits (for context)
git log --oneline -3 2>/dev/null

# Current branch
git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null

# Changed files (if recent changes)
git diff --name-only HEAD~1 2>/dev/null | head -10
```

Also use context from the conversation:
- What was just completed
- Any preview/production URLs
- Relevant file paths
- Who might need to know

### Step 4: Format the message

Use the appropriate template from `templates/` directory.

**Key formatting rules for Google Chat:**
- Use `*bold*` for emphasis (not **markdown bold**)
- Use `_italic_` for secondary text
- Newlines work as expected
- Keep messages concise but informative
- Include actionable links when relevant

### Step 5: Post to webhook

```bash
curl -X POST "WEBHOOK_URL" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "MESSAGE_HERE"}'
```

Replace:
- `WEBHOOK_URL` with value from `.claude/settings.json` → `team.chat_webhook`
- `MESSAGE_HERE` with the formatted message (escape quotes properly)

### Step 6: Confirm to user

After posting, tell the user:
> "Posted update to team chat: [brief summary of what was posted]"

## Setup Command

When user runs `/google-spaces-updates setup`:

1. Ask for the Google Spaces webhook URL
2. Ask for project name (or detect from package.json/repo)
3. Ask for team members (optional)
4. Create `.claude/settings.json` using the template
5. Add `.claude/` to `.gitignore` if not already there
6. Confirm setup is complete

---

## Proactive Suggestions

Suggest posting an update when:
- User says "done", "finished", "completed" after significant work
- After a `git push` to main/master/production
- User mentions team members by name
- User seems blocked and might benefit from team input

Ask: "Would you like me to post an update to the team about this?"

---

## When NOT to Use

- Minor refactors, typo fixes
- WIP commits that aren't ready for review
- Internal debugging/testing
- Anything that would just be noise

---

## Getting a Webhook URL

1. Open Google Chat
2. Navigate to your Space
3. Click Space name → **Apps & integrations** → **Webhooks**
4. Click **Add webhook**
5. Name it (e.g., "Claude Code Updates")
6. Copy the webhook URL

The URL format: `https://chat.googleapis.com/v1/spaces/SPACE_ID/messages?key=KEY&token=TOKEN`

**Security**: Keep webhook URLs private. Add `.claude/settings.json` to `.gitignore`.
