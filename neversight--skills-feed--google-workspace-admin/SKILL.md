# Google Workspace Admin CLI (GAM7)

GAM7 is the standard CLI tool for Google Workspace administration. Before executing commands, ask clarifying questions to ensure standard approaches.

## Beginner Guidance Philosophy

**Always ask before acting:**
- "What's the business reason for this change?"
- "Is this a one-off or recurring need?"
- "Have you checked if this can be done in Admin Console instead?"
- "Should we test on a single user first?"

**Guide toward standard practices:**
- Bulk operations should use CSV files, not loops
- Changes to permissions should be audited
- User provisioning should follow established OU structure

## Installation

```bash
# Linux/macOS/Cloud Shell
bash <(curl -s -S -L https://git.io/gam-install) -l

# Verify
gam version
gam info domain
```

Setup requires: Google Workspace paid/Edu/Nonprofit edition, super admin access.

## Core Command Patterns

```bash
gam <action> <entity> [options]
gam <entity> <selector> <action> [options]
gam csv <file> gam <action> ~column_name
```

## User Management

```bash
# List all users
gam print users allfields todrive

# Create user
gam create user john.doe@domain.com firstname John lastname Doe password 'TempPass123!' changepassword on org /Staff

# Create from CSV (users.csv: email,firstname,lastname,password,org)
gam csv users.csv gam create user ~email firstname ~firstname lastname ~lastname password ~password org ~org changepassword on

# Update user
gam update user john.doe@domain.com suspended off

# Bulk suspend (suspended_users.csv: email)
gam csv suspended_users.csv gam update user ~email suspended on

# Delete user
gam delete user john.doe@domain.com

# Get user info
gam info user john.doe@domain.com

# Reset password
gam update user john.doe@domain.com password 'NewTemp123!' changepassword on
```

⚠️ **Before bulk user operations:** Always preview with `gam csv file.csv gam info user ~email` first.

## Group Management

```bash
# List groups
gam print groups allfields members todrive

# Create group
gam create group engineering@domain.com name "Engineering Team" description "Engineering department"

# Add members
gam update group engineering@domain.com add member user@domain.com
gam update group engineering@domain.com add owner manager@domain.com

# Bulk add (members.csv: group,email,role)
gam csv members.csv gam update group ~group add ~role ~email

# Remove member
gam update group engineering@domain.com delete member user@domain.com

# Group settings
gam update group engineering@domain.com who_can_join invited_can_join who_can_post_message all_members_can_post
```

## Organizational Units

```bash
# List OUs
gam print orgs allfields

# Create OU
gam create org "/Staff/Engineering" description "Engineering department"

# Move user to OU
gam update user john.doe@domain.com org "/Staff/Engineering"

# Bulk move (moves.csv: email,org)
gam csv moves.csv gam update user ~email org ~org
```

## Drive & Labels

```bash
# List user's files
gam user john.doe@domain.com print filelist todrive

# Find externally shared files
gam user john.doe@domain.com print filelist query "visibility='anyoneWithLink' or visibility='anyoneCanFind'" todrive

# Transfer ownership
gam user departing@domain.com transfer drive newowner@domain.com

# Shared drives
gam print shareddrives todrive
gam create shareddrive name "Project Alpha"
```

### Data Classification Labels

See [references/labels.md](references/labels.md) for full label management.

```bash
# List available labels
gam print drivelabels todrive

# Show label details
gam info drivelabel labels/<label_id>

# Apply label to file
gam user user@domain.com update drivefile id:<file_id> addlabel labels/<label_id> field.<field_id> selection <choice_id>

# Find files by label
gam user user@domain.com print filelist query "labels/<label_id>" todrive

# Bulk apply labels (files.csv: user,file_id,label_id,field_id,choice_id)
gam csv files.csv gam user ~user update drivefile id:~file_id addlabel labels/~label_id field.~field_id selection ~choice_id
```

⚠️ **Label creation must be done in Admin Console** (Security > Data classification > Label Manager). GAM can apply/query labels but not create them.

## Security & Audit

```bash
# 2-Step Verification status
gam print users fields primaryEmail,isEnrolledIn2Sv,isEnforcedIn2Sv todrive

# Find users without 2SV
gam print users query "isEnrolledIn2Sv=false" todrive

# Admin audit log
gam report admin start -30d todrive

# Login audit
gam report login start -7d todrive

# Drive activity
gam report drive start -7d todrive

# Token (OAuth app) audit
gam all users print tokens todrive
```

## Chrome & Devices

```bash
# List Chrome devices
gam print cros allfields todrive

# Disable device
gam update cros query:serial:ABC123 action disable

# Mobile devices
gam print mobile todrive

# Wipe mobile device
gam update mobile <resource_id> action admin_remote_wipe
```

## Gmail Settings

```bash
# Set vacation responder
gam user user@domain.com vacation on subject "Out of Office" message "I'm away until Monday"

# Set signature
gam user user@domain.com signature file signature.html

# Bulk signature (users.csv: email)
gam csv users.csv gam user ~email signature file signature.html

# Add delegate
gam user executive@domain.com delegate to assistant@domain.com

# List filters
gam user user@domain.com print filters
```

## Bulk Operations Pattern

**Always follow this pattern:**
1. Create CSV with required columns
2. Preview: `gam csv file.csv gam info user ~email`
3. Execute: `gam csv file.csv gam <actual command>`
4. Verify: Re-run info/print command

```bash
# CSV template for user creation
# users.csv:
# email,firstname,lastname,password,org,phone
# john.doe@domain.com,John,Doe,TempPass123!,/Staff,+1555123456

gam csv users.csv gam create user ~email firstname ~firstname lastname ~lastname password ~password org ~org phone ~phone changepassword on
```

## Troubleshooting

```bash
# Re-authenticate
gam oauth create

# Check service account
gam user admin@domain.com check serviceaccount

# Debug mode
gam config debug true <command>

# API quota errors: wait and retry, or request quota increase in GCP Console
```

## Security Best Practices

See [references/security.md](references/security.md) for comprehensive checklist.

**Critical settings to verify:**
1. MFA enforced for all users, especially admins
2. 2-5 super admins only (not 1, not >5)
3. Separate admin accounts from daily-use accounts
4. External sharing restricted or monitored
5. Less secure apps disabled
6. OAuth app whitelisting enabled
7. Alert center configured

**Questions to ask before any admin change:**
- "Is there an audit trail requirement?"
- "Who approved this change?"
- "Should we test in a sandbox OU first?"
- "What's the rollback plan?"
