# /groom

Orchestrate comprehensive backlog grooming. Create prioritized issues across all domains.

## Philosophy

**Orchestrator pattern.** /groom invokes skills, doesn't reimplement logic.

**Unix philosophy.** Small, focused skills that compose. Investigate ≠ Fix.

**No flags.** Always runs full audit. Always creates issues.

## What This Does

1. **Load or gather vision** — Check vision.md or ask about product direction
2. **Capture what's on your mind** — Bugs, UX friction, nitpicks from using the app
3. **Audit existing backlog** — Validate, reprioritize, close stale issues
4. **Run issue-creator skills** — Each domain gets audited, issues created
5. **Adaptive agent analysis** — Based on backlog size, run specialized agents
6. **Dedupe & consolidate** — Merge duplicates, finalize issue set
7. **Summarize** — Report P0/P1/P2/P3 counts and recommended focus

## Priority System

```
🔴 P0: CRITICAL PRODUCTION BUGS
   └─ Errors actively breaking production
   └─ Critical security vulnerabilities

🟠 P1: FUNDAMENTALS (Foundation)
   ├─ Testing (coverage, quality gates)
   ├─ Documentation (README, architecture)
   ├─ Quality gates (hooks, CI/CD)
   ├─ Observability (logging, error tracking)
   ├─ Product standards (version, attribution, contact)
   └─ Working prototype (not stubs)

🟡 P2: LAUNCH READINESS
   ├─ Compelling landing page
   ├─ Boutique onboarding
   ├─ Stripe monetization
   ├─ Viral growth infrastructure
   └─ Marketing readiness (demo video, brand profile, analytics, distribution prep)

**Marketing Readiness checks:**
- Demo video exists (30-60s screen recording)
- brand-profile.yaml configured
- PostHog events defined (signup, activation, [core_action])
- Distribution drafts prepared (Twitter, Reddit, HN)

🟢 P3+: EVERYTHING ELSE
   └─ Innovation, polish, strategic improvements

⚠️  SECURITY: Own severity scale
   Critical → P0, High → P1, Medium → P2, Low → P3
```

## Process

### Step 1: Load or Gather Vision

Vision should persist across sessions. Check for `vision.md` in project root:

```bash
[ -f "vision.md" ] && echo "Vision found" || echo "No vision.md"
```

**If vision.md exists:**
1. Read and display current vision
2. Ask: "Is this still accurate? Any updates?"
3. If updates provided, rewrite vision.md

**If vision.md doesn't exist:**
1. Ask open-ended question:
   ```
   What's your vision for this product? Where should it go?
   ```
2. Write response to `vision.md`

**vision.md format:**
```markdown
# Vision

## One-Liner
[Single sentence: what this product is and who it's for]

## North Star
[The dream state - what does success look like in 2 years?]

## Key Differentiators
[What makes this different from alternatives?]

## Target User
[Who specifically is this for? Be concrete.]

## Current Focus
[What's the immediate priority this quarter?]

---
*Last updated: YYYY-MM-DD*
*Updated during: /groom session*
```

Store content as `{vision}` for agent context throughout session.

**Why persist vision?**
- Vision shouldn't change dramatically between sessions
- Agents get consistent context
- Creates documentation artifact
- Enables other skills to reference it

### Step 2: Capture What's On Your Mind

Before structured analysis, ask:

```
Anything on your mind? Bugs you've noticed, UX friction, missing features,
nitpicks while using the app? These become issues alongside the automated findings.

(Skip if nothing comes to mind)
```

**What this captures:**
- Bugs encountered during manual testing
- UX friction points noticed while using the app
- Missing features that became obvious
- "Why doesn't this..." observations
- Quality-of-life improvements
- Things that annoyed you today

**For each item provided:**
1. Clarify if needed (one follow-up max)
2. Assign tentative priority based on description
3. Create as GitHub issue with `source: user-observation` tag
4. Include in final summary

**Why this step matters:**
- User has context automation doesn't (how it *feels* to use the app)
- Catches issues that slip through automated checks
- Captures the "I keep meaning to file this" backlog
- Makes groom feel collaborative, not just audit

**Format for user-submitted issues:**

```markdown
## Title
[P{0-3}] {user's description, cleaned up}

## Labels
- priority/p{n}
- domain/{best-fit}
- source/user-observation

## Body
### Problem
{user's observation}

### Context
Reported during /groom session

---
Created by `/groom` (user observation)
```

### Step 3: Audit Existing Backlog

**Critical:** Existing issues are not sacred. They may be stale, irrelevant, misprioritized, or duplicative. Every issue must be validated.

```bash
gh issue list --state open --limit 100 --json number,title,labels,body,createdAt,updatedAt
```

**For each existing issue, evaluate:**

1. **Still relevant?** Does this issue still matter given current vision and codebase state?
   - If NO → Close with explanation
   - If UNCERTAIN → Flag for user confirmation

2. **Priority correct?** Given current vision.md focus, is the priority right?
   - Re-prioritize if focus has shifted
   - P0 from 6 months ago may be P3 now

3. **Description accurate?** Does the issue still describe the actual problem?
   - Update if codebase has changed
   - Flesh out if too vague to act on

4. **Duplicate?** Is this covered by another issue or will be covered by new findings?
   - Consolidate into single issue
   - Close duplicate with link to canonical

5. **Actionable?** Can someone pick this up and know what to do?
   - Add concrete next steps if missing
   - Break down if too large

**Actions to take:**

```bash
# Close irrelevant issue
gh issue close 123 --comment "Closing: no longer relevant. [reason]"

# Update priority
gh issue edit 123 --remove-label "priority/p1" --add-label "priority/p3"

# Update description
gh issue edit 123 --body "Updated description..."

# Close as duplicate
gh issue close 123 --comment "Duplicate of #456"
```

**Output from this step:**
- List of issues kept (with any priority/description changes)
- List of issues closed (with reasons)
- List of issues to consolidate with new findings

This prevents backlog bloat and ensures the backlog reflects current reality.

### Step 4: Run Issue-Creator Skills

Invoke in sequence (each creates GitHub issues):

| Skill | Domain | Priority Range |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| `/log-production-issues` | Production health | P0-P3 |
| `/log-quality-issues` | Tests, CI/CD, hooks | P0-P3 |
| `/log-doc-issues` | Documentation | P0-P3 |
| `/log-observability-issues` | Monitoring, logging | P0-P3 |
| `/log-product-standards-issues` | Version, attribution, contact | P1 |
| `/log-stripe-issues` | Stripe payments | P0-P3 |
| `/log-bitcoin-issues` | Bitcoin on-chain | P0-P3 |
| `/log-lightning-issues` | Lightning Network | P0-P3 |
| `/log-virality-issues` | Sharing, referrals | P0-P3 |
| `/log-landing-issues` | Landing page | P0-P3 |
| `/log-onboarding-issues` | New user experience | P0-P3 |

**Why invoke skills, not reimplement?**
- Each skill has deep domain knowledge
- Consistent output format
- Can be run independently
- Easy to update without changing groom

### Step 5: Adaptive Agent Analysis

After issue creation, count by priority:

```bash
p0_count=$(gh issue list --label priority/p0 --state open --json number | jq length)
p1_count=$(gh issue list --label priority/p1 --state open --json number | jq length)
total=$((p0_count + p1_count))
```

**Heavy backlog (P0+P1 > 15):**
Run only core agents:
- `security-sentinel` — Security vulnerabilities
- `architecture-guardian` — Structural issues

**Medium backlog (P0+P1 = 5-15):**
Add creative agents:
- `aesthetician` — Visual excellence
- `pioneer` — Innovation opportunities
- `visionary` — Vision acceleration (receives `{vision}`)

**Light backlog (P0+P1 < 5):**
Full suite:
- `product-visionary` — Feature opportunities
- `user-experience-advocate` — UX improvements

Each agent receives `{vision}` context and creates additional issues.

### Step 6: Dedupe & Consolidate

**Three sources of duplicates:**
1. User observations (Step 2) may overlap with automated findings
2. New issues from Steps 4-5 that overlap with each other
3. New issues that overlap with existing issues kept from Step 3

**Find duplicates:**

```bash
# Find potential duplicates (similar titles)
gh issue list --state open --json number,title,labels | jq '.[] | .title' | sort | uniq -d

# Review issues flagged for consolidation in Step 3
# These were marked as "consolidate with new findings"
```

**For each duplicate set:**
- Keep the most comprehensive issue
- Close others with link to canonical: `gh issue close 123 --comment "Consolidated into #456"`
- Merge unique details from closed issues into the kept issue

**For issues to consolidate from Step 3:**
- If new findings cover the same ground → close old, reference new
- If new findings add to old → update old issue with new details
- If old issue is more comprehensive → close new, reference old

**Final pass:**
- Verify all open issues have correct priority labels
- Verify all open issues have domain labels
- Verify no orphaned issues (no priority, no domain)

### Step 7: Summarize

Output final report:

```
