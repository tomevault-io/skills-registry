# Headspace Skill

## Overview

## Quick Install

```bash
curl -sSL https://canifi.com/skills/headspace/install.sh | bash

```

## Setup

## Privacy & Authentication

**Your credentials, your choice.** Canifi LifeOS respects your privacy.

### Option 1: Manual Browser Login (Recommended)
If you prefer not to share credentials with Claude Code:

2. Login to the service manually in the Playwright-controlled Chrome window
