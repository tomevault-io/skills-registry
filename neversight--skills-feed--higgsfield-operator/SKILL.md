# Higgsfield Operator

Master guide for Higgsfield AI - the multi-model video generation platform with 70+ cinematic camera presets, 23+ VFX effects, and integration with Sora 2, Google Veo 3.1, WAN 2.5, Kling 2.6, and more. This skill covers everything from basic image-to-video generation to advanced production workflows.

## Platform Overview

Higgsfield aggregates 15+ premium AI video models under one platform:
- **OpenAI Sora 2 / Sora 2 Pro** - Text-to-video with multi-scene support
- **Google Veo 3.1** - UGC Builder for talking heads
- **WAN 2.5** - Audio-synced video with camera controls
- **Kling 2.6** - High-fidelity video generation
- **Nano Banana Pro** - Fast generation (unlimited on Ultimate+)

**Key Differentiator:** Unlike single-model tools, Higgsfield layers professional controls (camera simulation, character consistency, lip-sync) on top of best-in-class AI models.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Creating AI-generated video content (social, ads, content)
- Applying cinematic camera movements to static images
- Adding VFX without green screens or post-production
- Maintaining character consistency across multiple videos (Soul ID)
- Building talking-head videos with lip-sync
- Automating video generation via Python SDK
- Choosing between Higgsfield's integrated models

**Not recommended for:**
- Real-time video editing (use traditional NLEs)
- Video longer than 1 minute (current AI video limits)
- Precise frame-by-frame control (AI generates autonomously)

## Quick Reference

| Action | Method/Tool |
|--------|-------------|
| Image-to-Video | Upload image + select camera preset |
| Text-to-Video | Sora 2 or WAN 2.5 with text prompt |
| Character Consistency | Soul ID (upload 10+ reference photos) |
| Talking Head | UGC Builder (Veo 3.1) + Lipsync Studio |
| VFX Application | Select effect from 23+ presets |
| API Generation | Python SDK `higgsfield-client` |

**Goal:** Transform a static image into a cinematic video clip

**Steps:**
1. Upload high-quality source image (1024x1024+ recommended)
2. Select camera preset from 70+ options
3. Optionally stack up to 3 movements
4. Choose aspect ratio (16:9, 9:16, 1:1)
5. Generate and download

**Camera Preset Categories:**

| Category | Examples | Best For |
|----------|----------|----------|
| **Dolly** | Dolly In, Dolly Out, Dolly Zoom | Product reveals, emphasis |
| **Pan** | Whip Pan, Pan Left/Right | Scene transitions, reveals |
| **Tilt** | Tilt Up/Down, Dutch Tilt | Dramatic reveals, horror |
| **Tracking** | Tracking Shot, Follow Shot | Action, chase scenes |
| **Aerial** | FPV Drone, Crane Shot, Helicopter | Establishing shots |
| **Specialty** | Bullet Time, 360 Rotation, Crash Zoom | Action, stylized content |
| **Stabilized** | Static, Locked Frame | Dialogue, interviews |

**Pro Tip:** Stack movements for complex motion: Crane + Dolly Zoom + Rotation = Christopher Nolan vibes.

   - Consistent lighting preferred
2. System creates digital twin capturing:
   - Face shape and structure
   - Hair style and color
   - Expression patterns
   - Posture characteristics
3. Select from 50+ style presets (Amalfi Summer, Gorpcore Outdoor, 0.5 Selfie, etc.)
4. Generate videos with consistent character

**Example Prompt with Soul ID:**
```
A young woman walks through a busy Tokyo street at night,
neon lights reflecting off wet pavement.
[Soul ID: @my-character]
Camera: Tracking Shot
```

    }
)

print(f"Video URL: {result['output_url']}")
```

**Asynchronous Generation with Polling:**
```python
import higgsfield_client as hf

# Submit request
controller = hf.submit(
    arguments={
        "prompt": "A futuristic city at sunset, flying cars",
        "model": "sora_2",
        "duration": 5
    }
)

# Poll for status
for status in hf.poll_request_status(controller.request_id):
    if isinstance(status, hf.Queued):
        print(f"Queue position: {status.position}")
    elif isinstance(status, hf.InProgress):
        print(f"Progress: {status.progress}%")
    elif isinstance(status, hf.Completed):
        print(f"Done! URL: {status.output_url}")
        break
    elif isinstance(status, hf.Failed):
        print(f"Error: {status.error}")
        break
```

## Best Practices

### Image Quality
- Use 1024x1024 or higher resolution
- Avoid blurry or compressed images
- Good lighting in source = better output
- Centered subjects work best for most presets

### Prompt Engineering (Text-to-Video)
```
Good: "A golden retriever runs through autumn leaves
       in a forest, morning sunlight, slow motion"

Better: "A golden retriever runs joyfully through
        scattered autumn leaves in a sun-dappled forest,
        warm morning light filtering through trees,
        slow motion, cinematic depth of field,
        camera tracking shot"
```

### Soul ID Optimization
- Minimum 10 reference images
- Include full face, 3/4 angle, profile
- Vary expressions (smile, neutral, talking)
- Consistent lighting across images
- Avoid sunglasses, hats (unless character feature)

### VFX Integration
- Match effect intensity to content tone
- Preview before generating full video
- Layer camera movement AFTER effect selection
- Some effects work better on certain subject types

### API Efficiency
- Batch similar requests together
- Use webhooks for long generations
- Cache frequently-used image uploads
- Handle status polling with backoff

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Character looks different | Soul ID needs more references | Add 5+ more varied photos |
| Video is too short | Model/credit limitation | Upgrade plan or use longer model |
| VFX looks artificial | Low source quality | Use higher res source image |
| Generation failed | NSFW detection or model error | Rephrase prompt, change source |
| API timeout | Server load | Retry with exponential backoff |
| Queue position not moving | High demand | Check Higgsfield status page |

---

## Model Selection Guide

| Need | Recommended Model | Why |
|------|-------------------|-----|
| Fastest generation | Nano Banana | 5-10 seconds |
| Best quality | Sora 2 Pro | Highest fidelity |
| Talking heads | Veo 3.1 + UGC Builder | Best lip-sync |
| Audio sync | WAN 2.5 | Native audio support |
| Long form (8+ sec) | Sora 2 | Extended generation |
| Specific style | Kling 2.6 | Style consistency |
| Budget conscious | WAN 2.5 | Good quality/cost ratio |

## Integration Examples

### Node.js Wrapper (fetch-based)
```javascript
async function generateVideo(imageUrl, preset) {
  const response = await fetch('https://cloud.higgsfield.ai/api/generate', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.HF_KEY}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      image: imageUrl,
      camera_preset: preset,
      model: 'wan_2.5'
    })
  });
  return response.json();
}
```

### Next.js API Route
```typescript
// app/api/higgsfield/route.ts
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  const { imageUrl, preset } = await request.json()

  // Forward to Higgsfield API
  const result = await generateVideo(imageUrl, preset)

  return NextResponse.json(result)
}
```

### Webhook Handler
```typescript
// app/api/higgsfield-webhook/route.ts
export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  const event = await request.json()

  if (event.status === 'completed') {
    // Save video URL to database
    await db.videos.update({
      where: { requestId: event.request_id },
      data: {
        outputUrl: event.output_url,
        status: 'ready'
      }
    })
  }

  return NextResponse.json({ received: true })
}
```
