# Claude HUD Manual Testing

Verify core functionality works after code changes. Uses the project's reset script and debugging tools.

## When to Use

- After implementing significant features
- After fixing state detection bugs
- Before commits affecting session tracking
- When user asks to "test the app" or "verify it works"

## Testing Workflow

### 1. Full Reset

Reset to clean state to test first-run experience and verify nothing depends on stale data:

```bash
./scripts/dev/reset-for-testing.sh
```

This clears:
- App UserDefaults (layout, setup state)
- `~/.capacitor/` (sessions, locks, activity)
- Hook script and registrations
- Rebuilds app and launches it

### 2. First-Run Verification

After reset, verify the onboarding flow:

1. **Setup screen appears** - App should detect missing hooks
2. **Hook installation works** - Click install, verify success
3. **Empty project list** - No projects pinned yet

### 3. Core Functionality Checklist

Test each feature manually:

| Feature | How to Test | Expected |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Add project** | Click +, select a project folder | Project appears in list |
| **Session detection** | Start Claude in that project | State shows Ready/Working |
| **State transitions** | Type prompt, wait for response | Working → Ready transitions |
| **Lock detection** | Check `ls ~/.capacitor/sessions/` | Lock dir exists while Claude runs |
| **Session end** | Exit Claude session | State returns to Idle |

### 4. Debug Commands

If issues occur, check these:

```bash
# Watch hook events in real-time
tail -f ~/.capacitor/hud-hook-debug.log

# View current session states
cat ~/.capacitor/sessions.json | jq .

# Check active locks
ls -la ~/.capacitor/sessions/

# Check for process
ps aux | grep -E "(claude|hud-hook)"
```

### 5. Quick Restart (No Reset)

For iterative testing without full reset:

```bash
./scripts/dev/restart-app.sh
```

This rebuilds Rust + Swift and restarts the app, keeping state intact.

## Common Issues

### State stuck on Working/Waiting

Check if lock holder is alive:
```bash
cat ~/.capacitor/sessions/*.lock/pid | xargs -I {} ps -p {}
```

If PID is dead but lock exists, the cleanup should remove it on next app launch.

### Hook events not firing

Verify hooks are registered:
```bash
cat ~/.claude/settings.json | jq '.hooks'
```

Should show entries for SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, etc. pointing to `hud-state-tracker.sh`.

### UniFFI checksum mismatch

Regenerate bindings:
```bash
cargo build -p hud-core --release
cd core/hud-core && cargo run --bin uniffi-bindgen generate --library ../../target/release/libhud_core.dylib --language swift --out-dir ../../apps/swift/bindings/
cp ../../apps/swift/bindings/hud_core.swift ../../apps/swift/Sources/ClaudeHUD/Bridge/
rm -rf ../../apps/swift/.build
```

## Verification Summary

After testing, confirm:

- [ ] App launches without crash
- [ ] Hooks install successfully on first run
- [ ] Projects can be added/removed
- [ ] Session states reflect actual Claude activity
- [ ] States transition correctly (Idle → Ready → Working → Ready → Idle)
- [ ] No orphaned lock holders accumulate
