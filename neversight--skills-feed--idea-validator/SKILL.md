# Idea Validator

Critically evaluate ideas with honest feedback on market viability, technical feasibility, and actionable improvements.

## Setup

1. **Create project folder**: `YYYY_MM_DD_<short_snake_case_name>/`
2. **Create `idea.md`**: Document the idea and clarifications
3. **Create `validate.md`**: Document evaluation and recommendations

If no idea provided in `$ARGUMENTS`, ask user to describe their concept.

## Phase 1: Clarify the Idea

Ask user (via AskUserQuestion):
- What problem does this solve? Who has this pain?
- Who is your target user? Be specific.
- What makes this different from existing solutions?
- What does success look like in 6-12 months?

Update `idea.md` with responses.

## Phase 2: Gather Technical Context

Ask user:
- Preferred tech stack?
- Timeline and team size?
- Budget situation (bootstrapped/funded/side project)?
- Existing assets (code, designs, research)?

Update `idea.md` technical section.

## Phase 3: Critical Evaluation

Evaluate honestly and update `validate.md`:

**Market Analysis:**
- Similar existing products
- Market size and competition
- Unique differentiation

**Demand Assessment:**
- Evidence people will pay
- Problem urgency level

**Feasibility:**
- Can this ship in 2-4 weeks MVP?
- Minimum viable features
- Complex dependencies?

**Monetization:**
- Clear revenue path?
- Willingness to pay?

**Technical Risk:**
- Buildable with stated constraints?
- Key technical risks?

**Verdict:** `Build it` / `Maybe` / `Skip it`

**Ratings (1-10):**
- Creativity
- Feasibility
- Market Impact
- Technical Execution

## Phase 4: Improvements

Update `validate.md` with:

- **How to Strengthen**: Specific, actionable improvements
- **Enhanced Version**: Reworked, optimized concept
- **Implementation Roadmap**: Phased approach (if applicable)

## Tone

- **Brutally honest**: Don't sugarcoat fatal flaws
- **Constructive**: Every criticism includes a suggestion
- **Specific**: Concrete examples, not vague feedback
- **Balanced**: Acknowledge strengths alongside weaknesses

## Output Summary

After all phases:
1. Confirm folder/files created
2. State verdict and key ratings
3. Top 3 strengths, top 3 concerns
4. Single most important next step
