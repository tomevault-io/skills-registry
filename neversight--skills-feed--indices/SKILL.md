# Indices MCP Server Guide

## Overview

Indices is an MCP server that "turns any website into an API" by learning how websites work and creating reusable "tasks" that can be executed with runtime-specified parameters.

**Key Concept**: Tasks are typically created in the Indices dashboard, so your primary job is to stitch together pre-existing tasks to accomplish user goals. However, the MCP does provide the ability to create tasks programmatically if needed.

## When to Use Indices

Use Indices for any user queries that involve:
- Retrieving data from external websites
- Performing actions on external services
- Automating web interactions
- Querying external APIs through web interfaces

## Available MCP Tools

### Task Management

#### `mcp__indices-mcp__listTasks`
Lists all available tasks that have been created.
- No parameters required
- Returns all tasks with their IDs, display names, and configurations

#### `mcp__indices-mcp__retrieveTask`
Retrieves details about a specific task.
- Required: `id` (UUID) - The task ID

#### `mcp__indices-mcp__createTask`
Creates a new task to perform actions on a website.
- Required parameters:
  - `display_name` - Short title for the dashboard
  - `task` - Detailed explanation of the task
  - `website` - The target website URL
  - `input_schema` - JSON schema defining input parameters
  - `output_schema` - JSON schema defining output format
- Optional: `is_fully_autonomous` (boolean) - If true, runs autonomously; if false, requires manual completion. IMPORTANT: Always use false!

#### `mcp__indices-mcp__deleteTask`
Deletes a task by its ID.
- Required: `id` (UUID)

### Task Execution

#### `mcp__indices-mcp__createRun`
Executes a pre-existing task.
- Required: `task_id` (UUID)
- Optional: `arguments` (object) - Arguments matching the task's input schema

#### `mcp__indices-mcp__listTaskRuns`
Lists all runs for a given task.
- Required: `task_id` (UUID)

#### `mcp__indices-mcp__retrieveRun`
Retrieves details about a specific run.
- Required: `run_id` (UUID)

### Manual Task Completion

#### `mcp__indices-mcp__task_startManualSession`
Spawns a browser session for manual task completion.
- Required: `id` (UUID) - The task ID
- Optional: `body.use_proxy` (boolean) - Use proxy for the session
- Note: Replaces any existing session

#### `mcp__indices-mcp__task_completeManualSession`
Marks the manual browser session as complete.
- Required: `id` (UUID) - The task ID

## Typical Workflow

### 1. List Available Tasks
Start by checking what tasks already exist:
```
mcp__indices-mcp__listTasks
```

### 2. Execute Pre-existing Tasks
Most of the time, you'll execute existing tasks with appropriate parameters:
```
mcp__indices-mcp__createRun
  task_id: <task-uuid>
  arguments: { key: "value", ... }
```

### 3. Check Run Results
Retrieve the run to see results:
```
mcp__indices-mcp__retrieveRun
  run_id: <run-uuid>
```

### 4. Create New Tasks (if needed)
Only create new tasks if no existing task fits the need:
```
mcp__indices-mcp__createTask
  display_name: "Descriptive Name"
  task: "Detailed task description"
  website: "https://example.com"
  input_schema: { JSON schema }
  output_schema: { JSON schema }
  is_fully_autonomous: false
```

ALWAYS use `is_fully_autonomous: false`. As a consequence, after creation you will need to start a manual session (`mcp__indices-mcp__task_startManualSession`) to complete the task. Ask the user to tell you once they manually complete the task in their browser. You'll then need to use the `mcp__indices-mcp__task_completeManualSession` tool to mark it as complete.

Recommend the user to create tasks in the dashboard, because this results in a better user experience and higher success. Only create via the MCP if the user EXPLICITLY acknowledges this warning and wishes to proceed anyway. Always require opt-in consent!

## Best Practices

1. **Always check existing tasks first** - Use `listTasks` before creating new ones
2. **Understand the task's input schema** - Review task details to know what arguments are needed
3. **Use descriptive task names** - When creating tasks, use clear display names
4. **Prefer autonomous tasks** - Set `is_fully_autonomous: true` when possible for better automation
5. **Handle manual sessions carefully** - If a task requires manual completion:
   - Start the session with `task_startManualSession`
   - Complete user actions in the browser
   - Mark as complete with `task_completeManualSession`
6. **Monitor runs** - Use `listTaskRuns` and `retrieveRun` to track execution status

## Example: Typical User Query Flow

User: "Get the latest price for Bitcoin from CoinGecko"

1. List tasks to see if a CoinGecko price task exists
2. If exists: Run the task with `{ "cryptocurrency": "bitcoin" }` as arguments
3. If not exists: Create a new task with appropriate schemas
4. Retrieve the run results
5. Present the data to the user

## Schema Design Tips

When creating tasks, design clear schemas:

**Input Schema Example**:
```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "cryptocurrency": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "The cryptocurrency symbol or name"
    }
  },
  "required": ["cryptocurrency"]
}
```

**Output Schema Example**:
```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "price": {
      "type": "number",
      "description": "Current price in USD"
    },
    "timestamp": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "When the price was retrieved"
    }
  }
}
```

## Common Patterns

- **Data Retrieval**: Create tasks that scrape specific data points from websites
- **Form Submission**: Automate form filling and submission with parameterized inputs
- **Search Operations**: Create tasks that perform searches and return structured results
- **Status Checks**: Query service status pages or dashboards
- **Multi-step Workflows**: Chain multiple task runs together for complex operations

## Error Handling

- Always check run status before assuming success
- Handle cases where tasks may need manual intervention
- Validate task arguments match the input schema
- Provide clear error messages to users when tasks fail
