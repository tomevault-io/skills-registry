# InfraNodus Orchestrator

## Overview

The InfraNodus Orchestrator is a meta-cognitive skill that intelligently coordinates cloud-based graph analytics (via InfraNodus MCP tools) with local knowledge management skills to enable sophisticated research, content analysis, and knowledge discovery workflows. It bridges the gap between powerful cloud-based text network analysis and local knowledge preservation through adaptive workflow routing.

**Core Philosophy**: InfraNodus provides world-class graph analytics and gap detection in the cloud, while local skills (hierarchical-reasoning, knowledge-graph, obsidian-markdown) handle strategic planning, local storage, and documentation. The orchestrator seamlessly integrates both worlds.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when tasks involve:

- **Knowledge graph generation** from text with topical clustering and gap analysis
- **Research question generation** based on structural gaps in discourse
- **Content gap analysis** to identify missing connections and underexplored topics
- **SEO optimization** through search demand-supply gap analysis
- **Comparative text analysis** finding overlaps and differences between documents
- **Google search intelligence** analyzing search results and related queries
- **Topic development** with latent topic identification and conceptual bridge building
- **Iterative research workflows** requiring strategic planning + analytics + documentation

**Trigger Keywords**: knowledge graph, content gaps, research questions, topical clusters, InfraNodus, gap analysis, SEO optimization, comparative analysis, search intelligence, topic development

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Adaptive Workflow Routing

Automatically analyzes user requests to select the optimal workflow pattern based on task complexity, content type, and analytical requirements.

**Routing Decision Framework:**

```yaml
Simple Graph Generation (confidence 0.90+):
  - Single text input, basic analysis request
  - Direct: mcp__infranodus__generate_knowledge_graph

Deep Research & Gap Analysis (confidence 0.85+):
  - Complex analysis requiring gaps + research questions
  - Workflow Pattern 1 (see below)

SEO Content Optimization (confidence 0.85+):
  - Contains SEO/optimization keywords
  - Workflow Pattern 2 (see below)

Comparative Text Analysis (confidence 0.80+):
  - Multiple texts requiring comparison
  - Workflow Pattern 3 (see below)

Iterative Topic Development (confidence 0.75+):
  - Requires topic refinement and development
  - Workflow Pattern 4 (see below)

Google Search Intelligence (confidence 0.85+):
  - Search analysis keywords present
  - Workflow Pattern 5 (see below)
```

**Confidence Calculation Factors:**
- Keyword presence and frequency (30%)
- Task complexity assessment (25%)
- Artifact type requirements (20%)
- Integration needs (15%)
- User history patterns (10%)

### 3. Integration with Existing Skills

The orchestrator seamlessly integrates with four existing skills:

#### knowledge-orchestrator Integration

The InfraNodus orchestrator operates as a **specialized meta-layer** above the knowledge-orchestrator:

**Delegation Pattern**:
```yaml
InfraNodus-specific tasks:
  - InfraNodus orchestrator handles directly
  - Uses InfraNodus MCP tools + coordinates with other skills

Standard knowledge management:
  - Delegate to knowledge-orchestrator
  - Let knowledge-orchestrator route to obsidian-markdown, knowledge-graph, etc.

Mixed workflows:
  - InfraNodus orchestrator coordinates high-level workflow
  - Delegates specific sub-tasks to knowledge-orchestrator
```

**Example Decision Logic**:
```
User: "Create a comprehensive note about AI with entity relationships"
→ knowledge-orchestrator handles (standard knowledge base construction)

User: "Analyze this text for content gaps and generate research questions"
→ InfraNodus orchestrator handles (InfraNodus-specific gap analysis)

User: "Analyze gaps in my AI notes and create refined documentation"
→ InfraNodus orchestrator coordinates InfraNodus analysis
→ Delegates documentation to knowledge-orchestrator
```

#### hierarchical-reasoning Integration

**Role**: Strategic planning and decomposition BEFORE cloud-based analysis

**Integration Points**:
- **Pre-analysis**: Decompose complex topics before InfraNodus processing
- **Post-analysis**: Validate InfraNodus insights and synthesize recommendations
- **Quality control**: Assess coherence and completeness of extracted knowledge

**Example Usage**:
```yaml
Pattern 1 Step 1:
  skill: hierarchical-reasoning
  input: "Analyze distributed systems architecture"
  output:
    strategic: "Core themes: consistency, availability, partition tolerance"
    tactical: "Sub-topics: consensus algorithms, replication, data partitioning"
    operational: "Specific concepts to extract: Paxos, Raft, CAP theorem"

  → This output guides InfraNodus analysis in Step 2
```

#### knowledge-graph Integration

**Role**: Local preservation of InfraNodus cloud analytics

**Integration Points**:
- **Format conversion**: InfraNodus graph → local JSON graph format
- **Provenance tracking**: Add source attribution and timestamps
- **Confidence scoring**: Map InfraNodus metrics to local confidence scores
- **Storage**: Persist graphs locally for long-term knowledge management

**Transformation Mapping**:
```yaml
InfraNodus Output → Local Knowledge Graph:

  nodes (concepts):
    - Extract from InfraNodus topical clusters
    - Create entity objects with:
      id: normalized_concept_name
      type: "Concept" or domain-specific type
      name: concept label
      confidence: derived from InfraNodus centrality
      provenance:
        source: "InfraNodus"
        graph_name: original_graph_identifier
        extraction_date: ISO timestamp
      properties:
        cluster: topical_cluster_membership
        centrality: node importance score

  edges (relationships):
    - Extract from InfraNodus co-occurrence connections
    - Create relationship objects with:
      source: entity_id_1
      target: entity_id_2
      type: "RELATED_TO" or "CO_OCCURS_WITH"
      confidence: derived from edge weight
      properties:
        weight: co-occurrence strength
        context: semantic relationship type
```

#### obsidian-markdown Integration

**Role**: Documentation and knowledge preservation

**Integration Points**:
- **Research documentation**: Create MOCs from research questions and gaps
- **SEO strategy docs**: Format SEO reports as actionable strategy notes
- **Comparison reports**: Visualize comparative analysis with Mermaid diagrams
- **Topic development**: Document iterative refinement process

**Template Usage**:
```yaml
research-moc-template:
  frontmatter:
    tags: [research, knowledge-graph, infranodus]
    clusters: ${topical_clusters}
    gaps: ${identified_gaps}
    date: ${timestamp}

### 5. Workflow Decision Logic

The orchestrator uses sophisticated decision logic to select workflows:

#### Task Feature Extraction

```yaml
Extract from user request:

  content_type:
    - single_text: One document/passage
    - multiple_texts: 2+ documents for comparison
    - search_queries: Google search terms
    - existing_graph: Reference to saved InfraNodus graph

  analysis_requirements:
    - basic_graph: Simple graph generation
    - gap_detection: Identify content gaps
    - research_questions: Generate investigation prompts
    - seo_optimization: Search optimization needs
    - topic_development: Expand/refine topics
    - comparative_analysis: Compare multiple texts

  complexity_score: 0.0-1.0
    factors:
      - Number of analysis steps required (0-0.3)
      - Integration needs across skills (0-0.3)
      - Strategic planning requirements (0-0.2)
      - Documentation complexity (0-0.2)

  keyword_signals:
    infranodus_specific: ["InfraNodus", "topical cluster", "content gap", "research question"]
    seo_keywords: ["SEO", "optimize", "search", "ranking", "keywords"]
    comparison_keywords: ["compare", "difference", "overlap", "similarity"]
    development_keywords: ["develop", "refine", "expand", "iterate"]
    search_keywords: ["Google", "search results", "queries", "SERP"]
```

#### Confidence Calculation

```yaml
Calculate confidence for each pattern:

  pattern_score = (
    keyword_match_score * 0.30 +
    complexity_alignment * 0.25 +
    artifact_type_match * 0.20 +
    integration_needs_match * 0.15 +
    user_history_factor * 0.10
  )

  Execute if pattern_score >= threshold:
    0.90+: Execute immediately (high confidence)
    0.70-0.89: Execute with explanation
    0.50-0.69: Present options to user
    < 0.50: Ask for clarification
```

#### Multi-Pattern Detection

```yaml
If multiple patterns score >= 0.70:

  check_workflow_composition:
    - Pattern 1 + Pattern 4: Research → Topic Development
    - Pattern 2 + Pattern 5: SEO → Search Intelligence
    - Pattern 3 + Pattern 1: Comparison → Deep Analysis

  if composition_makes_sense:
    execute_composed_workflow()
  else:
    select_highest_confidence_pattern()
```

### 6. Best Practices

#### Parameter Optimization

**modifyAnalyzedText Selection**:
```yaml
"detectEntities":
  - Use for cleaner graph structures
  - Better entity recognition
  - Recommended for most workflows

"extractEntitiesOnly":
  - Use for ontology creation
  - Pure entity extraction
  - Specialized use cases

"none":
  - Default processing
  - Preserves all word-level detail
```

**includeStatements Usage**:
```yaml
false (recommended):
  - Reduces response size
  - Faster processing
  - Use when source attribution not critical

true:
  - Includes original text excerpts
  - Enables provenance tracking
  - Use for academic/research work requiring citations
```

**Model Selection** (for AI-enhanced tools):
```yaml
"gpt-4o":
  - Highest quality analysis
  - Best for critical research questions
  - Use for strategic work

"gpt-4o-mini":
  - Faster processing
  - Good for iterative workflows
  - Cost-effective for exploration
```

#### Tool Chaining Strategy

**Optimal Chains**:
```yaml
Research Workflow:
  generate_knowledge_graph →
  generate_content_gaps →
  generate_research_questions

SEO Workflow:
  generate_topical_clusters →
  generate_seo_report →
  search_queries_vs_search_results

Topic Development:
  generate_knowledge_graph →
  develop_latent_topics →
  develop_conceptual_bridges
```

**Avoid Anti-Patterns**:
- ❌ Running gap detection without prior graph generation
- ❌ Using seo_report without topical cluster analysis
- ❌ Comparing texts without entity detection enabled
- ❌ Creating research questions from graphs without gap analysis

#### Progress Tracking

Long-running tools (seo_report, develop_text_tool) emit progress notifications:

```yaml

### 7. Error Handling & Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues

**Issue**: InfraNodus quota exhausted
```yaml
Error: API quota exceeded
Solution:
  - First 70 requests are quota-free
  - After exhaustion, requires API credentials
  - For Smithery integration, credentials auto-managed
  - For local deployment, configure INFRANODUS_API_KEY
```

**Issue**: Graph generation fails with large texts
```yaml
Error: Text too large or timeout
Solution:
  1. Use hierarchical-reasoning to chunk strategically
  2. Process in segments
  3. Merge resulting graphs using knowledge-graph skill
  4. Alternative: Use graph creation for persistent storage
```

**Issue**: Low-quality topical clusters
```yaml
Symptom: Weak or unclear clusters
Solution:
  1. Enable detectEntities parameter
  2. Ensure text has sufficient length (>500 words recommended)
  3. Check text coherence and topic focus
  4. Consider pre-processing with hierarchical decomposition
```

**Issue**: Research questions too broad/narrow
```yaml
Symptom: Questions don't match needed depth
Solution:
  1. Adjust gapDepth parameter (0 = primary, 1+ = deeper)
  2. Use useSeveralGaps for multiple question sets
  3. Switch to generate_research_ideas for broader ideation
  4. Try extendedIdeationMode in develop_text_tool
```

## Integration with Knowledge-Orchestrator

The InfraNodus orchestrator and knowledge-orchestrator work in tandem:

**Decision Hierarchy**:
```yaml
User Request
  ↓
knowledge-orchestrator (evaluates first)
  ↓
  ├─ InfraNodus-specific? → Delegate to infranodus-orchestrator
  │   ↓
  │   infranodus-orchestrator:
  │     - Execute InfraNodus workflow
  │     - May call back to knowledge-orchestrator for sub-tasks
  │     - Coordinates: hierarchical-reasoning, knowledge-graph, obsidian-markdown
  │
  └─ Standard knowledge management? → knowledge-orchestrator handles
      ↓
      Routes to: obsidian-markdown, knowledge-graph, hierarchical-reasoning
```

**Example Delegation**:
```yaml
Request: "Create a note about AI with entity relationships"
  → knowledge-orchestrator: Standard knowledge base task
  → Routes to: obsidian-markdown + knowledge-graph
  → Result: Obsidian note with local knowledge graph

Request: "Analyze AI content for gaps and generate research questions"
  → knowledge-orchestrator: Detects InfraNodus requirement
  → Delegates to: infranodus-orchestrator
  → infranodus-orchestrator: Executes Pattern 1
  → Calls back for: obsidian documentation (via knowledge-orchestrator)
  → Result: InfraNodus gap analysis + research questions + Obsidian docs
```
