---

## Data Location

All data stored in `initiatives/` directory:
```
initiatives/
├── _schema/schema-v1.md      # Schema definition
├── _index/jira-mapping.md    # Jira ID lookup
├── initiatives/*.md          # Initiative files
├── epics/*.md               # Epic files
├── people/*.md              # Person files
├── teams/*.md               # Team files
├── partners/*.md            # Partner files
└── product-areas/*.md       # Product area files
```

## File Format

All entities use YAML frontmatter + markdown body + history log:

```yaml
---
id: customer-onboarding
title: Customer Onboarding Simplification
status: Draft
completeness: 45
created_at: 2026-01-21T10:00:00+01:00
updated_at: 2026-01-21T10:00:00+01:00
---

# Customer Onboarding Simplification

## Expected Outcome
(content here)

## History
H-a1b2c3 | 2026-01-21T10:00:00+01:00 | created | | | | user | Initial creation
```

## Wikilinks

Reference other entities with `[[path/id]]` syntax:
- People: `[[people/anna-andersson]]`
- Teams: `[[teams/platform-team]]`
- Partners: `[[partners/partner-alpha]]`
- ProductAreas: `[[product-areas/customer-management]]`
- Epics: `[[epics/qr-scanner]]`

## Completeness Calculation

Auto-calculated percentage based on filled **recommended** fields:
- 90-100%: Complete
- 70-89%: Mostly complete
- 50-69%: Partially complete
- 0-49%: Incomplete

Display format: `92% ████████░░`

## Status Workflow

### Initiative Status
`Draft` → `Defined` → `Planned` → `In Progress` → `Finished` or `Abandoned`

Each transition has required fields - see [status-transitions.md](references/status-transitions.md).

### Epic Status
`Not Started` → `In Progress` → `Done` or `Abandoned`

## History Tracking

Every change creates a history entry:
```
ID | TIMESTAMP | ACTION | FIELD | OLD_VALUE | NEW_VALUE | ACTOR | NOTE
```

History ID format: `H-xxxxxx` (6 alphanumeric characters)

Actions: `created`, `field_updated`, `status_changed`, `stakeholder_added`, etc.

## Implementation Instructions

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
- This skill MUST persist all data to disk using the Python scripts
- Never simulate operations - always write actual files
- Always build and use the index for queries
- Always get user approval before writing data

### Skill Initialization

**ALWAYS do this when the skill is first invoked:**

1. Build/load the search index for fast querying:
   ```bash
   python .claude/skills/initiative-tracker/scripts/build_index.py
   ```

2. Read the index into memory:
   ```bash
   Read tool: initiatives/_index/index.json
   ```

3. Parse and store the index JSON in memory for the session

This enables instant queries even with hundreds of entities.

---

### Approval Workflow

**⚠️ CRITICAL: User Approval Required**

BEFORE writing any data to disk, you MUST:

1. **Show a preview** of what will be written:
   - Display the complete file content (frontmatter + body + history)
   - Show the file path where it will be saved
   - Show the completeness percentage

2. **Ask for user approval** using one of these methods:
   - Use AskUserQuestion tool with options: "Approve", "Modify", "Cancel"
   - Wait for explicit user confirmation

3. **Only proceed** if user approves:
   - If "Approve": Write the file as shown
   - If "Modify": Ask what changes are needed, update preview, ask again
   - If "Cancel": Abort the operation, don't write anything

4. **After writing**: Confirm success and show the actual file path created

**This applies to ALL commands that write data**: `/create_initiative`, `/update_initiative`, `/create_epic`, `/create_person`, `/create_team`, `/create_partner`

---

### Path Conventions

- Python scripts are in: `.claude/skills/initiative-tracker/scripts/`
- Data files are in: `initiatives/` (at project root)
- Always use relative paths from project root
- Use forward slashes in paths for cross-platform compatibility

---

### Index System for Fast Querying

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Performance Requirement**

For performance at scale, this skill uses an in-memory index for fast queries.

#### Index Location

The index is stored at: `initiatives/_index/index.json`

It contains metadata for all entities (initiatives, epics, people, teams, partners, product areas) extracted from their markdown files.

#### Build/Rebuild the Index

**At skill startup, ALWAYS build/load the index:**

1. Build the index from all markdown files:
   ```bash
   python .claude/skills/initiative-tracker/scripts/build_index.py
   ```
   This creates/updates `initiatives/_index/index.json`

2. Load the index into memory using Read tool:
   ```bash
   Read tool: initiatives/_index/index.json
   ```

3. Parse the JSON and keep it in memory for the session

**Rebuild the index AFTER every write operation:**
- After creating/updating initiatives, epics, people, teams, partners, or product areas
- Run the build_index.py script again
- Reload the updated index

#### Using the Index for Queries

**ALWAYS prefer index-based queries over file globbing/reading:**

**For /list_initiatives:**
- Use the index instead of globbing files
- Filter initiatives array by status/completeness in memory
- Much faster, especially with 100+ initiatives

**For /list_epics:**
- Use the epics array from index
- Filter by initiative_id or status in memory

**For searches:**
- Find all initiatives where a person is initiator: filter index by initiator field
- Find all initiatives with a specific stakeholder: filter by stakeholders array
- Find all epics for an initiative: filter epics by initiative_id
- Find all open actions assigned to a person: filter initiatives by actions array
- Find initiatives with overdue actions: filter by actions with due_date < today
- Find initiatives with >3 open questions: filter by open_question_count > 3

**Action queries (using index):**
```python
# Example: Get all my open actions
my_actions = []
for initiative in index['initiatives']:
    for action in initiative.get('actions', []):
        if action.get('assigned_to') == 'my-id' and action['status'] == 'Open':
            my_actions.append({
                'initiative': initiative['id'],
                'action_id': action['id'],
                'description': action['description'],
                'due_date': action.get('due_date'),
            })
```

**When to read actual files:**
- `/show_initiative` - need full body content and history
- `/update_initiative` - need to modify and write back
- `/add_action`, `/complete_action` - need to modify body sections
- Any operation requiring full markdown content or full action descriptions

#### Index Structure

**IMPORTANT**: The index contains ONLY small metadata fields, NOT large text content.

**Indexed fields (small)**:
- IDs, titles, status, completeness, jira_id
- References (initiator, stakeholders, team members as ID lists)
- Small metadata (timestamps, affected_systems, planned_quarter)
- Flags (deleted)
- **Embedded actions** (id, description, status, assigned_to, due_date)
- **Embedded questions** (id, status)
- Counts (action_count, open_action_count, open_question_count)

**NOT indexed (large text)**:
- expected_outcome, outcome_validation (initiatives)
- description, acceptance_criteria (epics)
- notes (all entities)
- Body content, history entries
- Full question text, answers
- Solution details, pros/cons

This keeps the index small (<100KB even with 500+ entities) for fast loading.

}
```

#### Performance Benefits

- Listing 500 epics: ~1ms (index) vs ~5 seconds (file globbing)
- Complex searches: Instant (filter in memory) vs very slow (scan all files)
- Finding relationships: Fast array operations vs nested file reads

### Command: /create_initiative <id> <title> [jira_id]

**Step 1: Prepare the initiative**

1. Generate history ID:
   ```bash
   python .claude/skills/initiative-tracker/scripts/generate_history_id.py
   ```

   (Describe what success looks like for this initiative)

   ## Outcome Validation

   (How will we measure/verify the outcome was achieved?)

   ## Intended Users

   (Who benefits from this initiative?)

   ## Solutions

   (Proposed approaches - add solutions as subsections)

   ## Actions

   (Action items - use checkbox format)

   ## Open Questions

   (Unresolved questions - use checkbox format)
   ```

**Step 2: Show preview and get approval**

5. Display the complete file preview to user:
   ```
   📄 Preview: initiatives/initiatives/<id>.md
   Completeness: 0% (Draft status)

   ---
   [Show complete YAML frontmatter]

1. Read the initiative file using Read tool: `initiatives/initiatives/<id>.md`
2. Parse YAML frontmatter and body content
3. Identify the change:
   - If field is in frontmatter: update frontmatter
   - If field is in body (expected_outcome, outcome_validation): update markdown section
4. Generate new history ID:
   ```bash
   python .claude/skills/initiative-tracker/scripts/generate_history_id.py
   ```
5. Create history entry with old/new values
6. Update `updated_at` timestamp to current time
7. Recalculate completeness using the completeness script

**Step 2: Show preview of changes**

8. Display a diff preview to user:
   ```
   📄 Updating: initiatives/initiatives/<id>.md

   CHANGES:
   - <field>: "<old_value>" → "<new_value>"
   - updated_at: "<old_timestamp>" → "<new_timestamp>"
   - completeness: <old_%> → <new_%>

   NEW HISTORY ENTRY:
   <history_id> | <timestamp> | field_updated | <field> | <old> | <new> | <actor> | <note>

   [Optionally show full file preview if major change]
   ```

9. Ask for user approval using AskUserQuestion:
   - Options: "Approve changes", "Modify", "Cancel"

**Step 3: Write if approved**

10. If approved, write complete updated file using Write tool to `initiatives/initiatives/<id>.md`
11. Confirm update by reading file back
12. **Rebuild the index** to reflect the changes:
    ```bash
    python .claude/skills/initiative-tracker/scripts/build_index.py
    ```
13. **Reload the index** into memory
14. Report success: "✓ Updated <field> in <id> (completeness: <new_%>)"

### Command: /list_initiatives [--status=X] [--completeness<N] [--product-area=X]

**Use the index for fast querying** (see Index System section above)

1. Ensure index is loaded in memory (if not, load it from `initiatives/_index/index.json`)
2. Filter the `initiatives` array from index:
   - If `--status=X` provided: filter where `status === X`
   - If `--completeness<N` provided: filter where `completeness < N`
   - If `--product-area=X` provided: filter where `product_area` contains `X`
3. Format as table:
   ```
   | ID | Title | Status | Product Area | Completeness |
   |---|---|---|---|---|
   | <id> | <title> | <status> | <product_area> | <completeness>% <bar> |
   ```
   Where <bar> is a visual bar like `████████░░` (10 characters, filled proportional to percentage).
4. Display table to user with total count.

**Performance**: This is instant even with 100+ initiatives (no file I/O required).

---

### Command: /show_initiative <id|jira_id>

1. If jira_id provided, read `initiatives/_index/jira-mapping.md` to map to id.

3. Parse frontmatter, body, and history.
4. Display formatted output:
   - Title and basic info
   - All frontmatter fields
   - Body content sections
   - History entries (last 5)
   - Completeness percentage with bar

---

### Command: /what_missing <id>

1. Read initiative file: `initiatives/initiatives/<id>.md`
2. Parse frontmatter.
3. Call: `python scripts/calculate_completeness.py initiative '<json_frontmatter>'`
4. Check which recommended fields are empty:
   - intended_users
   - stakeholders
   - source_document
   - affected_systems
5. Check required fields for current status (see references/status-transitions.md).
6. Display missing fields grouped by category:
   - Missing required fields (blocks status transition)
   - Missing recommended fields (reduces completeness)

---

### Command: /init_repository

1. Run Python script from project root:
   ```bash
   python .claude/skills/initiative-tracker/scripts/init_repository.py
   ```
2. This creates the directory structure in `initiatives/` at project root.
3. Confirm directories exist using Glob or Bash ls.
4. Report success to user.

---

### Command: /create_epic <id> <title> <initiative_id> [jira_id]

   ```
2. Build JSON frontmatter:
   ```json
   {
     "id": "<id>",
     "title": "<title>",
     "initiative_id": "<initiative_id>",
     "status": "Not Started",
     "jira_id": "<jira_id or empty>",

   ```markdown
   # <title>

   ## Description

   (What this epic delivers)

   ## Acceptance Criteria

   - [ ] Criterion 1
   - [ ] Criterion 2
   ```
4. Call write_entity.py to create `initiatives/epics/<id>.md`:
   ```bash
   python .claude/skills/initiative-tracker/scripts/write_entity.py "initiatives/epics/<id>.md" "epic" '<json>' '<body>'
   ```
5. Update parent initiative to add epic wikilink reference: `[[epics/<id>]]`
6. Report success.

2. Filter initiatives and extract actions:
   ```python
   results = []
   for initiative in index['initiatives']:
       for action in initiative.get('actions', []):
           # Apply filters
           if initiative_filter and initiative['id'] != initiative_filter:

## Planning and Query Commands

These commands provide high-level views and queries across initiatives, epics, and actions.

---

### Command: /prepare_meeting <person_id|partner_id>

Prepare context for a meeting with a person or partner. Uses index for instant results.

**Implementation:**

1. Identify entity type (person or partner) from ID
2. Query index for all initiatives where this entity is involved:
   ```python
   relevant_initiatives = []
   for initiative in index['initiatives']:
       # Check if person/partner is involved
       if entity_id in initiative.get('initiator', []):
           relevant_initiatives.append(initiative)
       elif entity_id in initiative.get('stakeholders', []):
           relevant_initiatives.append(initiative)
       elif entity_id in initiative.get('intended_users', []):
           relevant_initiatives.append(initiative)

       # Also check if assigned to any actions
       for action in initiative.get('actions', []):
           if action.get('assigned_to') == entity_id:
               relevant_initiatives.append(initiative)
               break
   ```

3. For each initiative, extract:
   - Current status and completeness
   - Recent changes (last 7 days from updated_at)
   - Open questions
   - Actions assigned to this person
   - Incomplete recommended fields

4. Format output:
   ```
   📋 Meeting Preparation: <Name>
   Role: <role> at <organization>

   INITIATIVES (<count>)

   1. <title> (Status: <status>, <completeness>%)
      - Your role: <Initiator|Stakeholder|Intended User>
      - Last updated: <days> ago
      - Open actions assigned to you: <count>
      - Open questions: <count>
      - ⚠️ Missing: <list if completeness < 80%>

   ACTIONS ASSIGNED (<count>)
   - ACT-001 in <initiative>: <description> (Due: <date>)
   - ACT-002 in <initiative>: <description> (⚠️ Overdue)

   OPEN QUESTIONS TO DISCUSS
   - Q-001 in <initiative>: <first 50 chars>...

   TALKING POINTS
   - <initiative> needs stakeholder input on <field>
   - <initiative> has 3 open questions
   ```

5. **Performance**: Instant (all data from index)

**Example:**
```
/prepare_meeting anna-andersson
```

           if action.get('assigned_to') == person_id and action['status'] == 'Open':
               my_actions.append({
                   'initiative': initiative,
                   'action': action,
               })
