# /intelligems-core

Shared library that powers all Intelligems Analytics skills. Sets up your workspace with the API client, metric helpers, and configuration.

**You rarely need to run this directly** — other skills (like `/test-verdict`) automatically check for the workspace and set it up if needed.

---

## What's Included

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `ig_client.py` | API client with automatic retry and rate-limit handling |
| `ig_metrics.py` | Extract values, uplift, confidence, and CI bounds from API responses |
| `ig_helpers.py` | Formatting, runtime calculation, variation lookup |
| `ig_config.py` | Shared thresholds (80% confidence, 10-day minimum, etc.) |
| `ig_slack.py` | Slack Block Kit formatting and webhook delivery |
| `setup_workspace.sh` | Creates `~/intelligems-analytics/` with venv and dependencies |
| `setup_automation.sh` | Creates macOS LaunchAgent for scheduled Slack delivery |

## Step 1: Get API Key

Ask the user for their Intelligems API key.

> "What's your Intelligems API key? You can get one by contacting support@intelligems.io"

**Never hardcode or assume an API key.**

---

## Step 2: Set Up Workspace

Run the setup script to create the workspace:

```bash
bash setup_workspace.sh
```

This creates:
- `~/intelligems-analytics/` — working directory
- `~/intelligems-analytics/venv/` — Python virtual environment
- `~/intelligems-analytics/.env` — API key configuration

Then save the user's API key:

```bash
echo "INTELLIGEMS_API_KEY=<user's key>" > ~/intelligems-analytics/.env
```

---

## Step 3: Copy Core Libraries

Copy all files from `references/` into the workspace:

```bash
cp references/ig_client.py ~/intelligems-analytics/
cp references/ig_metrics.py ~/intelligems-analytics/
cp references/ig_helpers.py ~/intelligems-analytics/
cp references/ig_config.py ~/intelligems-analytics/
```

---

## Step 4: Verify

Activate the environment and verify the client works:

```bash
source ~/intelligems-analytics/venv/bin/activate
python3 -c "
from ig_client import IntelligemsAPI
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os
load_dotenv()
api = IntelligemsAPI(os.getenv('INTELLIGEMS_API_KEY'))
tests = api.get_active_experiments()
print(f'Connected. Found {len(tests)} active experiment(s).')
"
```

If successful, the workspace is ready for any Intelligems Analytics skill.
