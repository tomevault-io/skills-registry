# iOS App Icon Generator

Create beautiful, production-ready iOS app icons through a two-phase creative process.

## Phase 1: Visual Philosophy

Before drawing anything, develop a 2-3 paragraph **Icon Philosophy** that articulates:

- **Core concept**: What single idea or feeling should the icon convey?
- **Visual metaphor**: What shape, object, or abstraction represents the app's purpose?
- **Color psychology**: What palette evokes the right emotional response?
- **Silhouette test**: Will it be recognizable as a tiny black shape?

Write this philosophy out. It guides every design decision.

### Design Principles

Icons that work follow these rules:

- **Simplicity**: One focal element. No more than 2-3 colors. No text (illegible at small sizes).
- **Distinctiveness**: Must stand out in a grid of 30 other icons. Avoid generic symbols (gears, checkmarks, clouds).
- **Scalability**: The 16x16 notification icon must read as clearly as the 1024x1024 App Store version.
- **No photography**: Apple's guidelines discourage photos. Use illustration, geometry, or abstract forms.
- **Optical balance**: Center of visual weight, not geometric center. Curves feel heavier than straight lines.

## Phase 2: Icon Generation

Generate the icon as a **self-contained HTML file** with embedded SVG that:

1. Renders the icon design at 1024x1024 (the master size)
2. Includes iOS-style rounded corners (superellipse, not CSS border-radius)
3. Shows a preview grid of all sizes to verify readability
4. Provides a download mechanism for each size

### Required Sizes

Generate all iOS app icon sizes:

| Size | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| 1024x1024 | App Store |
| 180x180 | iPhone (@3x) |
| 167x167 | iPad Pro (@2x) |
| 152x152 | iPad (@2x) |
| 120x120 | iPhone (@2x) |
| 87x87 | Spotlight (@3x) |
| 80x80 | Spotlight (@2x) |
| 76x76 | iPad (@1x) |
| 60x60 | iPhone (@1x) |
| 58x58 | Settings (@2x) |
| 40x40 | Spotlight (@1x) |
| 29x29 | Settings (@1x) |
| 20x20 | Notification (@1x) |

### HTML Artifact Structure

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>App Icon: [Name]</title>
  <style>
    /* Dark interface, icon grid layout, download buttons */
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <!-- Philosophy statement -->
  <!-- Master SVG at 1024x1024 -->
  <!-- Preview grid showing all sizes -->
  <!-- Download buttons (use canvas to convert SVG → PNG) -->
  <script>
    // SVG → Canvas → PNG download logic
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

### SVG Guidelines

- Use `viewBox="0 0 1024 1024"` for the master
- Apply the iOS squircle mask (superellipse with n≈5)
- Use gradients sparingly but effectively
- Ensure googd stroke widths scale proportionally
- Test: zoom browser to 25% - is the icon still clear?

### iOS Squircle Mask

The iOS icon shape is NOT a rounded rectangle. Use this superellipse path or approximate with:

```svg
<clipPath id="ios-squircle">
  <path d="M512,1024 C252,1024 0,772 0,512 C0,252 252,0 512,0 C772,0 1024,252 1024,512 C1024,772 772,1024 512,1024 Z" />
</clipPath>
```

Or generate programmatically with the superellipse formula: `|x/a|^n + |y/b|^n = 1` where n ≈ 5.

## Process

1. Ask about the app's purpose, name, and any existing brand colors
2. Write the Icon Philosophy
3. Describe 2-3 concept directions with rationale
4. Get user approval on a direction
5. Generate the HTML artifact with full icon set
6. Iterate based on feedback

## Quality Bar

The output should look like it belongs on a top-10 App Store chart. Every icon in that grid was crafted by a professional designer - yours should be indistinguishable from theirs.

Avoid:
- Glossy/skeuomorphic styles (outdated since iOS 7)
- Thin hairline details (disappear at small sizes)
- Overly complex illustrations
- Generic clip-art aesthetics
- Centered-circle-on-gradient laziness
