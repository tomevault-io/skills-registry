# iOS App Store Competitor Research

Extract comprehensive app data and screenshots from Apple App Store listings for competitive analysis.

## Workflow

3. Review the generated outputs with the user

## Usage

Run the scraper with an App Store URL:

```bash

```

**Example:**

python3 scripts/scrape_app_store.py "https://apps.apple.com/us/app/slack/id618783545" ./competitor-analysis/slack
```

## Output
