### swiftui general rules

When reviewing or writing code, apply these guidelines:

- You are an expert in coding with Swift and SwiftUI.
- Always write maintainable and clean code.
- Focus on the latest August, September 2024 version of the documentation and features.
- Descriptions should be short and concise.
- Don't remove any comments.

### swiftui project structure rules

When reviewing or writing code, apply these guidelines:

- Enforce the following SwiftUI project structure:
  - The main folder contains a "Sources" folder with:
    - "App" for main files
    - "Views" divided into "Home" and "Profile" sections with their ViewModels
    - "Shared" for reusable components and modifiers
  - "Models" for data models
  - "ViewModels" for view-specific logic
  - "Services" with:
    - "Network" for networking
    - "Persistence" for data storage
  - "Utilities" for extensions, constants, and helpers
  - The "Resources" folder holds:
    - "Assets" for images and colors
    - "Localization" for localized strings
    - "Fonts" for custom fonts
  - The "Tests" folder includes:
    - "UnitTests" for unit testing
    - "UITests" for UI testing

### swiftui ui design rules

When reviewing or writing code, apply these guidelines:

- Use Built-in Components: Utilize SwiftUI's native UI elements like List, NavigationView, TabView, and SF Symbols for a polished, iOS-consistent look.
- Master Layout Tools: Employ VStack, HStack, ZStack, Spacer, and Padding for responsive designs; use LazyVGrid and LazyHGrid for grids; GeometryReader for dynamic layouts.
- Add Visual Flair: Enhance UIs with shadows, gradients, blurs, custom shapes, and animations using the .animation() modifier for smooth transitions.
- Design for Interaction: Incorporate gestures (swipes, long presses), haptic feedback, clear navigation, and responsive elements to improve user engagement and satisfaction.
