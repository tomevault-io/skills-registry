# iOS Simulator PWA Testing

Test and debug Progressive Web Apps using iOS Simulator on macOS for a real iOS Safari experience.

## Prerequisites

- **Xcode** installed from App Store
- **Xcode Command Line Tools**: `xcode-select --install`
- **Safari** with Developer menu enabled

## Quick Start

### 1. Launch Simulator

```bash
# Open Simulator app
open -a Simulator

# Or boot a specific device
xcrun simctl boot "iPhone 15 Pro"
open -a Simulator
```

### 2. Open Your PWA

```bash
# Open localhost URL (Mac's localhost is accessible from Simulator)
xcrun simctl openurl booted "http://localhost:3000"

# Or any URL
xcrun simctl openurl booted "https://your-pwa.com"
```

### 3. Debug with Safari Web Inspector

1. **Enable Safari Develop Menu**: Safari → Settings → Advanced → "Show features for web developers"
2. Open Safari on Mac
3. Go to **Develop** menu → **Simulator** → Select your webpage
4. Full Web Inspector opens with Console, Elements, Network, etc.

## simctl Commands Reference

### Device Management

```bash
# List all available simulators
xcrun simctl list devices

# List only booted simulators
xcrun simctl list devices | grep Booted

# Boot a simulator
xcrun simctl boot "iPhone 15 Pro"
xcrun simctl boot <DEVICE-UUID>

# Shutdown simulator
xcrun simctl shutdown booted
xcrun simctl shutdown all

# Erase simulator (factory reset)
xcrun simctl erase booted

# Delete unavailable/old simulators
xcrun simctl delete unavailable
```

### Opening URLs

```bash
# Open URL in booted simulator
xcrun simctl openurl booted "http://localhost:3000"

# Open URL in specific simulator
xcrun simctl openurl "iPhone 15 Pro" "https://example.com"
```

### Screenshots & Recording

```bash
# Take screenshot
xcrun simctl io booted screenshot ~/Desktop/ios-screenshot.png

# Record video (Ctrl+C to stop)
xcrun simctl io booted recordVideo ~/Desktop/ios-recording.mp4

# With specific format
xcrun simctl io booted recordVideo --type=mp4 ~/Desktop/recording.mp4
```

### Media & Files

```bash
# Add photos/videos to simulator
xcrun simctl addmedia booted ~/Desktop/test-image.png
xcrun simctl addmedia booted ~/Desktop/test-video.mp4
```

## Safari Web Inspector Features

When connected via Develop menu:

- **Console**: View JS logs, errors, service worker logs
- **Elements**: Inspect DOM, modify CSS in real-time
- **Network**: Monitor requests, check service worker caching
- **Sources**: Debug JavaScript, set breakpoints
- **Storage**: Inspect localStorage, IndexedDB, Cache Storage
- **Service Workers**: Debug service worker (visible in Develop menu as separate context)

### Debugging Service Workers

PWA Service Workers appear in Safari's Develop menu:
1. Open Simulator with your PWA
2. Safari → Develop → Simulator → Look for "Service Worker" entries
3. Opens inspector with Console, Sources, Network tabs

**Note**: Service Worker debugging works BETTER in Simulator than on physical devices.

## Accessibility Testing

### Using Accessibility Inspector

1. Open Xcode
2. Xcode → Open Developer Tool → **Accessibility Inspector**
3. Select Simulator from the device dropdown
4. Hover over elements to see accessibility info
5. Run **Audit** to find accessibility issues

### Command Line Accessibility Snapshot

```bash
# Get accessibility hierarchy (requires running app)
xcrun simctl ui booted accessibility
```

## PWA-Specific Testing

### Add to Home Screen (Manual)

1. Open your PWA URL in Safari on Simulator
2. Tap Share button (bottom bar)
3. Select "Add to Home Screen"
4. PWA installs as standalone app

### Testing Installed PWA

- Installed PWAs run in `Web.app` engine (same as real device)
- Access via Develop menu as separate web context
- Test `display-mode: standalone` media queries
- Verify splash screens, icons, theme colors

### Manifest Validation

Check your manifest is loaded correctly:
1. Open Web Inspector → Application tab (if available) or Network tab
2. Look for `manifest.json` request
3. Verify all icons, theme_color, display mode

## Multi-Device Testing Script

Run `scripts/multi-device-test.sh` to test across multiple device sizes:

```bash
./scripts/multi-device-test.sh "http://localhost:3000"
```

## Useful Keyboard Shortcuts (Simulator)

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| ⌘ + Shift + H | Go to Home Screen |
| ⌘ + Shift + H (x2) | App Switcher |
| ⌘ + → / ⌘ + ← | Rotate device |
| ⌘ + S | Take screenshot |
| ⌘ + R | Record video |
| ⌘ + K | Toggle keyboard |

## Troubleshooting

### "No Inspectable Applications" in Safari Develop menu
- Ensure a webpage is open in Safari on Simulator
- Restart Safari on Mac
- Restart Simulator

### Simulator not appearing in Develop menu
- Quit Safari and Simulator
- Reopen Simulator first, then Safari

### localhost not working
- Use `http://localhost:PORT` (Simulator shares Mac's network stack)
- Try `http://127.0.0.1:PORT` as alternative

### Service Worker not updating
- Clear Safari cache in Simulator: Settings → Safari → Clear History and Website Data
- Or erase simulator: `xcrun simctl erase booted`
