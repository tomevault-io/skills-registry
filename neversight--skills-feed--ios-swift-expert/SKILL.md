# iOS and macOS Development Expert

## Overview

Elite-level guidance for iOS and macOS development with deep expertise in Swift, SwiftUI, UIKit, and the entire Apple development ecosystem.

**Core principle:** Follow Apple's Human Interface Guidelines, Swift API Design Guidelines, and modern iOS development best practices while writing clean, performant, memory-safe code.

## When to Use

Automatically activates when:
- Working with `.swift` source files
- Opening or modifying Xcode projects (`.xcodeproj`, `.xcworkspace`)
- Editing SwiftUI views or UIKit view controllers
- Implementing iOS/macOS frameworks (Core Data, Combine, UIKit, SwiftUI, etc.)
- Debugging Xcode build errors or runtime issues
- Designing app architectures (MVVM, MVI, Clean Architecture)
- Optimizing performance or fixing memory leaks
- Implementing accessibility, localization, or privacy features
- Configuring app targets, build settings, or project structure

Manual invocation when:
- User explicitly asks about Swift language features
- User needs guidance on Apple platform APIs
- User requests iOS/macOS development best practices
- User encounters Apple platform-specific problems

## When NOT to Use This Skill

Do not use this skill for:
- General programming questions unrelated to Apple platforms
- Backend server development (unless using Vapor/Swift on server)
- Cross-platform mobile development (React Native, Flutter, Kotlin Multiplatform)
- Web development (unless WebKit/Safari specific or Swift for WebAssembly)
- Android development
- Desktop development on non-Apple platforms

- **Testing**: XCTest, UI testing, performance testing, test plans, code coverage
- **Swift Package Manager**: Package manifests, dependencies, versioning, local packages

### App Architecture

- **MVVM**: Model-View-ViewModel with SwiftUI or UIKit
- **MVI**: Model-View-Intent unidirectional data flow
- **Clean Architecture**: Layered separation, dependency injection, testability
- **Coordinator Pattern**: Navigation flow management
- **Repository Pattern**: Data layer abstraction
- **Design Patterns**: Factory, observer, strategy, dependency injection containers

## Development Workflow

### 1. Build Verification

**Always verify builds** after making changes using `xcodebuild`:

```bash
xcodebuild -project YourProject.xcodeproj -scheme YourScheme -quiet build
```

- Use `-quiet` flag to minimize output as specified in project documentation
- Replace placeholders with actual project and scheme names
- For workspaces, use `-workspace YourWorkspace.xcworkspace`
- Check exit code to confirm success

### 2. Code Standards

Follow these standards for all Swift code:

**Naming Conventions:**
- Types: UpperCamelCase (e.g., `UserProfileViewController`)
- Functions/variables: lowerCamelCase (e.g., `fetchUserData()`)
- Constants: lowerCamelCase (e.g., `let maxRetryCount = 3`)
- Protocols: UpperCamelCase, often ending in -able, -ible, or -ing (e.g., `Codable`, `Drawable`)

**Access Control:**
- Default to `private` or `fileprivate` for implementation details
- Use `internal` (default) for module-internal APIs
- Mark `public` or `open` only for exported APIs
- Consider `@testable import` for testing instead of making everything public

**Code Organization:**
- Group related code with `// MARK: - Section Name`
- Order: properties, initializers, lifecycle methods, public methods, private methods
- One type per file (exceptions for small helper types)
- Use extensions for protocol conformance

**Memory Safety:**
- Use `[weak self]` in closures that may outlive the caller
- Use `[unowned self]` only when certain closure won't outlive the reference
- Break retain cycles between parent/child view controllers
- Monitor retain cycles in Instruments

### 3. Testing Requirements

Write testable code with appropriate coverage:

**Unit Tests:**
- Test business logic, view models, data transformations
- Mock network/database dependencies
- Use dependency injection for testability
- Aim for >80% coverage on critical paths

**UI Tests:**
- Test critical user flows (login, purchase, main features)
- Use accessibility identifiers for reliable element selection
- Keep UI tests fast and focused

### 4. Performance Considerations

Optimize for user experience:

**Rendering Performance:**
- Keep view hierarchies shallow
- Avoid expensive operations in `body` (SwiftUI) or `layoutSubviews` (UIKit)
- Profile with Instruments (Time Profiler, SwiftUI view body)
- Lazy-load content, virtualize lists

**Memory Management:**
- Release large objects when no longer needed
- Monitor memory warnings and respond appropriately
- Profile with Instruments (Allocations, Leaks)
- Avoid strong reference cycles

**Battery Life:**
- Minimize location services usage
- Batch network requests
- Use background modes judiciously
- Profile with Instruments (Energy Log)

### 5. Apple Platform Best Practices

Follow Apple's official guidelines for:
- Human Interface Guidelines (navigation, controls, interactions, accessibility)
- Privacy & Security (permissions, data handling, authentication)
- Accessibility (VoiceOver, Dynamic Type, color contrast)
- Localization (NSLocalizedString, RTL languages, formatting)

See `./references/apple-guidelines.md` for detailed requirements and best practices.

## Problem-Solving Approach

### 1. Analysis Phase

- Read error messages carefully (Xcode, runtime logs, crash reports)
- Check project-specific requirements in CLAUDE.md
- Review existing code patterns and architecture
- Consider iOS version compatibility and API availability

### 2. Solution Design

- Provide multiple approaches when appropriate, explaining trade-offs
- Reference official Apple documentation and WWDC sessions
- Consider performance, memory, and battery impact
- Suggest appropriate design patterns for the problem

### 3. Implementation

- Write clean, readable Swift code following API Design Guidelines
- Include inline comments for complex logic
- Add proper error handling with meaningful error messages
- Ensure code is testable with dependency injection where appropriate

### 4. Validation

- Verify code builds successfully with `xcodebuild`
- Test on simulator and, when possible, physical devices
- Check for retain cycles and memory leaks
- Validate accessibility and localization

## Communication Style

**Clear and Actionable:**
- Provide specific code examples, not just descriptions
- Explain the "why" behind architectural and implementation decisions
- Offer step-by-step instructions for complex implementations
- Highlight potential pitfalls and how to avoid them

**Authoritative Sources:**
- Link to Apple's official documentation
- Cite WWDC sessions for best practices
- Reference Swift Evolution proposals for language features
- Point to Human Interface Guidelines for design decisions
- See `./references/apple-guidelines.md` for documentation links

**Trade-offs:**
- Performance vs. code simplicity
- SwiftUI vs. UIKit for specific use cases
- Async/await vs. completion handlers
- Protocol-oriented vs. class-based design

**Complete implementation examples:** See `./references/code-examples.md` for SwiftUI views, MVVM view models, Core Data setup, and memory management patterns.

**Design patterns and solutions:** See `./references/patterns.md` for dependency injection, result builders, coordinator pattern, and other common solutions.

**Debugging guidance:** See `./references/debugging-strategies.md` for comprehensive debugging techniques for Xcode build issues, runtime problems, and SwiftUI-specific debugging.
