description: Use iOS/Swift code as the source of truth and implement the equivalent feature in Android/Kotlin. Understands the feature behavior, data structures, and logic from iOS, then creates idiomatic Android code that matches the target codebase's existing patterns.

# iOS to Android: Feature Parity Implementation

Use iOS code as the reference to implement the equivalent Android feature. Not a literal translation - understand what the iOS code does, then implement it idiomatically for Android.

**Use this when:**
- Porting a feature from iOS to Android
- iOS is the "source of truth" for a feature
- Ensuring feature parity between platforms

## Key Principle

```
iOS Code → Understand Feature → Match Android Codebase Patterns → Implement
              (what)                    (how it's done here)
```

**Preserved:** Feature behavior, data structure shapes, business logic, user flows
**Adapted:** Language idioms, frameworks, patterns to match the Android codebase

---

## Workflow

### Step 0: Gather Context

**Ask the user for both pieces of information:**

```
To port a feature from iOS to Android, I need:

1. PATH TO iOS CODEBASE (source of truth)
   Where is the iOS project located?
   Example: /path/to/ios-app or ../ios-app

2. FEATURE TO IMPLEMENT
   What feature or component should I port?
   Example: "UserProfile screen" or "the authentication flow" or "src/Features/Checkout"
```

**Assumptions:**
- Current working directory = Android codebase (target)
- User provides path to iOS codebase (source)

If the user already provided this info, proceed. Otherwise, ask.

### Step 1: Locate the iOS Feature

Navigate to the iOS codebase path and find the relevant files:

1. Go to the iOS path provided
2. Find files related to the feature
3. Read and understand the implementation

### Step 2: Analyze the iOS Code

Thoroughly understand:

| Aspect | What to Extract |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Feature Behavior** | What does this feature do? User-facing functionality |
| **Data Structures** | Models, types, enums - their shapes and relationships |
| **Business Logic** | Core logic, validations, transformations |
| **State Management** | What state exists, how it flows |
| **API Contracts** | Network calls, request/response shapes |
| **UI Flow** | Screens, navigation, user interactions |
| **Edge Cases** | Error handling, loading states, empty states |

```

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Feature: [Name]

### What It Does
[User-facing description]

### Data Structures
[Key models and their relationships]

### Business Logic
[Core logic summary]

### State
[What state is managed, how it changes]

### API Calls
[Endpoints, request/response shapes]

### UI Flow
[Screens, navigation]

### Edge Cases Handled
- [Case 1]
- [Case 2]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### Step 3: Analyze Android Codebase Patterns

**Before implementing, understand how THIS Android codebase does things:**

1. **Check if `.claude/codebase-style.md` exists** - If yes, use it and skip manual analysis
2. Find similar features in the codebase
3. Note the patterns used:
   - Architecture pattern
   - UI framework and patterns
   - State management approach
   - Networking approach
   - Dependency injection
   - File/folder organization
   - Naming conventions

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
               ANDROID CODEBASE PATTERNS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Style Guide: [Found / Not found]

Patterns observed from existing code:
- Architecture: [what pattern is used]
- UI: [how UI is built]
- State: [how state is managed]
- Networking: [how API calls are made]
- DI: [how dependencies are injected]
- Navigation: [how navigation works]

Similar features to reference:
- [Feature 1]: [path]
- [Feature 2]: [path]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### Step 4: Create Implementation Plan

Map the iOS feature to Android equivalents **using the patterns from Step 3**:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
                  IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Files to Create

| # | File | Purpose | iOS Equivalent |
|---|------|---------|----------------|
| 1 | [path matching codebase conventions] | [purpose] | [iOS file] |
| 2 | ... | ... | ... |

## Key Mappings

| iOS Concept | Android Equivalent (matching codebase patterns) |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------|
| [iOS thing] | [Android equivalent as done in this codebase] |
| ... | ... |

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### Step 5: Implement

Create the Android implementation:

- **Match the codebase's existing patterns exactly**
- Use the same architecture, UI patterns, state management as other features
- Follow the same naming conventions
- Keep data structure shapes equivalent for API compatibility

### Step 6: Copy Assets (if needed)

**If the feature uses assets, offer to copy them:**

Assets that may need to be copied:
- Images, icons, colors, fonts, Lottie animations, sounds, etc.

If assets are needed and the user wants them copied, use file operations to transfer them from the iOS codebase to the appropriate Android locations.

### Step 7: Report Results

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
                 iOS → ANDROID COMPLETE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Feature: [Name]

### Files Created

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [path] | [description] |

### Feature Parity Checklist

- [x] Core functionality matches iOS
- [x] Data structures equivalent
- [x] Error handling preserved
- [x] Loading states preserved
- [x] Edge cases handled
- [x] Matches Android codebase patterns

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Triggers

```
"ios to android"
"convert from ios"
"port this swift to kotlin"
"implement this ios feature for android"
"android version of this ios code"
```

---

## Integration with style-guide

**Recommended:** Run the `style-guide` skill on the Android codebase first.

```
style guide     ← Run this first on Android codebase
ios to android  ← Then run this
```

This generates `.claude/codebase-style.md` which this skill will automatically reference.

**If style guide exists:**
- Skip manual pattern analysis (Step 3)
- Reference the documented patterns directly
- Ensure perfect consistency with existing code

**If no style guide:**
- This skill will analyze patterns manually (Step 3)
- Consider running `style-guide` first for better results

---

## Tips

1. **Don't translate literally** - Understand the feature, then implement idiomatically
2. **Match the codebase** - Use the same patterns as existing Android code
3. **Keep data shapes equivalent** - API compatibility matters
4. **Handle platform differences** - Some things work differently (lifecycle, permissions)
5. **Verify feature parity** - Same behavior, not same code
