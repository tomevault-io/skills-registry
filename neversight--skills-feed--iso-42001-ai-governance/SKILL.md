## Best Practices

1. **Start with Risk Assessment**: Prioritize based on AI risk level
2. **Document Everything**: ISO 42001 requires extensive documentation
3. **Engage Stakeholders Early**: Include affected parties in governance
4. **Use Existing Frameworks**: Leverage NIST AI RMF, EU AI Act requirements
5. **Automate Monitoring**: Build MLOps with governance built-in
6. **Train Your Team**: ISO 42001 requires competent personnel
7. **Regular Audits**: Don't wait for problems—proactive reviews
8. **Learn from Incidents**: Every issue is improvement opportunity
9. **Balance Innovation and Safety**: Responsible AI doesn't mean no AI
10. **Seek Certification**: Third-party ISO 42001 certification adds credibility

## Regulatory Alignment

ISO 42001 aligns with major AI regulations:

**EU AI Act:**
- Risk classification framework
- High-risk AI obligations
- Transparency requirements
- Conformity assessment

**GDPR:**
- Data protection by design
- Privacy impact assessments
- Data subject rights
- Lawful processing

**NIST AI RMF:**
- Govern, Map, Measure, Manage functions
- Risk-based approach
- Trustworthy AI characteristics

**Sector-Specific:**
- Healthcare: FDA AI/ML guidance, MDR
- Finance: Model Risk Management (SR 11-7)
- Employment: EEOC AI guidance

## Common Pitfalls

1. **"We'll add governance later"** - Build it in from the start
2. **Treating ISO 42001 as one-time exercise** - It's continual
3. **Documentation without implementation** - Must be operational
4. **Ignoring low-risk AI** - Even minimal-risk needs baseline governance
5. **No stakeholder engagement** - Affected parties must be involved
6. **Insufficient resources** - Responsible AI requires investment
7. **Lack of monitoring** - Deploy-and-forget is non-compliant
8. **No incident response plan** - When AI fails, you need a plan
9. **Training as checkbox** - Teams must truly understand responsible AI
10. **Copying templates without customization** - Tailor to your context

## Version

1.0 - Initial release based on ISO/IEC 42001:2023

---

**Remember**: ISO 42001 is about building trustworthy AI systems through systematic risk management and governance. It's not a barrier to innovation—it's a framework for responsible innovation that protects both organizations and the people affected by AI.
