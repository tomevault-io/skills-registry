# isq CLI

A CLI for GitHub, Linear, and JIRA issues. Instant. Offline-first.

## Prerequisites

The `isq` command must be installed and available in PATH. Install via:

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
curl -LsSf https://cameronwestland.com/isq/install.sh | sh
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
irm https://cameronwestland.com/isq/install.ps1 | iex
```

## Why isq is Fast

isq syncs issues to a local SQLite database. All reads come from this cache—no network round-trip. A background daemon keeps the cache fresh automatically.

```
CLI reads → Local SQLite (instant, <1ms)
CLI writes → API directly (then cached)
Daemon → Syncs in background every 15s
```

## Core Commands

### Link a Repository

Before using isq, link your repo to GitHub, Linear, or JIRA:

```bash
isq link github    # Link current repo to GitHub Issues
isq link linear    # Link current repo to Linear
isq link jira      # Link current repo to JIRA Cloud
```

For JIRA, you can also use options to select a specific project:

```bash
isq link jira -o list-projects   # List available JIRA projects
isq link jira -o project=MYPROJ  # Link to specific project
```

Linking also installs a git commit hook that auto-appends issue references to commits.

### Sync Issues

Manually sync issues from the remote:

```bash
isq sync
```

The daemon also syncs automatically in the background.

### List Issues

```bash
isq issue list                          # All issues (sorted by priority)
isq issue list --state=open             # Open issues only
isq issue list --state=closed           # Closed issues only
isq issue list --label=bug              # Filter by label
isq issue list --mine                   # Issues assigned to me
isq issue list --unassigned             # Issues with no assignee
isq issue list --goal "v1"              # Issues in a goal/milestone
isq issue list --id 7,12,45             # Filter by specific issue IDs
isq issue list --sort newest            # Sort by issue number (newest first)
isq issue list --sort updated           # Sort by last updated
isq issue list --label=bug --state=open # Combine filters
isq issue list --json                   # JSON output
isq issue list --tree                   # Show as parent-child hierarchy
isq issue list --root-only              # Only top-level issues (no parents)
isq issue list --children-of 42         # Children of issue #42 for scripts
```

**Note:** `--id` gives a compact list view of specific issues. Use `isq issue show <id>` for full details including description and comments.

### Show Issue Details

```bash
isq issue show 423        # Show issue #423
isq issue show 423 --json # JSON output
```

### Create Issues

```bash
isq issue create --title "Fix login bug"
isq issue create --title "Add feature" --body "Description here"
isq issue create --title "Bug" --label=bug
```

### Comment on Issues

```bash
isq issue comment 423 "Fixed in commit abc123"
```

### Close and Reopen

```bash
isq issue close 423
isq issue reopen 423
```

### Manage Labels

```bash
isq issue label 423 add bug
isq issue label 423 remove bug
```

### Assign Users

```bash
isq issue assign 423 username
```

### Label Commands

List and create repository labels (for discovery and priority setup):

```bash
isq label list                              # List all repo labels
isq label list --json                       # JSON output
isq label create P0 --color ff0000          # Create a label
isq label create P1 --color orange --description "High priority"
```

## Development Workflow

isq integrates with git worktrees so your filesystem becomes your context. Each worktree is associated with an issue—no need to track issue IDs manually.

### Start Working on an Issue

```bash
isq start 891
```

This command:
1. Creates a git worktree at `~/src/myapp-891-fix-auth-timeout`
2. Creates a branch named `891-fix-auth-timeout`
3. Marks the issue as in-progress (adds labels on GitHub, transitions state on Linear)
4. Runs any setup script defined in `.config/isq.toml`

### Show Current Issue

```bash
isq              # Show current issue with full details
isq current      # Just the issue number (for scripts)
isq current -q   # Quiet mode: no output if no issue, exit code 1
```

When in a worktree, `isq` (no args) shows the associated issue:

```
#891 Auth timeout on slow connections                        open
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Connections time out after 30s on slow networks...

Branch: 891-fix-auth-timeout
Worktree: ~/src/myapp-891-fix-auth-timeout
```

### Automatic Commit References

When you commit in a worktree with an associated issue, the commit message automatically gets the issue reference appended:

```bash
git commit -m "Fix connection pool sizing"
# Becomes: "Fix connection pool sizing [#891]"
```

### Clean Up

When done with an issue (PR merged, etc.):

```bash
isq cleanup         # Remove worktree, clear association, and clean up issue state
isq cleanup --keep  # Keep worktree directory, just clear association
```

Cleanup undoes what `isq start` did:
- **GitHub**: Removes labels added on start (e.g., "in progress")
- **Linear/JIRA**: Can transition issue back to a state (e.g., "backlog")

Configure in `.config/isq.toml`:

```toml
[on_cleanup]
remove_labels = ["in progress"]  # GitHub
# transition = "backlog"         # Linear/JIRA
```

## Goal Commands

Goals are time-bound containers for issues. They map to GitHub Milestones and Linear Projects.

### List Goals

```bash
isq goal list                 # Open goals (default)
isq goal list --state=closed  # Closed goals
isq goal list --state=all     # All goals
isq goal list --json          # JSON output
```

### Show Goal Details

```bash
isq goal show "v1"        # Show goal by name
isq goal show "v1" --json # JSON output
```

### Create Goals

```bash
isq goal create "v1"
isq goal create "v1" --target 2026-02-01
isq goal create "v1" --target 2026-02-01 --body "First public release"
```

### Assign Issues to Goals

```bash
isq goal assign 423 "v1"  # Assign issue #423 to goal "v1"
```

### Close Goals

```bash
isq goal close "v1"
```

## Daemon Commands

The daemon syncs issues in the background and enables instant reads.

```bash
isq daemon start    # Start the background daemon
isq daemon stop     # Stop the daemon
isq daemon status   # Check daemon status and watched repos
```

## Diagnostics and Updates

```bash
isq doctor            # Diagnose common issues and suggest fixes
isq doctor --verbose  # Show detailed diagnostics
isq doctor --check auth  # Run specific check (auth, repo, sync, service, database, network)

isq update check      # Check if a newer version is available
isq update install    # Download and install the latest version
```

## Other Commands

```bash
isq status        # Show auth, sync health, and daemon status
isq unlink        # Remove link and commit hook from current repo
isq logout github # Remove stored credentials for a forge
```

## Offline Support

When offline, write operations queue locally and sync when back online:

```bash
# Works offline - queues the operation
isq issue create --title "New issue"
# Output: ✓ Queued: New issue (offline, 8ms)

# When back online, daemon syncs automatically
isq daemon status
# Output: ✓ Synced 2 pending operations
```

## JSON Output

All commands support `--json` for machine-readable output. Use this for scripts and AI agent workflows:

```bash
isq issue list --json
isq issue show 423 --json
isq issue create --title "Bug" --json
isq status --json
```

## Views (Saved Filters)

Views are named filter combinations that save you from typing repetitive flags. They're stored in your user config (`~/.config/isq/config.toml`) and work across all repositories.

### Create a View

```bash
# Create a view for high-priority bugs assigned to me
isq view create my-bugs --label=bug --state=open --mine --priority-lte=2

# Create a view for stale unassigned issues
isq view create stale --unassigned --updated-before="30 days"

# Create a view for backlog triage
isq view create triage --state=open --unassigned --label-not=wontfix
```

### Use a View

Reference views with `@` prefix in issue list:

```bash
isq issue list @my-bugs      # Expands to: --label=bug --state=open --mine --priority-lte=2
isq issue list @stale        # Expands to: --unassigned --updated-before="30 days"
isq issue list @triage       # Expands to: --state=open --unassigned --label-not=wontfix
```

Views can be combined with additional flags (CLI flags override view settings):

```bash
isq issue list @my-bugs --label=security  # Overrides label from view
isq issue list @triage --json             # Adds json output
```

### Manage Views

```bash
isq view list             # List all views
isq view show my-bugs     # Show view details
isq view delete stale     # Delete a view
```

### Available View Filters

| Flag | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `--label` | Include issues with this label | `--label=bug` |
| `--label-not` | Exclude issues with this label | `--label-not=wontfix` |

## Guidance

- **Prefer the CLI** for all issue operations rather than calling GitHub/Linear APIs directly
- **Use `isq start`** when beginning work on an issue—it sets up the worktree and tracks context automatically
- **NEVER manually create branches with `git checkout -b` when starting issue work**—always use `isq start <id>` instead, then `cd` into the created worktree
- **NEVER remove or clean up worktrees created by `isq start`**—they are the intended working environment
- **Use `--json`** when you need structured output for further processing
- **Reads are instant** because they come from the local cache—no need to worry about API rate limits for queries
- **Writes go directly to the API** when online, or queue locally when offline
- **The daemon is optional** but recommended—it keeps the cache fresh automatically

## Common Workflows

### Initial Setup
```bash
cd /path/to/your/repo
isq link github      # or: isq link linear, isq link jira
isq sync             # Initial sync
isq daemon start     # Start background sync
```

### Feature Development
```bash
# Find an issue to work on
isq issue list --state=open --label=feature

# Start working (creates worktree, branch, marks in-progress)
isq start 891

# Work on the feature...
# Commits auto-reference the issue: "Add feature [#891]"

# When done, clean up
isq cleanup
```

### Daily Issue Triage
```bash
isq issue list --state=open --label=bug
isq issue show 423
isq issue comment 423 "Looking into this"
isq issue close 423
```

### Working Offline
```bash
# On a plane, no internet
isq issue list                    # Works! Reads from cache
isq issue create --title "Idea"   # Queues locally

# Back online
isq daemon status                 # Shows pending ops synced
```

## Finding What to Work On

When users ask "what should I work on?" or similar, use these patterns.

### Understanding Priority

Issues have priority levels (shown in JSON output):
- `0` / `urgent` — Drop everything, fix now
- `1` / `high` — Important, do soon
- `2` / `medium` — Normal priority
- `3` / `low` — Nice to have
- `4` / `none` — No priority set

Issues are sorted by priority by default. Always recommend highest priority first.

**Linear:** Priority is native (works out of box).

**GitHub:** Priority requires explicit `[priority]` config in `.config/isq.toml`:

```toml
[priority]
P0 = 0  # urgent
P1 = 1  # high
bug = 1 # treat bugs as high priority
P2 = 2  # medium
P3 = 3  # low
```

### Pre-assigned Teams

If issues are assigned during sprint planning, find the user's top priority work:

```bash
isq issue list --mine --json
```

Recommend the highest priority assigned issue.

### Pull-from-Backlog Teams

If the team pulls from a shared backlog:

```bash
isq issue list --goal "Sprint 5" --unassigned --json
```

Recommend the highest priority unassigned issue, then assign and start:

```bash
isq issue assign 42 username
isq start 42
```

### Not Sure Which Model?

Ask: "Does your team pre-assign issues, or do you pull from a shared backlog?"

### Example Workflow: "What Should I Work On?"

```bash
# Pre-assigned model
isq issue list --mine --json
# Look at top result (highest priority)
# Recommend it to user
isq start <id>

# Pull model
isq issue list --goal "Current Sprint" --unassigned --json
# Look at top result
# Recommend it, then:
isq issue assign <id> <username>
isq start <id>
```

### Setting Up Priority (GitHub)

If priority labels aren't configured for a GitHub repo:

1. Check existing labels: `isq label list`
2. Either map existing labels to priorities in `.config/isq.toml`
3. Or create priority labels: `isq label create P0 --color ff0000`

Example configuration:

```toml
# .config/isq.toml
[priority]
P0 = 0
P1 = 1
bug = 1
P2 = 2
P3 = 3
```

## Troubleshooting

### General Diagnosis
```bash
isq doctor            # Check auth, repo, sync, service, database, network
isq doctor --verbose  # Show detailed diagnostics
```

### Daemon Not Starting
```bash
isq daemon status
# If stuck on macOS:
launchctl stop com.isq.daemon
isq daemon start
```

### Stale Cache
```bash
isq sync    # Force manual sync
```

### Check What's Linked
```bash
isq status
```
