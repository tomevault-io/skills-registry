# Jira Integration Skill

Comprehensive Jira integration through lightweight Python CLI scripts.

> **Note:** Run scripts from `skills/jira-communication/`, or use full paths from repo root.

## Auto-Trigger Patterns

**AUTOMATICALLY ACTIVATE** when user mentions:
- **Jira URLs**: `https://jira.*/browse/*`, `https://*.atlassian.net/browse/*`
- **Issue keys**: Pattern like `PROJ-123`, `NRS-4167`, `ABC-1`
- **Keywords**: "Jira issue", "Jira ticket", "search Jira"

## Authentication Failure Handling

**CRITICAL**: When authentication fails, DO NOT just display the error. Instead:

1. **Detect failure** - Look for "Missing required variable" or 401/403 responses
2. **Offer help** - Ask: "Would you like me to help configure Jira credentials?"
3. **Run interactive setup** - `uv run skills/jira-communication/scripts/core/jira-setup.py`
