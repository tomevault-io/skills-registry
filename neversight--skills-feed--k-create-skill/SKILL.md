# Creating Claude Skills

Knowledge for creating and maintaining Claude commands and skills.

## Mechanic Skill System

This project uses a three-prefix taxonomy:

| Prefix | Type | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `c-` | Commands | Action workflows with explicit steps |
| `s-` | Skills | How-to knowledge (paired with commands) |
| `k-` | Knowledge | Context/background (no command needed) |

See [../../AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md) for full system documentation.

## Creating a New Action

To add a new action (e.g., "deploy"):

1. Create `commands/c-deploy.md` with explicit steps
2. Create `skills/s-deploy/SKILL.md` with detailed guidance
3. Add bidirectional links between them

## Creating New Knowledge

To add new context (e.g., "blizzard-api"):

1. Create `skills/k-blizzard-api/SKILL.md`
2. No command needed - the skill IS the context loader

## Skill Structure

```
skills/[skill-name]/
├── SKILL.md              # Required: Main skill file
└── references/           # Optional: Supporting documents
    ├── topic1.md
    └── topic2.md
```

## SKILL.md Format

```markdown
---
name: [prefix]-[name]
description: >
  [What this skill does]. [What content it covers].
  Use when [scenarios]. Triggers: [keyword1], [keyword2], [keyword3].
---

# [Title]

[One-line description]

## Related Commands (for s-* skills only)

- [c-X](../../commands/c-X.md) - [description]

## Capabilities / Key Concepts

1. **[Item 1]** — [Brief description]
2. **[Item 2]** — [Brief description]

## Routing Logic (optional)

| Request type | Load reference |
|--------------|----------------|
| [Topic] | [references/file.md](references/file.md) |
```

## Core Principles

### 1. Progressive Loading

Skills load in stages:
- **Stage 1:** Name + description (always loaded)
- **Stage 2:** SKILL.md body (when skill is relevant)
- **Stage 3:** References (only when explicitly needed)

Design for minimal initial context, deep references.

### 2. Clear Triggers

Description should include trigger words that help Claude know when to use this skill.

### 3. Self-Contained References

Each reference file should be independently useful without requiring other files.

### 4. Actionable Content

Focus on rules, patterns, and examples—not background explanation.

## Routing Logic

| Request type | Load reference |
|--------------|----------------|
| Skill file format | [references/format.md](references/format.md) |
| Routing tables | [references/routing.md](references/routing.md) |
| Description writing | [references/descriptions.md](references/descriptions.md) |
| Reference file design | [references/reference-files.md](references/reference-files.md) |
| Skill architecture | [references/architecture.md](references/architecture.md) |
