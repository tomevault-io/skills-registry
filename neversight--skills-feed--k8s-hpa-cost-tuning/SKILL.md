description: Tune Kubernetes HPA scale-up/down behavior, topology spread, and resource requests to reduce idle cluster capacity and ensure nodes can drain. This skill should be used when auditing cluster costs on a schedule, analyzing post-incident scaling behavior, or investigating why replicas or nodes do not scale down. Use when this capability is needed.

# Kubernetes HPA Cost & Scale-Down Tuning

## Mode selection (mandatory)

Declare a mode before executing this skill. All reasoning, thresholds, and recommendations depend on this choice.

```text
mode = audit | incident
```

If no mode is provided, refuse to run and request clarification.

## When to use

### `mode = audit` — Periodic cost-savings audit

Run on a schedule (weekly or bi-weekly) to:

* Detect over-reservation early
* Validate that scale-down and node consolidation still work
* Identify safe opportunities to reduce cluster cost

This mode assumes no active incident and prioritizes stability-preserving recommendations.

### `mode = incident` — Post-incident scaling analysis

Run after a production incident or anomaly, attaching:

* Production logs
* HPA events
* Scaling timelines

This mode focuses on:

* Explaining *why* scaling behaved the way it did
* Distinguishing traffic-driven vs configuration-driven incidents
* Preventing recurrence without overcorrecting

This skill assumes **Datadog** for observability and standard Kubernetes HPA + Cluster Autoscaler.

## Core mental model

Kubernetes scaling is a **three-layer system**:

1. **HPA** decides *how many pods* (based on usage / requests)
2. **Scheduler** decides *where pods go* (based on requests + constraints)
3. **Cluster Autoscaler** decides *how many nodes exist* (only when nodes can empty)

> Cost optimization only works if **all three layers can move downward**.

Key takeaway: HPA decides *quantity*, scheduler decides *placement*, autoscaler decides *cost*. Scale-up can be aggressive; scale-down must be **possible**. If replicas drop but nodes do not, the scheduler is the bottleneck.

## Datadog formulas

For CPU utilization, CPU reservation, and memory utilization queries, see [references/datadog-formulas.md](references/datadog-formulas.md).

## Scale-down as a first-class cost control

When scale-down is slow or blocked:

* Replicas plateau
* Pods remain evenly spread
* Nodes never empty
* Cluster Autoscaler cannot remove nodes

Result: **permanent over-reservation**.

### Recommended HPA scale-down policy

```yaml
scaleDown:
  stabilizationWindowSeconds: 60
  selectPolicy: Max
  policies:
    - type: Percent
      value: 50
      periodSeconds: 30
```

Effects: fast reaction once load drops, predictable replica collapse, low flapping risk.

## Topology spread: critical cost lever

> Topology spread must never prevent pod consolidation during scale-down.

Strict constraints block scheduler flexibility and freeze cluster size.

### Anti-pattern (breaks cost optimization)

```yaml
maxSkew: 1
whenUnsatisfiable: DoNotSchedule
```

Pods cannot collapse onto fewer nodes. Nodes never drain. Reserved CPU/memory never decreases.

### Recommended default (cost-safe)

```yaml
topologySpreadConstraints:
- topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname
  maxSkew: 2
  whenUnsatisfiable: ScheduleAnyway
```

Strong preference for spreading while allowing bin-packing during scale-down and enabling node removal.

### Strict isolation (AZ-level only)

When hard guarantees are required:

```yaml
topologySpreadConstraints:
- topologyKey: topology.kubernetes.io/zone
  maxSkew: 1
  whenUnsatisfiable: DoNotSchedule
```

Do **not** combine this with strict hostname-level spread.

## Anti-affinity as a soft alternative

To avoid hot nodes without blocking scale-down:

```yaml
podAntiAffinity:
  preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
  - weight: 100
    podAffinityTerm:
      topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname
      labelSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: your-app
```

Anti-affinity is advisory and cost-safe.

## Resource requests tuning

* Over-requesting CPU = slower scale-down
* Over-requesting memory = unexpected scale-ups

Practical defaults:

* `targetCPUUtilizationPercentage: 70`
* `targetMemoryUtilizationPercentage: 75–80`

Adjust **one knob at a time**.

## Validation loop

Run weekly (or after changes):

1. Check HPA `current/target` values
2. Compare CPU used % vs CPU requested %
3. Observe replica collapse after load drops
4. Verify nodes drain and disappear
5. Re-check latency, errors, OOMs

### Quick validation commands

```bash
kubectl -n <namespace> get hpa <deployment>
kubectl -n <namespace> describe hpa <deployment>
kubectl -n <namespace> top pod --containers
kubectl top node
kubectl -n <namespace> get pods -o wide | sort -k7
```
