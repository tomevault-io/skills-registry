# Kamal Deployment

Kamal is a zero-downtime deployment tool for containerized applications, originally built by 37signals for deploying Rails apps but works with any containerized web application.

## Core Concepts

**Philosophy**: Kamal uses an imperative "push" model where you explicitly tell servers what to do, unlike declarative tools like Kubernetes. It combines SSH, Docker, and Kamal Proxy to achieve zero-downtime deployments.

**Components**:
- **SSH/SSHKit**: Remote command execution
- **Docker**: Container runtime and image management
- **Kamal Proxy**: Reverse proxy for zero-downtime deployments (routes traffic between container versions)
- **Accessories**: Supporting services (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis, etc.)

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need to:
- Set up Kamal for a new project
- Configure `config/deploy.yml` or understand configuration options
- Deploy applications or troubleshoot deployment failures
- Manage multiple environments (staging, production)
- Configure accessories (databases, Redis, etc.)
- Debug deployment issues or container problems
- Perform rollbacks or maintenance mode
- Understand Kamal commands and workflows
- Set up CI/CD pipelines with Kamal

## Quick Start Workflow

### Initial Setup
```bash
# 1. Install Kamal
gem install kamal

# 2. Initialize configuration
cd your-app
kamal init

# 3. Edit config/deploy.yml
# - Set service name and image
# - Add server IP addresses
# - Configure registry credentials
# - Set environment variables

# 4. Configure secrets in .kamal/secrets
KAMAL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD=your-token
RAILS_MASTER_KEY=your-key

# 5. Run initial setup (installs Docker, deploys everything)
kamal setup
```

### Standard Deploy
```bash
kamal deploy              # Build, push, deploy with zero downtime
kamal deploy -d staging   # Deploy to staging environment
kamal app logs -f         # Follow application logs
```

### Common Operations
```bash
kamal app exec -i --reuse "bin/rails console"  # Rails console
kamal app logs -g "error"                       # Search logs
kamal rollback <version>                        # Rollback
kamal app maintenance                           # Maintenance mode
kamal app live                                  # Exit maintenance
```

## Configuration Patterns

### Basic deploy.yml Structure
```yaml
service: myapp
image: username/myapp

servers:
  web:
    - 192.168.1.10

registry:
  server: ghcr.io
  username: myuser
  password:
    - KAMAL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD

env:
  secret:
    - RAILS_MASTER_KEY
  clear:
    RAILS_ENV: production

proxy:
  ssl: true
  host: example.com
```

### Multi-Server with Roles
```yaml
servers:
  web:
    hosts:
      - 192.168.1.10
      - 192.168.1.11
  worker:
    hosts:
      - 192.168.1.12
    cmd: bundle exec sidekiq
```

### Accessories (Supporting Services)
```yaml
accessories:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:15
    host: 192.168.1.20
    port: 5432
    env:
      secret:
        - POSTGRES_PASSWORD
      clear:
        POSTGRES_DB: myapp_production
    directories:
      - data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
  
  redis:
    image: redis:7
    host: 192.168.1.21
    directories:
      - data:/data
```

For comprehensive configuration options, see **references/configuration.md**.

## Essential Commands

### Deployment
- `kamal init` - Initialize configuration files
- `kamal setup` - First-time setup (installs Docker, deploys everything)
- `kamal deploy` - Standard deploy with zero downtime
- `kamal redeploy` - Fast redeploy (skips proxy setup)
- `kamal rollback VERSION` - Rollback to previous version

### Application Management
- `kamal app logs [-f]` - View logs (follow with -f)
- `kamal app exec "COMMAND"` - Run command in container
- `kamal app exec -i --reuse "bash"` - Interactive shell
- `kamal app maintenance` - Enable maintenance mode
- `kamal app live` - Disable maintenance mode
- `kamal app containers` - List all containers (for rollback)
- `kamal app version` - Show deployed version

### Accessories
- `kamal accessory boot NAME` - Start accessory
- `kamal accessory logs NAME [-f]` - View accessory logs
- `kamal accessory exec NAME "CMD"` - Run command in accessory

### Troubleshooting
- `kamal config` - Show parsed configuration
- `kamal lock status` - Check deployment lock
- `kamal lock release` - Release stuck lock
- `kamal server exec "CMD"` - Run command on host

### Multiple Environments
- `kamal deploy -d staging` - Deploy to staging
- `kamal deploy -h 192.168.1.10` - Deploy to specific host
- `kamal deploy -r web` - Deploy to specific role

For complete command reference, see **references/commands.md**.

## Common Workflows

### Deploy with Database Migration

**Using pre-deploy hook** (recommended):

Create `.kamal/hooks/pre-deploy`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
kamal app exec -p -q "bin/rails db:migrate"
```

```bash
chmod +x .kamal/hooks/pre-deploy
kamal deploy
```

### Rollback Workflow
```bash
# Check what went wrong
kamal app logs

# List available versions
kamal app containers

# Rollback to previous version
kamal rollback abc123def
```

### Debugging Failed Deployments

1. **Check logs**: `kamal app logs -n 500`
2. **Check container status**: `kamal server exec "docker ps -a"`
3. **Test health endpoint**: `kamal app exec "curl localhost:3000/up"`
4. **Check configuration**: `kamal config`
5. **Release stuck locks**: `kamal lock release`

### Multiple Environments Pattern

Create environment-specific configs:
- `config/deploy.yml` (production)
- `config/deploy.staging.yml`

```bash
kamal setup -d staging
kamal deploy -d staging
kamal deploy  # production
```

For detailed workflows, troubleshooting guides, and best practices, see **references/workflows.md**.

## Database and Accessory Management

### Running Commands in Accessories
```bash
# PostgreSQL
kamal accessory exec postgres "psql -U myapp"
kamal accessory exec postgres "pg_dump -U myapp myapp_production" > backup.sql

# Redis
kamal accessory exec redis "redis-cli"

# MySQL
kamal accessory exec mysql "mysql -u root -p myapp_production"
```

### Litestream (SQLite Replication)
```bash
kamal accessory exec litestream "litestream generations /data/production.sqlite3"
kamal accessory exec litestream "litestream restore /data/production.sqlite3"
```

## Configuration for Common Scenarios

### Custom SSH User/Port
```yaml
ssh:
  user: deploy
  port: 2222
```

### Custom Build Context
```yaml
builder:
  context: .
  dockerfile: Dockerfile.production
  args:
    RUBY_VERSION: 3.2.0
```

### Health Check Configuration
```yaml
healthcheck:
  path: /up
  port: 3000
  interval: 10
  max_attempts: 7
```

### Aliases for Common Commands
```yaml
aliases:
  console: app exec --interactive --reuse "bin/rails console"
  shell: app exec --interactive --reuse "bash"
  logs: app logs -f
```

Use: `kamal console` instead of full command.

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Example
```yaml
- name: Deploy
  env:
    KAMAL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_TOKEN }}
    RAILS_MASTER_KEY: ${{ secrets.RAILS_MASTER_KEY }}
  run: |
    gem install kamal
    kamal deploy
```

## Key Limitations

1. **No automatic state reconciliation** - Kamal won't automatically decommission containers if you remove them from config
2. **No dynamic provisioning** - Cannot auto-scale or provision servers on demand
3. **Single-server load balancing only** - Kamal Proxy balances containers on each server, not across servers (use external load balancer for that)
