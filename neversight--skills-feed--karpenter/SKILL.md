# Karpenter

## Overview

Karpenter is a Kubernetes node autoscaler that provisions right-sized compute resources in response to changing application load. Unlike Cluster Autoscaler which scales predefined node groups, Karpenter provisions nodes based on aggregate pod resource requirements, enabling better bin-packing and cost optimization.

### Key Differences from Cluster Autoscaler

- **Direct provisioning**: Talks directly to cloud provider APIs (no node groups required)
- **Fast scaling**: Provisions nodes in seconds vs minutes
- **Flexible instance selection**: Chooses from all available instance types automatically
- **Consolidation**: Actively replaces nodes with cheaper alternatives
- **Spot instance optimization**: First-class support with automatic fallback

### When to Use Karpenter

- Running workloads with diverse resource requirements
- Need for fast scaling (sub-minute response)
- Cost optimization with spot instances and Graviton (ARM64)
- Consolidation to reduce cluster waste and over-provisioning
- Clusters with unpredictable or bursty workloads
- Right-sizing infrastructure to actual usage patterns
- Managing mixed capacity types (spot/on-demand) automatically

## Instructions

### 1. Installation and Setup

- Install Karpenter controller in cluster
- Configure cloud provider credentials (IAM roles)
- Set up instance profiles and security groups
- Create NodePools for different workload types
- Define EC2NodeClass (AWS) or equivalent for your provider

### 2. Design NodePool Strategy

- Separate NodePools for different workload classes
- Define instance type families and sizes
- Configure spot/on-demand mix
- Set resource limits per NodePool
- Plan for multi-AZ distribution

### 3. Configure Disruption Management

- Set disruption budgets to control churn
- Configure consolidation policies
- Define expiration windows for node lifecycle
- Handle workload-specific disruption constraints
- Test disruption scenarios

### 4. Optimize for Cost and Performance

- Enable consolidation for cost savings
- Use spot instances with fallback strategies
- Set appropriate resource requests on pods (Karpenter depends on accurate requests)
- Monitor node utilization and waste
- Adjust instance type restrictions based on usage
- Leverage Graviton (ARM64) instances for 20% cost reduction
- Configure capacity-type weighting to prefer spot over on-demand

### 5. Cost Optimization Strategies

- **Spot instances**: Configure 70-90% spot mix for fault-tolerant workloads
- **Graviton (ARM64)**: Use c7g, m7g, r7g families for lower costs
- **Consolidation**: Enable WhenUnderutilized policy to replace expensive nodes
- **Instance diversity**: Wide instance family selection improves spot availability
- **Right-sizing**: Let Karpenter bin-pack efficiently instead of over-provisioning

### 6. Spot Instance Management

- Use wide instance type selection (10+ families) for better spot availability
- Configure automatic fallback to on-demand when spot unavailable
- Implement Pod Disruption Budgets to control blast radius
- Set graceful termination handlers in applications (preStop hooks)
- Monitor spot interruption rates and adjust instance selection
- Use diverse availability zones to reduce correlated failures

### 7. Node Consolidation

- **WhenUnderutilized**: Replaces nodes with cheaper/smaller alternatives actively
- **WhenEmpty**: Only consolidates completely empty nodes (conservative)
- Configure consolidateAfter delay to prevent churn (30s-600s typical)
- Use disruption budgets to limit consolidation rate (5-20% per window)
- Respect Pod Disruption Budgets during consolidation
- Set expiration windows to force periodic node refresh

## Best Practices

1. **Start Conservative**: Begin with restrictive instance types, expand based on observation
2. **Use Disruption Budgets**: Prevent too many nodes from being disrupted simultaneously
3. **Set Pod Resource Requests**: Karpenter relies on accurate requests for scheduling
4. **Enable Consolidation**: Let Karpenter optimize node utilization automatically
5. **Separate Workload Classes**: Use multiple NodePools for different requirements
6. **Monitor Provisioning**: Track provisioning latency and failures
7. **Test Spot Interruptions**: Ensure graceful handling of spot instance terminations
8. **Use Topology Spread**: Combine with pod topology constraints for availability

## Monitoring and Troubleshooting

### Key Metrics to Monitor

```text
# Provisioning metrics
karpenter_nodes_created_total
karpenter_nodes_terminated_total
karpenter_provisioner_scheduling_duration_seconds

# Disruption metrics
karpenter_disruption_replacement_node_initialized_seconds
karpenter_disruption_consolidation_actions_performed_total
karpenter_disruption_budgets_allowed_disruptions

# Cost metrics
karpenter_provisioner_instance_type_price_estimate
karpenter_cloudprovider_instance_type_offering_price_estimate

# Pod metrics
karpenter_pods_state (pending, running, etc.)
```

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: Pods stuck in Pending

- Check NodePool requirements match pod node selectors/tolerations
- Verify cloud provider limits not exceeded
- Check instance type availability in selected zones
- Ensure subnet capacity available

#### Issue: Excessive node churn

- Adjust consolidation delay (consolidateAfter)
- Review disruption budgets
- Check if pod resource requests are accurate
- Consider using WhenEmpty instead of WhenUnderutilized

#### Issue: High costs despite using Karpenter

- Enable consolidation if not already active
- Verify spot instances are being used
- Check if pods have unnecessarily large resource requests
- Review instance type selection (allow more variety)

#### Issue: Spot interruptions causing service disruption

- Implement Pod Disruption Budgets
- Use diverse instance types for better spot availability
- Configure appropriate replica counts
- Implement graceful shutdown in applications

## Integration with Terraform

```hcl
# Install Karpenter via Terraform
resource "helm_release" "karpenter" {
  namespace        = "karpenter"
  create_namespace = true
  name             = "karpenter"
  repository       = "oci://public.ecr.aws/karpenter"
  chart            = "karpenter"
  version          = "v0.33.0"

  values = [
    <<-EOT

    EOT
  ]

  depends_on = [
    aws_iam_role_policy_attachment.karpenter_controller
  ]
}

# Deploy default NodePool
resource "kubectl_manifest" "karpenter_nodepool_default" {
  yaml_body = <<-YAML
    apiVersion: karpenter.sh/v1beta1

}
```

## Migration from Cluster Autoscaler

1. **Plan the migration**

   - Identify current node groups and their characteristics
   - Map workloads to new NodePool configurations
   - Plan for coexistence period

2. **Deploy Karpenter alongside Cluster Autoscaler**

   - Install Karpenter in the cluster
   - Create NodePools with distinct labels
   - Test with non-critical workloads first

3. **Migrate workloads incrementally**

   - Update pod specs with Karpenter tolerations/node selectors
   - Monitor provisioning and consolidation behavior
   - Validate cost and performance metrics

4. **Remove Cluster Autoscaler**

   - Once all workloads migrated, scale down CA node groups
   - Remove Cluster Autoscaler deployment
   - Clean up CA-specific resources
