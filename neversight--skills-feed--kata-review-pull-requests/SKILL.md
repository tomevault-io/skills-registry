description: Run a comprehensive pull request review using multiple specialized agents. Each agent focuses on a different aspect of code quality, such as comments, tests, error handling, type design, and general code review. The skill aggregates results and provides a clear action plan for improvements. Triggers include "review PR", "analyze pull request", "code review", and "PR quality check". Use when this capability is needed.

# Comprehensive PR Review

Run a comprehensive pull request review by spawning `general-purpose` subagents with inlined reference instructions. Each subagent gets a fresh context window with its specialized review instructions, the diff, and project context.

**Review Aspects (optional):** "$ARGUMENTS"

<process>

## 1. Determine Review Scope

- Check git status to identify changed files
- Parse arguments to see if user requested specific review aspects
- Default: Run all applicable reviews

## 2. Available Review Aspects

| Aspect       | Reference File                        | Purpose                                    |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **code**     | code-reviewer-instructions.md         | General code review for project guidelines |
| **tests**    | pr-test-analyzer-instructions.md      | Test coverage quality and completeness     |
| **comments** | comment-analyzer-instructions.md      | Code comment accuracy and maintainability  |
| **errors**   | silent-failure-hunter-instructions.md | Silent failures and error handling         |
| **types**    | type-design-analyzer-instructions.md  | Type design and invariants                 |
| **simplify** | code-simplifier-instructions.md       | Code clarity and maintainability           |
| **all**      | _(all applicable)_                    | Run all reviews (default)                  |

## 3. Identify Changed Files

- Run `git diff --name-only` to see modified files
- Check if PR already exists: `gh pr view`
- Identify file types and what reviews apply

**Error handling:**
- If `git diff` fails (not a git repo): Report error clearly and stop
- If `gh pr view` fails with "no PR found": Expected for pre-PR reviews, continue with git diff
- If `gh pr view` fails with auth error: Note that GitHub CLI authentication is needed
- If no changed files found: Report "No changes detected" and stop

## 4. Determine Applicable Reviews

Based on changes:
- **Always applicable**: code (general quality)
- **If test files changed**: tests
- **If comments/docs added**: comments
- **If error handling changed**: errors
- **If types added/modified**: types
- **After passing review**: simplify (polish and refine)

## 5. Read Reference Instructions

Read each applicable reference file into a variable for inlining into subagent prompts:

```
code_instructions      = Read("./references/code-reviewer-instructions.md")
test_instructions      = Read("./references/pr-test-analyzer-instructions.md")
comment_instructions   = Read("./references/comment-analyzer-instructions.md")
errors_instructions    = Read("./references/silent-failure-hunter-instructions.md")
types_instructions     = Read("./references/type-design-analyzer-instructions.md")
simplify_instructions  = Read("./references/code-simplifier-instructions.md")
```

Only read files for applicable review aspects. Also read:
- `git diff` output into `diff_content`
- `CLAUDE.md` (if exists) into `project_context`

## 6. Resolve Model Profile

```bash
MODEL_PROFILE=$(cat .planning/config.json 2>/dev/null | grep -o '"model_profile"[[:space:]]*:[[:space:]]*"[^"]*"' | grep -o '"[^"]*"$' | tr -d '"' || echo "balanced")
```

Default to "balanced" if not set.

**Model lookup table:**

| Agent            | quality | balanced | budget |
| ---------------- | ------- | -------- | ------ |
| code-reviewer    | opus    | sonnet   | sonnet |
| test-analyzer    | sonnet  | sonnet   | haiku  |
| comment-analyzer | sonnet  | sonnet   | haiku  |
| failure-hunter   | sonnet  | sonnet   | haiku  |
| type-analyzer    | sonnet  | sonnet   | haiku  |
| code-simplifier  | sonnet  | sonnet   | haiku  |

## 7. Launch Review Agents

Spawn `general-purpose` subagents via parallel Task calls. Each agent receives its reference instructions inlined as `<agent-instructions>`, the diff, and project context.

**Task call pattern:**

```
Task(
  prompt="<agent-instructions>\n{instructions_content}\n</agent-instructions>\n\nReview the following changes:\n\n<diff>\n{diff_content}\n</diff>\n\n<project-context>\n{project_context}\n</project-context>",
  subagent_type="general-purpose",
  model="{resolved_model}",
  description="PR review: {aspect}"
)
```

**Example parallel launch (3 agents):**

```
Task(prompt="<agent-instructions>\n{code_instructions}\n</agent-instructions>\n\nReview these changes:\n<diff>\n{diff_content}\n</diff>\n<project-context>\n{project_context}\n</project-context>", subagent_type="general-purpose", model="{code_model}", description="PR review: code")
Task(prompt="<agent-instructions>\n{test_instructions}\n</agent-instructions>\n\nReview these changes:\n<diff>\n{diff_content}\n</diff>\n<project-context>\n{project_context}\n</project-context>", subagent_type="general-purpose", model="{test_model}", description="PR review: tests")
Task(prompt="<agent-instructions>\n{errors_instructions}\n</agent-instructions>\n\nReview these changes:\n<diff>\n{diff_content}\n</diff>\n<project-context>\n{project_context}\n</project-context>", subagent_type="general-purpose", model="{errors_model}", description="PR review: errors")
```

All run in parallel. Task tool blocks until all complete.

**Agent failure handling:**
- If agent completes: Include results in aggregation
- If agent times out: Report "[aspect] review timed out - consider running independently"
- If agent fails: Report "[aspect] review failed: [error reason]"
- If one agent fails, STILL proceed with remaining agents
- **Never silently skip a failed agent** - always report its status

## 8. Aggregate Results

After agents complete, summarize:
- **Critical Issues** (must fix before merge)
- **Important Issues** (should fix)
- **Suggestions** (nice to have)
- **Positive Observations** (what's good)

**Edge cases:**
- If no issues found: "All Checks Passed" summary
- If agents conflict: Note the disagreement and let user decide
- If agent output malformed: Note "[aspect] output could not be parsed"
- Always include count of agents completed vs failed

## 9. Provide Action Plan

Organize findings:

```markdown
# PR Review Summary

## Critical Issues (X found)
- [aspect]: Issue description [file:line]

## Important Issues (X found)
- [aspect]: Issue description [file:line]

## Suggestions (X found)
- [aspect]: Suggestion [file:line]

## Strengths
- What's well-done in this PR

## Recommended Action
1. Fix critical issues first
2. Address important issues
3. Consider suggestions
4. Re-run review after fixes
```
