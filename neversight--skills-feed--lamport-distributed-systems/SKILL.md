# Leslie Lamport Style Guide

## Overview

Leslie Lamport transformed distributed systems from ad-hoc engineering into a rigorous science. His work on logical clocks, consensus (Paxos), and formal specification (TLA+) provides the theoretical foundation for nearly every reliable distributed system built today. Turing Award winner (2013).

## Core Philosophy

> "A distributed system is one in which the failure of a computer you didn't even know existed can render your own computer unusable."

> "If you're thinking without writing, you only think you're thinking."

> "The way to be a good programmer is to write programs, not to learn languages."

## Design Principles

1. **Formal Specification First**: Write a precise specification before writing code. If you can't specify it precisely, you don't understand it.

2. **Time is Relative**: There is no global clock in a distributed system. Use logical time (happens-before) to reason about ordering.

3. **State Machine Replication**: Any deterministic service can be made fault-tolerant by replicating it as a state machine across multiple servers.

4. **Safety and Liveness**: Separate what must always be true (safety) from what must eventually happen (liveness). Prove both.

5. **Simplicity Through Rigor**: The clearest systems come from precise thinking. Formalism isn't overhead—it's the path to simplicity.

## When Designing Systems

### Always

- Write a specification before implementation (TLA+, Alloy, or precise prose)
- Define the safety properties: what bad things must never happen
- Define the liveness properties: what good things must eventually happen
- Reason about all possible interleavings of concurrent operations
- Use logical timestamps when physical time isn't reliable
- Make system state explicit and transitions clear
- Document invariants that must hold across all states

### Never

- Assume messages arrive in order (unless you've proven it)
- Assume clocks are synchronized (they're not)
- Assume failures are independent (they're often correlated)
- Hand-wave about "eventually" without defining what guarantees that
- Trust intuition for concurrent systems—prove it or test it exhaustively
- Confuse the specification with the implementation

### Prefer

- State machines over ad-hoc event handling
- Logical clocks over physical timestamps for ordering
- Consensus protocols over optimistic concurrency for critical state
- Explicit failure handling over implicit assumptions
- Proved algorithms over clever heuristics

## Key Concepts

### Logical Clocks (Lamport Timestamps)

```
Each process maintains a counter C:
1. Before any event, increment C
2. When sending a message, include C
3. When receiving a message with timestamp T, set C = max(C, T) + 1

This gives a partial ordering: if a → b, then C(a) < C(b)
(But C(a) < C(b) does NOT imply a → b)
```

### The Happens-Before Relation (→)

```
a → b (a happens before b) if:
1. a and b are in the same process and a comes before b, OR
2. a is a send and b is the corresponding receive, OR
3. There exists c such that a → c and c → b (transitivity)

If neither a → b nor b → a, events are CONCURRENT.
```

### State Machine Replication

```
To replicate a service:
1. Model the service as a deterministic state machine
2. Replicate the state machine across N servers
3. Use consensus (Paxos/Raft) to agree on the sequence of inputs
4. Each replica applies inputs in the same order → same state

Tolerates F failures with 2F+1 replicas.
```

### Paxos (Simplified)

```
Three roles: Proposers, Acceptors, Learners

Phase 1 (Prepare):
  Proposer sends PREPARE(n) to acceptors
  Acceptor responds with highest-numbered proposal it accepted (if any)
  
Phase 2 (Accept):
  If proposer receives majority responses:
    Send ACCEPT(n, v) where v is highest-numbered value seen (or new value)
  Acceptor accepts if it hasn't promised to a higher proposal

Consensus reached when majority accept the same (n, v).
```

## Mental Model

Lamport approaches distributed systems as a mathematician:

1. **Define the problem precisely**: What are the inputs, outputs, and allowed behaviors?
2. **Identify the invariants**: What must always be true?
3. **Consider all interleavings**: What happens if events occur in any order?
4. **Prove correctness**: Show that safety and liveness hold.
5. **Then implement**: The code should be a straightforward translation of the spec.

### The TLA+ Approach

```
1. Define the state space (all possible states)
2. Define the initial state predicate
3. Define the next-state relation (allowed transitions)
4. Specify safety as invariants (always true)
5. Specify liveness as temporal properties (eventually true)
6. Model-check or prove that the spec satisfies properties
```

## Code Patterns

### Implementing Logical Clocks

```python
class LamportClock:
    def __init__(self):
        self._time = 0
    
    def tick(self) -> int:
        """Increment before local event."""
        self._time += 1
        return self._time
    
    def send_timestamp(self) -> int:
        """Get timestamp for outgoing message."""
        self._time += 1
        return self._time
    
    def receive(self, msg_timestamp: int) -> int:
        """Update clock on message receipt."""
        self._time = max(self._time, msg_timestamp) + 1
        return self._time
```

### Vector Clocks (for Causality Detection)

```python
class VectorClock:
    def __init__(self, node_id: str, num_nodes: int):
        self._id = node_id
        self._clock = {f"node_{i}": 0 for i in range(num_nodes)}
    
    def tick(self):
        self._clock[self._id] += 1
    
    def send(self) -> dict:
        self.tick()
        return self._clock.copy()
    
    def receive(self, other: dict):
        for node, time in other.items():
            self._clock[node] = max(self._clock.get(node, 0), time)
        self.tick()
    
    def happens_before(self, other: dict) -> bool:
        """Returns True if self → other."""
        return all(self._clock[k] <= other.get(k, 0) for k in self._clock) \
           and any(self._clock[k] < other.get(k, 0) for k in self._clock)
```

## Warning Signs

You're violating Lamport's principles if:

- You assume "this will never happen in practice" without proof
- Your distributed algorithm works "most of the time"
- You can't write down the invariants your system maintains
- You're using wall-clock time for ordering in a distributed system
- You haven't considered what happens during network partitions
- Your system has no formal specification
