# Langfuse API

Help users interact with Langfuse via the REST API.

## When to Use

- User wants to query or export traces
- User wants to manage prompts programmatically
- User wants to create/update datasets or dataset items
- User wants to fetch or create scores
- User wants to manage projects or API keys
- Any other Langfuse API interaction

## Workflow

### 1. Check Credentials

Before making any API call, verify credentials are available:

```bash
echo $LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY   # pk-...
echo $LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY   # sk-...
echo $LANGFUSE_HOST         # https://cloud.langfuse.com (or self-hosted/EU/US URL)
```

If not set, ask user:
- "I need your Langfuse API credentials. You can find them in Settings → API Keys in the Langfuse UI."
- "Which Langfuse host are you using? (cloud.langfuse.com, us.cloud.langfuse.com, eu.cloud.langfuse.com, or self-hosted URL)"

### 2. Fetch Fresh API Reference

**Always fetch the current API reference before making calls.** The API may have new endpoints or changed parameters.

Fetch: https://api.reference.langfuse.com

Look for the specific endpoint needed for the user's request. The reference contains:
- All available endpoints
- Required and optional parameters
- Request/response schemas
- Authentication details

### 3. Make the API Call

**Authentication:** Basic Auth with `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY` as username and `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY` as password.

**Base URL:** `{LANGFUSE_HOST}/api/public`

Example:
```bash
curl -X GET "${LANGFUSE_HOST}/api/public/traces" \
  -u "${LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY}:${LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### 4. Handle Pagination

Many endpoints return paginated results. Check for:
- `page` and `limit` parameters
- `meta.totalItems` and `meta.totalPages` in response
- Iterate if user needs all results

## Common Use Cases

| User Request | Endpoint to Look Up |
|--------------|---------------------|
| "Get my recent traces" | GET /traces |
| "Export traces from last week" | GET /traces with date filters |
| "Fetch a specific prompt" | GET /prompts/{name} |
| "Create a dataset" | POST /datasets |
| "Add items to dataset" | POST /dataset-items |
| "Get scores for a trace" | GET /scores with traceId filter |
| "List all prompts" | GET /prompts |

## Important Notes

- **Always fetch fresh docs** - Don't rely on cached knowledge of the API
- **Check rate limits** - The API has rate limits; handle 429 responses
- **Validate responses** - Check for errors before processing data
- **Large exports** - For bulk data, use pagination and consider streaming to file
