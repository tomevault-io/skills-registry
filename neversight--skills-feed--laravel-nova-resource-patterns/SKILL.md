# Nova Resource Patterns

Build consistent Nova resources that mirror domain models and evolve safely.

## Fields

- Keep fields ordered: identifiers → primary attributes → relations → meta
- Use `->sortable()`/`->filterable()` where it delivers value
- Hide sensitive fields (e.g., tokens) from index/detail unless necessary
- Prefer `BelongsTo`/`HasMany`/`Morph*` relations with searchable constraints

## Authorization

- Use Nova policies mirroring model policies for `viewAny`, `view`, `create`, `update`, `delete`
- Avoid leaking existence via unauthorized search; scope queries

## Actions

- Keep actions idempotent or provide safeguards
- Provide confirmation messages and clear result feedback

## Filters & Lenses

- Filters: simple, commonly used constraints (status, owner, date range)
- Lenses: opinionated, task‑centric views (e.g., stale items)

## Metrics

- Value/Trend/Partition metrics for essentials; cache appropriately
- Use explicit time ranges; label units clearly

## Resource Organization

- Group resources by domain (navigation grouping)
- Keep display titles meaningful; use `title()` consistently

## Testing

- Prefer feature tests that exercise policy + query scope + resource logic
- For actions, test success and failure states with realistic seed data
