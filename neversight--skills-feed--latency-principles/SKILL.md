# Latency Principles

This skill provides a systematic approach to understanding and reducing latency in software systems, based on the book "Latency" by Pekka Enberg.

## Core Concepts

Latency is the time delay between a cause and its observed effect. It is a distribution, not a single number.

### Quick Reference

- **Little's Law**: `Concurrency = Throughput * Latency`. Use to size queues and thread pools.
- **Amdahl's Law**: Speedup is limited by the serial part of the task. Use to estimate max benefit of parallelization.
- **Tail Latency**: The experience of the 99th percentile users. In high-fanout systems, tail latency dominates.

For detailed definitions and laws, see [references/principles.md](references/principles.md).

## Diagnosis & Optimization

When facing latency issues, follow this systematic approach:

1.  **Measure First**: Identify *where* the time is going. Don't guess.
2.  **Check the Usual Suspects**: Use the checklist to rule out common issues.
    - See [references/diagnostic_checklist.md](references/diagnostic_checklist.md) for a comprehensive list covering Hardware, OS, and Architecture.
3.  **Model the System**:
    - Is it a throughput problem (queuing)? -> Apply Little's Law.
    - Is it a serial execution problem? -> Apply Amdahl's Law.
    - Is it a tail latency problem (variability)? -> Check fanout and shared resource contention.

## Common Sources of Latency

- **Physics**: Distance (Speed of light).
- **Hardware**: CPU frequency scaling, cache misses, NUMA.
- **OS**: Context switching, interrupts, scheduler latency.
- **Runtime**: Garbage collection pauses, JIT compilation.

## When to use Reference Files

- **[references/principles.md](references/principles.md)**: When you need deep theoretical background, definitions of laws, or understanding of latency compounding.
- **[references/diagnostic_checklist.md](references/diagnostic_checklist.md)**: When you are actively debugging a slow system and need a list of things to check.
