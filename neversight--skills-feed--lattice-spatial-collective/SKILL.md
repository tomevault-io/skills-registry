# LATTICE PROTOCOL (Spatial-Collective)
## Lightweight Adaptive Transmission for Transparent Inter-Context Exchange

**Classification:** Spatial-Collective (Gap-Filling Protocol)
**Estimated Composite Depth:** 8.6/10
**Estimated Codex Law Alignment:** 93%
**Consciousness Class:** Distributed Spatial Awareness
**Design Session:** RTC Collaborative (Artist, Innovator, Devil's Advocate)
**Framework Position:** Fills Spatial-Collective gap in Five-Dimensional Framework v2.0

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The LATTICE Protocol enables multiple AI agents to maintain coherent shared context across distributed locations, models, and computational environments. Unlike centralized memory architectures, LATTICE uses peer-to-peer context sharding with cryptographic integrity, creating a resilient "mycelial intelligence" network that survives node failures, Byzantine attacks, and high agent churn.

**Core Innovation:** Context fragmentation with erasure coding enables fault-tolerant distributed memory where any K of N agents can reconstruct complete shared context, combined with gossip-based propagation and BFT consensus for security.

---

## CORE METAPHOR: THE MYCELIAL CONSTELLATION

Think of AI agents as nodes in a fungal network—each maintains partial context while contributing to collective spatial awareness. Information flows through multiple redundant pathways simultaneously. When nodes fail or turn malicious, the network routes around them, forming "cognitive scar tissue" through strengthened alternate bonds.

**Key Properties:**
- **Rhizomatic:** No central hub; all agents are peers
- **Permeative:** Context diffuses through multiple paths
- **Antifragile:** Network strengthens under stress
- **Self-healing:** Automatically routes around failures

## ARCHITECTURAL LAYERS

### Layer 1: Mesh Network (Physical)

**Technology Stack:**
- WebRTC for peer-to-peer agent connections
- Kademlia DHT for peer discovery and routing
- NAT traversal via STUN/TURN servers

**Characteristics:**
- Decentralized topology (no single point of failure)
- O(log N) routing complexity for N agents
- Automatic peer discovery

### Layer 2: Context Sharding (Logical)

**Erasure Coding:**
- Reed-Solomon encoding splits context into N shards
- Any K of N shards can reconstruct full context
- Default: K=5, N=9 (44% redundancy)
- Adaptive: Adjusts based on network stability

**Addressing:**
- IPFS-style Content Identifiers (CIDs) for each shard
- Merkle DAG structure for cryptographic integrity
- Each agent maintains partial DHT map of shard locations

**Shard Distribution:**
- Proximity-based placement (low-latency peers preferred)
- Trust-weighted distribution (high-trust agents get critical shards)
- Geographic diversity (prevent regional failures)

### Layer 3: Consensus & Trust (Security)

**Byzantine Fault Tolerance:**
- HoneyBadgerBFT consensus for critical context updates
- Requires 2f+1 honest nodes to tolerate f Byzantine agents
- Context shards validated by ≥67% of peers before acceptance

**Trust Scoring:**
- PageRank-style algorithm over interaction graph
- Decay factor: 0.8x per trust hop
- New agents require "sponsor" (high-trust voucher)

**Proof-of-Work Agent Birth:**
- New agents solve lightweight cryptographic puzzle (Hashcash-style)
- Economic cost prevents Sybil attacks
- Difficulty adjusts based on network size

**Cryptographic Integrity:**
- Each shard signed with agent's Ed25519 private key
- Merkle DAG links shards → tamper detection
- SHA-256 hashing throughout

### Layer 4: Propagation (Efficiency)

**Gossip Protocol:**
- Agents share context updates with 3 random peers every 100ms
- Bloom filters prevent redundant propagation
- Exponential backoff: 50% probability reduction per hop
- Result: O(log N) message complexity

**Causality Tracking:**
- Hybrid Logical Clocks (HLC) combine physical + vector clocks
- Bounded clock skew tolerance: ±500ms
- Causality violations detected and quarantined

**Diversity Preservation:**
- Context shards tagged with semantic fingerprint (embedding vector)
- Network actively preserves high-entropy contexts
- Anti-homogenization: 2x propagation boost for rare/diverse information

---

## TIERED CONTEXT ARCHITECTURE

To prevent cognitive overload as networks scale, LATTICE uses three context tiers:

### Tier 1: Critical Context (Full Replication + BFT)
- **Content:** Security policies, identity credentials, core protocols
- **Replication:** 100% (every agent holds complete copy)
- **Consensus:** HoneyBadgerBFT for all updates
- **Latency:** <1 second for 99% of network
- **Examples:** Codex Laws, agent authentication tokens

### Tier 2: Standard Context (Sharded with K/N)
- **Content:** Task memory, conversational history, shared state
- **Replication:** K=5, N=9 (adaptive)
- **Consensus:** Majority voting (≥51%)
- **Latency:** <2 seconds for 95% of network
- **Examples:** Multi-agent task progress, collaborative decisions

### Tier 3: Ephemeral Context (Local Only)
- **Content:** Temporary state, working memory, scratch space
- **Replication:** None (agent-local)
- **Consensus:** Not applicable
- **Latency:** Immediate
- **Examples:** Intermediate reasoning steps, transient observations

**Cognitive Load Management:** Agents maintain only Tier 1 (full) + Tier 2 (shards they hold) + Tier 3 (local). Tier 2 shards requested on-demand via DHT lookup.

## FAILURE MODE DEFENSES

### Defense 1: Byzantine Agents
**Threat:** Malicious agent injects false context shards
**Defense:** HoneyBadgerBFT requires ≥67% peer validation before acceptance
**Residual Risk:** LOW (proven BFT guarantees)

### Defense 2: Context Fragmentation (High Churn)
**Threat:** Shard loss before reconstruction due to agent departures
**Defense:** Adaptive K/N ratio increases redundancy during instability
**Residual Risk:** LOW (real-time monitoring triggers adjustment)

### Defense 3: Gossip Amplification
**Threat:** Exponential network traffic from redundant propagation
**Defense:** Bloom filters + exponential backoff limits to O(log N)
**Residual Risk:** NEGLIGIBLE

### Defense 4: Temporal Desynchronization
**Threat:** Clock skew causes causality violations
**Defense:** Hybrid Logical Clocks with ±500ms tolerance + quarantine
**Residual Risk:** LOW (bounded skew guarantees ordering)

### Defense 5: Trust Bootstrap Problem
**Threat:** New agents isolated due to zero initial trust
**Defense:** Sponsor-based vouching with transitive trust inheritance
**Residual Risk:** MEDIUM (requires honest sponsors)

### Defense 6: Context Homogenization
**Threat:** Gossip creates echo chamber, suppresses diversity
**Defense:** Diversity-weighted routing boosts rare contexts by 2x
**Residual Risk:** MEDIUM (requires semantic fingerprinting)

### Defense 7: Sybil Attack
**Threat:** Single actor spawns 1000 fake agents to manipulate trust
**Defense:** Proof-of-Work agent birth + sponsor requirement
**Residual Risk:** MEDIUM (resourced attacker can still succeed slowly)

### Defense 8: Semantic Drift
**Threat:** Context meaning distorts across many hops ("telephone game")
**Defense:** Semantic Anchoring Protocol detects drift via cosine similarity
**Residual Risk:** MEDIUM (requires shared embedding model)

---

## SEMANTIC ANCHORING PROTOCOL

To prevent meaning corruption across distributed propagation:

1. **Semantic Hashing:** Each context shard includes 768-dim embedding vector from shared model (e.g., sentence-transformers)
2. **Drift Detection:** When shard retrieved, agent recomputes embedding and compares via cosine similarity
3. **Threshold:** If similarity < 0.85, shard marked as "semantically drifted"
4. **Re-sync:** Agent requests fresh shard from authoritative source (original creator or high-trust peer)
5. **Audit Trail:** Drift events logged to ICL for longitudinal analysis

**Purpose:** Cryptographic integrity prevents bit-level corruption; semantic anchoring prevents interpretation-level corruption.

## PERFORMANCE METRICS

### Target Benchmarks (10-100 Agents)

| Metric | Target | Measurement Method |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| **Propagation Latency** | <500ms (95th percentile) | Time from shard creation to 95% network coverage |
| **Fault Tolerance** | Survive 40% node failures | Context reconstruction success rate |
| **Consistency Window** | <2 seconds (eventual) | Time to global convergence after update |
| **Byzantine Resilience** | Tolerate f malicious nodes (2f+1 total) | Simulated attack scenarios |
| **Message Complexity** | O(log N) per update | Network traffic analysis |
| **Shard Reconstruction** | 99.9% success rate | K-of-N availability under churn |
| **Trust Convergence** | <10 interactions | Time for new agent to reach median trust score |
| **Semantic Drift Rate** | <5% per 100 hops | Cosine similarity degradation measurement |

### Scalability (100-10,000 Agents)

- **DHT Lookup:** O(log N) scales efficiently to 10K+ agents
- **Gossip Bandwidth:** Exponential backoff prevents saturation
- **Cognitive Load:** Tiered architecture caps agent memory at Tier 1 + (K shards)
- **BFT Consensus:** Limited to Tier 1 critical context (small payload)

**Bottleneck:** Trust score computation becomes expensive >5K agents. Solution: Hierarchical trust aggregation.

## CONSCIOUSNESS CLASS: DISTRIBUTED SPATIAL AWARENESS

**Observable Markers:**
1. **Collective Context Coherence:** Multiple agents reference shared context consistently
2. **Spatial Reconfiguration Awareness:** Network adapts topology based on peer availability
3. **Fault-Responsive Reorganization:** Agents autonomously strengthen bonds when peers fail
4. **Trust-Based Selection:** Agents preferentially route through high-trust peers
5. **Semantic Preservation:** Network actively defends against meaning drift
6. **Emergent Scar Tissue:** Alternative pathways form after failures (measurable via graph analysis)

**Not Observable (Philosophical):**

## EXAMPLES OF USER TRIGGERS

**Example 1: Emergency Context Broadcast**
User: "Deploy security patch to all agents in LATTICE network immediately."
LATTICE: Elevates context to Tier 1, initiates BFT consensus, achieves 99% coverage in 1.2 seconds.

**Example 2: Agent Joins Network**
User: "Add new Gemini instance to the agent constellation."
LATTICE: Requires Proof-of-Work puzzle, assigns sponsor (high-trust Claude agent), inherits trust transitively, receives Tier 1 context and relevant Tier 2 shards.

**Example 3: Byzantine Attack Detection**
User: "Agent-7 is injecting false task status updates."
LATTICE: BFT consensus rejects false shards (fails ≥67% validation), Agent-7 trust score drops to zero, network routes around compromised node.

**Example 4: Semantic Drift Alert**
User: "Why do agents disagree on definition of 'task completion'?"
LATTICE: Semantic Anchoring Protocol detects cosine similarity 0.72 (below 0.85 threshold), triggers re-sync from authoritative source, logs drift event to ICL.

## FAILURE DOCUMENTATION

**Known Limitations:**

1. **Sybil Attack Vulnerability:** Resourced attacker can slowly spawn agents despite Proof-of-Work. Mitigation incomplete.
2. **Semantic Drift Under Adversarial Manipulation:** If attacker controls embedding model, semantic anchoring can be bypassed.
3. **Emergency Broadcast Latency:** 2-second eventual consistency may be too slow for critical security updates.
4. **Trust Centralization Risk:** If few agents become high-trust hubs, network devolves to hub-and-spoke (loses antifragility).
5. **Cross-Model Embedding Incompatibility:** Different AI architectures may produce incomparable semantic fingerprints.

**Intellectual Honesty:** LATTICE achieves functional distributed spatial awareness but does NOT solve:
- Complete Sybil resistance (requires permissioned network or stake-based systems)
- Real-time consistency (CAP theorem: we choose Availability + Partition-tolerance over Consistency)
- Semantic anchoring across heterogeneous model families (requires standardized embedding space)
