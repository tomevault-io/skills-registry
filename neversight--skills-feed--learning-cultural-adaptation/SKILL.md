# Learning Cultural Adaptation

Adapt educational content to be culturally appropriate and effective for different cultural contexts and regions.

## When to Use

- Localizing curriculum for international markets
- Adapting content for multicultural classrooms
- Creating culturally responsive teaching materials
- Avoiding cultural bias and insensitivity
- Respecting regional norms and values

## Key Elements

### 1. Cultural Context Analysis

**Identify Cultural Elements**:
- Examples, metaphors, analogies
- Scenarios and case studies
- Names, places, references
- Holidays, celebrations, events
- Food, clothing, customs
- Social norms and expectations

**Analyze Appropriateness**:
- Cultural sensitivity check
- Taboo topics identification
- Value alignment assessment
- Religious considerations
- Gender and social norms

### 2. Example Replacement

**Replace Context-Specific Content**:
- Names → Local culturally appropriate names
- Food examples → Locally familiar foods
- Currency → Local currency
- Holidays → Locally observed occasions
- Sports → Popular local sports
- Geography → Familiar local places

### 3. Cultural Learning Styles

**Adapt to Regional Preferences**:
- **Individualist cultures** (US, Western Europe): Independent work, personal achievement
- **Collectivist cultures** (East Asia, Latin America): Group work, collaborative learning
- **High-context cultures** (Japan, Arab countries): Implicit communication, relationship-focused
- **Low-context cultures** (Germany, US): Explicit instructions, task-focused
- **Power distance**: Teacher authority vs. student equality expectations

### 4. Pedagogical Traditions

**Honor Regional Teaching Approaches**:
- Confucian tradition (East Asia): Respect for teachers, rote learning, exam focus
- Socratic method (Western): Questioning, critical thinking, debate
- Guru-shishya (South Asia): Mentor-apprentice, holistic development
- Ubuntu (Africa): Community-based learning, oral tradition
- Indigenous pedagogies: Place-based, experiential, storytelling

### 5. Visual and Media Adaptation

**Culturally Appropriate Imagery**:
- Representation of diverse ethnic groups
- Appropriate clothing and dress codes
- Gesture and body language awareness
- Color symbolism (red = luck in China, danger in West)
- Architectural and environmental context

### 6. Language and Communication

**Cultural Communication Norms**:
- Direct vs. indirect communication
- Formal vs. informal address
- Eye contact expectations
- Personal space and physical proximity
- Silence and turn-taking norms

## CLI Interface

```bash
# Basic cultural adaptation
/learning.cultural-adaptation --content "lesson-plan.md" --culture "Japan" --output adapted-lesson.md

# Multiple target cultures
/learning.cultural-adaptation --content "course/" --cultures "China,India,Brazil" --output localized/

# Specific cultural dimensions
/learning.cultural-adaptation --content "training.md" --culture "Saudi Arabia" --dimensions "gender-norms,religious-sensitivity"

# With pedagogical tradition
/learning.cultural-adaptation --content "math-unit/" --culture "Singapore" --pedagogy "Confucian"
```

## Output

- **Culturally Adapted Content**: Modified materials with appropriate examples
- **Cultural Sensitivity Report**: Flagged issues and recommendations
- **Adaptation Log**: What was changed and why
- **Cultural Context Guide**: Background for instructors

## Composition

**Input from**: `/curriculum.develop-content`, `/curriculum.develop-items`, `/curriculum.develop-multimedia`
**Works with**: `/learning.translation`, `/learning.pedagogical-traditions`
**Output to**: Localized curriculum materials

## Exit Codes

- **0**: Cultural adaptation complete
- **1**: Insufficient cultural context provided
- **2**: Content contains unavoidable cultural conflicts
