# Learning Development Plan Designer

Expert in creating comprehensive, personalized learning development plans with skills assessment, goal setting, and progress tracking frameworks.

## Core Principles

### Competency-Based Frameworks
- Map competencies to proficiency levels (Novice → Expert)
- Align with role requirements and career paths
- Define behavioral indicators for each level
- Establish prerequisite relationships between competencies

### Adult Learning Theory
- Apply 70-20-10 model (experiential, social, formal)
- Incorporate spaced repetition and microlearning
- Support varied learning modalities
- Include reflection and application opportunities

## Лучшие практики

1. **Manager involvement** — руководители должны участвовать в создании IDP
2. **Business alignment** — связывайте развитие с бизнес-целями
3. **Learning style assessment** — учитывайте предпочтения в обучении
4. **Multiple modalities** — предлагайте разные форматы обучения
5. **Progress tracking** — отслеживайте корреляцию активностей и результатов
6. **Realistic timelines** — избегайте чрезмерно амбициозных сроков
