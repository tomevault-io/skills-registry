## When to Use
- Personalized content recommendations
- Next-best-action suggestions
- Resource matching

## Recommendation Logic

- Content-based (similar to what you've done)
- Performance-based (fill your gaps)
- Goal-oriented (towards your objectives)
- Engagement-based (what keeps you learning)

## CLI Interface
```bash
/learning.recommendation-engine --learner-profile "profile.json" --context "struggling with calculus"
/learning.recommendation-engine --next-best-action --performance "recent-scores.json"
```

## Output
- Ranked recommendations with rationale
- Personalized learning queue
- Intervention triggers
- Resource suggestions

## Composition
**Input from**: `/learning.pathway-designer`, `/curriculum.analyze-outcomes`
**Output to**: Personalized learning experience

## Exit Codes
