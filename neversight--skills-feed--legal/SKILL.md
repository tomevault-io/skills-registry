# Legal Pages Workflow

Generate comprehensive legal pages (Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, Cookie Policy) through a guided, interactive process. Combines automatic project detection with user questions to create tailored documents.

**These are starting points that MUST be reviewed by a qualified lawyer before publishing.**

---

## Process Overview

```
Step 1: Disclaimer & Scope     → Set expectations
Step 2: Project Detection      → Scan codebase for data collection
Step 3: Guided Questions       → Interactive Q&A to fill gaps (5 rounds)
Step 4: Generate Documents     → Create tailored legal pages
Step 5: Implementation         → Add to project with proper routing
Step 6: Next Steps            → Cookie consent, lawyer review, etc.
```

## Step 1: Disclaimer & Scope

**Always start with this disclaimer:**

> ⚠️ **Important: These are template documents, not legal advice.**
>
> I'll generate comprehensive legal pages based on your project and answers, but:
> - I am not a lawyer and this is not legal advice
> - These templates should be reviewed by a qualified attorney
> - Laws vary by jurisdiction and change frequently
> - Regulated industries (healthcare, finance, children) have special requirements
>
> These documents will give you a solid starting point that covers common requirements under GDPR, CCPA, and general best practices.

**Ask: "Do you want to proceed with generating legal pages for this project?"**

## Step 2: Project Detection

Perform comprehensive codebase scan for data collection signals.

## Step 3: Guided Questions

Use AskUserQuestion tool for each round. One focused topic at a time.

### Round 1: Business Identity

```
Question: "What are your business details?"
Header: "Business"
Options: [Free text response needed]

Gather:
- Legal business name (e.g., "Acme Inc." or "John Smith trading as Acme")
- Country/state of incorporation or residence
- Business type: Company, LLC, Sole proprietor, etc.
- Website URL
- Contact email for privacy/legal inquiries

```

### Round 2: Target Audience & Jurisdiction

    → Covers EU, California, and general best practices
  - "US only"
    → CCPA for California, general US practices
  - "EU/EEA only"
    → GDPR-focused
  - "Specific countries"
    → Ask follow-up for which countries

Follow-up if needed:
Question: "Do you expect users under 18?"
Header: "Age"
Options:
  - "No, adults only (18+)"
  - "Yes, 13-17 with parental consent"
  - "Yes, under 13" → COPPA applies, special handling required
  - "Not sure"
```

### Round 3: Documents Needed

```
Question: "Which legal documents do you need?"
Header: "Documents"
MultiSelect: true
Options:
  - "Privacy Policy" [Required for almost all sites]
    → Required if you collect ANY data (even just analytics)
  - "Terms of Service"
    → Required for apps/SaaS, recommended for all
  - "Cookie Policy"
    → Required if using non-essential cookies (can be section in Privacy Policy)
  - "Acceptable Use Policy"
    → Recommended if users can post content or interact
```

### Round 4: Service Type & Features

```
Question: "What type of service is this?"
Header: "Service type"
Options:
  - "SaaS / Web application"
    → User accounts, possibly subscriptions
  - "E-commerce / Online store"
    → Products, checkout, shipping
  - "Content / Blog / Marketing site"
    → Minimal data collection
  - "Marketplace / Platform"
    → Multiple user types, transactions between users
  - "API / Developer tools"
    → API keys, usage data, developer accounts

Follow-up based on selection:
- SaaS: "Do you offer free trials? Refund policy? Subscription billing?"
- E-commerce: "Physical or digital products? Return policy? Shipping regions?"
- Marketplace: "Do you facilitate payments between users? Take commission?"
```

### Round 5: Specific Policies

```
Question: "What are your data practices?"
Header: "Practices"
MultiSelect: true
Options:
  - "We use data only for providing our service"
  - "We send marketing emails (with consent)"
  - "We share anonymized/aggregated data"
  - "We use AI/ML to process user data"
  - "We allow third-party integrations"

Question: "What is your refund/cancellation policy?"

Options:
  - "14-day money-back guarantee"

  - "Pro-rated refunds for annual plans"
  - "No refunds (for digital goods)"
  - "Custom policy" → Ask for details
```

## Step 4: Generate Documents

Based on detection + user answers, generate **fully personalized documents**.

### CRITICAL: No Placeholders

**DO NOT** generate documents with `[PLACEHOLDER]` markers. The documents must be:
- Filled in with actual company name, URLs, emails from user answers
- Populated with actual detected services (Stripe, Vercel, etc.) by name
- Include real cookie names and durations from detection
- Have actual data categories based on what was detected
- Remove sections that don't apply (e.g., no Payments section if no payments detected)

**Example — WRONG:**
```
We share data with [SERVICE_PROVIDERS].
Contact us at [EMAIL].
```

**Example — CORRECT:**
```
We share data with Vercel (hosting), Stripe (payments), and Resend (email).
Contact us at privacy@acme.com.
```

The templates below show the **structure**. When generating, replace ALL bracketed items with real values from detection and user answers. If a section doesn't apply to this project, omit it entirely.

---

### Structure Reference Templates

The template structures for each document are maintained in separate files. **Read these templates at runtime** to use as the structure reference when generating personalized documents:

- **Privacy Policy:** `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/privacy-policy.md`
- **Terms of Service:** `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/terms-of-service.md`
- **Cookie Policy:** `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/cookie-policy.md`

**Use Read tool** to load each template before generating. The templates show the **structure** — when generating, replace ALL bracketed items with real values from detection and user answers. If a section doesn't apply to this project, omit it entirely.

---

## Step 5: Implementation

### Create the Pages

**For Next.js App Router:**

```
app/
├── (legal)/
│   ├── layout.tsx          # Shared layout for legal pages
│   ├── privacy/page.tsx    # Privacy Policy
│   ├── terms/page.tsx      # Terms of Service
│   └── cookies/page.tsx    # Cookie Policy (or section in privacy)
```

**Example layout:**
```tsx
// app/(legal)/layout.tsx
export default function LegalLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <div className="container mx-auto max-w-3xl px-4 py-12">
      <article className="prose prose-gray dark:prose-invert max-w-none">
        {children}
      </article>
    </div>
  )
}
```

**Offer to create:**
1. The page files with generated content
2. Footer links to the legal pages
3. Cookie consent banner component (if needed)

---

## Step 6: Next Steps

Present to user after generation:

```markdown
## ✅ Legal Pages Generated

**Created:**
- `/privacy` — Privacy Policy
- `/terms` — Terms of Service
- `/cookies` — Cookie Policy

## Required Next Steps

1. **Add footer links**
   - Link to Privacy Policy, Terms, and Cookies from your site footer

2. **Cookie consent banner** (if using non-essential cookies)
   - Required before setting analytics/marketing cookies
   - Must offer "Reject All" option for GDPR compliance
   - Consider: [CookieConsent](https://github.com/orestbida/cookieconsent), [Osano](https://www.osano.com/), or custom

3. **Legal review**
   - Have these documents reviewed by a lawyer, especially if:
     - You handle sensitive data (health, financial)
     - You have users in multiple jurisdictions
     - You're in a regulated industry
     - You process children's data

4. **Keep updated**
   - Update "Last updated" date when you make changes
   - Review annually at minimum
   - Update when you add new data collection or third-party services

5. **Data Subject Requests**
   - Set up a process to handle privacy requests (access, deletion, etc.)
   - Aim to respond within 30 days (GDPR requirement)
```

<arc_log>
**After completing this skill, append to the activity log.**
See: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/arc-log.md`

Entry: `/arc:legal — Generated Privacy Policy, Terms, Cookie Policy`
</arc_log>

---

## Interop

- Invoked by **/arc:letsgo** when legal documents are missing
- May invoke **cookie consent implementation** after generating Cookie Policy
- References project detection patterns shared with /arc:letsgo
