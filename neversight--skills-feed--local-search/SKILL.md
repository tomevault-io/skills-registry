## Cost Optimization

### Use Partial Tier When:
- Just need name, address, basic info
- Browsing/discovering options
- Initial search before drilling down

### Use Full Tier When:
- Need reviews/ratings details
- Need atmosphere info (accessibility, etc.)
- Final decision-making

### Efficient Patterns

1. **Search partial, detail full:**
   - Text search (partial) to find places
   - Place details (full) for the one you care about

2. **Batch searches:**
   - Combine filters to reduce calls
   - Use `maxResultCount` to limit results

3. **Cache place IDs:**
   - Place IDs are stable
   - Re-fetch details only when needed
