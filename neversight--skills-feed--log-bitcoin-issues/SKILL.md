# /log-bitcoin-issues

Run Bitcoin integration audit and create GitHub issues for all findings.

## What This Does

1. Invoke `/check-bitcoin` to audit Bitcoin integration
2. Parse findings by priority (P0-P3)
3. Check existing issues to avoid duplicates
4. Create GitHub issues for each finding

**This is an issue-creator.** It creates work items, not fixes. Use `/fix-bitcoin` to fix issues.

## Process

### 1. Run Primitive

Invoke `/check-bitcoin` skill to get structured findings.

### 2. Check Existing Issues

```bash
gh issue list --state open --label "domain/bitcoin" --limit 50
```

### 3. Create Issues

For each finding:

```bash
gh issue create \
  --title "[P0] Hot wallet key stored in repo" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Problem
Bitcoin hot wallet private key committed in repo. Critical loss risk.

## Impact
- Funds theft
- Full wallet compromise
- Irreversible loss

## Location
`config/bitcoin.ts`

## Suggested Fix
Run `/fix-bitcoin` or move key to secret store and rotate.

## Priority Mapping

| Gap | Priority |
|-----|----------|
| Private key in code/repo | P0 |
| No confirmation checks | P0 |
| Wrong network (mainnet/testnet) | P0 |
| Address reuse | P1 |
| No reorg handling | P1 |
| No double-spend/mempool checks | P1 |
| No fee estimation/bumping | P2 |
| Single node/provider dependency | P2 |
| Missing monitoring/alerts | P2 |
| Advanced features (RBF/CPFP/PSBT) | P3 |

## Output

After running:
```
Bitcoin Issues Created:
- P0: 2 (keys, confirmations)
- P1: 3 (reorg, reuse, mempool)
- P2: 3 (fees, redundancy, alerts)
- P3: 1 (advanced features)

Total: 9 issues created
View: gh issue list --label domain/bitcoin
```
