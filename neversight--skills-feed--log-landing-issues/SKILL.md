# /log-landing-issues

Run landing page audit and create GitHub issues for all findings.

## What This Does

1. Invoke `/check-landing` to audit landing page quality
2. Parse findings by priority (P0-P3)
3. Check existing issues to avoid duplicates
4. Create GitHub issues for each finding

**This is an issue-creator.** It creates work items, not fixes. Use `/fix-landing` to fix issues.

## Process

### 1. Run Primitive

Invoke `/check-landing` skill to get structured findings.

### 2. Check Existing Issues

```bash
gh issue list --state open --label "domain/landing" --limit 50
```

### 3. Create Issues

For each finding:

```bash
gh issue create \
  --title "[P1] No clear value proposition on landing page" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Problem
Landing page lacks a clear, compelling headline. Users don't understand what the product does within 5 seconds.

## Impact
- High bounce rate
- Visitors leave without understanding value
- Low signup conversion
- Marketing spend wasted

## Location
`app/page.tsx` or `app/(marketing)/page.tsx`

## Suggested Fix
Run `/fix-landing` or add:
- Clear headline: "X for Y" or "Verb + Benefit"
- Sub-headline explaining how it works
- Hero section with clear visual

Examples:
- "Track your fitness journey. See results in weeks."
- "The newsletter for busy professionals. 5 min reads that matter."
