# /log-onboarding-issues

Run onboarding audit and create GitHub issues for all findings.

## What This Does

1. Invoke `/check-onboarding` to audit new user experience
2. Parse findings by priority (P0-P3)
3. Check existing issues to avoid duplicates
4. Create GitHub issues for each finding

**This is an issue-creator.** It creates work items, not fixes. Use `/fix-onboarding` to fix issues.

## Process

### 1. Run Primitive

Invoke `/check-onboarding` skill to get structured findings.

### 2. Check Existing Issues

```bash
gh issue list --state open --label "domain/onboarding" --limit 50
```

### 3. Create Issues

For each finding:

```bash
gh issue create \
  --title "[P0] No onboarding flow - users dropped into empty app" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Problem
After signup, users land on an empty dashboard with no guidance. They don't know what to do first.

## Impact
- High drop-off after signup
- Users never experience core value
- Support tickets asking "how do I start?"
- Lost users who never return

## Suggested Fix
Run `/fix-onboarding` or implement:

1. **First-run detection:**
```typescript
const isNewUser = !user.hasCompletedOnboarding;
if (isNewUser) redirect('/onboarding');
```

2. **Onboarding wizard:**
- Welcome screen
- First action prompt
- Success celebration

3. **Empty state with CTA:**
"Create your first X to get started"
