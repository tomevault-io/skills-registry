# /log-stripe-issues

Run Stripe integration audit and create GitHub issues for all findings.

## What This Does

1. Invoke `/check-stripe` to audit Stripe integration
2. Parse findings by priority (P0-P3)
3. Check existing issues to avoid duplicates
4. Create GitHub issues for each finding

**This is an issue-creator.** It creates work items, not fixes. Use `/fix-stripe` to fix issues.

## Process

### 1. Run Primitive

Invoke `/check-stripe` skill to get structured findings.

### 2. Check Existing Issues

```bash
gh issue list --state open --label "domain/stripe" --limit 50
```

### 3. Create Issues

For each finding:

```bash
gh issue create \
  --title "[P0] Webhook signature not verified" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Problem
Stripe webhook endpoint does not verify signatures. Security vulnerability.

## Impact
- Attackers can forge webhook events
- Fake payment confirmations possible
- Customer data manipulation risk
- PCI compliance violation

## Location
`app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`

## Suggested Fix
Run `/fix-stripe` or manually add:
```typescript
const event = stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(
  body,
  signature,
  process.env.STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET!
);
```

## Priority Mapping

| Gap | Priority |
|-----|----------|
| Missing webhook secret | P0 |
| Hardcoded keys | P0 |
| Webhook verification missing | P1 |
| No customer portal | P1 |
| Subscription status not checked | P1 |
| No idempotency keys | P2 |
| Poor error handling | P2 |
| CLI profile issues | P2 |
| Advanced features | P3 |

## Output

After running:
```
Stripe Issues Created:
- P0: 1 (webhook verification)
- P1: 3 (portal, subscription checks)
- P2: 2 (idempotency, error handling)
- P3: 2 (advanced features)
