# Maestro Core - Workflow Router

Central hub for Maestro workflow skills. Routes triggers, defines hierarchy, and handles fallbacks.

## Skill Hierarchy

```
conductor (1) > orchestrator (2) > designing (3) > tracking (4) > specialized (5)
```

Higher rank wins on conflicts.

## Ownership Matrix

| Skill | Owns | Primary Triggers |
|-------|------|------------------|
| conductor | Implementation + autonomous | `ci`, `ca`, `/conductor-implement`, `/conductor-autonomous` |
| orchestrator | Parallel execution | `co`, `/conductor-orchestrate` |
| designing | Phases 1-10 (design → track creation) | `ds`, `cn`, `/conductor-newtrack`, `/conductor-design` |
| tracking | Task/bead management | `bd *`, `fb`, `rb` |
| handoff | Session cycling | `ho`, `/conductor-finish`, `/conductor-handoff` |
| creating-skills | Skill authoring | "create skill", "write skill" |

## Workflow Chain

```
ds/cn → design.md → /conductor-newtrack → spec.md + plan.md → fb → tracking → ci/co/ca → implementation
```

## Routing Table

**CRITICAL:** After loading `maestro-core`, you MUST explicitly load the target skill via `skill(name="...")` before proceeding.

See **[routing-table.md](references/routing-table.md)** for complete trigger → skill mappings, phrase triggers, and conditional routing logic.

### Quick Triggers

| Trigger | Skill |
|---------|-------|
| `ds`, `cn` | designing |
| `ci` | conductor |
| `ca` | conductor |
| `co` | orchestrator |
| `fb`, `rb`, `bd *` | tracking |
| `ho` | handoff |

### Routing Flow

```
1. User triggers command (e.g., `ci`)
2. Load maestro-core → get routing table
3. Look up trigger → find target skill
4. MUST call skill tool to load target skill
5. Follow loaded skill instructions
```

## Fallback Policies

| Condition | Action | Message |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| `bd` unavailable | HALT | `❌ Cannot proceed: bd CLI required` |
| `conductor/` missing | DEGRADE | `⚠️ Standalone mode - limited features` |
| Agent Mail unavailable | HALT | `❌ Cannot proceed: Agent Mail required for coordination` |
