# Managing Work Dotfiles

This skill manages work-specific dotfiles using a separate git bare repo, keeping them isolated from personal dotfiles.

## Repository Info

- **Remote**: `git@ghe.spotify.net:thopper/dotfiles.git`
- **Work tree**: `$HOME`
- **Git directory**: `~/.local/share/yadm-work/repo.git`
- **Function**: `yadm-work` (defined in `~/.config/fish/fish-work.fish`)

## Key Principle: Use yadm-work

The `yadm-work` function wraps git with the correct directories:

```bash
yadm-work status
yadm-work add <file>
yadm-work commit -m "message"
yadm-work push
```

This is equivalent to:
```bash
git --git-dir="$HOME/.local/share/yadm-work/repo.git" --work-tree="$HOME" <command>
```

## Initial Setup

If not yet initialized on a new machine:

```bash
# Create the directory
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/yadm-work

# Clone as bare repo
git clone --bare git@ghe.spotify.net:thopper/dotfiles.git ~/.local/share/yadm-work/repo.git

# Checkout files to home directory
yadm-work checkout
```

## Getting Current State

```bash
yadm-work status          # Show modified/staged files
yadm-work ls-files        # List all tracked work files
yadm-work diff            # Show unstaged changes
yadm-work remote -v       # Verify remote is Spotify GHE
```

## Core Operations

### Pull from Remote

```bash
yadm-work pull
```

If merge conflicts occur:
1. Run `yadm-work status` to see conflicted files
2. Edit files to resolve conflicts
3. Stage resolved files: `yadm-work add <file>`
4. Complete the merge: `yadm-work commit`

### Commit and Push Changes

```bash
yadm-work add <file>           # Stage specific file
yadm-work add -u               # Stage all modified tracked files
yadm-work commit -m "message"  # Commit with message
yadm-work push                 # Push to Spotify GHE
```

### Modify Configuration Files

1. Find the relevant file: `yadm-work ls-files | grep -i <pattern>`
2. Read and understand the current config
3. Make the requested changes
4. Stage, commit, and push:
   ```bash
   yadm-work add <modified-file>
   yadm-work commit -m "Update <config> to <what was changed>"
   yadm-work push
   ```

## Adding/Removing Files

### Add a new file to tracking

```bash
yadm-work add <new-file>
yadm-work commit -m "Add <file> to work dotfiles"
yadm-work push
```

**Important**: When adding new files under `~/.claude/`, also update `~/.claude/README.md` to document them:

```bash
# After adding new .claude files, update the README
yadm-work add ~/.claude/README.md
yadm-work commit -m "Update README with new <item>"
yadm-work push
```

### Stop tracking a file (without deleting it)

```bash
yadm-work rm --cached <file>
yadm-work commit -m "Stop tracking <file>"
yadm-work push
```

## Avoiding Conflicts with Personal Dotfiles

**Critical**: Never track the same file in both personal (`yadm`) and work (`yadm-work`) repos.

Check before adding:
```bash
# Check if file is in personal dotfiles
yadm ls-files | grep <filename>

# Check if file is in work dotfiles
yadm-work ls-files | grep <filename>
```

## Currently Tracked Files

```
~/.claude/README.md
~/.claude/skills/add-knowledge/
~/.claude/skills/investigating-pagerduty-incidents/
~/.claude/skills/managing-work-dotfiles/
~/.claude/skills/monitor-deploy/
```

## Useful Commands

```bash
yadm-work log --oneline -10    # Recent commits
yadm-work show HEAD            # Last commit details
yadm-work stash                # Stash changes temporarily
yadm-work stash pop            # Restore stashed changes
```
