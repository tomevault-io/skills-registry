# Manual Testing

Verify current work through automated testing first, falling back to user verification only when necessary.

## Core Principle

**Automate everything possible.** Only ask the user to manually verify what Claude cannot verify through tools.

## Workflow

### 1. Analyze Current Context

Examine recent work to identify what needs testing:
- Review recent file changes and conversation history
- Identify the feature, fix, or change to verify
- Determine testable behaviors and expected outcomes

### 2. Classify Each Verification Step

For each thing to verify, determine if Claude can test it automatically:

**Claude CAN verify (do these automatically):**
- Code compiles/builds: `npm run build`, `cargo build`, `go build`, etc.
- Tests pass: `npm test`, `pytest`, `cargo test`, etc.
- Linting/type checking: `eslint`, `tsc --noEmit`, `mypy`, etc.
- API responses: `curl`, `httpie`, or scripted requests
- File contents: Read files, grep for expected patterns
- CLI tool output: Run commands and check output
- Server starts: Start server, check for errors, verify endpoints respond
- Database state: Query databases, check records exist
- Log output: Tail logs, grep for expected/unexpected messages
- Process behavior: Check exit codes, stdout/stderr content
- File existence/permissions: `ls`, `stat`, `test -f`
- JSON/config validity: Parse and validate structure
- Port availability: `lsof`, `netstat`, curl localhost
- Git state: Check diffs, commits, branch state

**Claude CANNOT verify (ask user):**
- Visual appearance (colors, layout, spacing, alignment)
- Animations and transitions
- User experience feel (responsiveness, intuition)
- Cross-browser rendering
- Mobile device behavior
- Physical hardware interaction
- Third-party service UIs (OAuth flows, payment forms)
- Accessibility with actual screen readers
- Performance perception (feels fast/slow)

### 3. Execute Automated Verifications

Run all automatable checks first. Be thorough:

```bash
# Example: Testing a web feature
npm run build          # Compiles?
npm run lint           # No lint errors?
npm test               # Tests pass?
npm run dev &          # Server starts?
sleep 3
curl localhost:3000/api/endpoint  # API responds correctly?
```

Report results as you go. If automated tests fail, stop and address before asking user to verify anything.

### 4. User Verification (Only When Necessary)

For steps Claude cannot automate, present them sequentially with selectable outcomes:

```
Step N of M: [Brief description]

**Action:** [Specific instruction - what to do]

**Expected:** [What should happen if working correctly]
```

Then use AskUserQuestion with predicted outcomes:
- 2-4 most likely outcomes as selectable options
- First option: expected/success outcome
- Remaining options: common failure modes
- Free-text "Other" option is provided automatically

**Example:**
```json
{
  "questions": [{
    "question": "How does the button look?",
    "header": "Visual check",
    "options": [
      {"label": "Looks correct", "description": "Blue button, proper spacing, readable text"},
      {"label": "Wrong color/style", "description": "Button exists but styling is off"},
      {"label": "Layout broken", "description": "Elements overlapping or misaligned"},
      {"label": "Not visible", "description": "Button missing or hidden"}
    ],
    "multiSelect": false
  }]
}
```

### 5. Handle Results

**Automated test fails:** Stop and fix before proceeding.

**User reports issue:** Note it, ask if they want to investigate now or continue testing.

### 6. Summarize

After all steps complete:
- List what was verified automatically (with pass/fail)
- List what user verified (with results)
- Summarize any issues found
- Recommend next actions

## Guidelines

- Run automated checks in parallel when possible
- Be creative with verification—most things can be tested programmatically
- If unsure whether something can be automated, try it first
- Keep user verification steps minimal and focused on truly visual/experiential checks
