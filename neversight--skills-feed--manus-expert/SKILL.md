# 🕵️‍♂️ Skill: Manus Expert (v1.2.0)

## Executive Summary
The `manus-expert` is the master of high-level autonomous orchestration. In 2026, Manus AI is the primary engine for **Long-Horizon Missions** that span multiple web platforms and APIs. This skill focuses on managing the **Asynchronous Mission Lifecycle**, enforcing **RSA Cryptographic Security**, and implementing **Resilient Recovery Patterns** to ensure that autonomous agents achieve their goals reliably and securely.

## 🚀 Autonomous Mission Lifecycle

Missions are persistent and stateful:
1.  **Creation**: `POST /v1/tasks` with clear, objective-driven goals.
2.  **Execution**: Transition from `pending` to `running`.
3.  **Observation**: Real-time status monitoring via Webhooks.
4.  **Completion**: Handling `task.completed` with idempotent result processing.
5.  **Audit**: Reviewing the agent's reasoning logs for compliance.

## 🚫 The "Do Not" List (Anti-Patterns)

| Anti-Pattern | Why it fails in 2026 | Modern Alternative |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Micro-Instruction** | Limits agent reasoning power. | Use **Objective-Based Goals**. |
| **Polling for Results** | Inefficient and adds latency. | Use **RSA-Signed Webhooks**. |
| **Hardcoded Secrets** | Credentials leak in prompts. | Use **Manus Connectors System**. |
| **Unlimited Runtime** | Costs spiral out of control. | Implement **Logical Timeouts**. |
| **Unmapped Task IDs** | Lost missions on server crash. | **Session-Task State Mapping**. |

## 🔒 Secure Connector Architecture

Connectors bridge agents to the world without exposing keys:
-   **Zero-Trust**: Agents never see the raw credentials.
-   **Least Privilege**: Scoped access to specific repos or channels.
-   **Verification**: RSA signatures ensure data integrity.

*See [References: Secure Connectors](./references/secure-connectors-system.md) for details.*

## 🛠️ Multi-Step Orchestration

Manus doesn't just respond; it **Executes**:
-   **Sub-tasking**: Automatic deconstruction of complex requests.
-   **Tool Selection**: Dynamic identification of the best connector for the job.
-   **Feedback Loops**: Agent-led self-correction during navigation.
