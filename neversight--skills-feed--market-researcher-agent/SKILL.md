# Market Researcher Agent

Research markets and validate opportunities with comprehensive analysis.

**This skill uses 4 specialized agents** that analyze markets from different perspectives, then synthesizes into a complete market research report.

## What It Produces

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Market Size** | TAM, SAM, SOM estimates with methodology |
| **Trends Analysis** | Current trends and future outlook |
| **Competitive Landscape** | Key players and their positions |
| **Opportunities** | Gaps and opportunities identified |
| **Go/No-Go Recommendation** | Assessment of market attractiveness |

## Prerequisites

- Web access for research (browser tools)
- No API keys required

## Workflow

### Step 1: Define Research Scope (REQUIRED)

⚠️ **DO NOT skip this step. Use interactive questioning — ask ONE question at a time.**

#### Question Flow

⚠️ **Use the `AskUserQuestion` tool for each question below.** Do not just print questions in your response — use the tool to create interactive prompts with the options shown.

**Q1: Market**
> "I'll research this market for you! First — **what market or industry?**
> 
> *(e.g., 'smart home devices', 'pet food', 'B2B SaaS')*"

*Wait for response.*

**Q2: Product**
> "Do you have a **specific product or idea** you're exploring?
> 
> - Yes — describe it
> - No — just researching the market"

*Wait for response.*

**Q3: Geography**
> "What's the **geographic focus**?
> 
> - US only
> - North America
> - Europe
> - Global
> - Or specify regions"

*Wait for response.*

**Q4: Questions**
> "Any **specific questions** you want answered?
> 
> *(e.g., 'is this market growing?', 'who are the key players?', 'what's the market size?')*
> 
> Or say 'comprehensive analysis' for a full report."

*Wait for response.*

#### Quick Reference

| Question | Determines |
|----------|------------|
| Market | Industry and category focus |
| Product | Whether to include product-market fit analysis |
| Geography | Regional scope of research |
| Questions | Specific areas to emphasize |
