# Mattermost CLI

Fetch and display Mattermost messages using the `mm` command. Output is automatically redacted for safe LLM processing.

## When to Invoke Immediately

Trigger this skill when the user explicitly:
- Asks to check/read/fetch their Mattermost messages or DMs
- Wants to see what someone said ("what did alice say about X")
- Needs to find tasks or action items from chat
- References a conversation they had on Mattermost

## When to Suggest (Don't Auto-Invoke)

Offer to use this skill when:
- User mentions a task "from chat" without specifying Mattermost
- User is looking for context that might be in messages
- You need message history to understand a task better

Say: "want me to check your Mattermost messages for context?" - don't auto-invoke.

## Prerequisites

The `mm` CLI must be installed and configured:

```bash
# Test if working
mm channels
```

If it fails, configure credentials using one of:
1. Config file: `mm config --init` then edit `~/.config/mattermost-cli/config.toml`
2. Environment variables: `MM_URL` and `MM_TOKEN`
3. CLI flags: `--url` and `--token`

## Commands

### List DM Channels
```bash
mm channels              # Pretty output - who have I chatted with?
mm channels --json       # Structured output
```

### Fetch Messages
```bash
mm dms                        # All DMs, last 7 days
mm dms -u <username>          # From specific user
mm dms -u alice -u bob        # Multiple users
mm dms --since 24h            # Last 24 hours
mm dms --since 30d --limit 100  # More history
mm dms --json                 # For parsing
```

### Manage Configuration
```bash
mm config                # Show config status
mm config --init         # Create config file with template
mm config --path         # Print config file path
```

### Quick Reference

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Recent messages | `mm dms --since 24h` |
| From specific person | `mm dms -u alice` |
| All channels list | `mm channels` |
| JSON for processing | `mm dms --json` |
| Extended history | `mm dms --since 30d --limit 200` |
| Setup config | `mm config --init` |

## Output Formats

| Context | Format | Use Case |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Terminal (TTY) | Pretty | Reading directly |
| Piped/non-TTY | Markdown | Passing to tools |
| `--json` flag | JSON | Parsing, analysis |

### Date/Time Display

Dates use European format (DD Mon YYYY) and 24-hour time.

**Under AI agents**, relative time is enabled by default ("2 days ago" instead of "29 Jan 2026"). Override with `--no-relative` if needed.

```bash
mm channels              # "2 days ago" (under agent)
mm channels --no-relative  # "29 Jan 2026"
mm channels --relative   # Force relative time
```

## Security

**All secrets are automatically redacted:**
- API keys, tokens, passwords, JWTs
- Connection strings
- Credentials in config snippets

Example: `ghp_abc123xyz789secret` → `ghp_...cret`

Output is safe to include in context or pass to other LLMs.

## Configuration Priority

Credentials are resolved in this order:
1. CLI flags (`--url`, `--token`)
2. Environment variables (`MM_URL`, `MM_TOKEN`)
3. Config file (`~/.config/mattermost-cli/config.toml`)

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| "Mattermost URL required" | Not configured | Run `mm config --init` or set `MM_URL` |
| "Mattermost token required" | Not configured | Edit config file or set `MM_TOKEN` |
| "Could not find DM channel" | User doesn't exist or no DM history | Check username spelling |
| Connection errors | Network/server issues | Verify URL is correct and accessible |

## When NOT to Use

- User is asking about Slack, Discord, or other chat platforms
- User wants to *send* messages (this is read-only)
- User needs real-time notifications (this is one-shot fetch)

## Example Workflows

### "What did Alice say about the deployment?"
```bash
mm dms -u alice --since 7d
```
Then grep or scan output for deployment-related content.

### "Check my recent messages for any tasks"
```bash
mm dms --since 24h
```
Review output for action items, requests, or TODOs.

### "Get context from a specific conversation"
```bash
mm dms -u bob --limit 50 --json > /tmp/bob-chat.json
```
Parse JSON for relevant context to include in your response.
