# Mecene.ai Agent Skills

Mecene.ai transforms videos into a queryable knowledge base called "Video-as-Code". This skill teaches you how to read and edit videos through the Mecene API.

## What is Mecene?

Mecene is a video clip editing SaaS that:
- Analyzes videos to extract transcripts, speakers, scenes, and visual data
- Stores this as structured data (Video-as-Code format)
- Allows you to edit videos by manipulating timeline overlays
- Renders final clips with captions, cuts, and visual effects

## Capabilities

As an AI agent, you can:
1. **List videos** - See all videos in the user's account
2. **Read video data** - Access transcripts, scenes, speakers, and the TOON script
3. **Read clips** - See clip timeline with all overlays
4. **Edit overlays** - Modify, create, or delete timeline elements

## Authentication

See `rules/authentication.md` for how to discover and use the API token.

## API Endpoints

All endpoints require `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.

### Video & Clip Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
