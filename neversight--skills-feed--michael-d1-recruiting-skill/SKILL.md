```python
# Check rival progress
rivals = [
    {'name': 'Soto', 'id': 2928537, 'pi': 47},
    {'name': 'Gordon', 'id': 1733035, 'pi': 90},
    {'name': 'Domboru', 'id': 1518102}
]

    # Track improvement trends
```

### Meet Results Logging

After each meet, log:
- Event, time, place
- Improvement from previous
- National/conference ranking
- Notify coaches of significant drops

## Supabase Logging

Log recruiting activities:

```python
supabase.table('activities').insert({
    'category': 'michael_swim',
    'subcategory': 'recruiting',
    'title': f"Coach Outreach: {university}",
    'content': json.dumps({
        'coach_name': coach_name,
        'university': university,
        'date_sent': datetime.now(),
        'type': 'initial_contact',
        'follow_up_date': datetime.now() + timedelta(days=14)
    })
})
```

## Key Considerations

### Shabbat Observance
**CRITICAL:** No swimming competitions Friday night through Saturday havdalah

When researching programs:
- Ask about meet schedules
- Confirm Shabbat accommodation
- Look for precedent (other observant swimmers)

### Kosher Diet Maintenance
- Verify campus dining options
- Check proximity to kosher restaurants
- Hillel/Chabad presence on campus

### Academic Balance
- Engineering/science program strength
- Athletic academic support
- Summer training vs internship flexibility

## Target Program Tiers

### Tier 1 (Reach)
- Top 10 programs nationally
- Very competitive recruiting times
- Example: Florida, Texas, Cal

### Tier 2 (Target)
- Top 25 programs
- Times align with current trajectory
- Example: Florida State, NC State, Louisville

### Tier 3 (Safety)
- Strong programs, achievable times
- Great academic fit
- Example: [Specific schools based on current times]

## Example Usage

```
"Use michael-d1-recruiting-skill to draft outreach email to UF coach"

"Research D1 programs with strong engineering and kosher options"

"Log meet results and generate coach update emails"
```

## Next Key Dates

**Harry Meisel Meet:** December 13-14, 2025  
**Recruiting Priority:** Junior year = critical time for commitments  
**Action Items:** 
- Update times after each meet
- Monthly coach touchpoints
- Visit top 3 schools by spring 2026

## Critical Reminders

1. **Shabbat First:** No compromises on Friday night/Saturday meets
2. **Academic Priority:** D1 swimming supports education, not replaces it
3. **Honest Assessment:** Target schools matching realistic progression
4. **Coach Relationships:** Quality over quantity in outreach
5. **Family Input:** Ariel and Mariam involved in all decisions
