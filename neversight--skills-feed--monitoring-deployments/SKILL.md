# Monitoring Deployments

Monitor Spotify deployments via the Tugboat CLI with optional GCP log tailing.

## Prerequisites

Check if `tugboat` exists. If not, auto-install:

```bash
uv tool install --from git+ssh://git@ghe.spotify.net/warpspeed/tugboat-cli.git tugboat-cli
```

## Workflow

### 1. Get component

Use provided component name/pattern, or ask the user.

### 2. List installations

```bash
tugboat installations list --component=<component-or-pattern>
```

### 3. Get deployment status

```bash
tugboat deployments show --installation=<installation-id> <deployment-id>
```

For full JSON details:

```bash
tugboat deployments dump --installation=<installation-id> <deployment-id>
```

### 4. Get version info

```bash
tugboat version <component-id> show <version-id>
```

### 5. Summarize

Present concisely: state, progress %, version/commit, errors.

### 6. Offer log tailing

When in-progress or failed, offer to tail GCP logs. Parse log info from tugboat output and run:

```bash
gcloud logging tail "<filter>" --project=<project>
```

## Batch mode

For patterns like `fan-audio-*`, show a table of all matching components.

## Errors

- Auth issues → `gcloud auth login`
- Missing tugboat → auto-install
- Bad component → list available ones
