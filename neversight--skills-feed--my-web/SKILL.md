# React Web Development Standards

When writing or reviewing React web application code, follow these principles.

## Stack

- **UI framework**: React with TypeScript (strict mode, no `any`)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui primitives
- **Routing**: TanStack Router (file-based route tree, loaders, auth guards)
- **State**: Zustand for client state, router loaders for server state
- **Build**: Vite

## Component Guidelines

### One Component Per File

Each file exports **one** React component. File name matches the component name: `MessageRow.tsx` exports `MessageRow`.

When a component has sub-components used only by it, group them in a folder:

```
Sidebar/
  Sidebar.tsx          -> main component
  SidebarItem.tsx      -> internal, used only by Sidebar
  SidebarSection.tsx   -> internal, used only by Sidebar
```

Simple components with no sub-components stay as standalone files — no folder needed. Do not put unrelated components in one file.

### Prefix-Style Naming

Component names use **domain-prefix** style — the domain comes first, then the specific part:

- `Sidebar`, `SidebarItem`, `SidebarSection` — not `Item`, `Section`
- `Message`, `MessageRow`, `MessageActions` — not `Row`, `Actions`
- `Channel`, `ChannelHeader`, `ChannelSettings` — not `Header`, `Settings`

The prefix makes it immediately clear which domain a component belongs to, even outside its folder. Grep-friendly and unambiguous.

Shared UI primitives (`components/ui/`) are the exception — `Button`, `Dialog`, `Avatar` need no domain prefix since they are domain-agnostic.

### Fragments

Fragments are large, self-contained UI regions — the biggest building blocks below a page. Think of them like Android Fragments or Atomic Design's organisms: a chat conversation, a profile editor, a settings form. Each fragment owns its own layout, internal state, and child components.

Fragments are **not** modals, panels, or wrappers — they are the main content regions that a route composes together. A page might render one fragment (full-screen chat) or several side by side (sidebar + chat + thread panel).

- Name fragments after what they **are**, not how they're displayed: `ChatConversation`, `ProfileEditor`, `ChannelSettings` — not `ChatModal`, `ProfilePanel`.
- A fragment manages its own internal component tree but receives its key data (IDs, config) as props from the route.
- Fragments live in a top-level `fragments/` folder. Each fragment gets its own folder, and fragment-specific components go in a `components/` subfolder within it:
  ```
  fragments/
    ChatConversation/
      ChatConversation.tsx          -> the fragment
      components/
        ChatMessageList.tsx         -> specific to this fragment
        ChatComposer.tsx            -> specific to this fragment
    ProfileEditor/
      ProfileEditor.tsx             -> the fragment
      components/
        ProfileAvatarUpload.tsx
        ProfileFormFields.tsx
  ```
- The separate top-level `components/` folder is for **shared, reusable** components (UI primitives, domain components used across multiple fragments). Fragment-specific components stay inside the fragment's own `components/` subfolder.
- Route files compose fragments — they don't build UI themselves:
  ```tsx
  function WorkspaceRoute() {
    const { channelId, threadId } = Route.useParams()
    return (
      <WorkspaceLayout>
        <Sidebar />
        <ChatConversation channelId={channelId} />
        {threadId && <ThreadPanel threadId={threadId} />}
      </WorkspaceLayout>
    )
  }
  ```

### Route Files Stay Thin

Route files handle **routing concerns only**: declaring the route, params, loaders, error boundaries, and rendering the top-level page component.

Move all business logic, layout, data transformation, and UI orchestration into dedicated components imported by the route.

```tsx
// Good: thin shell
function ChannelRoute() {
  const { channelId } = Route.useParams()
  return <ChannelView channelId={channelId} />
}

// Bad: entire page in the route file
function ChannelRoute() {
  const { channelId } = Route.useParams()
  const messages = useMessages(channelId)
  const members = useMembers(channelId)
  // ... 200 lines of UI, handlers, and logic
}
```

## Layout Stability with Loading States

Components with loading/placeholder states must never change their size when transitioning between loading and loaded. Reserve the exact dimensions so the layout stays stable.

- **List headers and footers**: if a list footer shows a "Load more" spinner or an "End of list" message, it must occupy the same height in both states. Use a fixed-height container or render an invisible placeholder of the same size.
- **Skeleton screens**: skeletons must match the dimensions of the real content they replace.
- **Pagination indicators**: when a paginated list reaches the end, swap the spinner for a static placeholder of the same size — never collapse to zero height.
- **General rule**: if a region can be in a loading state, wrap it in a container with explicit dimensions or `min-height` so surrounding content never shifts.

```tsx
// Good: fixed-height footer — no jump when loading ends
<div className="h-10 flex items-center justify-center">
  {isLoading ? <Spinner /> : hasMore ? null : <span className="text-muted">No more items</span>}
</div>

// Bad: footer collapses when loading ends, list jumps
{isLoading && <Spinner />}
```

## Hover Interactions in Lists

When list rows have hover states (highlight, action buttons, menus), getting the behavior right is critical. Flickering, ghost hovers, or disappearing menus feel broken.

### Rules

1. **One hovered row at a time.** Track `hoveredId` in state — only the row matching `hoveredId` renders its hover appearance. Do not rely on CSS `:hover` alone for anything that shows interactive controls, because CSS hover cannot coordinate with menu-open state.

2. **Menu open locks the hover.** When a row's context menu or dropdown is open, that row stays hovered regardless of where the mouse moves. The menu and hover highlight must remain until the menu is explicitly closed (click outside, Escape, or selecting an item).

3. **No flicker on transitions.** Moving the mouse between the row content and its action buttons (or the open menu popover) must not cause the hover to blink off and back on. Hover state is driven by the row container's `mouseenter`/`mouseleave`, not by individual child elements.

### Performance: Only Re-render the Affected Rows

Hover changes happen on every mouse move — re-rendering the entire list on each hover is unacceptable. Use a React context to broadcast hover/menu state so that **only the row entering hover and the row leaving hover re-render**, not the whole list.

```tsx
// --- HoverContext.tsx ---

type HoverState = {
  hoveredId: string | null
  menuOpenId: string | null
  onMouseEnter: (id: string) => void
  onMouseLeave: () => void
  onMenuOpen: (id: string) => void
  onMenuClose: () => void
}

const HoverContext = createContext<HoverState>(null!)

function HoverProvider({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
  const [hoveredId, setHoveredId] = useState<string | null>(null)
  const [menuOpenId, setMenuOpenId] = useState<string | null>(null)

  const onMouseEnter = useCallback((id: string) => {
    setHoveredId((prev) => prev === id ? prev : id)
  }, [])

  const onMouseLeave = useCallback(() => {
    setHoveredId(null)
  }, [])

  const onMenuOpen = useCallback((id: string) => {
    setMenuOpenId(id)
    setHoveredId(id)
  }, [])

  const onMenuClose = useCallback(() => {
    setMenuOpenId(null)
  }, [])

  const value = useMemo(
    () => ({ hoveredId, menuOpenId, onMouseEnter, onMouseLeave, onMenuOpen, onMenuClose }),
    [hoveredId, menuOpenId, onMouseEnter, onMouseLeave, onMenuOpen, onMenuClose],
  )

  return <HoverContext.Provider value={value}>{children}</HoverContext.Provider>
}

// --- useRowHover.ts ---
// Each row subscribes to context but only re-renders when *its own* hover status changes.

function useRowHover(id: string) {
  const { hoveredId, menuOpenId, onMouseEnter, onMouseLeave, onMenuOpen, onMenuClose } =
    useContext(HoverContext)

  const isHovered = hoveredId === id
  const isMenuOpen = menuOpenId === id

  // Stable callbacks bound to this row's id
  const handlers = useMemo(() => ({
    onMouseEnter: () => onMouseEnter(id),
    onMouseLeave: menuOpenId ? undefined : onMouseLeave,
    onMenuOpen: () => onMenuOpen(id),
    onMenuClose,
  }), [id, menuOpenId, onMouseEnter, onMouseLeave, onMenuOpen, onMenuClose])

  return { isHovered, isMenuOpen, handlers }
}
```

The list component itself never re-renders on hover — it wraps children in `HoverProvider` and each `memo`'d row reads its own hover state via `useRowHover`:

```tsx
const MessageRow = memo(function MessageRow({ message }: { message: Message }) {
  const { isHovered, isMenuOpen, handlers } = useRowHover(message.id)

  return (
    <div onMouseEnter={handlers.onMouseEnter} onMouseLeave={handlers.onMouseLeave}>
      <MessageContent message={message} />
      {(isHovered || isMenuOpen) && (
        <MessageActions onMenuOpen={handlers.onMenuOpen} onMenuClose={handlers.onMenuClose} />
      )}
    </div>
  )
})

function MessageList({ messages }: { messages: Message[] }) {
  return (
    <HoverProvider>
      {messages.map((msg) => (
        <MessageRow key={msg.id} message={msg} />
      ))}
    </HoverProvider>
  )
}
```

When hover moves from row A to row B: context value changes → only row A and row B re-render (their `isHovered` changed). All other rows stay untouched because `memo` sees the same props and `useRowHover` returns the same `false`/`false`.

**Important caveat**: the context approach above re-renders all rows when `hoveredId` changes because every row consumes the full context. To truly limit re-renders to only the two affected rows, use a **ref + subscription** pattern or a Zustand store instead of context — rows subscribe and only re-render when their own derived `isHovered` value flips. The context pattern shown is the simple starting point; if profiling shows too many re-renders in large lists, switch to a store-based approach.

### Testing Hover Behavior

Use `agent-browser` to verify hover interactions. These are the specific scenarios to test:

**1. Basic hover highlighting:**
- Move mouse onto a row — row highlights.
- Move mouse to a different row — first row un-highlights, second highlights.
- Move mouse off all rows — no row highlighted.

**2. Action buttons visibility:**
- Hover a row — action buttons appear.
- Move to adjacent row — buttons disappear from first row, appear on second.
- Move off list — all buttons hidden.

**3. Menu open — hover lock:**
- Hover a row, click its menu button — menu opens.
- Move mouse away from the row entirely (to another row, to empty space) — **menu stays open, row stays highlighted**. The other row does NOT highlight.
- Move mouse back to the original row — still highlighted, no flicker.

**4. Menu open — no blink on click:**
- Hover a row, click the menu button — verify the transition from hover-state to menu-open-state produces **no visual blink** (the highlight must not flash off then back on).

**5. Menu close — return to normal:**
- With menu open, click outside the menu but still on the same row — menu closes, row **stays highlighted** (mouse is still over it), no blink. This is the hardest case — popup portals/overlays can cause spurious `mouseleave` events when the overlay disappears, leading to a hover blink between menu close and the browser re-firing `mouseenter`. The implementation must account for this.
- With menu open, click outside the menu onto a different row — menu closes, hover moves to the clicked row.
- With menu open, press Escape — menu closes, hover follows current mouse position.

**6. Edge cases:**
- Rapidly move mouse across multiple rows — exactly one row highlighted at any moment, no double-highlights.
- Open menu, scroll the list — menu should close (scroll dismisses popover), hover resets.

## Avoid `useEffect`

`useEffect` is a code smell in most cases. Before reaching for it, consider alternatives:

- **Derived state**: compute inline during render or use `useMemo`. Never `useEffect` + `setState` to mirror a prop — just derive it.
- **Event handlers**: if something should happen in response to a user action, do it in the handler, not in an effect that watches for state changes.
- **Refs for imperative APIs**: use `useRef` + `useLayoutEffect` only when truly necessary (focus, scroll, measure).
- **Data fetching**: use router loaders or a dedicated fetching hook, not `useEffect` + `fetch` + `setState`.
- **Subscriptions**: use `useSyncExternalStore` or the store's own hook, not `useEffect` with manual subscribe/unsubscribe.

Legitimate uses are rare: setting up/tearing down non-React subscriptions with no hook abstraction, or one-time initialization with no better home. When you do use one, leave a comment explaining why.

## State Management

### Zustand Stores

- Separate stores by concern: `uiStore` (modals, drafts, sidebar), `connectionStore` (online/offline), `toastStore`.
- Keep stores small and focused — one responsibility per store.
- For selectors that return derived arrays or objects, use `useShallow` to keep snapshots stable and avoid render loops.

```tsx
// Good: stable selector with useShallow
const channels = useStore(useShallow((s) => s.channels.filter((c) => !c.archived)))

// Bad: creates new array reference every render
const channels = useStore((s) => s.channels.filter((c) => !c.archived))
```

### Data Fetching

- Use router loaders for data needed at route level.
- REST for mutations, SSE or WebSockets for real-time updates.
- Auth via bearer token in `Authorization` header.
- Keep API clients typed — one function per endpoint, return typed responses.

## File Organization

```
app/
  routes/          -> route files (thin shells only)
  fragments/       -> large self-contained UI regions (ChatConversation/, ProfileEditor/, ...)
    [Fragment]/
      Fragment.tsx
      components/  -> components specific to this fragment
  components/
    ui/            -> shadcn/ui primitives (button, input, dialog, avatar, etc.)
    [domain]/      -> shared domain components reused across fragments
  stores/          -> Zustand stores (one per concern)
  lib/             -> utilities, hooks, session management, route guards
  api/             -> typed API client, HTTP helpers, SSE subscriber
  types.ts         -> shared TypeScript types
```

### File Naming

- One public function/component per file. File name matches export name.
- Prefix notation for non-component files: `channelCreate` not `createChannel`, `messageSend` not `sendMessage`.
- `domainVerb.ts` + `domainVerb.spec.ts` side by side.
- Tests use `*.spec.ts`, live next to the file under test.
- Do not use barrel `index.ts` files.

## Conventions

- TypeScript only, ESM output.
- Keep files under ~700 LOC; split when it improves clarity.
- Brief comments for tricky or non-obvious logic only.
- Unix timestamps (milliseconds) for time values. `Date` only at boundaries for parsing/formatting.
- Prefer strict typing; avoid `any`.

## Dev Page

For non-trivial UI components, add a section on a dev route (`/dev`) for visual testing in isolation:

- Render the component with representative props covering key states (empty, loading, populated, error, long text, missing data).
- Each section: heading with component name, hardcoded/mock data, no dependency on real API state.
- Trivial components (styled wrappers, single-line formatters) don't need dev page entries.

## Visual Verification with Browser

Use the `agent-browser` skill to visually verify UI changes. After building or modifying components, launch the dev server and use agent-browser to navigate to the page, take screenshots, and confirm the result matches expectations.

- **After styling changes**: screenshot the affected page/component to verify layout and colors.
- **After adding new routes or pages**: navigate to the route and screenshot to confirm rendering.
- **Responsive checks**: resize the viewport and screenshot at different breakpoints.
- **Pixel-perfect comparison**: when matching a reference design, set the browser viewport to match the reference image dimensions exactly (account for `deviceScaleFactor` on Retina displays — a 1440x900 viewport at 2x produces a 2880x1800 screenshot).
- **Interactive flows**: fill forms, click buttons, and verify state transitions render correctly.

This replaces manual "open the browser and check" steps — let the agent verify visually.

## Summary

1. One component per file, domain-prefix names, colocate sub-components in folders
2. Route files are thin shells — logic lives in components
3. Avoid `useEffect` — derive state, handle events, use proper hooks
4. Zustand for client state with `useShallow` for derived selectors
5. Router loaders for data fetching, typed API clients for mutations
6. Prefix notation for files (`domainVerb.ts`), tests next to source
7. shadcn/ui + Tailwind for styling, keep the design system consistent
