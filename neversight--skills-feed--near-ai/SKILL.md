# NEAR AI Development

Comprehensive guide for building AI agents and AI-powered applications on NEAR Protocol, including NEAR AI integration, agent workflows, and AI model deployment.

## When to Apply

Reference these guidelines when:
- Building AI agents on NEAR
- Integrating AI models with NEAR smart contracts
- Creating agent-based workflows
- Implementing AI-powered dApps
- Using NEAR AI infrastructure
- Building with NEAR AI Assistant

## Rule Categories by Priority

| Priority | Category | Impact | Prefix |
|----------|----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Agent Architecture | CRITICAL | `arch-` |
| 2 | AI Integration | HIGH | `ai-` |
| 3 | Agent Communication | HIGH | `comm-` |
| 4 | Model Deployment | MEDIUM-HIGH | `model-` |
| 5 | Agent Workflows | MEDIUM | `workflow-` |
| 6 | Security & Privacy | MEDIUM | `security-` |
| 7 | Best Practices | MEDIUM | `best-` |

## Quick Reference

- `workflow-execution` - Execute multi-step workflows
- `workflow-error-handling` - Handle workflow errors gracefully
- `workflow-state-persistence` - Persist workflow state
- `workflow-composability` - Compose workflows from smaller tasks

### 6. Security & Privacy (MEDIUM)

- `security-input-validation` - Validate user inputs to agents
- `security-output-sanitization` - Sanitize agent outputs
- `security-access-control` - Implement agent access control
- `security-data-privacy` - Protect user data privacy
- `security-prompt-injection` - Prevent prompt injection attacks

### 7. Best Practices (MEDIUM)

- `best-error-messages` - Provide clear error messages
- `best-logging` - Log agent interactions for debugging
- `best-testing` - Test agent behavior comprehensively
- `best-documentation` - Document agent capabilities and APIs
- `best-user-feedback` - Collect and incorporate user feedback

## How to Use

Read individual rule files for detailed explanations and code examples:

```
rules/arch-agent-structure.md
rules/ai-inference-endpoints.md
```

Each rule file contains:
- Brief explanation of why it matters
- Incorrect code example with explanation
- Correct code example with explanation
- Additional context and NEAR AI-specific patterns
