# Presentation Jobs - Steve Jobs Methodology

Create presentations following Steve Jobs's legendary minimalist approach, centered on the "Billboard Test" (3-Second Rule) for maximum impact and audience retention.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill whenever you need to create a presentation that:
- Launches a product or feature
- Pitches a business idea or proposal
- Explains complex concepts simply
- Delivers keynotes or important announcements
- Requires high audience engagement and retention

## Core Workflow

### Step 1: Understand the Request and Gather Information

Before creating the presentation, ask clarifying questions if needed:

**Essential Information:**
- **Topic/Purpose**: What is the presentation about? What's the main goal?
- **Audience**: Who will be viewing this? (executives, customers, team, investors, etc.)
- **Key Message**: What's the single most important takeaway?
- **Duration**: How long is the presentation? (helps determine slide count)
- **Content Details**: Any specific points, data, or stories to include?

**Optional Information:**
- Brand colors or visual preferences
- Existing materials to reference
- Specific examples or demos to showcase

If the user provides clear context, proceed directly to Step 2. Only ask questions when information is genuinely ambiguous or missing.

### Step 2: Read the Steve Jobs Guidelines

**MANDATORY:** Before designing any slides, read the complete Steve Jobs guidelines:
```
Read references/jobs-guidelines.md
```

This file contains the essential principles you must follow:
- The Billboard Test (3-Second Rule)
- Cognitive load minimization
- Content minimalism guidelines
- Visual design standards
- The presenter's role

### Step 2B: Apply Sentient Brand Guidelines

For every presentation, **review the Sentient Brand Guidelines skill** to apply the correct colors, typography, and logo usage:

```
Read sentient-brand-guideline/skill.md
```

Key alignment points:
- Use Sentient.io-approved logo assets and placement rules.
- Apply the official color palette (Primary Red, Beige, Green, and supporting tones) and Nunito Sans/Noto Sans typography.
- Follow the spacing, contrast, and naming conventions detailed in the guidelines.

### Step 3: Structure the Presentation

Apply the Steve Jobs 3-act storytelling structure:

**Act 1: Setup (20-30% of slides)**
- Hook the audience with a problem or opportunity
- Set context and create anticipation
- Example: "There are three products in one..."

**Act 2: Confrontation (40-50% of slides)**
- Introduce the solution/product/idea
- Demonstrate key features or concepts (one per slide)
- Use visuals and benefits, not just features
- Build emotional connection

**Act 3: Resolution (20-30% of slides)**
- Show the impact and transformation
- Call to action
- Memorable closing message

**Default Slide Count:** Target 10 slides maximum unless content complexity requires more. Quality over quantity.

### Step 4: Design Each Slide (Following the 3-Second Rule)

For EVERY slide, strictly adhere to these principles from the guidelines:

**Content Rules:**
1. **One idea per slide** - If you have multiple ideas, create multiple slides
2. **Minimal text** - Use keywords and short phrases, never paragraphs
3. **One number** - If showing data, highlight only ONE statistic prominently
4. **No bullet point overload** - Use bullets sparingly; prefer visual hierarchy

**Visual Rules:**
1. **Large, impactful visuals** - One striking image that supports the message
2. **Minimum 30-point font** - This physically prevents overcrowding
3. **Ample white space** - Negative space is powerful, not wasted
4. **High contrast** - Light on dark or dark on light for maximum legibility

**Slide Types to Use:**
- **Title slides**: Large text with minimal supporting text (e.g., "iPhone" + "Apple reinvents the phone")
- **Image slides**: Full-bleed impactful image with minimal text overlay
- **Number slides**: One big statistic with context
- **Comparison slides**: Before/after or side-by-side visuals
- **Demo slides**: Visual showing the product/concept in action

### Step 5: Create the Presentation Using PPTX Skill

**MANDATORY:** Always read the PPTX skill before generating presentations:
```
Read /mnt/skills/public/pptx/SKILL.md
```

Then create the presentation following both the PPTX skill's technical requirements AND the Steve Jobs design principles.

**Key Integration Points:**
- Use the PPTX skill's methods for creating slides
- Apply Jobs principles to ALL content and layout decisions
- Ensure visual hierarchy through font sizes (30pt minimum)
- Leverage white space in slide layouts
- Use high-contrast color schemes
- Keep text minimal on every slide

### Step 6: Present the Deliverable

After creating the presentation:

1. **Provide the PPTX file** with a clear download link
2. **Summarize the structure** - Brief overview of the slide flow
3. **Highlight the key message** - Remind the user of the core takeaway
4. **Presenter notes** - Offer brief guidance on delivery:
   - The slides support YOU, not replace you
   - Practice until you can speak naturally without reading
   - Let the visuals amplify your spoken message
   - Embrace pauses and white space in delivery

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing, verify each slide passes these tests:

**The 3-Second Test:**
- [ ] Can the main point be grasped in 3-5 seconds?
- [ ] Is there only ONE core idea per slide?
- [ ] Would this work as a highway billboard?

**Design Standards:**
- [ ] Font size minimum 30 points?
- [ ] Ample white space around elements?
- [ ] High contrast for legibility?
- [ ] Large, impactful visual (not decorative clipart)?

**Content Standards:**
- [ ] Minimal text (keywords, not sentences)?
- [ ] Only one statistic if showing data?
- [ ] Bullets used sparingly or not at all?
- [ ] Presenter as storyteller, not reading slides?

## Important Reminders

**What This Skill Is:**
- A methodology for creating minimalist, high-impact presentations
- Based on proven cognitive science principles
- Designed for live delivery with a presenter

**What This Skill Is Not:**
- Not for creating document-style slide decks meant to be read independently
- Not for comprehensive reports (recommend separate documents for those)
- Not for slides that replace the presenter

**Hybrid Strategy:**
If the user needs both a live presentation AND detailed documentation, recommend creating:
1. A minimalist presentation (using this skill) for live delivery
2. A separate detailed document (using docx skill) for pre-reads or leave-behinds

## Examples of Jobs-Style Slides

**Product Launch:**
- Slide 1: "iPhone" (large text, black background)
- Slide 2: "Apple reinvents the phone" (single line, image of iPhone)
- Slide 3: Three icons showing iPod + Phone + Internet
- Slide 4: "All in one device" with product image

**Concept Explanation:**
- Slide 1: Problem statement (one sentence + evocative image)
- Slide 2: "The Solution" (just those two words, large)
- Slide 3: Key benefit #1 (visual + 3-5 words)
- Slide 4: Key benefit #2 (visual + 3-5 words)
- Slide 5: "Imagine..." (showing the transformation)

**Business Pitch:**
- Slide 1: Hook - "What if..." (provocative question)
- Slide 2: Market opportunity (ONE big number)
- Slide 3: The problem (powerful image)
- Slide 4: Our solution (visual demo)
- Slide 5: Why now (timing/traction in visual form)

## Best Practices

1. **Start with the message, not the slides** - Know your core story first
2. **Embrace simplicity** - Every element must earn its place
3. **Test the 3-second rule** - If you can't get it in 3 seconds, simplify
4. **Use visuals emotionally** - Images should evoke feeling, not just illustrate
5. **Practice extensively** - Minimalist slides require confident delivery
6. **Remember: YOU are the presentation** - Slides are your supporting cast

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ Putting full sentences on slides
❌ Using bullet points as a crutch
❌ Multiple ideas competing on one slide
❌ Small font sizes (<30pt)
❌ Cluttered layouts with no white space
❌ Decorative images that don't support the message
❌ Reading the slides verbatim
❌ Treating slides like documents
