# Nextdoor Skill

## Overview
Automates Nextdoor operations including posting to neighborhood, browsing local discussions, and engaging with community through browser automation.

## Quick Install

```

## Setup

## Privacy & Authentication

**Your credentials, your choice.** Canifi LifeOS respects your privacy.

### Option 1: Manual Browser Login (Recommended)
If you prefer not to share credentials with Claude Code:
1. Complete the [Browser Automation Setup](/setup/automation) using CDP mode
2. Login to the service manually in the Playwright-controlled Chrome window

### Option 2: Environment Variables
