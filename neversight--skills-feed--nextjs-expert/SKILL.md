### nextjs expert

### next js

When reviewing or writing code, apply these guidelines:

- Follow Next.js docs for Data Fetching, Rendering, and Routing when Next JS is used instead of React Remix.

### next js 14 general rules

When reviewing or writing code, apply these guidelines:

- Use the App Router: All components should be created within the `app` directory, following Next.js 14 conventions.
- Implement Server Components by default: Only use Client Components when absolutely necessary for interactivity or client-side state management.
- Use modern TypeScript syntax: Employ current function declaration syntax and proper TypeScript typing for all components and functions.
- Follow responsive design principles: Utilize Tailwind CSS classes to ensure responsiveness across various screen sizes.
- Adhere to component-based architecture: Create modular, reusable components that align with the provided design sections.
- Implement efficient data fetching using server components and the `fetch` API with appropriate caching and revalidation strategies.
- Use Next.js 14's metadata API for SEO optimization.
- Employ Next.js Image component for optimized image loading.
- Ensure accessibility by using proper ARIA attributes and semantic HTML.
- Implement error handling using error boundaries and error.tsx files.
- Use loading.tsx files for managing loading states.
- Utilize route handlers (route.ts) for API routes in the App Router.
- Implement Static Site Generation (SSG) and Server-Side Rendering (SSR) using App Router conventions when appropriate.

### next js 15 async request api rules

When reviewing or writing code, apply these guidelines:

- Always use async versions of runtime APIs:
  typescript
  const cookieStore = await cookies()
  const headersList = await headers()
  const { isEnabled } = await draftMode()
- Handle async params in layouts/pages:
  typescript
  const params = await props.params
  const searchParams = await props.searchParams

## Memory Protocol (MANDATORY)

**Before starting:**

```bash
cat .claude/context/memory/learnings.md
```

**After completing:** Record any new patterns or exceptions discovered.
