# Next.js Rendering Expert Guidance

## Core Concepts

### Static vs Dynamic Rendering

Understand the fundamental distinction between static and dynamic rendering:

- **Static pages do not involve compute.** They are pre-built, uploaded to a CDN, and replicated to edge locations globally. This means static content remains available even if a region goes down and serves faster because it's cached near the user with no compute overhead.

- **Dynamic pages execute in a specific region** where the serverless function is configured to run. They require compute on every request, making them slower and dependent on regional availability.

- **SSG and ISR are the same rendering mode.** The only difference is whether you generate all paths upfront (SSG) or incrementally on-demand (ISR). Both produce static output.

- **Cache components can combine static and dynamic behavior,** but the page itself is still fundamentally either static or dynamic. Even with cache components, the underlying render mode matters.

### The Prospective Render System

Next.js uses a two-phase render to determine what is static vs dynamic:

1. **Warmup render (prospective render):** Next.js searches for cached instances and fills those caches. This phase identifies what can be resolved synchronously.

2. **Microtask check:** Next.js runs a second render that executes for just one tick, then aborts. Everything that resolves within that single microtask is considered "instant" and therefore static.

This two-render mechanism is how Next.js determines whether components are async or not without explicit developer annotation.

## Streaming and Suspense

### Streaming Behavior in Static Rendering

**Static content does not support streaming** because no compute is involved at request time. The entire page is pre-generated and served as a complete asset.

- **Suspense boundary fallbacks will not show when generating ISR paths.** The page is built fully before being cached, so users never see intermediate loading states.

- **Streaming only works with dynamic rendering** where the server can flush partial content while waiting for async operations.

### Enabling Streaming for Dynamic Pages

To allow the server to stream a page without requiring a complete skeleton upfront:

```jsx
<Suspense fallback={null}>
  {/* Wrap your entire HTML document */}
  <html>
    <body>{children}</body>
  </html>
</Suspense>
```

**Wrap the HTML document with an empty Suspense boundary.** Without a document element outside the boundary, there's nothing to stream—the server needs an outer shell to flush to the client.

## Determining Static vs Dynamic

### Async Dynamic APIs

Next.js uses **async dynamic APIs as signals** to determine when something must be dynamic:

- **Anything that cannot run in a single tick becomes dynamic.** If an operation requires awaiting beyond the initial microtask, Next.js marks that render as dynamic.

- **Exception: `params` can still create static routes** because `params` is called once per item returned by `generateStaticParams`. Since each invocation is synchronous within that static generation context, it's considered "instant."

```tsx
// This can still be static if generateStaticParams provides the params
export async function generateStaticParams() {
  return [{ id: '1' }, { id: '2' }];
}

export default async function Page({ params }: { params: { id: string } }) {
  // params is "instant" here because it's called once per static param
  const { id } = params;
  // ...
}
```

## Using Cache Directives

### "use cache" Behavior

Adding `"use cache"` to a page or its main component fundamentally changes its output:

```tsx
'use cache';

export default function Page() {
  // This produces static output
}
```

**When you add "use cache" to a page component, you are producing static output** that will be:
- Cached and reused
- Not streamed (served as complete HTML)
- Not have holes or Suspense boundaries that resolve at request time

Even in a dynamic app, cache directives convert specific subtrees to static behavior with all the implications of static rendering (no streaming, no runtime Suspense resolution).

## Common Pitfalls

### Expecting Streaming in Static Contexts

Do not expect Suspense fallbacks or streaming to work when:
- Generating ISR paths
- Using `"use cache"` on page components
- Building SSG routes

In all these cases, the page is fully rendered during build/revalidation, not at request time.

### Misunderstanding Regional Failures

Remember that **dynamic content fails if its configured region goes down,** while static content remains available globally. Design critical paths as static when high availability is required.

### Forgetting the Prospective Render

When debugging why something is marked as dynamic, remember that **Next.js aborts a render after one tick** to detect async work. If your code performs any async operation that doesn't resolve in a microtask, it becomes dynamic, even if it seems "fast."
