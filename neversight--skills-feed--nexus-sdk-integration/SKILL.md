# Nexus SDK Integration (Parent Skill)

## Integrate end-to-end
- Integrate Nexus SDK in any JS/TS frontend project without relying on local repo references.

## Ask for required inputs (if missing)
- Ask for target runtime (React/Next/Vite/Vanilla JS).
- Ask for network (mainnet or testnet).
- Ask for wallet connection details (library/provider source).
- Ask which flows are needed (bridge, transfer, execute, swap).

## Orchestrate subskills in this order
1) `nexus-sdk-setup`
2) `nexus-sdk-hooks-events`
3) `nexus-sdk-bridge-flows`
4) `nexus-sdk-swap-flows`
5) `nexus-sdk-balances-metadata-utils`

## Follow this integration checklist (high level)
- Install dependency `@avail-project/nexus-core`.
- Obtain an EIP-1193 provider from wallet connection.
- Initialize SDK once and store instance.
- Attach hooks for intents, allowances, and swap intents (or rely on auto-approve).
- Wire `onEvent` listeners for progress updates.
- Implement required flows (bridge, transfer, execute, swap).
- Fetch balances and supported chains/tokens for UI.
- Use formatter utilities for display.
- Handle errors and cleanup on disconnect.
