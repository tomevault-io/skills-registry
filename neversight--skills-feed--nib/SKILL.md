# Nib — Visual Feedback

You have eyes. Use them. Any time something visual is relevant, capture the screen and look.

## When to Use This

**Use nib aggressively.** If any of these apply, capture and look:

- You just made a UI change → capture and verify it looks right
- You're debugging something visual → capture and inspect
- You need to know where something is on screen → capture and find it
- You're unsure about layout, spacing, colors, alignment → capture and check
- The user mentions anything visual → capture immediately
- You want to show the user what you did → capture and annotate
- You're about to ask "does this look right?" → capture instead of asking
- You need coordinates for clicking or positioning → capture and use grid

**Don't ask what to capture. Don't ask permission. Just capture and look.**

## The Loop

```
1. Find the right window → nib windows --json
2. Capture it → nib capture --app "AppName" -o /tmp/nib_shot.png
3. Look at the screenshot (read the file)
4. Decide what you need feedback on
5. nib feedback /tmp/nib_shot.png -a '[annotations]' -m "question"
6. Parse the human's response
7. Act on it
```

### Step 1: Find the Right Window

Don't just screenshot everything. Find the window you actually care about:

```bash
# List all windows with metadata
nib windows --json

# Filter by app name
nib windows --app "Safari" --json
```

Output gives you app name, title, size, position, and focus state for every window.

### Step 2: Capture the Right Thing

```bash
# Capture a specific app's window
nib capture --app "Safari" -o /tmp/nib_shot.png

# Capture by window title
nib capture --title "index.html" -o /tmp/nib_shot.png

# Capture the focused window
nib capture --mode window -o /tmp/nib_shot.png

# Capture full screen (fallback)
nib capture -o /tmp/nib_shot.png
```

**Always prefer `--app` or `--title` over full screen.** You get just the window you need, no distractions.

### Step 3: Look

Read the screenshot file to see what's on screen. Use grid or OCR if you need precision:

```bash
# Coordinate grid for positioning
nib grid /tmp/nib_shot.png --spacing 100 -o /tmp/nib_grid.png

# Find text via OCR
nib find-text /tmp/nib_shot.png -s "Submit"
```

### Step 3: Annotate and Ask

Point at the things you want feedback on. Be specific.

```bash
nib feedback /tmp/nib_shot.png \
  -a '[{"type":"arrow","from":[300,200],"to":[450,350]},{"type":"text","at":[300,180],"content":"This spacing looks off?"}]' \
  -m "Does the spacing between these elements look right?"
```

### Step 4: Parse Response

Human draws annotations and hits Cmd+Enter. You get back only their annotations:

```json
{"annotations": [{"id": "a1", "type": "arrow", "at": [150, 200, 300, 100], "owner": "human"}]}
```

Timeout returns `{"event": "timeout"}` (exit code 0, not an error).

### Step 5: Act

Use the human's visual feedback to take action. Then capture again to verify.

## Annotation Format

```json
[
  {"type": "arrow", "from": [x, y], "to": [x, y]},
  {"type": "rectangle", "at": [x, y], "size": [w, h]},
  {"type": "text", "at": [x, y], "content": "Label"},
  {"type": "highlight", "at": [x, y], "size": [w, h], "color": "#ffff0080"},
  {"type": "number", "at": [x, y], "value": 1},
  {"type": "ellipse", "center": [x, y], "radius": [rx, ry]},
  {"type": "line", "from": [x, y], "to": [x, y]},
  {"type": "blur", "at": [x, y], "size": [w, h]}
]
```

All types accept optional `"color"` (hex). Use blue `#3b82f6` for your annotations.

## Headless Mode

When you don't need human feedback, just annotate and render:

```bash
nib annotation add image.png -t rectangle -x 100 -y 100 -w 200 -H 50 -c "#ff0000"
nib render image.png  # → image.rendered.png
```
