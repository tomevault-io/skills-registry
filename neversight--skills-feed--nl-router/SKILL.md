# nl-router

Route natural language requests to appropriate skills and workflows.

## Triggers

This skill is the meta-router - it processes natural language and routes to other skills. It should be consulted when no explicit skill trigger is matched.

## Purpose

This skill interprets natural language requests and routes them to the appropriate skills or workflows by:
- Parsing user intent from natural language
- Matching to available skills and commands
- Handling ambiguous requests with clarification
- Suggesting relevant actions
- Learning from routing patterns

## Behavior

When triggered, this skill:

1. **Parses user intent**:
   - Extract action verbs
   - Identify objects/targets
   - Detect qualifiers and constraints
   - Recognize context from conversation

2. **Matches to skills**:
   - Search skill trigger patterns
   - Score match confidence
   - Consider context relevance

3. **Routes request**:
   - High confidence: Route directly
   - Medium confidence: Confirm with user
   - Low confidence: Offer options
   - No match: Suggest alternatives

4. **Handles follow-ups**:
   - Track routing context
   - Enable corrections
   - Learn from feedback

    prm: product-release-milestone
```

## Confidence Scoring

```yaml
confidence_levels:
  high:
    threshold: 0.85
    action: route_directly
    example: "create SAD" → artifact-orchestration (SAD)

  medium:
    threshold: 0.60
    action: confirm_before_routing
    example: "review this" → "Did you mean brand review or code review?"

  low:
    threshold: 0.40
    action: offer_options
    example: "help" → "Here are things I can help with..."

  none:
    threshold: 0.0
    action: clarify
    example: "do the thing" → "I'm not sure what you'd like to do. Can you clarify?"
```

## Routing Response Format

### Direct Route (High Confidence)

```yaml
routing_response:
  confidence: high
  matched_skill: artifact-orchestration
  extracted_params:
    artifact_type: sad
  message: "Creating Software Architecture Document..."
  next_action: invoke_skill
```

### Confirmation Route (Medium Confidence)

```yaml
routing_response:
  confidence: medium
  candidates:
    - skill: brand-compliance
      confidence: 0.72
      reason: "brand" keyword matched
    - skill: code-reviewer
      confidence: 0.65
      reason: "review" action detected
  message: "I found multiple possible actions. Did you mean..."
  next_action: await_clarification
```

### Options Route (Low Confidence)

```yaml
routing_response:
  confidence: low
  suggestions:
    - category: Documentation
      actions: [create SAD, generate ADR, draft requirements]
    - category: Review
      actions: [brand review, code review, security review]
    - category: Status
      actions: [project status, coverage report, risk review]
  message: "I'm not sure what you'd like to do. Here are some options..."
  next_action: await_selection
```

## Usage Examples

### Clear Intent

```
User: "Generate the architecture document"

Skill routes:
- Intent: create
- Object: architecture document → SAD
- Confidence: 0.95 (high)

Output:
"Routing to artifact-orchestration to generate Software Architecture Document.

Starting SAD generation..."

[Invokes artifact-orchestration with artifact_type=sad]
```

### Ambiguous Intent

```
User: "Review the landing page"

Skill analyzes:
- Intent: review
- Object: landing page
- Possible skills: brand-compliance, qa-protocol, code-reviewer
- Confidence: 0.65 (medium)

Output:
"I found a few review options for 'landing page':

1. **Brand Review** - Check brand compliance
2. **QA Review** - Check quality and specs
3. **Content Review** - Check copy and messaging

Which would you like?"
```

### Unclear Intent

```
User: "Help with the project"

Skill analyzes:
- Intent: unclear
- Object: project (generic)
- Confidence: 0.30 (low)

Output:
"I can help with many things! Here are some common actions:

**Project Status**
- Where are we? → Project status
- What's next? → Phase recommendations

**Documentation**
- Create SAD → Architecture document
- Generate ADR → Decision record

**Reviews**
- Security review → Threat assessment
- Brand review → Compliance check

What would you like to do?"
```

### Contextual Routing

```
User: (After discussing a bug) "Create a ticket for this"

Skill analyzes:
- Context: Bug discussion
- Intent: create
- Object: ticket
- Inference: incident or defect ticket
- Confidence: 0.80 (high with context)

Output:
"Based on our discussion, I'll create an incident ticket for the authentication issue.

Routing to incident-triage..."
```

    routes_to: performance-digest
    params:
      period: weekly
```

### Priority Overrides

```yaml
priority_overrides:
  # Urgent patterns always match first
  urgent:
    - "production down"
    - "SEV1"
