# Node Dependencies Update Skill

> **File paths**: All `scripts/` paths in this skill resolve under `~/.agents/skills/node-deps/`. Do not look for them in the current working directory.

Update Node.js dependencies using taze CLI with smart prompting: auto-apply MINOR/PATCH updates, prompt for MAJOR updates individually, skip fixed-version packages.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, verify taze is installed by running:

```bash
~/.agents/skills/node-deps/scripts/run-taze.sh
```

If exit code is 1, stop and inform the user that taze must be installed:

- Global install: `npm install -g taze`
- One-time: `npx taze`

## Update Workflow

### Step 1: Determine Scope

Ask the user if this is a monorepo project. Use the `-r` flag for recursive scanning of workspaces.

### Step 2: Scan for Updates

Run the taze script to discover all available updates:

```bash
# Single package
~/.agents/skills/node-deps/scripts/run-taze.sh

# Monorepo (recursive)
~/.agents/skills/node-deps/scripts/run-taze.sh -r
```

### Step 3: Parse and Categorize Updates

From the taze output, categorize each package update:

| Category  | Version Change                              | Action        |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| **Fixed** | No `^` or `~` prefix (e.g., `"1.0.0"`)      | Skip entirely |
| **PATCH** | `x.y.z` → `x.y.Z` (e.g., `1.0.0` → `1.0.1`) | Auto-apply    |
| **MINOR** | `x.y.z` → `x.Y.0` (e.g., `1.0.0` → `1.1.0`) | Auto-apply    |
| **MAJOR** | `x.y.z` → `X.0.0` (e.g., `1.0.0` → `2.0.0`) | Prompt user   |

**Identifying fixed versions:** In package.json, fixed versions have no range prefix:

- Fixed: `"lodash": "4.17.21"` → skip
- Ranged: `"lodash": "^4.17.21"` → process

### Step 4: Apply MINOR/PATCH Updates

Apply all non-major updates automatically without prompting:

```bash
# Single package
taze minor --write

# Monorepo
taze minor --write -r
```

Report the packages that were updated.

### Step 5: Prompt for MAJOR Updates

**Auto-skip packages:** Never prompt for these packages—auto-apply their major updates:

- `lucide-react` (icon library with frequent major bumps, backward-compatible in practice)

For each remaining package with a major update available, use `AskUserQuestion` to ask the user individually:

```
Package: <package-name>
Current: <current-version>
Available: <new-version>

Update to major version?
```

**Question format:**

- header: Package name (max 12 chars, truncate if needed)
- options: "Yes, update" / "No, skip"
- multiSelect: false

Collect all approved major updates.

### Step 6: Apply Approved MAJOR Updates

After collecting user approvals, apply the approved major updates:

```bash
# Apply specific packages
taze major --write --include <pkg1>,<pkg2>,<pkg3>

# With monorepo
taze major --write -r --include <pkg1>,<pkg2>,<pkg3>
```

### Step 7: Install Dependencies

After all updates are applied, remind the user to run their package manager's install command:

```bash
npm install
# or
pnpm install
# or
yarn install
```

## Taze Output Interpretation

Taze displays updates grouped by type. Example output:

```
@types/node  ^20.0.0  →  ^22.0.0   (major)
typescript   ^5.3.0   →  ^5.4.0    (minor)
eslint       ^8.56.0  →  ^8.57.0   (patch)
```

The rightmost column indicates update type (major/minor/patch).

Packages shown with `--include-locked` that have no `^` or `~` are fixed versions—skip these entirely.

## Script Reference

| Script                                              | Purpose                                              |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `~/.agents/skills/node-deps/scripts/run-taze.sh`    | Run taze in non-interactive mode, check installation |
| `~/.agents/skills/node-deps/scripts/run-taze.sh -r` | Same with recursive monorepo scanning                |

## Important Notes

- Fixed-version dependencies (no `^` or `~`) indicate intentional pinning—never modify these
- MAJOR updates may contain breaking changes—always prompt the user
- MINOR/PATCH updates are backward-compatible by semver convention—safe to auto-apply
- The `--include` flag accepts comma-separated package names or regex patterns
