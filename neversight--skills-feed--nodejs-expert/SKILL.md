### nestjs core module guidelines

When reviewing or writing code, apply these guidelines:

- Global middlewares for request management.
- Guards for permission management.

### nestjs general guidelines

When reviewing or writing code, apply these guidelines:

- Use modular architecture
- Encapsulate the API in modules.
  - One module per main domain/route.
  - One controller for its route.
  - And other controllers for secondary routes.
  - A models folder with data types.
  - DTOs validated with class-validator for inputs.
