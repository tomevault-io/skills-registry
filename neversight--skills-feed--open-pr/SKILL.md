# open-pr

Publish your work for review by pushing the branch and creating/updating a Draft PR with a strong title + description.

---

## Guardrails

- Do not implement new code here. If changes are needed, go back to `implement`.
- Do not merge the PR here. Review happens in `review`; merge/branch cleanup happens in `commit` (finalise mode).
- Prefer Draft PRs by default.
- For hotfixes committed directly to the default branch, a PR is optional; use `review local` + `commit` instead.

---

## Workflow

1. **Gather inputs**
   - PRD path (e.g. `tasks/f-##-<slug>.md`)
   - base branch (default: repository default branch resolved from `origin/HEAD`; ask if unclear)
   - PR title seed (default: from PRD title / feature ID)

2. **Preflight**
   - Confirm you are on a feature branch (not the base branch).
   - Ensure the working tree is clean (`git status --porcelain` is empty).
   - Ensure there are commits to push (compare `base...HEAD`).
   - Ensure the PRD contains checklist-based progress (user stories/tasks/acceptance criteria) and completed items are checked.
   - Capture test/check commands + results for the PR body (don't guess).

3. **Push the branch**
   - `git push -u origin HEAD`

4. **Draft PR title + body**
   - Use the template below and include:
     - PRD path
     - what changed + why
     - tests run (exact commands + results)
     - how to verify
     - risks / rollout / rollback (if applicable)

5. **Create or update the PR with `gh`**
   - Try to view an existing PR for the current branch:
     - `gh pr view --json url,number,state,isDraft -q .url`
   - If it exists, update:
     - `gh pr edit --title "<title>" --body "<body>"`
   - If it does not exist, create a Draft PR:
     - `gh pr create --draft --base "<base>" --title "<title>" --body "<body>"`
   - Capture the PR URL:
     - `gh pr view --json url -q .url`
   - If `gh` is unavailable, output the prepared title and body with manual instructions (repo URL, base branch, draft flag) so the user can create the PR themselves.

6. **Next**
   - Run `review` (PR mode) when needed, then run `commit` (finalise mode) when ready.
