openclaw doctor         # Health checks and diagnostics

# Gateway operations
openclaw gateway        # Start the WebSocket gateway
openclaw gateway --port 18789  # Custom port
openclaw --dev gateway  # Dev mode (isolated state, port 19001)
openclaw health         # Check gateway health
openclaw status         # Channel health and sessions

# Agent operations
openclaw agent --to +15555550123 --message "Hello"
openclaw agents         # Manage agent workspaces

# Messaging

```

## Common Workflows

### Initial Setup

openclaw setup
openclaw onboard
openclaw channels login --verbose
```

### Start Gateway and Send Message

```bash
openclaw gateway &
openclaw message send --target +15555550123 --message "Test"
```

### Run Agent Turn

```bash
openclaw agent --to +15555550123 --message "Run summary" --deliver
```

## Profile Isolation

Use `--dev` or `--profile <name>` to isolate state:

```bash
openclaw --dev gateway           # Uses ~/.openclaw-dev
openclaw --profile test gateway  # Uses ~/.openclaw-test
```
