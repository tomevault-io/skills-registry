# Operation Manual Writer

## Overview

This skill creates standardized business operation documentation (manuals, procedures, SOPs, regulations) following corporate documentation guidelines. It ensures consistent structure, clear responsibilities, and practical usability across all business documents.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill for creating:
- **Development procedures** (release, testing, environment setup)
- **Operation manuals** (daily reports, weekly reports, application flows, incident response)
- **Administrative procedures** (attendance, expense reimbursement, approval processes)
- **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)** for any business process
- **Regulations and policies** requiring standardized format

## Document Types Covered

1. **Release/Deployment Procedures**
2. **Testing Procedures**
3. **Operational Manuals**
4. **Administrative Instructions**
5. **Incident Response Guides**
6. **Policy Documents**
7. **Training Materials**

## Workflow

### 1. Gather Requirements

Ask the user to provide:
- **Purpose**: What is this document for?
- **Target audience**: Who will use this document?
- **Scope**: What processes/activities does it cover?
- **Specific steps**: What are the actual procedures (if known)?
- **Roles**: Who is responsible, who approves, who confirms?

**Example prompt**: "Please tell me: (1) document purpose, (2) target users, (3) process overview, (4) any specific steps"

### 2. Load Guidelines

**CRITICAL**: Before creating any document, read the complete guidelines:

```
references/business-document-guidelines.md
```

These guidelines define:
- Required document sections (7 mandatory headings)
- Writing style and formatting rules
- Responsibility assignment (RACI matrix)
- Version control and approval flow
- Template structure

### 3. Create Document

Follow the standard structure from guidelines:

**Mandatory sections (7 required headings):**
1. **目的 (Purpose)**: Why this document exists
2. **適用範囲 (Scope)**: Who/what it applies to
3. **責任と役割 (Responsibilities and Roles)**: RACI matrix
4. **手順・ルール (Procedures/Rules)**: Step-by-step instructions
5. **例外・注意点 (Exceptions/Cautions)**: Edge cases and important notes
6. **関連ドキュメント (Related Documents)**: References and links
7. **改訂履歴 (Revision History)**: Change log with dates

### 4. Format and Polish

Apply formatting standards:
- Hierarchical numbering (1 → 1.1 → 1.1.1)
- Definitive language (avoid "できれば", "なるべく")
- Date format: YYYY/MM/DD
- Tables and checklists for clarity
- Numbered lists for sequential steps

### 5. Save Document

Save the completed manual to the user's specified location or suggest:

```
operation-manuals/{category}/{document-name}.md
```

## Usage Examples

**Example 1: Release Procedure Manual**

User: "リリース手順書を作成してください"

Agent questions:
- What system/service is being released?
- Who performs the release? (developer, ops team, manager)
- What are the steps? (code freeze, testing, deployment, verification)
- Any approval required?

Agent creates: Structured release manual with all 7 sections

**Example 2: Daily Report Guidelines**

User: "日報の記録ルールを作成して"

Agent questions:
- Who submits daily reports?
- What information should be included?
- Where are reports submitted?
- Any review process?

Agent creates: Daily report policy document with examples

**Example 3: Incident Response Procedure**

User: "インシデント対応手順を整備したい"

Agent questions:
- What types of incidents? (system down, security, data issues)
- Who is on the response team?
- What are the escalation steps?
- Communication protocol?

Agent creates: Incident response manual with clear escalation paths

## Document Quality Standards

Every document must include:
- ✅ Clear purpose statement
- ✅ Defined scope and target audience
- ✅ RACI matrix (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed)
- ✅ Numbered, sequential procedures
- ✅ Exception handling guidance
- ✅ References to related documents
- ✅ Revision history with initial version

Avoid:
- ❌ Ambiguous language ("maybe", "preferably")
- ❌ Missing responsibility assignments
- ✅ Unnumbered procedures
- ❌ Inconsistent formatting
- ❌ Missing version control
