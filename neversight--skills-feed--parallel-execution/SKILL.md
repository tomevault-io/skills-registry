# Parallel Execution

Execute multiple independent tasks simultaneously to maximize throughput and minimize total execution time.

## When to Use

- Multiple independent tasks (no dependencies)
- Tasks benefit from concurrent execution
- Maximizing throughput is priority
- Available agents for parallel work
- Results can be aggregated after completion

## Core Concepts

### Independence

**Tasks are independent when**:
- ✓ No data dependencies (one doesn't need other's output)
- ✓ No resource conflicts (different files, databases)
- ✓ No ordering requirements (either can complete first)
- ✓ Failures are isolated (one failing doesn't block others)

**Example - Independent**:
```markdown
✓ Task A: Review code quality (code-reviewer)
✓ Task B: Run test suite (test-runner)
→ Can run in parallel
```

**Example - NOT Independent**:
```markdown
✗ Task A: Implement feature (feature-implementer)
✗ Task B: Test feature (test-runner)
→ B depends on A's output, must run sequentially
```

### Concurrency

**Critical**: Use **single message** with **multiple Task tool calls**

**Correct**:
```markdown
Send one message containing:
- Task tool call #1 → Agent A
- Task tool call #2 → Agent B
- Task tool call #3 → Agent C

All three agents start simultaneously.
```

**Incorrect**:
```markdown
Message 1: Task tool → code-reviewer
[wait]
Message 2: Task tool → test-runner
[wait]

This is sequential, NOT parallel!
```

### Synchronization

**Collection Point**:
- Wait for all parallel agents to complete
- Collect results from each agent
- Validate each result independently
- Aggregate results into final output

## Parallel Execution Process

### Step 1: Identify Independent Tasks

**Independence Checklist**:
- [ ] No data dependencies
- [ ] No shared writes (read-only or different targets)
- [ ] No execution order requirements
- [ ] Failures don't cascade
- [ ] Results can be validated independently

### Step 2: Agent Assignment

**Match Tasks to Agents**:
```markdown
Task 1: Review code quality → code-reviewer
Task 2: Run test suite → test-runner
Task 3: Run benchmarks → test-runner
```

**Agent Availability Check**:
- Ensure sufficient agents available
- Check for specialization overlap
- Consider workload balance

### Step 3: Launch Parallel Execution

```markdown
Single message with multiple Task tool calls:

<Task tool> → code-reviewer (review task)
<Task tool> → test-runner (test task)
<Task tool> → test-runner (benchmark task)

All agents start simultaneously.
```

### Step 4: Monitor Execution

**Track Progress**:
```markdown
Agent 1 (code-reviewer): In Progress
  Task: Code quality review

Agent 2 (test-runner): Completed ✓
  Task: Test suite
  Result: 45/45 tests passed

Agent 3 (test-runner): In Progress
  Task: Benchmarks
```

### Step 5: Collect & Validate Results

**As Each Agent Completes**:
1. Collect output
2. Validate against success criteria
3. Check for errors
4. Mark as complete or failed

### Step 6: Aggregate Results

```markdown
## Parallel Execution Results

### Completed Tasks:
1. ✓ Code quality review (code-reviewer)
   - Result: 3 minor issues found

2. ✓ Test suite (test-runner)
   - Result: All tests passing (45/45)

3. ✓ Performance benchmarks (test-runner)
   - Result: All benchmarks acceptable

### Overall Status: ✓ Success (with minor issues)
```

## Execution Patterns

### Pattern 1: Homogeneous Parallel

**All agents same type, different inputs**:
```markdown
Use Case: Test multiple modules

├─ test-runner: Test memory-core
├─ test-runner: Test memory-storage-turso
└─ test-runner: Test memory-storage-redb

Single message, 3 Task tool calls
```

### Pattern 2: Heterogeneous Parallel

**Different agent types, related task**:
```markdown
Use Case: Comprehensive code check

├─ code-reviewer: Quality analysis
├─ test-runner: Test execution
└─ debugger: Performance profiling

Single message, 3 Task tool calls
```

### Pattern 3: Parallel with Convergence

**Parallel execution → Single synthesis**:
```markdown
Phase 1: Parallel Investigation
├─ debugger: Profile performance
├─ code-reviewer: Analyze efficiency
└─ test-runner: Run benchmarks

[All complete]

Phase 2: Synthesis
└─ Combine findings, identify root cause
```

## Synchronization Strategies

### Wait for All (AND)

**Most Common**:
- Wait for ALL agents to complete
- Proceed only when all finished
- Useful when all results needed

### Wait for Any (OR)

**Early Termination**:
- Proceed when ANY agent completes successfully
- Cancel or continue others
- Useful for redundant approaches

### Wait for Threshold

**Partial Completion**:
- Proceed when N out of M agents complete
- Useful for resilience
- Handle missing results gracefully

## Resource Management

### Available Agents
- code-reviewer (1 instance)
- test-runner (1 instance)
- feature-implementer (1 instance)
- refactorer (1 instance)
- debugger (1 instance)

**Parallelization Limit**: Maximum 5 agents simultaneously (one of each type)

### Workload Balancing

**Distribute Evenly**:
```markdown
Tasks: [T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6]
Agents: [A, B, C]

Distribution:
- Agent A: T1, T4 (2 tasks)
- Agent B: T2, T5 (2 tasks)
- Agent C: T3, T6 (2 tasks)
```

## Error Handling

### Independent Failures

**Isolation**:
- One agent failing doesn't stop others
- Continue collecting successful results
- Report failed tasks separately

```markdown
Parallel Execution:
├─ Agent A: ✓ Success
├─ Agent B: ✗ Failed (error in code)
└─ Agent C: ✓ Success

Result:
- Collect: Results from A and C
- Report: B failed with error
- Decision: Retry B or proceed without
```

### Partial Success Handling

**Strategies**:

1. **Fail Fast**: If any fails, stop and report
2. **Best Effort**: Collect all successful results
3. **Retry Failed**: Let successful complete, retry failures

## Performance Optimization

### Speedup Calculation

```
Sequential time = T1 + T2 + T3 + ... + Tn
Parallel time = max(T1, T2, T3, ..., Tn)

Speedup = Sequential time / Parallel time
```

**Example**:
```markdown
Tasks:
- Task A: 10 minutes
- Task B: 15 minutes
- Task C: 8 minutes

Sequential: 10 + 15 + 8 = 33 minutes
Parallel: max(10, 15, 8) = 15 minutes

Speedup: 33 / 15 = 2.2x faster
```

### Optimal Parallelization

**Identify Bottlenecks**:
- Find longest-running task
- Can it be decomposed further?
- Can it be optimized?
- Start slow tasks first

## Best Practices

### DO:
✓ Verify independence before parallelizing
✓ Use single message with multiple Task tool calls
✓ Balance workload across agents
✓ Set appropriate timeouts for each task
✓ Handle failures gracefully (isolation)
✓ Validate each result independently
✓ Aggregate comprehensively at the end

### DON'T:
✗ Parallelize dependent tasks
✗ Send sequential messages thinking they're parallel
✗ Overload single agent while others idle
✗ Skip validation because "it's parallel"
✗ Assume all will succeed
✗ Ignore agent failures

## Examples

### Example 1: Simple Parallel Review

```markdown
Task: "Check code quality and run tests"

Analysis: Independent tasks, different agents

Plan:
├─ code-reviewer: Review code quality
└─ test-runner: Run test suite

Execution: [Single message with 2 Task tool calls]

Results:
- code-reviewer: 2 issues found ✓
- test-runner: 45/45 tests pass ✓

Speedup: 2x
```

### Example 2: Multi-Module Testing

```markdown
Task: "Test all crates in workspace"

Analysis: 3 independent crates, same agent type

Plan:
├─ test-runner: Test memory-core
├─ test-runner: Test memory-storage-turso
└─ test-runner: Test memory-storage-redb

Execution: [Single message with 3 Task tool calls]

Results:
- memory-core: 25/25 pass ✓
- memory-storage-turso: 15/15 pass ✓
- memory-storage-redb: 10/10 pass ✓

Speedup: 3x
```

### Example 3: Comprehensive Quality Check

```markdown
Task: "Pre-release quality validation"

Analysis: 4 independent checks, maximum parallelization

Plan:
├─ code-reviewer: Code quality (fmt, clippy)
├─ test-runner: Test suite execution
├─ test-runner: Performance benchmarks
└─ debugger: Memory leak detection

Execution: [Single message with 4 Task tool calls]

Results: All checks pass ✓

Speedup: 4x
```

## Integration

Parallel execution is one coordination strategy used by the agent-coordination skill:

```markdown
Coordination Strategy Selection:
├─ Independent tasks → Use parallel-execution (this skill)
├─ Dependent tasks → Use sequential coordination
├─ Complex mix → Use hybrid coordination
└─ Multiple perspectives → Use swarm (with parallel)
```

## Summary

Parallel execution maximizes efficiency for independent tasks by:
- **Concurrent agent execution** (single message, multiple tools)
- **Independent task validation** (no cross-dependencies)
- **Synchronized result collection** (wait for completion)
- **Comprehensive aggregation** (synthesize final output)

When done correctly, parallel execution provides significant speedup while maintaining quality and reliability.
