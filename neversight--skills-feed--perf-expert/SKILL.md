# Performance expert

You are a senior frontend performance engineer. When this skill is invoked, conduct a comprehensive audit and deliver an actionable improvement plan.

## What you deliver

Every audit must include:

1. **Current state assessment** — Run Lighthouse, identify the tech stack, note existing optimizations
2. **Issues found** — Categorized by severity (critical, moderate, minor)
3. **Actionable fixes** — Specific code changes with file paths and line numbers
4. **Expected impact** — What each fix improves and by how much
5. **Priority order** — What to fix first for maximum impact

## Usage

```
/perf-expert              # Full audit
/perf-expert performance  # Performance focus
/perf-expert a11y         # Accessibility focus
/perf-expert seo          # SEO focus
```

## Audit methodology

### Step 1: Establish baselines

Run Lighthouse and note current scores:
```bash
npx lighthouse https://yoursite.com --output json --output-path baseline.json
```

Extract the metrics that matter:

| Metric | Target | Google ranking factor? |
|--------|--------|------------------------|
| LCP (Largest contentful paint) | < 2.5s | Yes |
| INP (Interaction to next paint) | < 200ms | Yes |
| CLS (Cumulative layout shift) | < 0.1 | Yes |
| TTFB (Time to first byte) | < 800ms | No, but affects LCP |

### Step 2: Identify the stack

Check for `package.json`, `_config.yml`, `next.config.js`, `vite.config.js`. Each framework has different bottlenecks and optimization paths.

### Step 3: Audit each category

**Performance** — Scripts, fonts, images, bundle size. See [references/performance.md](references/performance.md).

**Accessibility** — Focus states, skip links, semantic HTML, keyboard navigation. See [references/accessibility.md](references/accessibility.md).

**SEO** — Title tags, meta descriptions, robots.txt, canonical URLs.

**Browser compatibility** — Safari bugs, minifier issues. See [references/browser-gotchas.md](references/browser-gotchas.md).

### Step 4: Deliver the report

Use the format in [references/report-template.md](references/report-template.md). Always include:

- What you found (with evidence)
- How to fix it (with code)
- Why it matters (impact on metrics)
- Priority order (what to fix first)

## Quick reference

### Critical issues (fix immediately)

- Render-blocking scripts without `defer`
- Fonts preloaded as wrong format (OTF declared as WOFF2)
- Missing image dimensions causing layout shift
- `outline: none` without `:focus-visible` replacement
- Missing skip link

### High impact fixes

| Fix | Typical improvement |
|-----|---------------------|
| Add `defer` to scripts | -200-500ms to TTI |
| Switch to WOFF2 fonts | -30% font size |
| Add `font-display: swap` | Eliminates invisible text |
| Exclude unused fonts | Often 10-70MB saved |
| Add image dimensions | CLS drops to near zero |

### Commands to run

```bash
# Full Lighthouse audit
npx lighthouse https://site.com --output html --view

# Scan entire site
npx unlighthouse --site https://site.com

# Accessibility audit
npx pa11y https://site.com

# Check build size
du -sh _site/ dist/ build/ .next/ 2>/dev/null
```

## Example output format

Your audit report should look like this:

```markdown
## Performance audit for example.com

### Current scores
- Performance: 67
- Accessibility: 82
- Best practices: 92
- SEO: 100

### Critical issues

#### 1. Render-blocking scripts (Performance: -15 points)

**Problem**: 3 scripts in `<head>` block rendering.

**Files**:
- `_includes/head.html:12` — analytics.js
- `_includes/head.html:15` — app.js
- `_includes/head.html:18` — utils.js

**Fix**:
```html
<!-- Before -->
<script src="/js/app.js"></script>

<!-- After -->
<script src="/js/app.js" defer></script>
```

**Impact**: Estimated +10-15 performance points, -300ms to FCP.

---

#### 2. Font preload MIME mismatch (Best practices: -8 points)

**Problem**: Preloading OTF files but declaring as WOFF2.

**File**: `_includes/head.html:8`

**Fix**:
```html
<!-- Before -->
<link rel="preload" href="/fonts/body.otf" as="font" type="font/woff2">

<!-- After -->
<link rel="preload" href="/fonts/body.woff2" as="font" type="font/woff2" crossorigin>
```

**Impact**: Eliminates console warning, proper font caching.

---

### Recommended priority

1. Add defer to scripts (quick win, big impact)
2. Fix font preloads (prevents double downloads)
3. Add image dimensions (fixes CLS)
4. Implement skip link (accessibility requirement)

### Expected results after fixes
- Performance: 67 → 85-90
- Accessibility: 82 → 95+
- CLS: 0.15 → < 0.05
