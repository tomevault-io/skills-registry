| `perplexity "query"` | Search with default settings |

| Mode | Flag | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| pro | `--mode pro` | Deep search with reasoning (default) |
| deep-research | `--mode deep-research` | Comprehensive research |

## Common Operations

### Basic Query
```bash
perplexity "What is quantum computing?"
```

### Query with Specific Mode
```bash
perplexity "Explain neural networks" --mode pro
```

### Read Query from File, Save Response
```bash
perplexity -f question.md -o answer.md 
```

### Query with Sources

perplexity "Climate research" --sources web,scholar 
```

## All Flags

## Best Practices

1. Use `--mode deep-research` for comprehensive research tasks
2. Use `-f` and `-o` flags for batch processing

## Piping and Scripting

```bash
# Pipe query from stdin
echo "What is Go?" | perplexity

# Use in scripts
RESPONSE=$(perplexity "Quick answer" --mode pro 2>/dev/null)

# Batch processing
cat questions.txt | while read q; do
  perplexity "$q" -o "answers/$(echo $q | md5sum | cut -c1-8).md"
done
```
