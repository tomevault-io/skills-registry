name: photo-color
description: Adjust photo brightness, contrast, and saturation based on natural language prompts using GPT-5 text analysis. Use when the user asks to adjust brightness, change contrast, modify saturation, apply a specific style, or fix photo issues like washed out colors. Use when this capability is needed.

# Photo Color

## When to Use

Use this skill when the user asks to:
- Adjust brightness (e.g., "make it brighter", "darken the photo")
- Change contrast (e.g., "increase contrast", "make it more dramatic")
- Modify saturation (e.g., "make colors more vibrant", "desaturate")
- Apply a specific style (e.g., "cinematic look", "natural enhancement")
- Fix photo issues (e.g., "fix washed out colors", "add warmth")

## Instructions

This skill uses GPT-5 text API to interpret natural language and calculate color adjustments. Always:

1. **Validate input** - Ensure photo exists and is JPG/PNG format
2. **Analyze photo** - Calculate current brightness, contrast, saturation scores
3. **Call GPT-5** - Get enhancement suggestions based on user's prompt and photo analysis
4. **Select best match** - Choose suggestion that best matches prompt keywords (vivid/natural/dramatic)
5. **Apply enhancements** - Adjust colors and save to new file (never overwrite original)
6. **Report results** - Show multipliers applied and GPT-5's reasoning

### Usage

```python
from photo_color import main

result = main(
    photo_path="photo.jpg",
    prompt="Make the colors more vibrant and warm"
)
# Returns: "photo-enhanced.jpg"
```

### Command Line

```bash
python photo_color.py <photo_path> "<prompt>" [output_path]
```

### Examples

**Vivid colors:**
```
Make the colors much more vibrant and vivid
Increase saturation by 50%
Make colors pop
```

**Natural enhancement:**
```
Apply a subtle natural enhancement
Keep it looking natural and soft
```

**Cinematic/dramatic:**
```
Create a dramatic cinematic look with high contrast
Make it bold and intense
```

**Fix issues:**
```
Fix the washed out appearance
Increase saturation to make colors more realistic
Add warmth to the photo
```

**Specific adjustments:**
```
Brighten and increase contrast
Make it darker and more moody
```

## Output

- Returns path to enhanced photo
- Never overwrites original
- Format: `{original_name}-enhanced.{ext}`
- Multipliers in safe range (0.5-2.0)
- Displays style name and GPT-5's reasoning

## Enhancement Styles

GPT-5 suggests these style categories:
- **Vivid**: High saturation (1.3-1.5), increased brightness and contrast
- **Natural**: Subtle adjustments (1.05-1.2), minimal changes
- **Dramatic**: High contrast (1.5-1.8), bold adjustments
- **Custom**: Tailored to specific prompt requirements

## Error Handling

- Falls back to safe defaults (×1.2 saturation, ×1.1 brightness, ×1.1 contrast) if GPT-5 unavailable
- Validates multipliers (0.5-2.0 range)
- Clear error messages for missing files or invalid formats

## Requirements

- OPENROUTER_API_KEY environment variable must be set
- Photo must be JPG or PNG format
- Photo under 50MB recommended

## Technical Implementation

See `references/implementation.md` for:
- GPT-5 text API integration
- Photo analysis algorithms
- Color enhancement styles
- Prompt matching strategy

## Examples

See `examples/common-use-cases.md` for:
- Vivid color enhancement
- Natural subtle adjustment
- Dramatic cinematic look
- Fix washed out photos
- Add warmth
- Before/after comparisons
