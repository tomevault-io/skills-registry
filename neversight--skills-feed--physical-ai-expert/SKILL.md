## Inverse Kinematics in Humanoid Robotics

Inverse kinematics (IK) is a fundamental problem in robotics that involves determining the joint angles required to achieve a desired end-effector position and orientation. For humanoid robots, this is particularly complex due to the redundant nature of their kinematic chains.

### Mathematical Formulation

Given an end-effector position $ \mathbf{p} = [x, y, z]^T $ and orientation $ \mathbf{R} $, the inverse kinematics problem seeks to find the joint configuration $ \mathbf{q} = [q_1, q_2, ..., q_n]^T $ such that:

$$ f(\mathbf{q}) = \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{p} \\ \mathbf{R} \end{bmatrix} $$

Where $ f $ is the forward kinematics function. The solution typically involves iterative methods such as the Jacobian transpose method or cyclic coordinate descent for redundant systems.

### Jacobian-Based Solution

For small displacements, the relationship between joint velocities and end-effector velocities is given by:

$$ \Delta \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{J}(\mathbf{q}) \Delta \mathbf{q} $$

Where $ \mathbf{J}(\mathbf{q}) $ is the geometric Jacobian matrix. The inverse kinematics solution can be approximated as:

$$ \Delta \mathbf{q} = \mathbf{J}^{-1}(\mathbf{q}) \Delta \mathbf{x} $$

For redundant systems, the pseudoinverse is used:

$$ \Delta \mathbf{q} = \mathbf{J}^+(\mathbf{q}) \Delta \mathbf{x} $$
