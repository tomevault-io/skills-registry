# PinMe Skill

Use PinMe CLI to upload files to IPFS and get a preview URL.

## When to Use

### General File Upload
- User wants to upload any files or folders to IPFS
- User wants to share files via decentralized storage
- User mentions "pinme", "pin", "IPFS", or "upload to IPFS"

### Website Deployment
- User requests deployment of a frontend project
- User wants to deploy a static website
- After building a frontend project (Vue, React, Next.js, etc.)

## Upload Steps

### 1. Check if PinMe is Installed

```bash
pinme --version
```

If not installed:
```bash
npm install -g pinme
```

### 2. Identify Upload Target

**For general files:**
- Use the file or directory path specified by the user
- Can be any file type: images, documents, archives, etc.

**For website deployment:**
Look for build output directories (in priority order):
1. `dist/` - Vue/React/Vite default output
2. `build/` - Create React App output
3. `out/` - Next.js static export
4. `public/` - Pure static projects

### 3. Execute Upload

```bash
pinme upload <path>
```

Examples:
```bash
# Upload a single file
pinme upload ./document.pdf

# Upload a folder
pinme upload ./my-folder

# Upload website build output
pinme upload dist
```

### 4. Return Result

After successful upload, return the preview URL:
```
https://pinme.eth.limo/#/preview/<hash>
```

Users can visit the preview page to:
- View or download the uploaded files
- Get a fixed domain: `https://<name>.pinit.eth.limo`

## Important Rules

**DO:**
- Verify the file or directory exists before uploading
- Return the preview URL to the user

**DO NOT:**
- Upload `node_modules/`
- Upload `.env` files
- Upload `.git/` directory
- Upload empty or non-existent paths

**For website deployment, also avoid:**
- Uploading source code instead of build output
- Uploading configuration files (package.json, tsconfig.json, etc.)

## Common Workflows

### General File Upload

```bash
# Upload a single file
pinme upload ./image.png

# Upload a folder
pinme upload ./my-documents

# Upload with specific path
pinme upload /path/to/files
```

### Website Deployment

#### Vue/Vite
```bash
npm run build
pinme upload dist
```

#### React CRA
```bash
npm run build
pinme upload build
```

#### Next.js Static
```bash
npm run build
npm run export  # or next export
pinme upload out
```

## Error Handling

| Error | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| `command not found: pinme` | Run `npm install -g pinme` |
| `No such file or directory` | Check path exists |
| `Permission denied` | Check file/folder permissions |
| Upload failed | Check network, retry |

## Other Commands

```bash
# List upload history
pinme list
pinme ls -l 5

# Remove uploaded file
pinme rm <hash>
```
