# Plan Generator Skill

<identity>
Plan Generator Skill - Creates structured, validated plans from requirements by coordinating with specialist agents and generating comprehensive planning artifacts.
</identity>

<capabilities>
- Creating plans for new features
- Planning refactoring efforts
- Planning system migrations
- Planning architecture changes
- Breaking down complex requirements
- Validating existing plans
</capabilities>

<instructions>
<execution_process>

### Step 1: Analyze Requirements

Parse user requirements:

- Extract explicit requirements
- Identify implicit requirements
- Determine planning scope
- Assess complexity

### Step 2: Coordinate Specialists

Request planning input from relevant agents:

- **Analyst**: Business requirements and market context
- **PM**: Product requirements and user stories
- **Architect**: Technical architecture and design
- **Database Architect**: Data requirements
- **UX Expert**: Interface requirements

### Step 3: Generate Plan Structure

Create plan following this **EXECUTABLE** structure:

````markdown
# Plan: [Title]

## Executive Summary

[2-3 sentence overview]

## Objectives

- [Objective 1]
- [Objective 2]

## Phases

### Phase N: [Phase Title]

**Dependencies**: [Phase numbers or 'None']
**Parallel OK**: [Yes/No - can tasks run concurrently?]

#### Tasks

- [ ] **N.1** [Task description] (~X min)
  - **Command**: `actual shell command here`
  - **Verify**: `command to verify success`
  - **Rollback**: `command to undo if needed`

- [ ] **N.2** [Task description] (~X min) [⚡ parallel OK]
  - **Command**: `...`
  - **Verify**: `...`

#### Phase N Error Handling

If any task fails:

1. Run rollback commands for completed tasks (reverse order)
2. Document error: `echo "Phase N failed: [error]" >> .claude/context/memory/issues.md`
3. Do NOT proceed to Phase N+1

#### Phase N Verification Gate

```bash
# All must pass before proceeding
[verification commands]
```
````

## Risks

| Risk   | Impact  | Mitigation | Rollback  |
| ------ | ------- | ---------- | --------- |
| [Risk] | [H/M/L] | [Strategy] | [Command] |

## Timeline Summary

| Phase | Tasks | Est. Time | Parallel? |
| ----- | ----- | --------- | --------- |
| 1     | 5     | 30 min    | Partial   |
| 2     | 3     | 20 min    | No        |

````

### The Executable Task Format (MANDATORY)

Every task MUST include:
1. **Checkbox** - `- [ ]` for progress tracking
2. **ID** - `N.M` format for reference
3. **Time estimate** - `(~X min)`
4. **Command** - Actual executable command
5. **Verify** - Command to confirm success
6. **Rollback** - Command to undo (if applicable)
7. **Parallel marker** - `[⚡ parallel OK]` if can run concurrently

### Guidelines
- Define clear objectives
- Break down into phases (<=7 phases total)
- Each phase has <=7 tasks
- Every task has executable commands
- Include verification gates between phases

### Step 4: Assess Risks

Identify risks and mitigation:

- Technical risks
- Resource risks
- Timeline risks
- Dependency risks
- Mitigation strategies

### Step 5: Validate Plan

Validate plan completeness:

- All requirements addressed
- Dependencies mapped
- Success criteria defined
- Risks identified
- Plan is feasible

### Step 6: Generate Artifacts

Create plan artifacts:

- Plan markdown: `.claude/context/artifacts/plan-<id>.md`
- Plan JSON: `.claude/context/artifacts/plan-<id>.json`
- Plan summary
</execution_process>

<plan_types>
**Feature Development Plan**:

- Objectives: Feature goals
- Steps: Analysis -> Design -> Implementation -> Testing
- Agents: Analyst -> PM -> Architect -> Developer -> QA

**Refactoring Plan**:

- Objectives: Code quality goals
- Steps: Analysis -> Planning -> Implementation -> Validation
- Agents: Code Reviewer -> Refactoring Specialist -> Developer -> QA

**Migration Plan**:

- Objectives: Migration goals
- Steps: Analysis -> Planning -> Execution -> Validation
- Agents: Architect -> Legacy Modernizer -> Developer -> QA

**Architecture Plan**:

- Objectives: Architecture goals
- Steps: Analysis -> Design -> Validation -> Documentation
- Agents: Architect -> Database Architect -> Security Architect -> Technical Writer
</plan_types>

<integration>
**Integration with Planner Agent**:
Planner agent uses this skill to:
- Generate plans from requirements
- Coordinate specialist input
- Validate plan completeness
- Track plan execution
</integration>

<best_practices>

1. **Coordinate Early**: Get specialist input before finalizing plan
2. **Keep Steps Focused**: <=7 steps per plan section
3. **Map Dependencies**: Clearly identify prerequisites
4. **Assess Risks**: Identify and mitigate risks proactively
5. **Validate Thoroughly**: Ensure plan is complete and feasible
</best_practices>

**Example Plan Output**

**Command**: "Generate plan for user authentication feature"

**Generated Plan**:

```markdown
# Plan: User Authentication Feature

## Executive Summary
Add JWT-based authentication with login/logout endpoints. Includes password hashing, session management, and security testing.

## Objectives
- Implement JWT-based authentication
- Support login, logout, and session management
- Provide secure password handling

## Phases

### Phase 1: Setup & Design
**Dependencies**: None
**Parallel OK**: Partial

#### Tasks
- [ ] **1.1** Create feature branch (~2 min)
  - **Command**: `git checkout -b feature/auth`
  - **Verify**: `git branch --show-current | grep feature/auth`

- [ ] **1.2** Create auth module directory (~1 min) [⚡ parallel OK]
  - **Command**: `mkdir -p src/auth`
  - **Verify**: `ls -d src/auth`

- [ ] **1.3** Design auth architecture (~15 min)
  - **Command**: `Task({ agent: "architect", prompt: "Design JWT auth..." })`
  - **Verify**: `ls .claude/context/artifacts/auth-design.md`

#### Phase 1 Verification Gate
```bash
git branch --show-current | grep feature/auth && ls src/auth && ls .claude/context/artifacts/auth-design.md
````

### Phase 2: Implementation

**Dependencies**: Phase 1

## Rules

### The Iron Law of Planning
```

EVERY TASK MUST HAVE AN EXECUTABLE COMMAND

````

A task without a command is not a task - it's a wish.

### Mandatory Elements
- **Every task** must have: checkbox, ID, time estimate, command, verify
- **Every phase** must have: verification gate, error handling
- **Every risk** must have: rollback command

### Anti-Patterns (DO NOT)
| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Fix |
|--------------|---------|-----|
| "Install X" without command | Not executable | Add: `cp -r source dest` |
| "Verify Y works" | Vague | Add: `npm test \| grep PASS` |
| "Update Z" | What file? What change? | Add exact `Edit` or `sed` command |
| No time estimates | Can't track progress | Add `(~X min)` to every task |
| No rollback | Can't recover from failure | Add rollback command |

### Quality Checklist
Before finalizing any plan, verify:
- [ ] Can I copy-paste every command and run it?
- [ ] Does every verify command have a clear pass/fail output?
- [ ] Is there a rollback for every destructive operation?
- [ ] Are time estimates realistic and granular?
- [ ] Are parallel tasks marked with ⚡?
