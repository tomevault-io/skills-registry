description: Create a Product Requirements Document (PRD) / feature plan for a new or existing item (`Type: feat` / `fix` / `chore`). Use when planning scope, writing requirements, defining user stories + acceptance criteria, or turning an idea into an implementable spec. Triggers: plan, prd, product requirements, feature spec, bugfix spec, fix spec, requirements doc, spec this feature, write requirements. Use when this capability is needed.

# plan

Create a clear, implementation-ready PRD for a single feature (not code).

---

## Guardrails

- Do not implement the feature.
- If the user asks to implement, propose writing a PRD first (or ask if they want to skip the PRD).
- Prefer asking a small number of high-value questions; otherwise write a draft PRD with explicit assumptions.
- Write the PRD so a junior dev (or another AI) can implement it without extra context (plain language, explicit edge cases, verifiable acceptance criteria).
- Treat memory capture as built-in: if planning introduces durable decisions/constraints, update `tasks/memory.md` in this step.

---

## Workflow

1. Identify the feature:
   - Prefer a feature ID like `f-01` if available.
   - If `tasks/todo.md` exists, use the matching feature entry as the baseline for outcome + scope.
   - If the feature entry includes `Type:`, carry it into the PRD Summary so `implement` can branch and implement appropriately.
   - If `Type:` is missing, assume `Type: feat`.
   - If `tasks/todo.md` is missing or the feature is not in it yet, stop and use `new` to add the feature to `tasks/todo.md` first.
   - If `tasks/memory.md` exists, skim relevant key decisions / notes before finalising requirements.
2. Check priority (if `tasks/todo.md` exists):
   - Priority is determined by list order (higher in the list = higher priority).
   - If there are higher-priority unchecked items above this feature, ask the user to confirm they want to proceed (vs writing a PRD for one of the higher-priority items first). Mention the higher-priority IDs/names.
   - If the user says this item is urgent, recommend switching to `new` to move it higher in `tasks/todo.md`, then return to `plan`.
3. Determine the PRD file path:
   - First look for an active PRD matching the feature ID in `tasks/` (`tasks/f-##-*.md`).
   - If one exists, use it.
   - Otherwise use `tasks/f-##-<feature-slug>.md` (include the feature ID in the filename).
4. If a PRD already exists at that path, update it in place (do not create a duplicate PRD unless the user asks). Do not reset any existing checklist items inside the PRD.
5. Ask essential clarifying questions (lettered options) only when needed.
6. Confirm scope boundaries (in-scope vs non-goals) and success metrics.
7. Write or update the PRD at the chosen path (create `tasks/` if missing):
   - Ensure implementation progress is trackable via checklist items (for example, user stories and acceptance criteria checkboxes).
   - If `tasks/todo.md` lists `Dependencies:` for this feature, include them in "Dependencies & Constraints" (dependency validation happens during `implement`).
8. If `tasks/todo.md` exists, update it to reflect the PRD:
   - Check the feature checkbox (`- [ ]` → `- [x]`).
9. Evaluate memory-worthy outcomes and update `tasks/memory.md` inline when needed:
   - architecture or requirement decisions with durable impact
   - new constraints, non-goals, or rollout assumptions
   - risk decisions likely to affect later implementation/review
10. Reply with updated file paths and a short summary + open questions.

## Clarifying Questions (Only If Needed)

Ask up to ~7 questions. Use numbered questions with A/B/C/D options and an **Other** option so the user can reply like `1B, 2D, 3A`.

Cover only what is ambiguous:

- which feature this PRD is for (feature ID/name)
- user + use case
- problem + desired outcome
- scope boundaries (in scope vs out of scope)
- whether this is `Type: feat` vs `fix` vs `chore`
- feature dependencies (by feature ID)
- conflicts with existing decisions/constraints (from `tasks/memory.md`)
- platforms/surfaces
- data + permissions
- integrations / external dependencies
- success metrics
- rollout constraints / timeline

### Example question format

```text
1. What is the primary goal?
   A. Enable a new capability
   B. Improve an existing workflow
   C. Reduce cost / time / errors
   D. Other: [describe]
```

## PRD Template (Markdown)

Write the PRD using this default structure. Drop sections that truly do not apply, but prefer completeness.

```markdown
# PRD: <Feature name>

## 0. Summary
- **Feature ID**: f-##
- **Type**: feat | fix | chore
- **Dependencies** (feature IDs): <none> | f-02, f-10
- **What**: …
- **Why**: …
- **Who**: …
- **Success looks like**: …
- **Assumptions** (if any): …

## 1. Problem / Opportunity
Describe the user pain / opportunity and why now.

### For `Type: fix` items, also include:
- **Current behaviour**: what happens now
- **Expected behaviour**: what should happen
- **Repro steps** (if known): step-by-step to reproduce
- **Suspected root cause** (if known): …
- **Minimal fix approach**: smallest change to resolve
- **Regression tests to add**: what to test to prevent recurrence

## 2. Goals
- G-1: …

```

### Acceptance criteria examples

- Bad: "Export works."
- Good: "When a user clicks **Export CSV**, the app downloads a CSV that includes columns A/B/C in that order; if there are 0 rows, download still occurs with headers only; errors show a non-blocking toast with retry."

## Output

- Create or reuse `tasks/`.
- Save/update the PRD at the chosen path (prefer existing active `tasks/f-##-*.md`; otherwise `tasks/f-##-<feature-slug>.md`).
- If the slug or scope is ambiguous, ask the user to confirm before saving.
- If `tasks/todo.md` exists, update it (check the feature only; no PRD path field).
- If the PRD introduces durable decisions/constraints, update `tasks/memory.md` in the same run.
- End with a short status block:
  - **Files changed**: list of created/updated files
  - **Key decisions**: any assumptions or choices made (if any)
  - **Next step**: recommended next skill or action

---

## Todo Sync (If `tasks/todo.md` Exists)

- Update `tasks/todo.md` in place; do not reformat the whole file.
- Find the matching feature by ID (preferred) or by feature name.
- Update the feature checklist item to checked (`- [ ]` → `- [x]`). In `tasks/todo.md`, checked means "PRD exists" (not "built").
- Preserve the feature's `Type:` / `Dependencies:` lines as-is unless the user explicitly asked to change them.
- If the feature is not present in `tasks/todo.md`, do not create a PRD yet—use `new` to add the feature first, then return to `plan`.

---

## Quality Checklist

Before saving the PRD:

- [ ] If a PRD already existed, it was updated in place (no duplicates).
- [ ] If updating an existing PRD, keep existing story/task checkboxes (do not reset them).
- [ ] PRD Summary includes `Type:`.
- [ ] If the feature has dependencies in `tasks/todo.md`, they are referenced by ID and included in "Dependencies & Constraints".
- [ ] PRD is consistent with `tasks/memory.md` (or `tasks/memory.md` was updated in this run).
- [ ] Goals are measurable and directly tied to success metrics.
- [ ] Non-goals are explicit (prevent scope creep).
- [ ] User stories are checklist items with verifiable acceptance criteria.
- [ ] Requirements are numbered (FR/NFR) and unambiguous.
- [ ] Edge cases, error states, and permissions are specified.
- [ ] Rollout plan and rollback plan exist (if risk warrants it).
- [ ] Saved/updated at the chosen PRD path.
- [ ] If `tasks/todo.md` exists, the feature is checked.
