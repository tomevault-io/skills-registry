# Planning with Files

Work like Manus: Use persistent markdown files as your "working memory on disk."

## The Core Pattern

```
Context Window = RAM (volatile, limited)
Filesystem = Disk (persistent, unlimited)

Anything important gets written to disk.
```

## Quick Start

Before ANY complex task:

1. **Create `task_plan.md`** - Use the template below
2. **Create `findings.md`** - For research and discoveries
3. **Create `progress.md`** - For session logging
4. **Re-read plan before decisions** - Refreshes goals in attention window
5. **Update after each phase** - Mark complete, log errors

## File Purposes

| File | Purpose | When to Update |
|------|---------|----------------|
| `task_plan.md` | Phases, progress, decisions | After each phase |
| `findings.md` | Research, discoveries | After ANY discovery |
| `progress.md` | Session log, test results | Throughout session |

## Critical Rules

### 1. Create Plan First

Never start a complex task without `task_plan.md`. Non-negotiable.

### 2. The 2-Action Rule

> "After every 2 view/browser/search operations, IMMEDIATELY save key findings to text files."

This prevents visual/multimodal information from being lost.

### 3. Read Before Decide

Before major decisions, read the plan file. This keeps goals in your attention window.

### 4. Update After Act

After completing any phase:

- Mark phase status: `in_progress` -> `complete`
- Log any errors encountered
- Note files created/modified

### 5. Log ALL Errors

Every error goes in the plan file. This builds knowledge and prevents repetition.

```markdown
## Errors Encountered
| Error | Attempt | Resolution |
|-------|---------|------------|
| FileNotFoundError | 1 | Created default config |
| API timeout | 2 | Added retry logic |
```

### 6. Never Repeat Failures

```
if action_failed:
    next_action != same_action
```

Track what you tried. Mutate the approach.

## The 3-Strike Error Protocol

```
ATTEMPT 1: Diagnose & Fix
  -> Read error carefully
  -> Identify root cause
  -> Apply targeted fix

ATTEMPT 2: Alternative Approach
  -> Same error? Try different method
  -> Different tool? Different library?
  -> NEVER repeat exact same failing action

ATTEMPT 3: Broader Rethink
  -> Question assumptions
  -> Search for solutions
  -> Consider updating the plan

AFTER 3 FAILURES: Escalate to User
  -> Explain what you tried
  -> Share the specific error
  -> Ask for guidance
```

## Read vs Write Decision Matrix

| Situation | Action | Reason |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Just wrote a file | DON'T read | Content still in context |
| Viewed image/PDF | Write findings NOW | Multimodal -> text before lost |
| Browser returned data | Write to file | Screenshots don't persist |
| Starting new phase | Read plan/findings | Re-orient if context stale |
| Error occurred | Read relevant file | Need current state to fix |
| Resuming after gap | Read all planning files | Recover state |

## The 5-Question Reboot Test

If you can answer these, your context management is solid:

| Question | Answer Source |
|----------|---------------|
| Where am I? | Current phase in task_plan.md |
| Where am I going? | Remaining phases |
| What's the goal? | Goal statement in plan |
| What have I learned? | findings.md |
| What have I done? | progress.md |

## Templates

### task_plan.md Template

```markdown
# Task Plan: [Task Name]

## Goal
[Clear statement of what we're trying to accomplish]

## Phases

### Phase 1: [Name]
- Status: pending | in_progress | complete
- Tasks:
  - [ ] Task 1
  - [ ] Task 2

### Phase 2: [Name]
- Status: pending
- Tasks:
  - [ ] Task 1

## Errors Encountered
| Error | Attempt | Resolution |
|-------|---------|------------|

## Decisions Made
| Decision | Rationale | Date |
|----------|-----------|------|

## Files Modified
- [file1.py] - [what changed]
```

### findings.md Template

```markdown
# Research Findings

## [Topic 1]
- Key insight 1
- Key insight 2
- Source: [where found]

## [Topic 2]
- Finding 1
- Finding 2
```

### progress.md Template

```markdown
# Session Progress

## [Date/Time]
- Started: [task]
- Completed: [what]
- Blocked on: [if any]
- Next: [what's next]
```

## When to Use This Pattern

**Use for:**

- Multi-step tasks (3+ steps)
- Research tasks
- Building/creating projects
- Tasks spanning many tool calls
- Anything requiring organization

**Skip for:**

- Simple questions
- Single-file edits
- Quick lookups

## Anti-Patterns

| Don't | Do Instead |
|-------|------------|
| Use TodoWrite for persistence | Create task_plan.md file |
| State goals once and forget | Re-read plan before decisions |
| Hide errors and retry silently | Log errors to plan file |
| Stuff everything in context | Store large content in files |
| Start executing immediately | Create plan file FIRST |
| Repeat failed actions | Track attempts, mutate approach |
