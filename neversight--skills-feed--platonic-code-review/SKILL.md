# Platonic Code Review

Validate that code implementation is consistent with project specifications and requirements.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need to:

- **Verify** code implementation matches RFC specifications
- **Validate** feature completeness against requirements
- **Check consistency** between specs and actual code
- **Identify gaps** where specs exist but implementation is missing
- **Find discrepancies** where code behavior differs from specs
- **Audit compliance** with documented design decisions

Keywords: spec compliance, implementation validation, requirement verification, consistency check, gap analysis

## What This Skill Does

This is NOT a general code quality reviewer. It specifically focuses on:

✅ **Spec-to-Code Consistency**: Does the code implement what the specs describe?  
✅ **Completeness**: Are all specified features implemented?  
✅ **Correctness**: Does the implementation match spec requirements?  
✅ **Gap Identification**: What's specified but not implemented?  
✅ **Discrepancy Detection**: Where does code differ from specs?

## Default Behavior

**By Default**: Generates review report **without modifying code**

- Creates detailed report of findings
- Highlights inconsistencies and gaps
- Provides actionable recommendations
- Does NOT make code changes automatically

**To Modify Code**: User must explicitly request code modifications

## Review Procedure

The standard review process follows these steps:

### Step 1: Understand Specifications

- Locate and read relevant specification documents
  - RFC documents (rfc-*.md)
  - Requirements documents
  - Design documents
  - API specifications
- Extract key requirements and expected behaviors
- Identify testable criteria

### Step 2: Generate Functionality Checklist

Create a comprehensive checklist from specs:
- List all specified features
- List all specified behaviors
- List all API endpoints/interfaces
- List all data structures
- List all business rules
- List all constraints and validations

### Step 3: Map Specs to Code

Identify code locations implementing each spec:
- Find relevant files and modules
- Map features to implementation
- Identify entry points and key functions
- Understand code structure

### Step 4: Review Implementation Against Specs

For each checklist item:
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented / ⚠️ Partial / ❌ Missing / 🔍 Unclear
- **Consistency**: Does implementation match spec?
- **Completeness**: Are all aspects implemented?
- **Correctness**: Does it work as specified?
- **Evidence**: Specific code references

### Step 5: Identify Discrepancies

Document inconsistencies:
- **Implementation differs** from spec
- **Missing features** specified but not implemented
- **Extra features** implemented but not specified
- **Incorrect behavior** doesn't match spec requirements
- **Incomplete implementation** partially done

### Step 6: Generate Review Report

Create structured report with:
- Executive summary
- Functionality checklist with status
- Detailed findings (consistent, inconsistent, missing)
- Code references for each finding
- Prioritized recommendations
- Suggested actions (ask user before implementing)

## Extended Review Capabilities

Beyond the basic procedure, this skill can:

### Validation Levels

**Level 1: Basic Compliance**
- Check if major features are implemented
- Verify core functionality exists

**Level 2: Detailed Verification**
- Validate all specified behaviors
- Check edge cases and error handling
- Verify data structures and interfaces

**Level 3: Comprehensive Audit**
- Deep dive into implementation details
- Compare algorithms and approaches
- Validate performance requirements
- Check all specified constraints

### Cross-Reference Analysis

- **Bi-directional Check**: 
  - Specs → Code (what's missing in code?)
  - Code → Specs (what's not documented?)
- **Dependency Validation**: 
  - Check if dependencies match specs
  - Verify integration points
- **Version Alignment**: 
  - Ensure code version matches spec version
  - Track changes across versions

### Test Coverage Integration

- Compare test cases with spec requirements
- Identify untested specified behaviors
- Suggest test scenarios based on specs
- Validate test coverage completeness

## Report Format

Reviews generate structured reports:

```markdown
# Spec-to-Code Review Report

## Summary
- Specifications Reviewed: X
- Code Modules Reviewed: Y
- Consistency Rate: Z%

## Checklist Summary
- ✅ Fully Implemented: A items
- ⚠️ Partially Implemented: B items
- ❌ Not Implemented: C items
- 🔍 Unclear/Needs Investigation: D items

## Critical Inconsistencies
[Items where code contradicts specs]

## Missing Implementations
[Specified features not found in code]

## Extra Implementations
[Code features not in specs]

## Recommendations
[Prioritized actions - ASK USER before modifying code]
```

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Basic Spec Review

```
Use platonic-code-review to review the implementation of 
rfc-001-user-authentication.md in the src/auth/ directory.
Generate a report showing what's implemented and what's missing.
```

### Example 2: Comprehensive Module Review

```
Use platonic-code-review to conduct a comprehensive review 
of the entire API implementation against all RFCs in ./specs/.
Focus on API endpoints, data structures, and error handling.
```

### Example 3: Feature Completeness Check

```
Use platonic-code-review to verify that all features 
specified in rfc-005-payment-processing.md are fully 
implemented in src/payments/. Generate a detailed checklist.
```

### Example 4: Gap Analysis

```
Use platonic-code-review to perform a gap analysis between 
./specs/ and ./src/, identifying specifications without 
implementations and implementations without specifications.
```

## Important Notes

### Default: Report Only

⚠️ **This skill generates reports by default and does NOT modify code**

When inconsistencies are found:
1. Document the issue in the report
2. Provide specific code references
3. Explain the discrepancy
4. Recommend actions
5. **ASK USER** if they want code modifications

### When to Modify Code

Only modify code when user explicitly requests:
- "Fix the inconsistencies you found"
- "Update the code to match the specs"
- "Implement the missing features"

Otherwise, default to report generation only.

## Integration with Other Skills

Works well with:
- **platonic-code-specs**: Review code against RFCs managed by this skill
- **Documentation skills**: Generate docs from review findings
- **Testing skills**: Create tests for missing coverage

## Dependencies

- Read access to specification documents (RFCs, requirements, design docs)
- Read access to source code
- Understanding of project structure
- Write access only if user requests code modifications

## Best Practices

1. **Start with specs**: Always read and understand specs first
2. **Be thorough**: Check all specified requirements systematically
3. **Be specific**: Provide exact file names, line numbers, and code references
4. **Be objective**: Report facts, not opinions
5. **Prioritize findings**: Critical issues first, minor ones later
6. **Ask before modifying**: Never change code without user consent
