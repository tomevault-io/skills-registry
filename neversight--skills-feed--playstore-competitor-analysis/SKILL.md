# Play Store Competitor Analysis

Extract comprehensive app data and screenshots from Google Play Store listings for competitive analysis. Supports single app analysis, multi-app comparison, or searching for top competitors by keyword.

## Requirements

Install the google-play-scraper package. On modern macOS/Linux systems, you'll need to use a virtual environment:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment in the skill directory (one-time setup)
python3 -m venv .venv

# Activate and install the package
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install google-play-scraper
```

Then run the script with the virtual environment's python:

```bash
# Use the venv python directly (no activation needed)
.venv/bin/python3 scripts/scrape_play_store.py --search "messenger" ./output

# Or activate first, then run
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 scripts/scrape_play_store.py --search "messenger" ./output
```

## Workflow

1. Determine the analysis type:
   - **Single app**: User provides a Play Store URL or package ID
   - **Comparison**: User provides multiple URLs/package IDs
   - **Search**: User wants to find top competitors for a keyword (e.g., "top 10 messenger apps")
2. Run the appropriate scraper command
3. Review the generated outputs with the user

## Usage

### Single App Analysis

Run the scraper with a Play Store URL or package ID:

```bash
python3 scripts/scrape_play_store.py "<play_store_url_or_package_id>" "<output_directory>"
```

**Examples:**
```bash
# Using URL
python3 scripts/scrape_play_store.py "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.slack" ./competitor-analysis/slack

# Using package ID directly
python3 scripts/scrape_play_store.py com.slack ./competitor-analysis/slack
```

### Multiple App Comparison

Run the scraper with multiple URLs or package IDs:

```bash
python3 scripts/scrape_play_store.py --compare "<id1>" "<id2>" "<id3>" "<output_directory>"
```

**Example:**
```bash
python3 scripts/scrape_play_store.py --compare \
  com.slack \
  com.microsoft.teams \
  com.discord \
  ./competitor-analysis/messaging-apps
```

### Search for Top Competitors

Search for top apps by keyword and automatically analyze them:

```bash
python3 scripts/scrape_play_store.py --search "<query>" "<output_directory>" --limit <N>
```

**Examples:**
```bash
# Find and analyze top messenger apps
python3 scripts/scrape_play_store.py --search "messenger apps" ./competitor-analysis/messenger --limit 10

# Find top 5 podcast apps
python3 scripts/scrape_play_store.py --search "podcast" ./competitor-analysis/podcasts --limit 5

# Default limit is 10 if not specified
python3 scripts/scrape_play_store.py --search "fitness tracker" ./competitor-analysis/fitness
```

## Output

### Single App Output

```
