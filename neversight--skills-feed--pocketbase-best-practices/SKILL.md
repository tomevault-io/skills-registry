description: PocketBase development best practices covering collection design, API rules, authentication, SDK usage, query optimization, realtime subscriptions, file handling, and deployment. Use when building PocketBase backends, designing schemas, implementing access control, setting up auth flows, or optimizing performance. Use when this capability is needed.

# PocketBase Best Practices

42 rules across 8 categories for PocketBase v0.36+, prioritized by impact.

## When to Apply

- Designing collections and schema structures
- Implementing API rules for access control
- Setting up authentication (password, OAuth2, MFA)
- Using the PocketBase JavaScript SDK
- Optimizing queries with filtering, sorting, and expansion
- Implementing realtime subscriptions
- Handling file uploads and storage
- Deploying PocketBase to production

## Quick Reference

### Collection Design (CRITICAL)
- **coll-field-types**: Use appropriate field types (json for objects, select for enums)
- **coll-auth-vs-base**: Extend auth collection for users, base for non-auth data
- **coll-relations**: Use relation fields, not manual ID strings
- **coll-indexes**: Create indexes on frequently filtered/sorted fields
- **coll-view-collections**: Use views for complex aggregations
- **coll-geopoint**: Store coordinates as json field with lat/lng

### API Rules (CRITICAL)
- **rules-basics**: Always set API rules; empty = public access
- **rules-filter-syntax**: Use @request.auth, @collection, @now in rules
- **rules-request-context**: Access request data via @request.body, @request.query
- **rules-cross-collection**: Use @collection.name.field for cross-collection checks
- **rules-locked-vs-open**: Start locked, open selectively

### Authentication (CRITICAL)
- **auth-password**: Use authWithPassword for email/password login
- **auth-oauth2**: Configure OAuth2 providers via Admin UI
- **auth-token-management**: Store tokens securely, refresh before expiry
- **auth-mfa**: Enable MFA for sensitive applications
- **auth-impersonation**: Use impersonation for admin actions on behalf of users

### SDK Usage (HIGH)
- **sdk-initialization**: Initialize client once, reuse instance
- **sdk-auth-store**: Use AsyncAuthStore for React Native/SSR
- **sdk-error-handling**: Catch ClientResponseError, check status codes
- **sdk-auto-cancellation**: Disable auto-cancel for concurrent requests
- **sdk-filter-binding**: Use filter binding to prevent injection

### Query Performance (HIGH)
- **query-expand**: Expand relations to avoid N+1 queries
- **query-field-selection**: Select only needed fields
- **query-pagination**: Use cursor pagination for large datasets
- **query-batch-operations**: Batch creates/updates when possible

### Realtime (MEDIUM)
- **realtime-subscribe**: Subscribe to specific records or collections
- **realtime-events**: Handle create, update, delete events separately
- **realtime-auth**: Realtime respects API rules automatically
- **realtime-reconnection**: Implement reconnection logic

### File Handling (MEDIUM)
- **file-upload**: Use FormData for uploads, set proper content types
- **file-serving**: Use pb.files.getURL() for file URLs
- **file-validation**: Validate file types and sizes server-side

### Deployment (MEDIUM)
- **deploy-backup**: Schedule regular backups of pb_data
- **deploy-configuration**: Use environment variables for config
- **deploy-reverse-proxy**: Put behind nginx/caddy in production
- **deploy-sqlite-considerations**: Optimize SQLite for production workloads
