# Pokemon Data Fetcher

## Overview

This skill provides a Python script to fetch Pokemon data from the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2) and organize it into JSON files. The script retrieves all Pokemon names, sorts them by generation, and saves the results in a structured format.

## Quick Start

Fetch all Pokemon data organized by generation:

```bash
cd pokemon-data-fetcher/scripts
python3 fetch_pokemon.py
```

This will create JSON files in the current directory containing Pokemon data organized by generation.

## Features

### 1. Fetch All Pokemon

The script fetches all Pokemon from the PokeAPI and organizes them by their generation:

- Generation I (Kanto region)
- Generation II (Johto region)
- Generation III (Hoenn region)
- Generation IV (Sinnoh region)
- Generation V (Unova region)
- Generation VI (Kalos region)
- Generation VII (Alola region)
- Generation VIII (Galar region)
- Generation IX (Paldea region)

### 2. Sort by Generation

Pokemon are automatically sorted alphabetically within each generation for easy reference.

### 3. JSON Output

Results are saved in JSON format for easy parsing and integration with other tools:

- `pokemon_by_generation.json` - All Pokemon organized by generation
- Clean, readable JSON formatting

## Installation

1. Ensure Python 3.6+ is installed
2. No external dependencies required - uses Python standard library only

The script uses built-in modules: `urllib`, `json`, `sys`, `time`

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Navigate to the scripts directory and run:

```bash
cd pokemon-data-fetcher/scripts
python3 fetch_pokemon.py
```

### Script Output

The script will:
1. Connect to PokeAPI
2. Fetch all Pokemon species
3. Organize them by generation
4. Sort alphabetically within each generation
5. Save to `pokemon_by_generation.json`

### Output Format

```json
{
  "generation-i": [
    "bulbasaur",
    "charmander",
    "squirtle",
    ...
  ],
  "generation-ii": [
    "chikorita",
    "cyndaquil",
    "totodile",
    ...
  ],
  ...
}
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Fetch Pokemon Data

```bash
cd pokemon-data-fetcher/scripts
python3 fetch_pokemon.py
```

**Output:**
```
Fetching Pokemon data from PokeAPI...
Fetched 1025 Pokemon species
Organizing by generation...
Results saved to pokemon_by_generation.json
```

### Example 2: Use the Data

```python
import json

# Load the generated data
with open('pokemon_by_generation.json', 'r') as f:
    data = json.load(f)

# Get all Generation I Pokemon
gen1_pokemon = data['generation-i']
print(f"Generation I has {len(gen1_pokemon)} Pokemon")
print(f"First Pokemon: {gen1_pokemon[0]}")
```

## Script Details

### fetch_pokemon.py

The main script that handles all Pokemon data fetching:

**Functions:**
- `fetch_all_pokemon()` - Retrieves all Pokemon species from the API
- `organize_by_generation()` - Groups Pokemon by their generation
- `save_to_json()` - Writes results to a JSON file

**API Endpoints Used:**
- `https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon-species/?limit=10000` - Get all Pokemon species
- `https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/generation/{id}` - Get generation details

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Connection Error

**Symptoms:** Script fails with connection error

**Solution:** Check your internet connection and verify PokeAPI is accessible:
```bash
curl https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon-species/1
```

**Prevention:** The script includes retry logic for temporary network issues

### Issue: Missing Dependencies

**Symptoms:** Script runs successfully without additional installation

**Note:** This script uses only Python standard library modules (`urllib.request`, `json`, `sys`, `time`), so no external dependencies need to be installed.

### Issue: Permission Denied

**Symptoms:** Cannot write output file

**Solution:** Ensure you have write permissions in the current directory:
```bash
chmod +w .
```

## Best Practices

- Run the script periodically to get updated Pokemon data
- Store the JSON output in version control to track changes
- Use the data as a reference for Pokemon-related applications
- Consider caching the results to avoid repeated API calls

## API Information

This skill uses the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2), a free and open Pokemon API that provides comprehensive Pokemon data.

**API Features:**
- No authentication required
- Rate limiting: Fair use policy (no strict limits for reasonable use)
- Data includes: Pokemon species, abilities, types, moves, and more
- Well-documented and actively maintained

**API Limits:**
- Please be respectful of the free service
- Implement caching when making frequent requests
- The script is designed to minimize API calls
