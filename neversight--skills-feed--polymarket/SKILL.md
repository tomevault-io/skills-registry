# Polymarket — Sports Prediction Markets

## Setup

Before first use, check if the CLI is available:
```bash
which sports-skills || pip install sports-skills
```
If `pip install` fails with a Python version error, the package requires Python 3.10+. Find a compatible Python:
```bash
python3 --version  # check version
# If < 3.10, try: python3.12 -m pip install sports-skills
# On macOS with Homebrew: /opt/homebrew/bin/python3.12 -m pip install sports-skills
```
No API keys required.

## Quick Start

Prefer the CLI — it avoids Python import path issues:
```bash
sports-skills polymarket get_sports_markets --limit=20
sports-skills polymarket search_markets --query="NBA Finals"
```

Python SDK (alternative):
```python
from sports_skills import polymarket

markets = polymarket.get_sports_markets(limit=20)
prices = polymarket.get_market_prices(token_id="abc123")
```

## Commands

### get_sports_markets
Get active sports prediction markets.
- `limit` (int, optional): Max results (default: 50, max: 100)
- `offset` (int, optional): Pagination offset
- `sports_market_types` (str, optional): Filter by type ("moneyline", "spreads", "totals")

- `order` (str, optional): Sort field (default: "volume")
- `ascending` (bool, optional): Sort ascending (default: false)

### get_sports_events
Get sports events (each groups related markets).
- `limit`, `offset`, `active`, `closed`, `order`, `ascending` (same as above)
- `series_id` (str, optional): Filter by series (league) ID

### get_series
Get all series (leagues, recurring event groups).
- `limit` (int, optional): Max results (default: 100)
- `offset` (int, optional): Pagination offset

### get_market_details
Get detailed info for a specific market.
- `market_id` (str): Market ID
- `slug` (str): Market slug (alternative to ID)

### get_event_details
Get detailed info for a specific event.

### get_market_prices
Get current prices from the CLOB API.
- `token_id` (str): Single CLOB token ID
- `token_ids` (list): Multiple CLOB token IDs (batch)

### get_order_book
Get full order book for a market.
- `token_id` (str, required): CLOB token ID

### get_sports_market_types
Get all valid sports market types. No params.

### search_markets
Find markets by keyword and filters. **Search matches event titles, not sport categories.** Use specific league/competition names, not generic terms like "soccer" or "football".
- `query` (str, optional): Keyword to search — use league names (e.g., "Premier League", "Champions League", "La Liga", "NBA Finals")
- `sports_market_types` (str, optional): Filter by type
- `tag_id` (int, optional): Tag ID (default: 1 = Sports)
- `limit` (int, optional): Max results (default: 20)

### get_price_history
Get historical price data.
- `token_id` (str, required): CLOB token ID
- `interval` (str, optional): Time range ("1d", "1w", "1m", "max"). Default: "max"
- `fidelity` (int, optional): Seconds between data points. Default: 120

### get_last_trade_price
Get the most recent trade price.
- `token_id` (str, required): CLOB token ID

## Examples

User: "Who's favored to win the NBA Finals?"
1. Call `search_markets(query="NBA Finals", sports_market_types="moneyline")`
2. Get `token_id` from the market details
3. Call `get_market_prices(token_id="...")` for current odds
4. Present teams with implied probabilities (price = probability)

User: "Who will win the Premier League?"
1. Call `search_markets(query="English Premier League")` — use full league name
2. Sort results by Yes outcome price descending
3. Present teams with implied probabilities (price = probability)

User: "Show me Champions League odds"
1. Call `search_markets(query="Champions League")`
2. Present top contenders with prices, volume, and liquidity

User: "What's the order book depth on this market?"
1. Call `get_order_book(token_id="...")` for full book
2. Present bids, asks, spread, and implied probabilities

## Error Handling

When a command fails (invalid token_id, no active markets, network error, etc.), **do not surface the raw error to the user**. Instead:

1. **Catch it silently** — treat the failure as an exploratory miss, not a fatal error.
2. **Try alternatives** — if a `token_id` is invalid, use `search_markets(query="...")` to find the correct market, then `get_market_details` to get the CLOB token_id. If a search returns empty, try broader or alternative keywords (e.g., "English Premier League" instead of "EPL").
3. **Only report failure after exhausting alternatives** — and when you do, give a clean human-readable message (e.g., "I couldn't find any active markets for that on Polymarket"), not a traceback or raw CLI output.

This is especially important when the agent is responding through messaging platforms (Telegram, Slack, etc.) where raw exec failures look broken.

## Common Mistakes

**These are the ONLY valid commands.** Do not invent or guess command names:
- `get_sports_markets`
- `get_sports_events`
- `get_series`
- `get_market_details`
- `get_event_details`
- `get_market_prices`
- `get_order_book`
- `get_sports_market_types`
- `search_markets`
- `get_price_history`
- `get_last_trade_price`

**Commands that DO NOT exist** (commonly hallucinated):
- ~~`get_market_odds`~~ / ~~`get_odds`~~ — market prices ARE the implied probability. Use `get_market_prices(token_id="...")` where price = probability.
- ~~`get_implied_probability`~~ — the price IS the implied probability. No conversion needed.
- ~~`get_current_odds`~~ — use `get_last_trade_price(token_id="...")` for the most recent price.
- ~~`get_markets`~~ — the correct command is `get_sports_markets` (for browsing) or `search_markets` (for searching by keyword).

**Other common mistakes:**
- Using `market_id` where `token_id` is needed — price and orderbook endpoints require the CLOB `token_id`, not the Gamma `market_id`. Always call `get_market_details` first to get `clobTokenIds`.
- Searching generic terms like "soccer" or "football" — `search_markets` matches event titles. Use specific league names: "Premier League", "Champions League", "La Liga", etc.
- Forgetting to get the `token_id` before calling price/orderbook endpoints — always fetch market details first.

If you're unsure whether a command exists, check this list. Do not try commands that aren't listed above.

## Troubleshooting

- **`sports-skills` command not found**: Package not installed. Run `pip install sports-skills`. If pip fails with a Python version error, you need Python 3.10+ — see Setup section.
- **`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'sports_skills'`**: Same as above — install the package. Prefer the CLI over Python imports to avoid path issues.
- **token_id vs market_id**: Price/orderbook endpoints need the CLOB `token_id` (found in market details under `clobTokenIds`), not the Gamma `market_id`. Always fetch market details first to get the token_id.
- **Search returns 0 results**: `search_markets` matches event titles, not sport categories. Don't search "soccer" or "football" — search by league name: "Premier League", "Champions League", "La Liga", "Bundesliga", "Serie A", "NBA Finals", etc.
- **Market not found by ID**: Use `search_markets(query="...")` with keywords instead of guessing IDs. Or use `get_market_details(slug="...")` with the URL slug.
- **Stale or wide prices**: Low-liquidity markets may have wide bid-ask spreads. The `mid` price from `get_market_prices` is the midpoint — check `spread` to assess reliability.
- **Pagination**: Use `offset` parameter for paging. Default `limit` varies by endpoint (20-100). Increment offset by limit for each page.
