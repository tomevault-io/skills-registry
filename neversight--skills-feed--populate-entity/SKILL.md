# Populate Entity

Populate this entity: $ARGUMENTS

## Overview

This skill analyzes an existing entity file to:
1. Identify plain text that should become wikilinks (names of people, places, organizations)
2. Find existing wikilinks that point to non-existent entities
3. Create all missing entities using appropriate templates
4. Update the source entity with proper wikilinks
5. Ensure bidirectional connections

## Instructions

### Step 1: Parse Arguments

**Required:**
- Entity path or name

**Optional Flags:**
| Flag | Purpose | Default |
|------|---------|---------|
| `--dry-run` | Show what would be created without making changes | false |
| `--auto` | Skip confirmations, use best-guess entity types | false |
| `--limit N` | Maximum number of entities to create | 20 |
| `--broken-only` | Only fix broken wikilinks, skip plain text detection | false |
| `--links-only` | Only add wikilinks to existing entities, don't create new | false |
| `--world [name]` | **BULK MODE:** Process all entities in the specified world | - |
| `--category [type]` | With `--world`: only process entities in this category | all |

### Step 2: Locate Entity & Determine World

1. **If path provided** (contains `/` or `.md`):
   - Read the file directly
   - Extract world name from path: `Worlds/[World Name]/...`

2. **If name provided**:
   - Search `Worlds/` directories for matching entity
   - Try exact filename match first
   - Then fuzzy match on filename and YAML `name:` field
   - If multiple matches, list them and ask user to clarify

3. **If not found**:
   - List similar entities and ask for clarification

**The world name is required** for knowing where to save new entities.

### Step 3: Build Entity Index

Before analysis, create a complete index of existing entities in the world:

1. **Scan all files** in `Worlds/[World Name]/` recursively
2. **For each entity file**, extract:
   - Filename (without .md extension)
   - YAML `name:` field
   - YAML `aliases:` array
   - File path
3. **Build lookup dictionary** (case-insensitive):
   ```
   {
     "entity name": "path/to/entity.md",
     "alias1": "path/to/entity.md",
     ...
   }
   ```

This index is used to:
- Avoid creating duplicate entities
- Detect existing entities mentioned as plain text
- Verify wikilinks point to real files

### Step 4: Analyze Source Entity

Read the source entity file and perform three analyses:

#### 4A: Extract Existing Wikilinks

Use regex pattern: `\[\[([^\]|]+)(?:\|[^\]]+)?\]\]`

For each wikilink found:
1. Extract the entity name (handling `[[Name|Display]]` format)
2. Check if it exists in the entity index
3. If not found, mark as **broken link**
4. Track line numbers for reporting

#### 4B: Identify Potential Entity References

Scan the entity content (excluding YAML frontmatter, code blocks, and Image Prompts section) for proper noun patterns:

**High-Confidence Patterns:**

| Pattern | Entity Type | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Lord/Lady [Name] | Character | "Lord Varic", "Lady Serana" |
| King/Queen [Name] | Character | "King Aldric", "Queen Elara" |
| Prince/Princess [Name] | Character | "Prince Edric" |
| Sir/Dame [Name] | Character | "Sir Galahad" |
| Captain/Commander [Name] | Character | "Captain Alonzo" |
| High Priest/Confessor [Name] | Character | "High Confessor Maren" |
| Elder/Master [Name] | Character | "Elder Thorne" |
| House [Name] | Organization | "House Valdren" |
| Clan [Name] | Organization | "Clan Ironforge" |
| Guild/Order [Name] | Organization | "Guild of Merchants" |
| The [Name] + (River/Sea/Forest/Mountain) | Geography | "The Trader's Sea" |
| [Name] River/Stream | Geography (River) | "Valdris River" |
| [Name] Mountain(s)/Range/Peak(s) | Geography (Mountain) | "Sundered Peaks" |
| [Name] Forest/Wood(s)/Grove | Geography (Forest) | "Whisperwood Forest" |
| [Name] Sea/Ocean | Geography (Ocean) | "The Eastern Sea" |
| [Name] Lake/Pond | Geography (Lake) | "Lake Shimmer" |
| [Name] Fields/Plains | Geography (Plains) | "The Ashen Fields" |
| [Name] Pass/Gap | Geography (Pass) | "Ironhold Pass" |
| [Name] Palace/Ruins/Dungeon | Geography (Dungeon) | "The Sunken Palace" |
| [Name] City/Metropolis | Settlement (City) | "Porto Valdris" |
| [Name] Town | Settlement (Town) | "Oakhaven Town" |
| [Name] Port/Harbor | Settlement | "Porto Valdris" |
| [Name] Fortress/Castle/Keep | Settlement (Stronghold) | "Thornwall Keep" |
| [Name] Village/Hamlet | Settlement (Village) | "Millbrook Village" |

**Medium-Confidence Patterns:**

| Pattern | Entity Type | Context Needed |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| The [Capitalized Name] (standalone) | Geography/Organization | Check surrounding text |
| [Two-Three Capitalized Words] in People section | Character | "Marco Fortunato" |
| [Capitalized Name] near "guild/order/temple" | Organization | Check context |
| [Capitalized Name] near "river/mountain/forest" | Geography | Check context |

**Detection Algorithm:**

```
1. Split content into lines
2. Skip YAML frontmatter (between --- markers)
3. Skip Image Prompts section and below
4. Skip content inside code blocks (``` markers)
5. Skip existing wikilinks

6. For each line:
   a. Find capitalized multi-word phrases (2-4 words)
   b. Check against high-confidence patterns first
   c. If no pattern match, check context clues
   d. Skip common phrases that aren't entities:
      - "The [Direction]" (The North, The East)
      - Generic descriptors (The Great, The Ancient)
      - Section headers

7. For each detected phrase:
   a. Check if already in entity index -> mark as "needs wikilink"
   b. Check if not in index -> mark as "potential new entity"
   c. Record line numbers for all occurrences
   d. Extract surrounding context (10 words before/after)
```

#### 4C: Classify Detected References

Sort all detected references into categories:

| Category | Description | Action |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| **Existing (Unlinked)** | Name matches an existing entity but isn't a wikilink | Convert to `[[wikilink]]` |
| **Broken Link** | `[[wikilink]]` exists but no entity file found | Create entity |
| **Inferred New** | Proper noun with confident type guess | Create entity (confirm type) |
| **Ambiguous New** | Proper noun but type unclear | Ask user for type |

### Step 5: Present Analysis Report

Display findings before taking action:

```

## SUMMARY

| Category | Count |
|----------|-------|
| Existing to link | X |
| Broken links to create | X |
| New entities detected | X |
| Ambiguous (need input) | X |
| **Total potential creations** | **X** |

---

**Options:**
1. Create all suggested entities (uses best-guess types)
2. Review each entity individually
3. Only fix broken wikilinks
4. Only add links to existing entities
5. Show dry-run (no changes)
```

If `--auto` flag is set, skip this step and proceed with best-guess types.
If `--dry-run` flag is set, show report and stop.

### Step 6: Determine Entity Types

For each entity to create, use pattern matching to determine the template:

**Template Mapping (from create-entity):**

**Characters:**
| Pattern | Template |
|---------|----------|
| Lord/Lady/King/Queen/Prince/Princess + name | Support Character.md (or Antagonist.md if negative context) |
| Sir/Dame/Captain/Commander + name | Support Character.md |
| High Priest/Confessor/Elder + name | Support Character.md |
| Personal name in "Members" or "Allies" context | Support Character.md |
| Personal name with villain/enemy context | Antagonist.md |

**Settlements:**
| Pattern | Template |
|---------|----------|
| [Name] + City/Metropolis | City.md |
| [Name] + Port/Harbor (large) | City.md |
| [Name] + Town | Town.md |
| [Name] + Port/Harbor (small) | Town.md |
| [Name] + Village/Hamlet | Village.md |
| [Name] + Fortress/Castle/Keep/Stronghold | Stronghold.md |
| Context mentions "capital", "great city" | City.md |

**Organizations:**
| Pattern | Template |

**Geography:**
| Pattern | Template |
|---------|----------|
| [Name] + River/Stream | River.md |
| [Name] + Mountain(s)/Range/Peak(s) | Mountain Range.md |
| [Name] + Forest/Wood(s)/Grove/Jungle | Forest.md |
| [Name] + Sea/Ocean | Ocean.md |
| [Name] + Lake/Pond | Lake.md |
| [Name] + Fields/Plains/Grassland | Plains.md |
| [Name] + Pass/Gap | Pass.md |
| [Name] + Desert/Wasteland | Desert.md |
| [Name] + Coast/Shore | Coast.md |
| [Name] + Island/Isle | Island.md |
| [Name] + Palace/Ruins/Dungeon/Tomb | Dungeon.md |
| [Name] + Cave/Cavern | Cave.md |
| The [Name] (generic geography) | Region.md |

**History:**
| Pattern | Template |
|---------|----------|
| The [Name] + War/Conflict | War.md |
| The [Name] + Battle/Siege | Battle.md |
| The [Name] (event context: "years ago", "when") | Event.md |
| [Name] + Age/Era/Epoch | Age.md |
| [Name] + Treaty/Accord | Treaty.md |

**Category Folder Mappings:**
| Template Category | Save to Folder |
|-------------------|----------------|
| Characters | Characters/ |
| Settlements | Settlements/ |
| Organizations | Organizations/ |
| Geography | Geography/ |
| History | History/ |
| Concepts | Concepts/ |
| Items | Items/ |
| Creatures | Creatures/ |

### Step 7: Confirm Creation Plan

Before creating entities, present the plan:

```
=== CREATION PLAN ===

Will create X new entities:

CHARACTERS (X):
| Entity | Template | Context from Source |
|--------|----------|---------------------|
| Marco Fortunato | Support Character.md | "wealthiest merchant" |
| Adriano Valdren | Support Character.md | "Varic's brother" |

SETTLEMENTS (X):
| Entity | Template | Context from Source |
|--------|----------|---------------------|
| Marevento | Town.md | "secondary port", "shipbuilding" |
| Serenzia | Town.md | "agricultural center" |

ORGANIZATIONS (X):
| Entity | Template | Context from Source |
|--------|----------|---------------------|
| The Merchant Guilds | Guild.md | "allied with House Valdren" |

GEOGRAPHY (X):
| Entity | Template | Context from Source |
|--------|----------|---------------------|
| The Sunken Palace | Dungeon.md | "underwater ruins", "pre-Faith" |

---

Proceed with creation? (yes/no/modify)
```

If `--auto` flag is set, skip confirmation and proceed.

### Step 8: Create Entities

For each confirmed entity:

#### 8A: Read Template

Read the appropriate template from `Templates/[Category]/[Template].md`

#### 8B: Generate Content

Generate content based on:
1. **Context from source entity** - What does the source say about this entity?
2. **World Overview** - Read for tone, themes, naming conventions
3. **Template requirements** - Fill required sections

**Content Generation Guidelines:**

Since these are auto-generated entities, create **minimal but coherent** content:

1. **YAML Frontmatter:**
   - Set `name:` to the entity name
   - Set `status: draft` (marked for user review)
   - Fill category-specific fields with reasonable defaults
   - Leave `image:` empty

2. **Overview Section:**
   - 2-3 sentences based on context from source entity
   - Reference the source entity using `[[wikilink]]`

3. **Core Identity Sections:**
   - Fill minimally based on available context
   - Mark sections needing expansion with `<!-- TODO: Expand -->`

4. **Connections Section:**
   - Add `[[Source Entity]]` as primary connection
   - Use appropriate relationship category based on entity types

5. **Image Prompts:**
   - Leave as template placeholders or fill with basic descriptions

**Naming Conventions:**

Consult naming reference files when generating names:
- `Templates/Reference/D&D Species Naming Conventions.md`
- `Templates/Reference/Tolkien Naming Conventions.md`

Match naming style to the world's established conventions.

#### 8C: Save Entity

Save to: `Worlds/[World Name]/[Category]/[Entity Name].md`

Use Title Case with spaces for filenames.

#### 8D: Add Reciprocal Link

After saving the new entity, add a connection back to the source entity:

**Reciprocal Link Patterns:**

| New Entity Type | Source Entity Type | New Entity Links To Source As |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| Character | Settlement | Home/Location |
| Character | Organization | Member Of |
| Character | Character | Associate/Ally |
| Settlement | Region | Part Of |
| Settlement | Organization | Headquarters |
| Organization | Settlement | Based Here |
| Organization | Character | Leadership/Members |
| Geography | Geography | Part Of/Contains |

### Step 9: Update Source Entity

After creating all new entities:

#### 9A: Convert Plain Text to Wikilinks

For each detected reference that now has an entity:
1. Find occurrences in source entity
2. Replace `Entity Name` with `[[Entity Name]]`
3. Handle partial name matches (e.g., "Lady Serana" → `[[Lady Serana Valdren|Lady Serana]]`)

Use Edit tool for precise replacements.

#### 9B: Ensure Connections Section is Updated

For each new entity created:
1. Determine appropriate connection category based on entity type
2. Check if source entity's Connections section has this category
3. Add wikilink to appropriate subsection

**Connection Section Formats:**

```markdown
## Connections

### People
- **Family:** [[Family Member]]
- **Allies:** [[Ally 1]], [[Ally 2]]
- **Associates:** [[Associate 1]]

### Organizations
- **Member Of:** [[Organization]]
- **Allied With:** [[Allied Org]]

### Locations
- **Headquarters:** [[Settlement]]
- **Territory:** [[Region]]

### Geography
- **Contains:** [[Location 1]], [[Location 2]]
- **Borders:** [[Neighboring Region]]
```

#### 9C: Validate All Links

After updates, verify:
1. All new wikilinks resolve to existing entity files
2. No duplicate links in Connections section
3. Source entity frontmatter is intact

### Step 10: Summary Report

```
=== POPULATE COMPLETE: [Source Entity Name] ===

Created X new entities:

CHARACTERS:
- [[Marco Fortunato]] - Wealthy merchant, Valdren ally (draft)
- [[Adriano Valdren]] - Varic's brother, trade manager (draft)

SETTLEMENTS:
- [[Marevento]] - Secondary port, shipbuilding center (draft)
- [[Serenzia]] - Agricultural town (draft)

ORGANIZATIONS:
- [[The Merchant Guilds]] - Allied trading organizations (draft)

GEOGRAPHY:
- [[The Sunken Palace]] - Underwater ruins with ancient secrets (draft)

---

Source Entity Updated:
- Added X wikilinks (previously plain text)
- Added X items to Connections section

Reciprocal Links Added:
- Marco Fortunato → [[Source Entity]] (employer)
- Marevento → [[The Western Shore]] (region)
- etc.

---

All new entities marked as 'draft' for review.

Suggested Next Steps:
1. Review and expand created entities with /expand-entity
2. Run /audit-world [World Name] to verify all connections
3. Generate images with /generate-image [Entity]
```

## Bulk Processing Mode

When `--world` flag is provided, the skill processes multiple entities:

### Bulk Mode Workflow

1. **Scan world directory:**
   - List all `.md` files in `Worlds/[World Name]/`
   - If `--category` specified, only scan that folder
   - Build a master entity index for the entire world

2. **Analyze all entities:**
   - Run detection on each entity file
   - Compile a master list of potential new entities
   - De-duplicate across files (same reference in multiple files = one entity)

3. **Present consolidated plan:**
   ```
   === BULK POPULATE: [World Name] ===

   Files Analyzed: X
   Files with Detections: Y

   ENTITIES TO CREATE (de-duplicated):

   | Entity | Type | Referenced In | Times |
   |--------|------|---------------|-------|
   | Marco Fortunato | Character | 3 files | 7 mentions |
   | The Iron Guild | Organization | 2 files | 4 mentions |
   ...

   Total: N new entities across M source files

   Options:
   1. Create all (uses best-guess types)
   2. Review by category
   3. Review each individually
   4. Dry run complete
   ```

4. **Process with de-duplication:**
   - Create each entity once
   - Update ALL source files that reference it
   - Add reciprocal links from new entity to all referencing entities

5. **Bulk summary report:**
   ```
   === BULK POPULATE COMPLETE ===

   Entities Created: N
   Source Files Updated: M
   Total Wikilinks Added: X
   Reciprocal Links Created: Y

   By Category:
   - Characters: N created
   - Settlements: N created
   ...
   ```

### Bulk Mode Options

```bash
# Process entire world (with confirmations)
/populate-entity --world Eldermyr

# Fully automated (no confirmations)
/populate-entity --world Eldermyr --auto

# Only fix broken links across world
/populate-entity --world Eldermyr --broken-only

# Limit total entities created in bulk
/populate-entity --world Eldermyr --limit 50

# Preview bulk changes
/populate-entity --world Eldermyr --dry-run
```

### Performance Notes

- Bulk mode builds entity index once (more efficient)
- De-duplication prevents creating duplicate entities
- For very large operations, use `--limit` to process in batches
- Consider running `/audit-world --check links` afterward to verify

## Examples

```bash
# Populate a specific entity by name
/populate-entity "House Valdren"

# Populate by file path
/populate-entity Worlds/Eldermyr/Organizations/House Valdren.md

# Preview what would be created (no changes)
/populate-entity "Porto Valdris" --dry-run

# Auto-populate without prompts (for batch processing)
/populate-entity "Lord Varic Valdren" --auto

# Only fix broken wikilinks, skip text detection
/populate-entity "World Overview" --broken-only

# Only add wikilinks to existing entities, don't create new
/populate-entity "The Great War" --links-only

# Limit number of entities to create
/populate-entity "The Great War" --limit 5

# Combine flags
/populate-entity "House Valdren" --auto --limit 10
```

## Integration with Other Skills

### After `/create-entity`
Run `/populate-entity` on newly created entities to automatically flesh out referenced names.

### Before `/audit-world`
Run `/populate-entity` on key entities to reduce broken link count before audit.

### With `/expand-entity`
- `/expand-entity` adds depth to a single entity
- `/populate-entity` creates the network of related entities
- Use together: populate first, then expand key entities

### With `/link-entities`
- `/populate-entity` creates entities from detected references
- `/link-entities` can refine the relationships afterward

## Quality Guidelines

1. **Conservative Creation:** Only create entities with high-confidence type detection
2. **Minimal Content:** New entities get basic content marked as `draft`
3. **Preserve Context:** Use context from source to inform new entity content
4. **Bidirectional:** Always add reciprocal links
5. **No Duplicates:** Check entity index before creating
6. **User Control:** Confirmation prompts unless `--auto` flag
