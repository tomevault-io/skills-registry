# GTM Strategy

Position in workflow: v0.8 Monitoring Setup → **v0.9 GTM Strategy** → v0.9 Launch Metrics

## Purpose

Define how the product reaches its target users—the channels, messaging, timing, and coordination required for a successful launch.

## Core Concept: Launch as Campaign

> A launch is not "making the product available." It is a **coordinated campaign** that creates awareness, drives activation, and captures feedback. Every touchpoint should move users toward value.

## GTM Components

| Component | Purpose | Output |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| **Messaging** | What we say | GTM- (value props, headlines) |
| **Channels** | Where we say it | GTM- (channel strategy) |
| **Timing** | When we launch | GTM- (timeline, phases) |
| **Coordination** | Who does what | GTM- (RACI, tasks) |

## Execution

1. **Review target personas**
   - Pull PER- from v0.4
   - Understand where they spend time
   - Know what messages resonate

2. **Define core messaging**
   - Value proposition (from CFD- value hypotheses)
   - Positioning (from BR- product type)
   - Key differentiators (from v0.2 competitive landscape)

3. **Select launch channels**
   - Match channels to personas
   - Prioritize by reach and conversion potential
   - Consider owned, earned, and paid media

4. **Plan launch timeline**
   - Pre-launch: Build anticipation
   - Launch day: Maximum impact
   - Post-launch: Sustain momentum

5. **Assign ownership**
   - Who creates content?
   - Who monitors channels?
   - Who handles support surge?

6. **Create GTM- entries** with full traceability

## Channel Selection Framework

Match channels to product type (from v0.2 BR-):

| Product Type | Primary Channels | Strategy |
|--------------|------------------|----------|
| **Fast Follow** | SEO, Paid, Aggregators | "We're the better [competitor]" |
| **Slice** | Community, Integrations, Partnerships | "Best [thing] for [ecosystem]" |
| **Innovation** | Content, PR, Events | "Here's why this matters" |

## Channel Categories

| Category | Examples | Best For |
|----------|----------|----------|
| **Owned** | Website, Blog, Email, Product | Control message, build audience |
| **Earned** | PR, Reviews, Word-of-mouth | Credibility, reach |
| **Paid** | Ads, Sponsorships, Influencers | Scale, targeting |
| **Community** | Forums, Discord, Twitter | Engagement, feedback |

## Messaging Hierarchy

| Level | Purpose | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **Mission** | Why we exist | "Make developers 10x more productive" |
| **Value Prop** | What we offer | "AI that understands your codebase" |
| **Differentiator** | Why us vs others | "Context-aware, not just autocomplete" |
| **Proof Point** | Why believe us | "40% reduction in debugging time" |
| **CTA** | What to do next | "Start your free trial" |

## Launch Phases

| Phase | Duration | Focus | Success Metric |
|-------|----------|-------|----------------|
| **Teaser** | 2 weeks pre | Build anticipation | Waitlist signups |
| **Launch** | Day 0-3 | Maximum impact | Traffic, signups |
| **Momentum** | Week 1-4 | Sustain interest | Activation, feedback |
| **Steady State** | Month 2+ | Optimize funnel | Conversion, retention |

## Anti-Patterns

| Pattern | Signal | Fix |
|---------|--------|-----|
| **Launch and leave** | Big launch day, then silence | Plan 30 days of post-launch activity |
| **Everything everywhere** | All channels, no focus | Pick 2-3 channels, do them well |
| **Features not benefits** | "We have X, Y, Z" | "You can achieve X, Y, Z" |
| **No measurement** | "The launch went well (I think)" | Define KPI- before launch |
| **Ignoring personas** | Generic messaging for everyone | Tailor by PER- |
| **Over-promising** | "Revolutionary AI" without proof | Ground in CFD- evidence |

## Quality Gates

Before proceeding to Launch Metrics:

- [ ] Core messaging defined (GTM- Messaging type)
- [ ] Primary channels selected (GTM- Channel type)
- [ ] Launch timeline created (GTM- Timeline type)
- [ ] All tasks assigned owners (GTM- Task type)
- [ ] Key assets identified (GTM- Asset type)
- [ ] Messaging traces to CFD- evidence
- [ ] Channel selection matches PER- personas

## Downstream Connections

| Consumer | What It Uses | Example |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| **Launch Metrics** | GTM- channels inform tracking | GTM-002 (PH) → KPI-005 (PH upvotes) |
| **Feedback Loop Setup** | GTM- channels become feedback sources | GTM-002 comments → CFD-100 |
| **Content Creation** | GTM- messaging guides content | GTM-001 → blog post theme |
| **Sales** | GTM- messaging for outreach | GTM-001 → sales email template |
