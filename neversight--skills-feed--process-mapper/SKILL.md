# Process Mapper Skill

Systematic workflow for discovering, documenting, and analyzing processes. Implements user's SOP-first doctrine: **"You can't automate what you can't see."**

## Core Philosophy

**From user's work:**
> "When I sit with a person or team to start working through how they can work out where and how to apply AI into their job, I often like to start with a common task or value stream, and talk through—or more often than not, document—the SOP for that value stream."

**Three truths:**
1. **Shadow processes are real processes** (what actually happens ≠ org chart)
2. **Tacit knowledge is documentable** (capture decision *points*, not decision *logic*)
3. **Structure enables automation** (visibility → AI opportunities)

---

## Core Workflow

### 1. Diagnostic: Assess Current State

**Determine SOP state:**

Load `references/discovery-methodology.md` for framework

**State 1: Fiction**
- SOPs exist but nobody follows them
- Beautiful docs, zero usage
- Aspirational not actual

**State 2: Nonexistent**
- No documentation
- Tribal knowledge
- "Just ask Sarah"

**State 3: Accurate**
- Docs match reality
- Referenced regularly
- Updated when process changes

**Action by state:**
- Fiction → Archive and start fresh
- Nonexistent → Begin discovery (most common)
- Accurate → Use for automation analysis

---

### 2. Process Discovery Interview

**If starting from State 2 (Nonexistent), conduct discovery:**

**Setup:**
- Identify process owner (person who actually does this)
- Secure 45-90 minutes uninterrupted
- Frame: "Show me what actually happens, not what should happen"
- Get screen access to tools they use

**Five-round interview sequence:**

Load `references/discovery-methodology.md` for detailed questions. Brief framework:

**Round 1: High-Level Flow** - Get end-to-end sequence (5-10 major steps, trigger, endpoint, duration)

**Round 2: Step Decomposition** - Break into substeps (inputs, tools, transformations). Look for copy-paste, manual entry, system switching.

**Round 3: Decision Points** - Identify where judgment is required. Distinguish explicit rules from tacit judgment (labeled black box pattern).

**Round 4: Edge Cases & Exceptions** - Understand failure modes, workarounds, frequency. High exceptions = process might be wrong.

**Round 5: Context Dependencies** - Identify tacit knowledge (domain knowledge, institutional knowledge, relationships). Reveals automation tractability.

---

### 3. Process Documentation

**Choose format based on process characteristics:**

**Format 1: Linear SOP** (≤10 steps, minimal branching)
- Sequential steps with actions/tools/inputs
- Quality checks
- Common issues

**Format 2: Decision Tree** (multiple paths, branching logic)
- Entry conditions
- Path A/B/C with criteria
- Decision matrix

**Format 3: Swimlane** (multi-role, handoffs important)
- Who does what when
- Handoff points
- Role responsibilities

**Format 4: Visual Diagram** (complex flows)
- Mermaid flowchart
- System integrations
- Exception paths

Load `assets/visual-templates.md` for specific templates

**Documentation principles:**
- Capture **actual** current state (not aspirational)
- Mark tacit knowledge points with ⚡
- Note context dependencies with 🧠
- Flag frequent failures with ⚠️
- Include frequency/volume data
- Validate with process owner

---

### 4. Complexity Classification

**Map each process step to Tractability Grid (9 zones):**

Load `references/automation-framework.md` for full framework and detailed assessment criteria.

**Two dimensions:**
1. **Context Dependence:** Low (algorithmic, no expertise) → High (tacit judgment, relationships)
2. **Task Complexity:** Simple (≤5 steps, single system) → Complex (15+ steps, multiple systems)

**Assessment questions:** Could intern do this with instructions? How many steps/systems/decisions?

---

### 5. Automation Opportunity Analysis

**Plot each step on 9-zone grid** (see `references/automation-framework.md` for visual):
- **Zones 1-2 (Green):** High automation (85-75% success) - RPA, quick wins
- **Zones 3-5 (Yellow):** Medium (60-40%) - AI copilots, human-in-loop
- **Zones 6-9 (Red):** Low (<25%) - Avoid core automation, support tasks only

### 6. Prioritization & ROI

**Priority quadrants** (Pain × Feasibility):
- **P1 - Quick Wins:** High pain, easy (Zones 1-2) - Do immediately
- **P2 - Strategic:** High pain, hard (Zones 3-5) - Worth investment
- **P3 - Efficiency:** Low pain, easy - Do when capacity available
- **P4 - Avoid:** Low pain, hard (Zones 6-9) - Not worth effort

**ROI:** Payback Period = Cost / (Hours Saved × Rate + Error Reduction)

### 7. Output Delivery

**Standard deliverables:** Process Map (visual), SOP Document (written), Automation Analysis (zone classifications, priorities, ROI), Implementation Roadmap (phased plan)

**Optional:** Interview transcript, validation notes, comparative analysis, metrics dashboard

---

## The Labeled Black Box Pattern

**Critical technique:** Document THAT a decision exists, not HOW it's made (when tacit).

Load `references/documentation-patterns.md` for detailed examples and template.

**Core principle:** Name decision points even when logic is tacit. Enables process visibility, appropriate handoffs, training focus, and future automation planning.

---

## Movement Strategy

**Key insight:** Can't automate high-context zones directly. Build infrastructure to move problems to lower zones.

Load `references/documentation-patterns.md` for case study (Air India: Zone 8 → Zone 2, 97% accuracy).

**Infrastructure path:** Zone 8→5 (frameworks), Zone 5→2 (explicit logic), Zone 2→1 (eliminate manual steps)

---

## Quality Signals

**Good process map has:**
- [ ] Actual current state (not aspirational)
- [ ] All decision points identified
- [ ] Tacit knowledge points marked (⚡)
- [ ] Context dependencies noted (🧠)
- [ ] Exception paths included
- [ ] Validated by process owner
- [ ] Frequency/volume data
- [ ] Pain points documented
- [ ] Clear start and end
- [ ] Realistic time estimates

**Red flags:**
- Too neat (probably fictional)
- No exceptions (incomplete)
- No pain points (not real discovery)
- No tacit knowledge points (missed shadow process)
- Can't estimate frequency (no data)
- Process owner says "that's not quite right"

---

## Integration Points

**With `concept-forge`:**
- Test automation hypotheses dialectically
- Challenge zone classifications
- Refine through multiple perspectives

**With `strategy-to-artifact`:**
- Process map → Presentation deck
- Automation roadmap → Executive one-pager
- Business case → Slide deck

**With `research-to-essay`:**
- Process patterns → Substack post on SOP doctrine
- Case studies → Long-form analysis

**With user's voice (from `research-to-essay`):**
- Use dialogue structure in documentation
- Employ concrete examples (Air India vs Air Canada)
- Include practitioner stance ("In my experience...")
- Show recursive refinement ("Let me be more precise...")

---

## Common Process Types

**Approval Workflows:** Zones 1-2 (rule-based) or 4-5 (judgment). High automation potential for rules.

**Data Processing:** Zones 1-3. Very high automation if algorithmic.

**Customer Service:** Zones 4-8. Medium automation (copilot model).

**Reporting:** Zones 1-3 (structured) or 5-7 (insights). High for gathering, medium for analysis.

**Coordination:** Zones 4-9 (relationship-dependent). Low for core, high for supporting tasks.

---

## Anti-Patterns

**Don't:**
- Map aspirational process (document what actually happens)
- Skip validation with process owner (will be wrong)
- Try to capture tacit HOW (use labeled black box)
- Force Zone 8-9 into automation (will fail)
- Ignore shadow processes (they're the real process)
- Over-document (keep it actionable)
- Create one-time map (processes evolve, keep updated)

**Do:**
- Start with actual current state
- Validate iteratively
- Document decision points even when logic is tacit
- Acknowledge complexity honestly
- Focus on high-ROI opportunities
- Build movement infrastructure
- Update as process changes

---

## Success Metrics

**Process mapping succeeds when:**
- Process owner says "Yes, that's exactly what we do"
- New team members can follow documented process
- Automation opportunities clearly identified
- ROI estimates are validated
- Quick wins deliver promised value
- Documentation is referenced regularly (not ignored)

**Automation analysis succeeds when:**
- Zone classifications match reality
- Prioritization aligns with business value
- Implementation follows plan
- Expected savings materialize
- User adoption high (not forced)

---

## Example Triggers

- "Document how we handle support tickets"
- "Where can we apply AI to our workflow?"
- "Create SOP for expense approval"
- "Show me where automation makes sense"
- "Why does this process keep breaking?"
