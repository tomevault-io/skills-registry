# Embedded Swift

Embedded Swift is a compilation and language mode that enables development of baremetal, embedded and standalone software in Swift

## Documentation Structure

### Getting Started

- **Introduction to Embedded Swift** ([GettingStarted/Introduction.md](GettingStarted/Introduction.md)): Write Swift code for microcontrollers, embedded systems, and bare-metal applications
- **Language subset** ([GettingStarted/LanguageSubset.md](GettingStarted/LanguageSubset.md)): Details of the Embedded Swift language subset compared to full Swift
- **Install Embedded Swift** ([GettingStarted/InstallEmbeddedSwift.md](GettingStarted/InstallEmbeddedSwift.md)): Get the tools needed to use Embedded Swift

### Guided Examples

- **Getting started with Embedded Swift** ([GettingStarted/WaysToGetStarted.md](GettingStarted/WaysToGetStarted.md)): Possible directions to explore to start using Embedded Swift

- **Raspberry Pi Pico Blink (Pico SDK)** ([GuidedExamples/PicoGuide.md](GuidedExamples/PicoGuide.md)): Tutorial for targetting a Raspberry Pi Pico as an embedded device that runs a simple Swift program
- **Baremetal Setup for STM32 with Embedded Swift** ([GuidedExamples/STM32BaremetalGuide.md](GuidedExamples/STM32BaremetalGuide.md)): Program a STM32 microcontroller directly with low-level Swift code
