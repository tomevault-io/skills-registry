# Project Document Evaluation

Evaluate project documents against structured templates to ensure completeness and quality.

## Document Workflow

This skill supports the natural project documentation flow:
1. **Feature Request** - Initial idea or user need
2. **Initiative** - Strategic response with solution proposal
3. **Epic(s)** - Planned implementation work (epics can depend on each other; planning happens outside epic descriptions)

## Operations

This skill supports the following operations:

### 1. Evaluate Document with Specified Template

User provides both a document and specifies which template to use.

**Examples:**
- "Evaluate docs/feature.md against the feature request template"
- "Check my epic using the epic template"
- "Use the initiative template to evaluate initiative.md"

### 2. Evaluate Document (Template Selection Prompt)

User provides a document but doesn't specify which template. The skill will ask which template to use.

**Examples:**
- "Evaluate docs/project-proposal.md"
- "Check this document for completeness"
- "Help me evaluate my project document"

### 3. Evaluate Document with Custom Template

User provides both a document and a custom template file.

**Examples:**
- "Evaluate docs/proposal.md using my-template.md as the template"
- "Compare this document against custom-template.md"

## Workflow

1. **Identify the document** - User specifies the document to evaluate (markdown, PDF, or Word file)
2. **Select template** - Choose from built-in templates or use a custom template (see Template Selection Guide below)
3. **Read the document** - Load and analyze the document content
4. **Evaluate against template** - Assess completeness, quality, and alignment with template criteria
5. **Generate report** - Provide evaluation results, missing elements, and specific improvement suggestions

## Template Selection Guide

### When Template is Specified

If the user explicitly specifies which template to use (e.g., "evaluate against the initiative template" or "use the epic template"), proceed directly with that template.

### When Template is NOT Specified

If the user provides a document to evaluate without specifying which template to use:

1. **Ask the user** which template to use via the AskUserQuestion tool
2. Present the three built-in template options with their descriptions:
   - **Feature Request** - For initial feature ideas and user needs
   - **Initiative** - For strategic initiatives with solution proposals
   - **Epic** - For planned implementation work
   - **Custom Template** - User provides their own template file path

3. After the user selects, proceed with the evaluation using the chosen template

**Example prompt when template is unclear:**

```
Which template should I use to evaluate this document?

Options:
- Feature Request: Best for initial feature ideas, user needs, and product enhancement proposals
- Initiative: Best for strategic initiatives with solution proposals and desired outcomes
- Epic: Best for planned implementation work with user stories and technical details
- Custom Template: You can provide the path to your own template file
```

## Template Selection

### Built-in Templates

Each template is independent but follows the natural project flow. Read the appropriate template from `references/`:

- `feature-request-template.md` - Initial feature ideas and user needs that start the process
- `initiative-template.md` - Strategic initiatives with solution proposals (often created from feature requests)
- `epic-template.md` - Planned implementation work (created from initiatives; epics can depend on each other)

### Custom Templates

If the user provides a custom template:
- Read the custom template file they specify
- Use the same evaluation workflow with their criteria

For guidance on creating custom templates, see `references/custom-template-guide.md`.

## Evaluation Process

For each template section:

1. **Check presence** - Is the section present in the document?
2. **Assess completeness** - Are all required elements included?
3. **Evaluate quality** - Does the content meet the quality criteria?
4. **Note gaps** - What specific elements are missing or weak?

## Output Format

Provide a structured evaluation report with:

### 1. Overall Assessment
Brief summary of document quality and readiness

### 2. Section-by-Section Evaluation
For each template section:
- **Status**: Complete ✓ | Partial ⚠ | Missing ✗
- **Findings**: What's present, what's missing, quality issues
- **Specific Improvements**: Concrete suggestions for enhancement

### 3. Priority Recommendations
Top 3-5 most critical improvements ranked by impact

### 4. Next Steps
Clear action items to address gaps

## Example Usage

```
User: "Help me evaluate docs/payment-system-initiative.md according to the initiative template"

Process:
1. Read references/initiative-template.md
2. Read docs/payment-system-initiative.md
3. Evaluate each section against criteria
4. Generate improvement suggestions
```

## Note on Document Flow

While templates are independent and can be used in any order, they naturally support this progression:
- **Feature Request** identifies a need or opportunity
- **Initiative** proposes a strategic solution (may reference the originating feature request)
- **Epic(s)** break down implementation (may reference the parent initiative; epics can depend on each other)
