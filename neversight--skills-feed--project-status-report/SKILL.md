# Project Status Report

## Overview

Extract project status information from various sources (meetings, messages, emails, documents) and generate structured status reports following standardized markdown templates.

**Report files:**
- Single team latest day report of all its projects (will be used to create other compiled files)
- Single team compiled report with all its projects and reports informations in date sections
- Consolidated document grouping multiple team reports
- Consolidated project list

## Core Rules and Principles

- **Never invent information** - Only use explicitly stated data
- **Never infer critical data** - Dates, deadlines, metrics must be explicit
- **Ask when unclear** - Request clarification for missing critical info
- **Flexible input** - Accept any format (text, markdown, Google Docs, transcriptions)
- **Contextual intelligence** - Infer team/project names from context when reasonable
- **Automatic language detection** - Match user's language for all output and template content. The final content of the templates, need to be the same users language or the language users set.
- **Historical context awareness** - Use previous reports for consistency, never for inventing data
- **Update capability** - Update existing reports maintaining exact structure
- **Fill yaml correctly** - Final output files need to have the yaml filled correctly. Use the existing notes to learn and reference patterns. Don't create others properties, use only the defined in templates
- **RAG status**: If the user defined the RAG status is the true. If user don't give this information, assume the status based on the latest informations

## Instructions

- **General:**
    - Use the informations, transcripts and documents given by the user to create the reports
    - Learn with notes to understand relations between reports and notes
    - If you will update an existing file, read and understand the file before you update with new informations
    - Find product/project/initiative in existing notes and update the right block
    - Follow template instructions completely
    - If unsure where to insert information, ask to user. 
    - Final output files need to have the yaml filled correctly
    - For projects/topics with resolved and done status, move the the right section indicated in templates
    - Be prepared to update the notes in the right topic section, when the user give updated informations about one individual topic

- **File naming pattern**
    - By default, follow the kabeb-case to create the final files.
    - Multiple teams: `all-teams-status-report-{YYYY-MM-DD}.md`
    - Single team day report: `{team_name}-status-report-{YYYY-MM-DD}.md`
    - Single Compiled Team: `{team_name}-compiled-status-report-{YYYY-MM-DD}.md`
    - Ask for team name if unknown
    - If you will save the file to Obsidian Vault, use Title Case com espaços, where the name of the file is the Title of the File.

- **Single team report:**
    - Usually is used to get latest status report of projects until that day.
    - Is used for structure informations and status report of one single team and your projects. 
    - Use `templates/template-single-team-status.md`
    - Group multiple projects under SINGLE team header
    - Before create the file, ask user confirmation a list of projects and iniatives the final report will have. User can ask to merge some topics or rename

- **Compiled Team report (well structured and formatted group of many single team report files):**
    - Used to group in one file all single team report of one specific team and your projects status reports of multiple days
    - To create or update this report, use the single team reports already created before by the user and the informations given by the user
    - When the user asks for a latest updated report of all projects of one specific team
        - Use the given informations or if the obsidian is used, look for the historical related notes and new related notes to update this report
        - Look for files that have the same name and content patterns created by this skill or for partterns users already asked in the past
    - Output file need to follow the instructions and structure of the template `templates/template-single-team-compiled-status.md`
    - Maintaining structure of the single team report notes, but following the structure and organization of the given template
    - Don't change informations or dates when group those notes
    - Ask for clarification if individual notes don't exist
    - Group multiple projects under SINGLE team header

- **Multiple Teams Reports (multiple teams, with multiple projects, multiple days):**
    - Used to group in one file all single report of all teams with many projects status reports of multiple teams
    - Output file need to follow the instructions and structure of the template `templates/template-multiple-teams-compiled-status.md`
    - Maintaining structure of single team report notes, but following the structure and organization of the given template
    - Don't change informations or dates when group those notes
    - Ask for clarification if individual notes don't exist
    
- **Giving updated list of projects**
    - If users wants an updated list of projects in the notes, use the `templates/template-projects-list.md` file to give the answer.

### Critical Structure Rule

**CORRECT - Single team header with all projects:**
```markdown
## Team Name

### First Project
#### DD-MM-YYYY
{content}

#### DD-MM-YYYY
{content}

#### DD-MM-YYYY
{content}

### Second Project
#### DD-MM-YYYY
{content}

#### DD-MM-YYYY
{content}
```

In the project section, dates sections should be organized from newest to oldest.

**WRONG - Repeated team headers:**
```markdown
## Team Name
### First Project
...

## Team Name
### Second Project
...
```

Team name (`## Team Name`) must appear ONCE with all projects nested under it.

### What to Avoid

- Don't update wrong dates or wrong projects
- Don't create extra blocks (Meeting Notes, Learnings, etc.) - follow templates exactly
- Don't assume - ask for clarification when in doubt

## When the user have Obsidian
Check if the user use Obsidian. If yes, check if you have access to use skills or available MCP to manipulate notes in Obsidian Vault.

- If user wants to save the files in Obsidian vault, ask for the vault path
- if user want to update or modify an existent note in Obsidian vault, ask for the file path in the vault
- Look in the vault to 

## Processing Workflow

### 1. Receive and Analyze
- Detect user's language
- Check for historical context (previous reports)
- Accept input in any format
- Scan for: team names, projects, status, problems, risks, actions, dates

### 2. Extract Information
For each project:
- Team name (explicit or contextual)
- Project/initiative name
- Summary content
- On track items (positive progress)
- Problems (current blockers)
- Risks & concerns (potential issues)
- Actions (specific next steps)

### 3. Handle Missing Information
**When to ask:**
- Critical info missing (team name can't be inferred)
- Contradictory information exists
- Info too vague to populate sections

**When NOT to ask:**
- Minor details missing but core clear
- Only 1-2 sections sparse (mark empty)
- Team/project names reasonably inferable

### 4. Generate Output
- Single markdown file with all projects (default)
- Follow template structure
- Use current date following the right format indicated by templates
- Match user's language
- Insert new updates BEFORE old content (reverse chronological)

## Critical Rules

### NEVER:
❌ Invent dates, deadlines, or timelines
❌ Create action items that weren't stated
❌ Infer problems/risks from neutral statements
❌ Add team members/stakeholders not mentioned
❌ Make up metrics or quantitative data
❌ Fabricate technical details
❌ Assume project status without indication

### ALWAYS:
✅ Use only explicitly stated information
✅ Mark sections empty if no relevant info
✅ Preserve original terminology
✅ Use exact dates when mentioned
✅ Quote specific problems/risks as stated
✅ List only explicitly discussed actions
✅ Ask for clarification when needed
✅ Check if updating existing report
✅ Preserve exact structure when updating
✅ Group projects under SINGLE team header
✅ Insert new content BEFORE old (reverse chronological)

## Quality Checklist

Before delivering:
- [ ] All dates from source or current date following the right format indicated by templates
- [ ] No invented action items or problems
- [ ] Team/project names accurate or marked uncertain
- [ ] All sections present (even if empty)
- [ ] Summary factual without speculation
- [ ] Format matches template exactly
- [ ] Content verifiable from sources
- [ ] No hallucinated details
- [ ] If updating: exact structure preserved
- [ ] Historical context only for terminology, not data invention
- [ ] Each team header appears only ONCE
- [ ] New content inserted BEFORE old content
- [ ] Done/Resolved topics inserted in the right section

## Output Formats

**Default:** 
- Markdown (.md)
- Language following the existing files languages or other language only when the user asks
