name: prompt-complexity-scorer
description: Evaluates user prompts for effort and complexity on a 1-10 scale. This skill should be invoked on every user request to determine if the request warrants planning via a project. For scores 5-10, the agent suggests creating a project at projects/<date>-<project-name>/ to enable task tracking and team collaboration. Use when this capability is needed.

# Prompt Complexity Scorer

This skill evaluates user prompts to determine if they require planning before implementation.

## Skip Evaluation

**Do not evaluate** prompts that are explicit slash command invocations. If the user's prompt starts with `/`, they are already invoking a workflow and no complexity scoring is needed.

Examples of prompts to **skip** (just execute the command):
- `/project:bootstrap @specs/add-auth.md`
- `/git:commit`
- `/project:implement @projects/2026-01-26-feature`

Examples of prompts to **evaluate**:
- "Add WebSocket support to this project"
- "Make the app faster"
- "Refactor the authentication system"

## Scoring Criteria

Score each prompt on a 1-10 scale based on these factors:

| Factor | Low (1-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|--------|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| **Scope** | Single file/function | Multiple files/module | Multiple systems/services |
| **Clarity** | Specific, well-defined | Some ambiguity | Vague, open-ended |
| **Dependencies** | None or obvious | Some coordination | Multiple unknown deps |
| **Unknowns** | None | Some research needed | Significant discovery |
| **Risk** | Low/reversible | Moderate | High/architectural |

### Score Calculation

1. Evaluate each factor independently
2. Average the factor scores
3. Round to nearest integer

## Behavior by Score

### Score 1-4: Continue Normally

Do not mention the scoring. Proceed with the request immediately.

### Score 5-10: Suggest Project

Pause and ask the user:

```text
This request scores [X]/10 on complexity. I suggest creating a project to track this work properly.

Would you like me to create `projects/<date>-<suggested-name>/` with a brief.md?
```

Where `<date>` is today's date in YYYY-MM-DD format and `<suggested-name>` is a kebab-case name derived from the request (e.g., "2026-01-24-add-websockets", "2026-01-24-refactor-auth-system").

## Project Setup

When creating a project, create the directory structure and brief.md:

```bash
# Get today's date
DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
mkdir -p projects/${DATE}-<suggested-name>/tasks
```

```markdown
# <Title derived from prompt>

## Original Request

<User's exact prompt/request>

## Goals

<Bullet points summarizing what needs to be accomplished>

## Notes

<Any additional context or constraints mentioned>
```

After creating the project, inform the user:

```text
Project created at `projects/<date>-<suggested-name>/`.

You can now:
- Run `/project:bootstrap @projects/<date>-<suggested-name>` for full research and planning
- Or continue with the request and tasks will be tracked in this project
```

**IMPORTANT**: After creating the project, set the active project context by creating a marker file:

```bash
echo "${DATE}-<suggested-name>" > .claude-active-project
```

This enables automatic task syncing to the project directory.

## Examples

### Example 1: Simple Request (Score 1)

**Prompt**: "Fix the typo in the error message on line 45 of user.service.ts"

**Factors**:
- Scope: 1 (single line)
- Clarity: 1 (exact location specified)
- Dependencies: 1 (none)
- Unknowns: 1 (none)
- Risk: 1 (trivial change)

**Score**: 1 → Continue normally

### Example 2: Complex Request (Score 7)

**Prompt**: "Add WebSocket support to this project"

**Factors**:
- Scope: 8 (new system, multiple files)
- Clarity: 6 (what kind of WebSocket? real-time features?)
- Dependencies: 7 (infrastructure, client changes)
- Unknowns: 7 (architecture decisions needed)
- Risk: 7 (architectural change)

**Score**: 7 → Suggest creating `projects/YYYY-MM-DD-add-websockets/`

### Example 3: Medium Request (Score 3)

**Prompt**: "Add a new field 'nickname' to the User entity"

**Factors**:
- Scope: 4 (entity, migration, possibly resolvers)
- Clarity: 2 (clear requirement)
- Dependencies: 3 (migration, schema)
- Unknowns: 2 (standard pattern)
- Risk: 3 (database change but reversible)

**Score**: 3 → Continue normally

### Example 4: Nebulous Request (Score 8)

**Prompt**: "Make the app faster"

**Factors**:
- Scope: 9 (entire application)
- Clarity: 9 (completely vague)
- Dependencies: 8 (unknown until investigated)
- Unknowns: 9 (what's slow? why?)
- Risk: 6 (depends on changes)

**Score**: 8 → Suggest creating `projects/YYYY-MM-DD-performance-optimization/`

## Important Notes

- This evaluation should be quick and silent for low-complexity requests
- Never mention the scoring system for scores 1-4
- For borderline cases (score 4-5), lean toward continuing normally
- The goal is to catch truly complex/nebulous requests that benefit from planning
