# ProxyUser E2E Testing

ProxyUser is an AI-assisted E2E QA platform. Describe tests in plain English, and AI executes them as a human would.

## Quick Start

### Authentication

Store your API key in the environment:

```bash
export PROXYUSER_API_KEY="sk_live_your_key_here"
```

Create API keys at https://proxyuser.com/settings/api_keys

**Fallback:** If `$PROXYUSER_API_KEY` is not set in the environment, check the project's root `.env` file for `PROXYUSER_API_KEY=sk_live_xxx`.

### Verify Setup

```bash
curl -s https://proxyuser.com/api/v1/projects \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PROXYUSER_API_KEY" | jq '.data.projects[].name'
```

### Key Concepts

| Concept | Description | ID Format |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| **Project** | Groups scenarios for an application | `proj_xxx` |
| **Scenario** | Plain English test description + URL | `scen_xxx` |
| **Run** | Single test execution with status and video | `run_xxx` |
| **Folder** | Groups scenarios with shared instructions | `fold_xxx` |

---

## When Invoked Without Instructions

If the user invokes `/proxyuser` without specifying what they want to do:

**Ask the user to choose:**

1. **Generate starter tests** - Analyze the codebase and create foundational E2E tests
2. **Create test for a feature** - Write a test for something specific
3. **Run tests** - Execute existing tests against a URL
4. **Check recent failures** - Diagnose and investigate failed tests

### Starter Tests Workflow

When the user chooses "Generate starter tests":

**Step 1: Understand the application**

Analyze the codebase to identify:
- App type (e-commerce, SaaS, content site, etc.)
- Main user-facing routes and pages
- Authentication patterns (email/password, OAuth, magic link)
- Core features that deliver user value

Look at: route files, navigation components, page directories, and any existing test coverage.

**Step 2: Check existing coverage**

List all existing scenarios in the project to avoid duplicates:

```bash
curl -s "https://proxyuser.com/api/v1/projects/$PROJECT_ID/scenarios" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PROXYUSER_API_KEY" | jq '.data.scenarios[].prompt'
```

**Step 3: Suggest foundational tests**

Recommend scenarios following the prioritization order:

1. **Revenue-critical paths** - Checkout, payment, upgrade flows
2. **User acquisition** - Signup, onboarding
3. **Core product value** - The main thing users come to do
4. **Authentication** - Login, logout, password reset

Limit initial suggestions to 5-10 high-impact scenarios. Quality over quantity.

**Step 4: Create scenarios with proper organization**

Group related tests into folders. Create folders first, then add scenarios to them.

Example structure for an e-commerce app:
```
📁 Authentication
   - User can sign up with email
   - User can log in with credentials
📁 Shopping
   - User can add item to cart
   - User can view cart
📁 Checkout
   - User can complete purchase
```

---

## Workflows

### Create Test for New Feature

When implementing a feature that needs E2E coverage:

```
- [ ] **List existing scenarios and review coverage before suggesting new tests**
- [ ] Identify the user journey the feature enables
- [ ] Write scenario with specific, observable assertions
- [ ] Commit scenario alongside feature code
```

**Step 1: Check existing scenarios**

```bash
curl -s "https://proxyuser.com/api/v1/projects/$PROJECT_ID/scenarios" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PROXYUSER_API_KEY" | jq '.data.scenarios[].prompt'
```

**Step 2: Create the scenario**

```bash
curl -X POST "https://proxyuser.com/api/v1/projects/$PROJECT_ID/scenarios" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PROXYUSER_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "User clicks Add to Cart button, cart icon shows count of 1, checkout button becomes visible",
    "url": "https://example.com/products/widget-1"
  }'
```

---

### Run Scenario and Wait for Results

Test runs are async. Trigger, then poll for completion:

```bash
# Trigger run
RUN_ID=$(curl -s -X POST "https://proxyuser.com/api/v1/scenarios/$SCENARIO_ID/run" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PROXYUSER_API_KEY" | jq -r '.data.run.id')

echo "Started run: $RUN_ID"

# Poll until complete (timeout after 5 minutes)
for i in {1..30}; do
  RESULT=$(curl -s "https://proxyuser.com/api/v1/runs/$RUN_ID" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $PROXYUSER_API_KEY")

  STATUS=$(echo $RESULT | jq -r '.data.run.status')

  case $STATUS in
    passed)
      echo "Test passed!"
      exit 0
      ;;
    failed)
      echo "Test failed:"
      echo $RESULT | jq -r '.data.run.ai_diagnosis'
      exit 1
      ;;
    *)
      echo "Status: $STATUS..."
      sleep 10
      ;;
  esac
done

echo "Timeout waiting for test"
exit 1
```

---

### Run All Tests on Preview Deploy

Run your entire test suite against a preview/staging URL:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://proxyuser.com/api/v1/projects/$PROJECT_ID/run_all" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PROXYUSER_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"target_url": "https://preview-abc123.vercel.app"}'
```

Filter to specific folders:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://proxyuser.com/api/v1/projects/$PROJECT_ID/run_all" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PROXYUSER_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "target_url": "https://staging.example.com",
    "folder_ids": ["fold_abc123", "fold_def456"]
  }'
```

---

### Diagnose a Failed Test

Get the AI diagnosis and video for a failed run:

```bash
curl -s "https://proxyuser.com/api/v1/runs/$RUN_ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PROXYUSER_API_KEY" | jq '{
    status: .data.run.status,
    diagnosis: .data.run.ai_diagnosis,
    video: .data.run.video_url,
    scenario: .data.run.scenario.prompt
  }'
```

**Common diagnosis patterns:**

| Diagnosis | Likely Cause | Action |
|-----------|--------------|--------|
| "Element not found" | Selector changed, element removed | Check if UI changed |
| "Timeout waiting for" | Slow load, async issue | Check performance |
| "Unexpected text" | Copy changed, display bug | Verify expected text |
| "Navigation failed" | Route broken, redirect issue | Check routing |

---

### List Recent Failures

```bash
curl -s "https://proxyuser.com/api/v1/runs?status=failed&limit=10" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PROXYUSER_API_KEY" | jq '.data.runs[] | {
    id: .id,
    scenario_id: .scenario_id,
    completed: .completed_at
  }'
```

---

## Writing Effective Scenarios

### Keep It Simple

ProxyUser's AI browses like a human. Trust it to figure out the details—don't write step-by-step instructions.

**Good:**
```
User can sign up with a valid email address
```

**Bad:**
```
User enters "test@example.com" in email field, clicks Submit button,
sees "Check your inbox" confirmation message on screen
```

### Code-to-Test Translation

When you implement a feature, ask: "What capability does this give the user?"

| Code Change | Test Prompt |
|-------------|-------------|
| Add delete button | "User can delete an item from the list" |
| Implement search | "User can search for items by name" |
| Add form validation | "User sees error when submitting with empty email" |
| Add pagination | "User can load more items at bottom of list" |
| Implement login | "User can log in with {{EMAIL}} and {{PASSWORD}}" |

### Environment Variables

Use `{{VAR}}` for credentials (configured in ProxyUser dashboard):

```
User can log in with {{EMAIL}} and {{PASSWORD}}
```

### Common Patterns

See [examples/prompt-patterns.md](examples/prompt-patterns.md) for a library of reusable test scenario templates.

### Prioritizing Test Scenarios

Focus on high-impact tests first. If this breaks, does the business suffer?

**Test these first (in order):**

1. **Revenue-critical paths** - Checkout, payment, subscription upgrades
2. **User acquisition** - Signup, onboarding completion
3. **Core product value** - The main thing users come to do
4. **Authentication** - Login, logout, password reset
5. **Key error states** - Validation errors, failure messages users need to see

**Skip these (low impact):**
- Cosmetic hover states
- Admin-only features (test manually)
- Edge cases that affect <1% of users

### Scenario Guardrails

**Before suggesting any new scenarios:**

1. **List existing scenarios first** - Run the list scenarios API call and review what's already covered
2. **Check for overlapping coverage** - Don't suggest tests that duplicate existing functionality
3. **Limit recommendations** - Recommend a maximum of 20 scenarios per session. Quality > quantity.

**When reviewing existing scenarios, look for:**
- Similar user journeys (e.g., "User can add item" vs "User adds product to cart")
- Overlapping test coverage (e.g., login tested in multiple scenarios)
- Tests that could be consolidated

**Red flags that you're over-testing:**
- More than 5 scenarios for a single feature
- Scenarios testing minor variations of the same flow
- Tests for edge cases affecting <1% of users

### Test Boundaries

**Only test what can be completed entirely within the browser.**

ProxyUser controls a browser. It cannot check email inboxes, receive SMS codes, or interact with external services.

❌ **Do NOT create scenarios that require:**

- Checking email (verification links, password reset emails)
- SMS or phone verification
- Third-party OAuth (Google, Apple, Facebook login buttons)
- External service responses (Slack notifications, webhook deliveries)
- Real payment processing (use test/sandbox modes instead)
- Mobile app interactions
- Desktop notifications or OS-level prompts

✅ **Instead, test the browser-side behavior:**

| Don't test this | Test this instead |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| "User receives verification email" | "User sees 'Check your email' confirmation" |
| "User logs in with Google" | "User sees Google login button and it's clickable" |
| "Payment completes successfully" | "User can submit payment form" (in test mode) |
| "User gets Slack notification" | "User sees 'Notification sent' message in UI" |

## Organizing Scenarios

### Use Folders to Group Related Tests

Avoid creating a flat list of scenarios. Group tests by feature area, user flow, or page section.

**Good organization:**
```
📁 Authentication
   - User can sign up with email
   - User can log in with credentials
   - User can reset password
📁 Shopping Cart
   - User can add item to cart
   - User can remove item from cart
   - User can update quantity
📁 Checkout
   - User can complete purchase
   - User can apply discount code
```

**Bad organization:**
```
- User can sign up
- User can add to cart
- User can log in
- User can checkout
- User can reset password
- User can remove from cart
... (12 more unorganized scenarios)
```

### Before Creating Scenarios

**Step 1: List existing folders**

```bash
curl -s "https://proxyuser.com/api/v1/projects/$PROJECT_ID/folders" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PROXYUSER_API_KEY" | jq '.data.folders[] | {id, name, scenarios_count}'
```

To see scenarios within each folder, add `?include_scenarios=true`.

**Step 2: Choose the right folder**

- If a folder exists that matches the feature area → use it
- If no folder fits → create one (see below)
- If adding multiple related scenarios → create a folder for them

### Creating a Folder

```bash
curl -X POST "https://proxyuser.com/api/v1/projects/$PROJECT_ID/folders" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PROXYUSER_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Shopping Cart",
    "instructions": "All tests start from the product catalog page",
    "schedule": "0 9 * * *"
  }'
```

Parameters:
- `name` (required) - Folder name
- `instructions` (optional) - Shared context for all scenarios in the folder
- `schedule` (optional) - Cron expression for recurring test runs

**For folders requiring authentication:**

```bash
curl -X POST "https://proxyuser.com/api/v1/projects/$PROJECT_ID/folders" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PROXYUSER_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "User Dashboard",
    "instructions": "First, log in with {{EMAIL}} and {{PASSWORD}}"
  }'
```

**Note:** Set the scenario URLs to the login page (e.g., `https://example.com/login`) when using auth instructions.

### Folder Instructions and Inheritance

When you set `instructions` on a folder, **all scenarios in that folder inherit those instructions**. This is ideal for shared setup steps like authentication.

#### When to Use Folder-Level Authentication

Use folder-level instructions when:
- Multiple scenarios in the folder require the same login
- All tests start from an authenticated state
- You want DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) test organization

Use scenario-level authentication when:
- Only one or two scenarios need authentication
- Different scenarios need different credentials
- The auth flow IS what you're testing

#### Example: Folder with Authentication

```bash
curl -X POST "https://proxyuser.com/api/v1/projects/$PROJECT_ID/folders" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PROXYUSER_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Dashboard Features",
    "instructions": "First, log in with {{EMAIL}} and {{PASSWORD}}"
  }'
```

Now scenarios in this folder are simple:
```
User can view analytics chart
User can export data to CSV
User can update notification settings
```

The AI will log in first (from folder instructions), then execute the scenario.

#### Before/After: DRY Principle

**Before (repetitive):**
```
📁 Dashboard (no instructions)
   - User logs in with {{EMAIL}} and {{PASSWORD}}, then views analytics
   - User logs in with {{EMAIL}} and {{PASSWORD}}, then exports data
   - User logs in with {{EMAIL}} and {{PASSWORD}}, then updates settings
```

**After (using folder instructions):**
```
📁 Dashboard
   instructions: "First, log in with {{EMAIL}} and {{PASSWORD}}"
   - User can view analytics chart
   - User can export data to CSV
   - User can update notification settings
```

#### Starting URL for Authentication

When tests require authentication, set the scenario's starting URL to the login page:

| Scenario Type | Starting URL |
|--------------|--------------|
| Public page test | `https://example.com/` |
| Authenticated test | `https://example.com/login` |
| Deep-link after auth | `https://example.com/login` (AI navigates after login) |

**Note:** Even if your folder instructions say to log in, the browser needs to start on a page where login is possible.

### Running All Scenarios in a Folder

```bash
curl -X POST "https://proxyuser.com/api/v1/folders/$FOLDER_ID/run" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PROXYUSER_API_KEY"
```

All triggered tests share a `batch_id` for unified tracking.

### Assigning Scenarios to Folders

Include `folder_id` when creating scenarios:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://proxyuser.com/api/v1/projects/$PROJECT_ID/scenarios" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PROXYUSER_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "User can add item to cart",
    "url": "https://example.com/products",
    "folder_id": "fold_abc123"
  }'
```

### Moving Scenarios Between Folders

To move an existing scenario to a different folder:

```bash
curl -X PATCH "https://proxyuser.com/api/v1/scenarios/$SCENARIO_ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PROXYUSER_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"folder_id": "fold_newFolder123"}'
```

To remove a scenario from its folder (move to root/unfiled):

```bash
curl -X PATCH "https://proxyuser.com/api/v1/scenarios/$SCENARIO_ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PROXYUSER_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"folder_id": null}'
```

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions (Vercel Preview Deploys)

```yaml
name: E2E Tests
on:
  deployment_status:

jobs:
  test:
    if: github.event.deployment_status.state == 'success'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: proxyuserai/action@v1
        with:
          api-key: ${{ secrets.PROXYUSER_API_KEY }}
          project-id: 'proj_xxx'
          target-url: ${{ github.event.deployment_status.target_url }}
          fail-on-test-failure: 'true'
```

### Other CI Systems

Use the API directly with the polling script from "Run Scenario and Wait for Results" above.

Full CI/CD documentation: https://proxyuser.com/docs#github-integration

---

## Troubleshooting

### Test passes locally but fails in CI

- Check if `target_url` override is correct
- Verify environment variables are set in ProxyUser dashboard
- Check if preview deploy is fully ready before tests run

### Video not available

Videos take ~30 seconds to process after test completion. Poll the run endpoint until `video_available: true`.

### Rate limits

The API allows 100 requests per minute per API key. For bulk operations, use `run_all` instead of individual scenario runs.
