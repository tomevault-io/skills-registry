# Python Errors and Reliability

## Overview

Design errors so callers can act and operators can diagnose quickly.
Treat these recommendations as preferred defaults — when a default conflicts with project constraints, suggest a better-fit alternative and call out tradeoffs and compensating controls.

## When to Use

- Implementing or reviewing timeout, deadline, or retry logic.
- Translating exceptions across layer boundaries (e.g., infra → domain).
- Classifying failures as retryable vs. permanent.
- Adding idempotency guarantees to retried writes.
- Diagnosing swallowed exceptions or silent failures in existing code.

**When NOT to use:**

- Pure data-transformation code with no I/O or failure modes.
- Simple validation that raises immediately with no translation needed.
- Performance tuning unrelated to failure handling (see `python-concurrency-performance`).

## Quick Reference

- Preserve cause chains at translation boundaries.
- Catch only what can be handled.
- Keep timeout/deadline policy explicit.
- Keep retry policy explicit and bounded.
- Classify retryable vs. permanent failures with explicit policy data.
- Keep idempotency expectations explicit for retried writes.

## Common Mistakes

- **Swallowing exceptions** — bare `except: pass` or `except Exception` with no logging loses diagnostic context.
- **Unbounded retries** — retrying without a maximum count or total deadline leads to cascading failures and resource exhaustion.
- **Dropping the cause chain** — raising a new exception without `from original` discards the root cause operators need for diagnosis.
- **Treating all errors as retryable** — retrying a 400 Bad Request or a validation error wastes resources and delays the real fix.
- **Implicit timeouts** — relying on library defaults (or no timeout at all) produces unpredictable latency under failure conditions.

## Scope Note

- Treat these recommendations as preferred defaults for common cases, not universal rules.
- If a default conflicts with project constraints or worsens the outcome, suggest a better-fit alternative and explain why it is better for this case.
- When deviating, call out tradeoffs and compensating controls (tests, observability, migration, rollback).

## Invocation Notice

- Inform the user when this skill is being invoked by name: `python-design-modularity`.
