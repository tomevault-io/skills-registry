## Quick Reference

### Common Patterns

**Pattern 1:** base_url (str | Callable[[str], str], optional) – Telegram Bot API service URL. If the string contains {token}, it will be replaced with the bot’s token. If a callable is passed, it will be called with the bot’s token as the only argument and must return the base URL. Otherwise, the token will be appended to the string. Defaults to "https://api.telegram.org/bot". Tip Customizing the base URL can be used to run a bot against Local Bot API Server or using Telegrams test environment. Example:"https://api.telegram.org/bot{token}/test" Changed in version 21.11: Supports callable input and string formatting.

```
str
```

**Pattern 2:** Tip Customizing the base URL can be used to run a bot against Local Bot API Server or using Telegrams test environment. Example:"https://api.telegram.org/bot{token}/test"
