# Python Testing

## Overview

Test observable behavior and contracts, not internal implementation.
Keep unit tests fast, deterministic, and patched at module boundaries.

These are preferred defaults for common cases.
When a default conflicts with project constraints, suggest a better-fit alternative, call out tradeoffs, and note compensating controls.

## When to Use

- Writing or reviewing unit, integration, or reliability-sensitive tests.
- Tests are flaky, slow, or coupled to implementation details.
- Adding regression tests after a bugfix.
- Testing async lifecycles, cancellation, or cleanup paths.
- Unsure what test coverage a change needs.

**When NOT to use:**

- Pure data-shape or schema validation (see `python-types-contracts`).
- Production observability or monitoring concerns (see `python-runtime-operations`).
- Concurrency design decisions outside of test harnesses (see `python-concurrency-performance`).

## Quick Reference

- Test observable behavior, not internals.
- Keep unit tests fast and deterministic.
- Patch at module boundaries and import locations used by the unit under test.
- Add regression tests for bugfixes.
- Include timeout/retry/cancellation/cleanup coverage where relevant.

## Change-Specific Diagnostics

- Dependency updates: run `uv run pytest scripts/test_pypi_security_audit.py -v`
- Async-heavy lifecycle changes: run `pyleak` diagnostics.

## Common Mistakes

- **Mocking too deep** — patching internals instead of module-boundary seams makes tests brittle and coupled to implementation.
- **Testing the mock** — verifying mock call counts without asserting on observable output proves nothing about behavior.
- **Missing regression test** — fixing a bug without a test that reproduces it first; the bug will recur.
- **Non-deterministic time/order** — relying on wall-clock time or dict/set ordering instead of injecting clocks and sorting explicitly.
- **Skipping cleanup assertions** — verifying the happy path but never asserting that resources are released on failure or cancellation.

## Scope Note

- Treat these recommendations as preferred defaults for common cases, not universal rules.
- If a default conflicts with project constraints or worsens the outcome, suggest a better-fit alternative and explain why it is better for this case.
- When deviating, call out tradeoffs and compensating controls (tests, observability, migration, rollback).

## Invocation Notice

- Inform the user when this skill is being invoked by name: `python-design-modularity`.
