## When to Use

Use this skill when the user wants to:
- Convert a document, report, or text into a compelling business story
- Create an infographic from written content
- Transform dry business information into visual summaries
- Generate cartoon-style visual representations of key points

## Workflow

**IMPORTANT**: After each step, display outputs and ask for user confirmation before proceeding.

### Step 1: Prepare Input
Convert the source document to markdown/text.

```bash
markitdown <input_file> -o <OUTPUT.md>
```

**Review checkpoint**: Show the first ~50 lines of converted content. Ask user to confirm before proceeding.

### Step 2: Generate Story
```bash
python skills/q-infographics/scripts/gen_story.py <INPUT.md> skills/q-infographics/prompts/story.txt > STORY_OUTPUT.md
```

**Review checkpoint**:
1. Show the prompt being used: `cat skills/q-infographics/prompts/story.txt`
2. After generation, show the full story output: `cat STORY_OUTPUT.md`
3. Ask user: "Story generated. Review above and confirm to proceed with infographic generation, or request edits."

### Step 3: Generate Infographic
```bash
python skills/q-infographics/scripts/gen_image.py STORY_OUTPUT.md skills/q-infographics/prompts/image.txt <SOURCE_NAME>_INFO
```

**Naming convention**: Output files use the source filename with `_INFO` suffix (e.g., `MY_REPORT.pdf` → `MY_REPORT_INFO.jpg`).

**Review checkpoint**:
1. Show the image prompt being used: `cat skills/q-infographics/prompts/image.txt`
2. After generation, display the infographic image
3. Ask user: "Infographic generated. Would you like to regenerate with different settings?"

## Requirements
*   `pip install -r skills/q-infographics/requirements.txt`
*   `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable set

## Customization

*   **Story Style**: Edit `skills/q-infographics/prompts/story.txt` to change the writing persona
*   **Infographic Style**: Edit `skills/q-infographics/prompts/image.txt` to change the visual art style

## Prompts Reference

### Story Prompt (`prompts/story.txt`)
Creates business stories in the style of top-tier Chinese tech media (36Kr, Huxiu). Key elements:
- Story-first approach with hero's journey structure
- "Golden sentences" - bold, shareable quotes
- Effective analogies for complex concepts
- Structured methodology breakdowns
- Rhythmic flow with rhetorical questions

### Image Prompt (`prompts/image.txt`)
Generates hand-drawn cartoon-style infographics:
- 16:9 landscape composition
- Concise cartoon elements and icons
- Highlights keywords and core concepts
- Ample white space for readability
- Language matches input content

## Examples

Sample infographics generated from academic research papers:
