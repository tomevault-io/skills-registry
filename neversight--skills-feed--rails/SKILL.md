<objective>
Provide comprehensive guidance for Ruby on Rails development based on the official Rails Guides v8.1.1. Use this skill for all Rails-related development tasks, from basic CRUD operations to advanced features like Action Cable, Active Job, and performance tuning.
</objective>

<context>
Rails follows the "Convention over Configuration" principle. When building Rails applications:

- Follow Rails naming conventions for models, controllers, and routes
- Use Rails generators for consistency
- Leverage Rails magic (associations, validations, callbacks) rather than reinventing
- Write tests using Rails testing conventions
- Use Rails helpers and built-in functionality before custom code
</context>

<quick_start>
<common_commands>
```bash
# Database
rails db:create              # Create database
rails db:migrate             # Run pending migrations
rails db:rollback            # Rollback last migration

# Console and server
rails console                # Start Rails console
rails server                 # Start development server
rails test                   # Run all tests

# Generators
rails generate model NAME    # Generate model
rails generate controller NAME # Generate controller
rails generate scaffold NAME # Generate full CRUD
```
</common_commands>

<typical_workflow>
1. Generate model: `rails generate model Article title:string body:text`
2. Run migration: `rails db:migrate`
3. Add associations and validations to model
4. Generate controller: `rails generate controller Articles`
5. Define routes in `config/routes.rb`
6. Build views with ERB templates
7. Write tests and iterate
</typical_workflow>
</quick_start>

<reference_guides>
This skill includes detailed reference documentation organized by topic. **Always consult the relevant reference file** when working on specific Rails components:

**Active Record** ([references/active_record.md](references/active_record.md))

Read this when working with:
- Models and database operations (CRUD, queries, scopes)
- Database migrations and schema changes
- Model associations (has_many, belongs_to, has_one, has_and_belongs_to_many)
- Validations and custom validators
- Callbacks and lifecycle hooks
- PostgreSQL-specific features
- Multiple database configurations
- Composite primary keys
- Encryption

Common patterns:
- Defining associations: Always specify inverse_of for better performance
- Writing migrations: Use reversible changes when possible
- Query optimization: Use includes/joins to avoid N+1 queries
- Validations: Validate at the model level, not just in controllers

**Controllers & Views** ([references/controllers_views.md](references/controllers_views.md))

Read this when working with:
- Action Controller basics and advanced topics
- Rendering views, partials, and layouts
- Strong parameters and params handling
- Action View helpers and form builders
- Request/response cycle
- Filters (before_action, after_action, around_action)
- Streaming and file downloads

Common patterns:
- Use strong parameters to whitelist permitted attributes
- Keep controllers thin - business logic belongs in models
- Use partials for reusable view components
- Leverage view helpers for common formatting tasks

**Routing** ([references/routing.md](references/routing.md))

Read this when working with:
- Defining routes (resources, match, get, post, etc.)
- RESTful routing conventions
- Nested routes and namespaces
- Route constraints and custom matchers
- Route helpers and URL generation
- Routing concerns for DRY routes

Common patterns:
- Use `resources` for RESTful routes
- Nest routes only when truly hierarchical (limit to 1 level deep)
- Use shallow nesting for cleaner URLs
- Utilize route concerns for shared routing patterns

**Testing & Debugging** ([references/testing_debugging.md](references/testing_debugging.md))

Read this when working with:
- Writing unit tests (models, helpers)
- Controller tests and integration tests
- System tests with browser automation
- Fixtures, factories, and test data
- Testing mailers, jobs, and cables
- Debugging techniques (byebug, rails console)
- Rails logger and debugging helpers

Common patterns:
- Write tests first (TDD) or immediately after (test-driven design)
- Use fixtures for simple cases, factories for complex scenarios
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Use system tests for critical user flows

**Jobs, Mailers & Cable** ([references/jobs_mailers_cable.md](references/jobs_mailers_cable.md))

Read this when working with:
- Active Job for background processing
- Action Mailer for email sending
- Action Mailbox for receiving emails
- Action Cable for WebSocket connections
- Queue adapters (Sidekiq, Resque, etc.)
- Email delivery and testing

Common patterns:
- Always use Active Job for async work (don't block requests)
- Test mailers with ActionMailer::TestCase
- Use Action Cable for real-time features (chat, notifications)
- Configure proper queue backends for production

**Assets & Frontend** ([references/assets_frontend.md](references/assets_frontend.md))

Read this when working with:
- Asset pipeline and Sprockets
- JavaScript bundling (import maps, esbuild, webpack)
- CSS and preprocessors (Sass, Tailwind)
- Action Text for rich text editing
- Frontend frameworks integration

Common patterns:
- Use asset helpers (image_tag, javascript_include_tag, etc.)
- Configure proper asset compilation for production
- Leverage Rails UJS/Turbo for dynamic interactions
- Use Action Text for WYSIWYG content

**Storage & Caching** ([references/storage_caching.md](references/storage_caching.md))

Read this when working with:
- Active Storage for file uploads
- Attaching files to models
- Image variants and transformations
- Caching strategies (page, action, fragment, low-level)
- Cache stores (Redis, Memcached)
- Russian Doll caching patterns

Common patterns:
- Use Active Storage for all file uploads
- Generate image variants on-demand
- Cache expensive computations and queries
- Use fragment caching for dynamic pages

**Configuration & Internals** ([references/configuration_internals.md](references/configuration_internals.md))

Read this when working with:
- Rails configuration options
- Environment-specific settings
- Initialization process
- Autoloading and eager loading
- Threading and concurrency
- Rack integration
- Rails engines
- Command-line tools and generators
- Custom generators

Common patterns:
- Keep environment configs DRY using shared settings
- Use Rails.application.config for app-wide settings
- Understand autoloading in development vs eager loading in production
- Create custom generators for repeated patterns

**Security & Performance** ([references/security_performance.md](references/security_performance.md))

Read this when working with:
- Security best practices
- XSS, CSRF, SQL injection prevention
- Authentication and authorization patterns
- Performance tuning and optimization
- Database query optimization

Read this when working with:
- Building JSON APIs with Rails
- API-only applications
- Serialization patterns
- Authentication for APIs (tokens, JWT)
- API versioning strategies
- CORS configuration

Common patterns:
- Use Rails API mode for API-only apps
- Implement proper authentication (OAuth, JWT, API keys)

<workflow>
<starting_new_feature>
**Plan the data model**
- Identify models and their relationships
- Sketch out the database schema
- Consider validations and constraints

**Generate migrations and models**
```bash
rails generate model Article title:string body:text published_at:datetime
rails generate migration AddUserRefToArticles user:references
```

**Set up associations and validations**
- Define relationships in models
- Add validations for data integrity
- Write model tests

**Create controllers and routes**
```bash
rails generate controller Articles index show new create edit update destroy
```
- Or use `rails generate scaffold` for full CRUD

**Build views**
- Create templates using ERB or other templating engines
- Use partials for reusable components
- Leverage form helpers

**Write tests**
- Model tests for validations and associations
- Controller tests for actions
- System tests for user flows

**Iterate and refactor**
- Extract common logic to concerns or service objects
- Optimize database queries
- Improve user experience
</starting_new_feature>
</workflow>

<best_practices>
<code_organization>
- Keep controllers thin (delegate to models/services)
- Use concerns for shared behavior
- Extract complex queries to scopes or query objects
- Use service objects for complex business logic
</code_organization>

<database>
- Always add indexes for foreign keys
- Use database constraints where appropriate
- Write reversible migrations
- Use database-level validations when possible
</database>

<performance>
- Eager load associations to avoid N+1 queries
- Use counter caches for expensive counts
- Implement caching strategically
- Profile before optimizing
</performance>

<security>
- Never trust user input (use strong parameters)
- Keep Rails and gems updated
- Use HTTPS in production
- Implement proper authorization (use gems like Pundit/CanCanCan)
</security>

<testing>
- Aim for high model test coverage
- Write integration tests for critical paths
- Use fixtures or factories, not both
- Keep tests fast and focused
</testing>
</best_practices>

<common_patterns>
<model_example>
```ruby
class Article < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user
  has_many :comments, dependent: :destroy
  has_many_attached :images

  validates :title, presence: true, length: { minimum: 5 }
  validates :body, presence: true

  scope :published, -> { where.not(published_at: nil) }
  scope :recent, -> { order(created_at: :desc).limit(10) }

  def published?
    published_at.present? && published_at <= Time.current
  end
end
```
</model_example>

<controller_example>
```ruby
class ArticlesController < ApplicationController
  before_action :set_article, only: [:show, :edit, :update, :destroy]
  before_action :authenticate_user!, except: [:index, :show]

  def index
    @articles = Article.published.includes(:user)
  end

  def show
  end

  def create
    @article = current_user.articles.build(article_params)

    if @article.save
      redirect_to @article, notice: 'Article was successfully created.'
    else
      render :new, status: :unprocessable_entity
    end
  end

  private

  def set_article
    @article = Article.find(params[:id])
  end

  def article_params
    params.require(:article).permit(:title, :body, :published_at, images: [])
  end
end
```
</controller_example>

<routes_example>
```ruby
# config/routes.rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  root 'articles#index'

  resources :articles do
    resources :comments, only: [:create, :destroy]
  end

  namespace :admin do
    resources :articles
  end
end
```
</routes_example>
</common_patterns>

<version_notes>
This skill is based on Rails 8.1.1. Key recent features:

- Solid Queue, Solid Cache, and Solid Cable for built-in infrastructure
- Enhanced Turbo integration
- Improved authentication generators
- Better type checking with RBS support
- Progressive Web App features

When working with older Rails versions, check the upgrade guides in the references for migration paths and deprecated features.
</version_notes>

<troubleshooting>
When stuck on a Rails problem:

1. Check the relevant reference file first
2. Use `rails console` to experiment with code
3. Review the Rails guides at guides.rubyonrails.org
4. Check the API documentation at api.rubyonrails.org
5. Search GitHub issues for known problems

Remember: Rails is designed to make common tasks easy and follow sensible conventions. If something feels too difficult, there's likely a Rails way to do it more simply.
</troubleshooting>
