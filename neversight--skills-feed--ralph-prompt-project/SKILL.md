# Ralph Prompt Generator: Complete Project

## Overview

Generates comprehensive prompts for building entire projects from scratch using the Ralph Wiggum technique. These prompts structure development into architectural phases (design, implementation, testing, documentation) with clear milestones and incremental completion.

**Best For:**
- Building complete REST APIs from scratch
- Creating CLI tools
- Developing libraries/packages
- Building web applications
- Creating automation tools
- Greenfield projects with clear requirements

**Real-World Success:**
- Geoffrey Huntley used Ralph to create the "cursed" programming language over 3 months
- Y Combinator hackathon: 6 repositories generated overnight
- $50k contract completed for $297 in API costs

**Ralph Philosophy**: These successes work because Ralph embraces that failures are deterministic and fixable. Each iteration learns from the previous. Don't fear failures—they're expected and provide data for improvement through prompt tuning, not tool changes.

## Quick Start

**Input Required:**
1. Project description (what to build)
2. Technical requirements (language, framework, features)
3. Success criteria (what makes it complete)
4. Final completion promise

**Generate prompt with:**
```
Generate a Ralph project prompt for:
Project: [Project description]
Tech stack: [Language, framework, tools]
Features: [List of required features]
Promise: [COMPLETION_PHRASE]
```

## Prompt Generation Workflow

### Step 1: Define Project Scope

**Project Definition Template:**
```markdown
PROJECT: [Project Name]
PURPOSE: [One sentence explaining what it does]
TECH STACK: [Languages, frameworks, tools]
TARGET USERS: [Who will use this]

CORE FEATURES:
1. [Feature 1]
2. [Feature 2]
3. [Feature 3]

NON-GOALS (Out of scope):
- [What this project will NOT do]
- [Explicit exclusions]

SUCCESS DEFINITION:
[Measurable, verifiable completion criteria]
```

### Step 2: Map Project Phases

Standard project phases:

| Phase | Name | Purpose | Typical % |
|-------|------|---------|-----------|
| 0 | Setup | Project scaffolding, dependencies | 5% |
| 1 | Architecture | Design patterns, structure | 10% |
| 2 | Core | Main functionality | 40% |
| 3 | Features | Additional features | 25% |
| 4 | Testing | Test coverage | 10% |
| 5 | Polish | Documentation, cleanup | 10% |

### Step 3: Define Milestones

Each phase needs concrete milestones:

**Good Milestones:**
- Verifiable by running commands
- Binary (complete or not)
- Independent of subjective judgment

**Examples:**
- "Project builds without errors" (verifiable)
- "All tests pass" (verifiable)
- "CLI help command works" (verifiable)

### Step 4: Structure the Prompt

Use this template:

```markdown
# Project: [Project Name]

## Vision
[2-3 sentences describing what this project is and why it exists]

## Technical Specifications
- **Language**: [e.g., TypeScript, Python, Go]
- **Framework**: [e.g., Express, FastAPI, none]
- **Database**: [e.g., PostgreSQL, SQLite, none]
- **Testing**: [e.g., Jest, pytest, go test]
- **Build**: [e.g., npm, poetry, go build]

## Core Features
1. [Feature 1]: [Brief description]
2. [Feature 2]: [Brief description]
3. [Feature 3]: [Brief description]
[...]

## Non-Goals
- [Explicit exclusion 1]
- [Explicit exclusion 2]

## Progress Tracking
Update after each phase:
```
PROJECT PROGRESS:
Phase 0 (Setup): [COMPLETE/IN PROGRESS]
Phase 1 (Architecture): [COMPLETE/IN PROGRESS/NOT STARTED]
Phase 2 (Core): [COMPLETE/IN PROGRESS/NOT STARTED]
Phase 3 (Features): [COMPLETE/IN PROGRESS/NOT STARTED]
Phase 4 (Testing): [COMPLETE/IN PROGRESS/NOT STARTED]
Phase 5 (Documentation): [COMPLETE/IN PROGRESS/NOT STARTED]

Current Phase: [X]
Overall: [description of state]
```

## If Stuck
After multiple iterations on same issue:
1. Document the specific blocker
2. List what approaches have been tried
3. Identify the root cause if possible
4. Consider if feature should be descoped (but DO NOT skip without documenting)
5. Do NOT output false promise - continue or wait for max-iterations
```

## Example: REST API Project

**Input:**
- Project: Todo List REST API
- Tech: Node.js, Express, TypeScript, SQLite
- Features: CRUD todos, user auth, categories, due dates
- Promise: TODO_API_COMPLETE

**Generated Prompt:**

```markdown
# Project: Todo List REST API

## Vision

## Technical Specifications
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Framework**: Express.js
- **Database**: SQLite with better-sqlite3
- **Testing**: Jest with supertest
- **Build**: npm with tsc

## Core Features

2. **Todo CRUD**: Create, read, update, delete todo items
3. **Categories**: Organize todos by category
4. **Due Dates**: Set and track due dates with overdue detection
5. **Filtering**: Filter todos by status, category, due date

## Non-Goals

  http://localhost:3000/auth/signup

# Login and use token for todos
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@test.com","password":"password123"}' \
  http://localhost:3000/auth/login | jq -r '.token')

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:3000/todos
```

### Deliverables
- [ ] Categories CRUD works
- [ ] Todos can be assigned to categories
- [ ] Due dates stored and validated
- [ ] GET /todos/overdue returns overdue items
- [ ] Filtering by query params works

---

## Phase 4: Testing

npm run lint
npm run build
npm test -- --coverage
npm start  # Manual smoke test
```

## Completion
When all phases verified and:
- All tests passing with ≥80% coverage
- All endpoints working
- Documentation complete

Output: <promise>TODO_API_COMPLETE</promise>
```

## Best Practices

### Project Scope
- Define clear boundaries (non-goals)
- Start smaller than you think necessary
- Add features incrementally

### Phase Management
- Complete phases in order
- Don't skip testing phase
- Document checkpoints

### Verification
- Include actual commands to run
- Make success criteria binary
- Automate where possible

### DO:
- Define clear project scope
- Use all 6 phases
- Include verification commands
- Set realistic feature scope
- Document progress at checkpoints

### DON'T:
- Skip architectural phase
- Rush to implementation
- Leave testing for "later"
- Scope creep mid-project
- Output promise before documentation

## Integration with Ralph Loop

```bash
/ralph-wiggum:ralph-loop "[paste generated prompt]" --completion-promise "YOUR_PROMISE" --max-iterations 100
```

**Recommended iterations by project size:**
- Small project (CLI tool, simple API): `--max-iterations 60-80`
- Medium project (Full API with auth): `--max-iterations 100-150`
- Large project (Multi-feature app): `--max-iterations 150-200`

**Tip:** For large projects, consider splitting into multiple Ralph sessions:
1. First session: Phases 0-2 (Setup through Core)
2. Second session: Phases 3-5 (Features through Polish)
