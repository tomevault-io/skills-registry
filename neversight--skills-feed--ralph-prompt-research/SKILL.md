# Ralph Prompt Generator: Research & Analysis

## Overview

Generates structured prompts for research, analysis, and planning tasks using the Ralph Wiggum technique. These prompts define clear research methodology, required sources, synthesis requirements, and concrete deliverables rather than code.

**Best For:**
- Codebase analysis and audits
- Security vulnerability assessments
- Technology research and comparison
- Migration planning
- Architecture design documents
- Performance analysis
- Dependency audits
- Documentation generation from code

**Ralph Philosophy**: This generator embraces the principle that failures are deterministic and fixable. Each research iteration builds on previous findings. Don't fear incomplete first passes—they're expected and provide data for deeper analysis in subsequent iterations.

## Quick Start

**Input Required:**
1. Research objective (what you need to understand/analyze)
2. Scope (what to include/exclude)
3. Deliverable format (report, plan, document)
4. Completion promise

**Generate prompt with:**
```
Generate a Ralph research prompt for:
Objective: [What to research/analyze]
Scope: [What's included]
Deliverable: [What to produce]
Promise: [COMPLETION_PHRASE]
```

## Prompt Generation Workflow

### Step 1: Define Research Scope

**Research Definition Template:**
```markdown
OBJECTIVE: [What question to answer or what to analyze]
SCOPE:
  Include: [What's in scope]
  Exclude: [What's explicitly out of scope]
SOURCES: [Where to look for information]
DELIVERABLE: [What artifact to produce]
SUCCESS: [How to know research is complete]
```

### Step 2: Map Research Phases

Standard research phases:

| Phase | Name | Purpose | Deliverable |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | Discovery | Identify what exists | Inventory/map |
| 2 | Analysis | Deep dive into findings | Analysis notes |
| 3 | Synthesis | Draw conclusions | Findings summary |
| 4 | Recommendations | Actionable next steps | Recommendation doc |
| 5 | Documentation | Final deliverable | Complete report |

### Step 3: Define Completion Criteria

**Research completion criteria must be:**
- Based on coverage (examined all relevant items)
- Based on depth (sufficient analysis per item)
- Based on deliverable completeness (all sections written)

**Examples:**
| Research Type | Completion Criteria |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Security audit | All OWASP categories checked, all findings documented |
| Codebase analysis | All modules examined, architecture documented |
| Tech comparison | All options evaluated against all criteria |
| Migration plan | All systems inventoried, migration steps defined |

### Step 4: Structure the Prompt

Use this template:

```markdown
# Research: [Research Title]

## Objective
[Clear statement of what this research aims to answer or analyze]

## Scope

### In Scope
- [Item 1 to analyze]
- [Item 2 to analyze]
- [Item 3 to analyze]

### Out of Scope

### Research Methodology
- Define scope explicitly (what's in/out)
- Use consistent analysis framework
- Document evidence for conclusions
- Separate findings from opinions

### Deliverables
- Create artifacts as you go
- Use consistent format
- Include data to support conclusions
- Make recommendations actionable

### DO:
- Define clear scope boundaries
- Create deliverables at each phase
- Support conclusions with evidence
- Provide actionable recommendations
- Track progress systematically

### DON'T:
- Skip the discovery phase
- Make recommendations without evidence
- Leave sections incomplete
- Output promise before documentation

## Integration with Ralph Loop

```bash

```

**Recommended iterations by research complexity:**
- Simple audit (single module): `--max-iterations 30-40`
- Comparison (3-5 options): `--max-iterations 40-60`
- Full codebase analysis: `--max-iterations 70-100`
- Complex planning: `--max-iterations 60-80`
