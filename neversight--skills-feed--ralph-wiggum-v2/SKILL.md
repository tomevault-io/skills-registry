# Ralph Wiggum v2 - Autonomous TDD Development Loop

## Quick Start

```
/ralph-wiggum-v2:ralph-loop --project "diablo-starcraft" --completion-promise "DIABLO_STARCRAFT_COMPLETE"
```

## Overview

Autonomous TDD development loop that uses parallel agent swarms to review code, discover issues, and fix them with test-first methodology until convergence criteria are met.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Discovery & Initialization

1. **Locate or create state file**: `{project}/.ralph/state.json`
2. **Locate or create categories file**: `{project}/.ralph/categories.json`
3. **Bootstrap categories** from codebase structure if empty

### Phase 2: Parallel Agent Review Swarm

Spawn 3-5 parallel agents with:
- Random category (weighted toward lowest scores)
- Random subcategory within that category
- Random review style (never same as last 3 used)
- Unique focus area (no overlap between agents)

### Phase 3: TDD Implementation Cycle

For each finding:
1. Write failing test first
2. Implement minimal fix
3. Verify test passes
4. Update state

### Phase 4: Category Evolution

After each iteration:
1. Merge new discoveries
2. Recalculate scores
3. Meta-review (every 5 iterations)

### Phase 5: Convergence Detection

Complete when:
- 10 consecutive clean iterations
- All category scores >= 95/100
- All tests passing
- Game runs without crashes

## Review Styles

### Code Quality
| Style | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| NITPICKER | Formatting, naming, tiny inconsistencies |
| REFACTORER | Duplication, abstraction opportunities |
| DRY_ENFORCER | Copy-paste code, repeated patterns |

| API_PURIST | Interface design, contracts, signatures |

### Reliability
| Style | Focus |
|-------|-------|

| ERROR_HANDLER | Missing try/catch, unhandled promises |
| STATE_MACHINE_ANALYST | Invalid state transitions |
| CONCURRENCY_EXPERT | Race conditions, async bugs |
| MEMORY_LEAK_HUNTER | Listeners not removed, growing arrays |

### Performance
| Style | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| PERFORMANCE_HAWK | O(n²), unnecessary renders, hot paths |
| ALLOCATION_AUDITOR | Object churn, GC pressure |
| RENDER_OPTIMIZER | DOM thrashing, layout thrashing |

### Security
| Style | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| SECURITY_AUDITOR | XSS, injection, unsafe operations |

### Architecture
| Style | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| ARCHITECT | Coupling, cohesion, separation of concerns |
| DEPENDENCY_AUDITOR | Circular deps, tight coupling |
| LAYER_GUARDIAN | Layer violations, wrong abstractions |

### Testing
| Style | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| TEST_SKEPTIC | Coverage gaps, weak assertions |
| MUTATION_TESTER | Tests that always pass |
| INTEGRATION_ANALYST | Unit vs integration gaps |

### Game-Specific
| Style | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| DIABLO_VETERAN | ARPG conventions, loot, skills, combat feel |
| STARCRAFT_FAN | Faction identity, unit feel, SC universe |
| GAME_FEEL_EXPERT | Juice, polish, responsiveness |
| BALANCE_DESIGNER | Numbers, progression, fairness |
| PLAYER_PSYCHOLOGY | Motivation, reward loops |
| SPEEDRUNNER | Exploits, sequence breaks |
| COMPLETIONIST | Missing edge cases in content |
| FIRST_TIME_USER | Onboarding, confusion points |

### Meta
| Style | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| FRESH_EYES | What would confuse a new developer? |
| DOCUMENTATION_STICKLER | Missing/wrong comments |
| FUTURE_MAINTAINER | Technical debt accumulation |

}
```

## Hard Requirements

- [ ] **PLAYABLE_LOCAL** - Runs in browser, playable start-to-finish
- [ ] **TDD_ENFORCED** - No fix without failing test first
- [ ] **ZERO_CRASHES** - No unhandled exceptions in any path
- [ ] **ALL_TESTS_PASS** - 100% test suite green
- [ ] **SCORES_95_PLUS** - Every category at 95+/100
- [ ] **CLEAN_CONVERGENCE** - 10 consecutive clean iterations

---

## Iteration Loop

```
LOOP:
  1. Load state from .ralph/state.json
  2. Load categories from .ralph/categories.json
  3. Increment iteration counter
  4. Select 3-5 lowest-scoring categories for review
  5. Spawn parallel review agents (use Task tool)
  6. Collect findings from all agents
  7. Sort findings by severity (critical → major → minor)
  8. TDD fix each finding:
     a. Write failing test
     b. Implement minimal fix
     c. Verify test passes
     d. Run full test suite
  9. Update scores and state
  10. Check convergence criteria:
      - All agents returned cleanReview: true?
      - No critical/major findings?
      - All tests passing?
      - No new categories discovered?
  11. IF clean: consecutiveCleanIterations++
      IF dirty: consecutiveCleanIterations = 0
  12. IF consecutiveCleanIterations >= 10 AND all scores >= 95:
      → CONVERGED: Run final verification
      ELSE: → Continue loop
```

---

## Final Verification

When convergence criteria met:
1. Full test suite run
2. TypeScript strict mode check
3. Build production bundle
4. Verify game loads and plays
5. Generate completion report
6. Output: `{COMPLETION_PROMISE}` achieved
