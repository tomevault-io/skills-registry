# Random Encounter Generator

Generate encounter: $ARGUMENTS

## Overview

Creates contextually appropriate random encounters by:
1. Using existing world entities (creatures, NPCs, locations)
2. Matching encounter difficulty to party level
3. Generating varied encounter types (combat, social, exploration)
4. Optionally creating encounter tables for locations

## Instructions

### Step 1: Parse Arguments

Extract from `$ARGUMENTS`:
- **Location:** Where the encounter occurs (entity name, region, terrain type)
- **Party Level:** Average party level (1-20) - ask if not provided
- **Encounter Type:** combat, social, exploration, or random
- **World:** Which world to pull entities from

If location is a world entity, read it for context.
If location is a terrain type (forest, road, city), use as context.

### Step 2: Gather World Context

If a specific world is identifiable:
1. Scan `Worlds/[World Name]/Creatures/` for available monsters
2. Scan `Worlds/[World Name]/Characters/` for NPCs
3. Read location entity for specific inhabitants/dangers mentioned
4. Note regional factions, tensions, environmental hazards

### Step 3: Determine Encounter Parameters

#### Difficulty by Party Level

| Party Level | Easy CR | Medium CR | Hard CR | Deadly CR |
|-------------|---------|-----------|---------|-----------|
| 1-4 | 1/4-1/2 | 1-2 | 3-4 | 5+ |
| 5-8 | 1-3 | 4-6 | 7-9 | 10+ |
| 9-12 | 4-6 | 7-10 | 11-13 | 14+ |
| 13-16 | 7-10 | 11-14 | 15-17 | 18+ |
| 17-20 | 10-14 | 15-18 | 19-21 | 22+ |

#### Encounter Types by Location

| Location Type | Combat % | Social % | Exploration % |
|---------------|----------|----------|---------------|
| City/Town | 20% | 60% | 20% |
| Road/Trade Route | 40% | 40% | 20% |
| Wilderness | 60% | 15% | 25% |
| Dungeon | 70% | 10% | 20% |
