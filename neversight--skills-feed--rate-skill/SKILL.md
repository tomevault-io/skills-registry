# Rate Skill

## Overview

Audit SKILL.md files against quality standards from generate-skill best practices. Provides letter grade (A-F) and actionable recommendations.

**Core principle:** Measure skill quality objectively to improve activation reliability and context efficiency.

## When to Use

**Always use when:**
- Reviewing skills before publishing
- Validating skill structure and formatting
- Checking if skill meets quality standards
- User asks to "rate", "grade", or "review" a skill

**Useful for:**
- Skill authors validating their work
- Maintainers reviewing PRs with new skills
- Quality audits of skill repositories
- Before submitting skills to marketplaces

**Avoid when:**
- Evaluating non-skill documentation
- Reviewing code (not skill definitions)
- General code quality auditing

## How It Works

1. Read specified SKILL.md file
2. Evaluate against quality criteria
3. Calculate scores per category
4. Generate letter grade (A-F)
5. Output findings with priorities
6. Provide actionable recommendations

## Findings by Priority

### ❌ Critical Issues
1. **Length: 742 lines without progressive disclosure**
   - Impact: High context usage, harder to scan
   - Fix: Move detailed content to reference/ directory

2. **Only 2 trigger phrases in description**
   - Impact: Poor activation reliability
   - Fix: Add 3-5 specific user phrases and situations

### ⚠️ Important Issues
1. **Verbose mode descriptions (30+ lines each)**
   - Impact: Reduced scannability
   - Fix: Condense to 2-3 lines per mode

2. **Redundant format in examples**
   - Impact: Wastes context tokens
   - Fix: Reference Format section instead of repeating

### 📋 Recommendations
1. Add 2-3 more troubleshooting entries
2. Improve paragraph breaks for scannability

## Strengths
- Good structure with required sections
- Examples use Good/Bad pattern correctly

## Recommendations
1. Implement progressive disclosure (move 200+ lines to reference/)
2. Add 3+ trigger phrases to description
3. Condense verbose sections
4. Remove redundant content

## Estimated Improvements
- Fix critical issues: +12 points → 86 (B)
- Address important issues: +4 points → 90 (A)
- Potential grade: C → A
```

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Can't find SKILL.md file

**Cause:** Path incorrect or file doesn't exist.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify file exists
ls skills/skill-name/SKILL.md

# Use correct path
/rate-skill skills/skill-name/SKILL.md
```

### Problem: Rating seems too harsh

**Cause:** Standards are strict for good reason - quality matters for activation.

**Solution:**
- Review specific findings
- Compare to high-quality skills
- Focus on critical issues first
- Remember: B grade is still "good"

### Problem: Grade improved but still low

**Cause:** Multiple categories need attention.

**Solution:**
- Focus on highest-weight categories first (Length, Conciseness)
- Fix critical issues before nice-to-haves
- Re-rate after each major change
- Use "Estimated Improvements" as roadmap

### Problem: Don't know how to fix an issue

**Cause:** Fix recommendation unclear.

**Solution:**
- Check generate-skill examples for patterns
- Review high-rated skills for reference
- Ask for specific help on that issue
- Consult CLAUDE.md for SkillBox guidelines

## Integration

**This skill works with:**
- **generate-skill** - Use after generating to validate quality
- **Skill development workflow** - Rate before committing/publishing
- **Quality control** - Gate for accepting skills into repositories
- **Continuous improvement** - Track quality metrics over time

**Workflow:**
```bash
# Create skill
/generate-skill new-feature

# Rate it
/rate-skill skills/new-feature/SKILL.md

# Fix issues
[make improvements]

# Re-rate
/rate-skill skills/new-feature/SKILL.md

# When A or B grade, publish
git add skills/new-feature/
git commit -m "Add new-feature skill"
```

**Quality gates:**
- A-B: Merge to main ✅
- C: Request changes ⚠️
- D-F: Reject until improved ❌

## Scoring Algorithm

**Category scores:**
1. Length: Line count + progressive disclosure
2. Conciseness: Paragraph length + info density
3. Repetitiveness: Duplicate content detection
4. Structure: Section presence + organization
5. Triggers: Count + quality of trigger phrases
6. Examples: Count + Good/Bad presence
7. Troubleshooting: Entry count + completeness

**Weight application:**
```
Total = (Length × 0.20) + (Conciseness × 0.20) + (Repetitiveness × 0.15)
      + (Structure × 0.15) + (Triggers × 0.15) + (Examples × 0.10)
      + (Troubleshooting × 0.05)
```

**Grade assignment:**
- 90-100: A
- 80-89: B
- 70-79: C
- 60-69: D
- 0-59: F
