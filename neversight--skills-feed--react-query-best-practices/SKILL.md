# React Query Best Practices

> **Important:** This guide targets **React Query v4**. Some patterns may differ in v5.

Comprehensive guide for React Query v4 (TanStack Query) based on TkDodo's authoritative blog series. Contains 24 rules across 7 categories, prioritized by impact.

## When to Apply

Reference these guidelines when:
- Implementing new queries or mutations
- Integrating WebSockets with React Query
- Setting up query invalidation patterns
- Debugging React Query behavior
- Optimizing render performance
- TypeScript integration questions

## Rule Categories by Priority

| Priority | Category | Impact | Prefix |
|----------|----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Query Keys & Patterns | CRITICAL | `query-` |
| 2 | Mutations & Updates | CRITICAL | `mutation-` |
| 3 | Caching Strategy | HIGH | `cache-` |
| 4 | WebSocket Integration | HIGH | `websocket-` |
| 5 | TypeScript Integration | MEDIUM | `typescript-` |
| 6 | Testing Patterns | MEDIUM | `testing-` |
| 7 | Common Pitfalls | MEDIUM | `troubleshoot-` |
| 8 | Migration to v5 | HIGH | `migration-` |

## Quick Reference

### 1. Query Keys & Patterns (CRITICAL)

- `query-keys-as-dependencies` - Include all queryFn params in queryKey
- `query-key-factory` - Use factory pattern for consistent key generation
- `query-select-transforms` - Use select option for data transformations
- `query-status-check-order` - Check data first, then error, then loading
- `query-tracked-properties` - Only destructure properties you use
- `query-placeholder-vs-initial` - Know when to use each approach
- `query-dependent-enabled` - Use enabled option for dependent queries

### 2. Mutations & Updates (CRITICAL)

- `mutation-prefer-mutate` - Use mutate() with callbacks over mutateAsync()
- `mutation-invalidation` - Invalidate queries after mutations
- `mutation-direct-cache-update` - Update cache directly when appropriate
- `mutation-optimistic-updates` - Show success immediately, rollback on failure
- `mutation-callback-separation` - Query logic in hook, UI effects in component

### 3. Caching Strategy (HIGH)

- `cache-stale-time` - Set appropriate staleTime for your domain
- `cache-refetch-triggers` - Keep refetch triggers enabled in production

### 4. WebSocket Integration (HIGH)

- `websocket-event-invalidation` - Use events to trigger invalidation
- `websocket-stale-time-infinity` - Set staleTime: Infinity for WS-managed data
- `websocket-reconnection` - Invalidate stale queries on reconnect

### 5. TypeScript Integration (MEDIUM)

- `typescript-infer-dont-specify` - Let TypeScript infer, type the queryFn
- `typescript-zod-validation` - Use Zod for runtime validation

### 6. Testing Patterns (MEDIUM)

- `testing-fresh-client` - Create fresh QueryClient per test
- `testing-msw-mocking` - Use MSW for network mocking

### 7. Common Pitfalls (MEDIUM)

- `troubleshoot-copy-to-state` - Never copy query data to local state
- `troubleshoot-missing-key-deps` - Include all dependencies in query key
- `troubleshoot-fetch-not-reject` - Handle HTTP errors with fetch

### 8. Migration to v5 (HIGH)

- `migration-cache-time-to-gc-time` - cacheTime renamed to gcTime
- `migration-query-callbacks-removed` - onSuccess/onError/onSettled removed from useQuery
- `migration-suspense-hooks` - New useSuspenseQuery, useSuspenseInfiniteQuery hooks

## Core Mental Model

1. **React Query is NOT a data fetching library** - it's an async state manager
2. **Server state != Client state** - never mix them in global state managers
3. **Stale-while-revalidate** - show cached data immediately, fetch in background
4. **Query keys are dependencies** - include all variables used in queryFn

## How to Use

Read individual rule files for detailed explanations and code examples:

```
rules/query-key-factory.md
rules/mutation-invalidation.md
rules/websocket-event-invalidation.md
```

Each rule file contains:
- Brief explanation of why it matters
- Incorrect code example
- Correct code example
