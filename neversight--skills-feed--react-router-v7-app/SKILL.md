# React Router v7 App Implementation

## 1. Route Structure
- Use file-based routing in `app/routes/`.
- Route files: `route.tsx` for route components.
- Use underscore prefix for route groups: `_app`, `_landing`.
- Use dot notation for nested routes: `users.$id.tsx`.

## 2. Data Loading Patterns
- Use `loader` functions for server-side data fetching.
- Use `action` functions for form submissions and mutations.
- Leverage `useLoaderData()` and `useActionData()` hooks.
- Handle loading states with `useNavigation()`.

## 3. Route Component Structure
Use arrow functions for all exports.

```typescript
import type { Route } from './+types/route';

export const loader = async ({ request, params, context }: Route.LoaderArgs) => {
  // Server-side data loading
  // Return an object
  return { ... };
};

export const action = async ({ request, params, context }: Route.ActionArgs) => {
  // Handle form submissions and mutations
  // Return an object
  return { ... };
};

const Page = ({ loaderData, actionData }: Route.ComponentProps) => {
  // Component implementation with typed props
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Content */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default Page;
```

## 4. Error Handling
- Use `ErrorBoundary` components for route-level error handling.
- Implement proper error responses in loaders/actions.
- Use `isRouteErrorResponse()` for typed error handling.

## 5. Meta and Headers
- Export `meta` function for dynamic page metadata.
- Export `headers` function for custom HTTP headers.
- Use proper SEO practices with meta tags.

## 6. Project Structure

The `app` folder should follow this structure:

```sh
public                # Static files (images, fonts, etc.)
|
app
|
+-- components        # Shared components
|
+-- config            # Global configuration and environment variables
|
+-- constants         # Global constants
|
+-- hooks             # Shared hooks
|
+-- lib               # Pre-configured reusable libraries
|
+-- routes            # React Router routing directory
|
+-- stores            # Global state stores
|
+-- testing           # Test utilities and mock servers
|
+-- types             # Base types used across the application
|
+-- utils             # Shared utility functions
|
```

### app/components

```sh
app/components
|
+-- shadcn
|   |
|   +-- ui              # shadcn/ui components
|       |
|       +-- button.tsx
|       ...
|
```

### routes

Use collocation to group files related to layouts and pages.

```sh
app/routes/_app._index
|
+-- assets      # Feature-specific static files
|
+-- components  # Feature-scoped components
|
+-- constants   # Feature-specific constants
|
+-- hooks       # Feature-scoped hooks
|
+-- services    # Feature services (business logic)
|
+-- stores      # Feature state stores
|
+-- types       # Feature-specific TypeScript types
|
+-- utils       # Feature-specific utility functions
```

Example structure:

```sh
app/routes
|
+-- _app                # App-wide layout & shared files
|   |
|   +-- route.tsx       # Layout file
|   
+-- _app.index          # App top page
|   |
|   +-- route.tsx       # Page file
|   
+-- _app.todos          # (Example) todos layout & shared files
|   |
|   +-- components      # Components used in layout
|   |
|   +-- types           # Types common to todos
|   |
|   +-- route.tsx       # Layout file
|
+-- _app.todos._index   # (Example) todos top page
|   |
|   +-- components      # Components used in page
|   |
|   +-- route.tsx       # Page file
|
+-- _app.todos.$todoId.edit._index  # (Example) todos edit page
|   |
|   +-- components      # Components used in page
|   |
|   +-- hooks           # Hooks used in page
|   |
|   +-- stores          # Stores used in page
|   |
|   +-- route.tsx       # Page file
|
+-- _app.todos.$todoId_.delete      # (Example) todos delete resource route
    |
    +-- route.tsx       # Resource route file
```

## 7. Advanced Routing Patterns

### Nested Routes for UI Segmentation
Use nested routes to split complex pages (e.g., tabs) into independent route modules.
- Parent route renders shared UI and `<Outlet />`.
- Child routes handle their own data loading (`loader`) and mutations (`action`).
- Reduces prop drilling and isolates logic.

Example (Tabs):
- `routes/user.tsx`: Renders tabs navigation and `<Outlet />`.
- `routes/user.profile.tsx`: Renders profile tab content.
- `routes/user.account.tsx`: Renders account tab content.

### Route-based Modals
Manage modal state via URLs instead of `useState`.
- Define the modal as a child route.
- Parent route renders the background UI and `<Outlet />`.
- Modal component renders inside the `<Outlet />` (often using a Dialog component).
- Closing the modal is a navigation action (e.g., `<Link to="..">`).

Example:
- `routes/users.tsx`: Lists users and contains `<Outlet />`.
- `routes/users.new.tsx`: Renders the "Create User" modal.
