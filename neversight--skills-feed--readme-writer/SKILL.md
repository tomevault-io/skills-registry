# README Writer

This skill guides the creation and maintenance of comprehensive, human-friendly README documentation by analyzing the codebase and ensuring documentation stays in sync with actual functionality.

## When to Activate This Skill

Use this skill when:

- Creating a new README.md for a project or package
- Updating an existing README.md after code changes
- Auditing documentation for completeness and accuracy
- Converting sparse documentation into thorough guides
- User asks to "document this package" or "write a README"
- User mentions README in context of a monorepo subdirectory

## When NOT to Use This Skill

Do not activate for:

- API documentation generation (use JSDoc/TSDoc tools)
- Changelog or release notes
- Internal developer notes not meant for README
- Documentation in formats other than Markdown

## How to Use

### Step 1: Locate the README Context

Identify where the README should live. In monorepos, this determines the scope of codebase analysis:

```
project-root/           # README here documents entire monorepo
├── packages/
│   └── my-lib/         # README here documents only my-lib
│       └── README.md
└── README.md
```

### Step 2: Analyze the Codebase

Recursively parse code starting from the README's directory:

1. **Identify entry points**: Look for `index.ts`, `main.ts`, package.json `main`/`exports`
2. **Map public API**: Find all exported functions, classes, types, constants
3. **Trace dependencies**: Understand what the package depends on
4. **Find examples**: Look for `examples/`, test files, or inline usage comments
5. **Check package.json**: Extract scripts, dependencies, peer dependencies

### Step 3: Compare Against Existing README

If a README exists, identify gaps:

- **Missing exports**: Public API not documented
- **Stale examples**: Code samples using deprecated patterns
- **Missing sections**: No installation, no quick start, no API reference
- **Outdated commands**: Wrong package manager, missing scripts

### Step 4: Generate or Update README

Follow the [README Structure](references/readme-structure.md) and apply [Writing Principles](references/writing-principles.md).

Use the [README Template](references/readme-template.md) as a starting point for new READMEs.

## README Workflow Decision Tree

```
Start
  ↓
Does README.md exist?
  ├─ No → Analyze codebase → Generate from template
  └─ Yes → Analyze codebase → Compare with existing
             ↓
         Identify gaps and staleness
             ↓
         Suggest specific changes
             ↓
         Apply updates (with user confirmation)
```

## Key References

Load these as needed for detailed guidance:

- [references/readme-structure.md](references/readme-structure.md) - Section ordering and content requirements
- [references/writing-principles.md](references/writing-principles.md) - How to write human-sounding, thorough docs
- [references/codebase-analysis.md](references/codebase-analysis.md) - How to parse and understand code for documentation
- [references/readme-template.md](references/readme-template.md) - Copy-pasteable template for new READMEs

## Example Trigger Phrases

- "Create a README for this package"
- "Update the README to reflect recent changes"
- "The README is out of date, can you fix it?"
- "Document this library"
- "Write docs for packages/my-lib"
- "This package needs better documentation"

## Required Skills

This skill requires the `humanizer` skill for reviewing generated content.

If `humanizer` is not available:
1. Check Settings > Capabilities to enable it
2. Or invoke it with `/skill humanizer`

The humanizer skill removes AI writing patterns and ensures documentation sounds natural. Without it, generated READMEs may contain robotic language, inflated significance claims, and other AI artifacts.

## Important Notes

### Package Manager Detection

Always use the correct package manager based on lockfiles:

| Lockfile | Package Manager | Install Command |
|----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| `pnpm-lock.yaml` | pnpm | `pnpm install` |
| `package-lock.json` | npm | `npm install` |
| `yarn.lock` | yarn | `yarn` |
| `bun.lockb` | bun | `bun install` |

### Table of Contents

Include a TOC for READMEs over ~200 lines. Place it after the heading area, before the Installation section.

### Human-Sounding Writing

**REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use `humanizer` to review and refine generated README content.

Documentation should sound like it was written by someone who genuinely wants to help. The humanizer skill identifies and removes AI writing patterns including:

- Inflated significance language ("pivotal", "testament", "crucial")
- Promotional/advertisement-like tone
- Superficial -ing analyses
- Vague attributions and weasel words
- Em dash overuse and rule-of-three patterns

After generating README content, apply the humanizer skill to ensure the output sounds natural and human-written. See [references/writing-principles.md](references/writing-principles.md) for additional guidance specific to technical documentation.
