# Refactor & Dead Code Cleaner

Identify and remove dead code, duplicates, and unused exports to keep the codebase lean and maintainable. Safety-first approach with comprehensive documentation.

## Quick Start

Detect project type and run appropriate analysis:

**Node/TypeScript:**
```bash
npx knip                    # unused exports/files/deps
npx depcheck                # unused dependencies
npx ts-prune                # unused exports
```

**Go:**
```bash
go mod tidy                 # remove unused deps
deadcode ./...              # find unreachable code (golang.org/x/tools)
staticcheck ./...           # includes unused code detection
```

**Python:**
```bash
vulture .                   # find dead code
pip-autoremove              # unused dependencies
```

**Java:**
```bash
./mvnw dependency:analyze   # unused dependencies
# Use IDE or SpotBugs for dead code detection
```

## Workflow

### 1. Analysis Phase

Run detection tools and categorize findings:

| Risk Level | Examples | Action |
|------------|----------|--------|
| **SAFE** | Unused exports, unused deps | Remove after grep verify |
| **CAREFUL** | Dynamic imports possible | Manual review required |
| **RISKY** | Public API, shared utils | Do not remove |

### 2. Risk Assessment

For each item to remove:
- Grep for all references (including string patterns)
- Check for dynamic imports
- Verify not part of public API
- Review git history for context

### 3. Safe Removal Process

```
a) Start with SAFE items only
b) Remove one category at a time:
   1. Unused npm dependencies
   2. Unused internal exports
   3. Unused files
   4. Duplicate code
c) Run tests after each batch
d) Commit each batch separately
```

### 4. Document Deletions

Update `docs/DELETION_LOG.md` after each session:

```markdown
## [YYYY-MM-DD] Refactor Session

### Removed
- package-name - Reason
- src/unused-file.ts - Replaced by X

### Impact
- Files: -15, Deps: -5, Lines: -2,300
```

## Safety Rules

**Before removing ANYTHING:**
- [ ] Run detection tools
- [ ] Grep for all references
- [ ] Check dynamic imports
- [ ] Run all tests
- [ ] Create backup branch

**After each removal:**
- [ ] Build succeeds
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] Commit changes
- [ ] Update DELETION_LOG.md

## When NOT to Use

- During active feature development
- Right before production deployment
- Without proper test coverage
- On code you don't understand

## Error Recovery

```bash
# Immediate rollback if something breaks
git revert HEAD

# Reinstall deps and verify (by language)
# Node: npm install && npm run build && npm test
# Go:   go mod download && go build ./... && go test ./...
# Python: pip install -r requirements.txt && pytest
# Java: ./mvnw clean install
```

Then investigate: Was it a dynamic import/reflection? Update "DO NOT REMOVE" list.
