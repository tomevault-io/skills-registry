# Refactoring Catalog

Systematic techniques for improving code structure without changing its observable behavior. Based on Martin Fowler's Refactoring Catalog.

## Composing Methods

### Extract Function

**Smell**: Function body is as clear as its name  
**Action**: Replace calls with the function body and remove the function  
**Cookbook**: [inline-function.md](./cookbook/inline-function.md)

### Extract Variable

**Smell**: Complex expression that's hard to understand  
**Action**: Place the result in a temporary variable with a meaningful name
