# Reflect Skill

Analyze conversations to extract corrections, preferences, and best practices, then persist them to skill files. Supports manual triggering, automatic hooks, and Git versioning.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/reflect` | Analyze current session and propose skill updates |
| `/reflect [skill-name]` | Reflect and update a specific skill |
| `reflect on` | Enable automatic reflection via stop hook |
| `reflect off` | Disable automatic reflection |
| `reflect status` | Show current reflection mode |

## Manual Reflection Flow

### 1. Analyze Session for Signals

Scan the conversation and categorize by confidence:

**HIGH Confidence** - Explicit corrections
- "No, use X instead of Y"
- "Never [action] in this project"  
- "Always check for [condition]"

**MEDIUM Confidence** - Success patterns
- Approaches that worked after iteration
- Patterns user approved or praised

**LOW Confidence** - Observations
- Implied preferences
- Patterns to review later

### 2. Present Review & Approval

```
📊 Signals Detected:

HIGH CONFIDENCE:
- "Never generate button styles - reference existing components"
- "Always check for SQL injections"

MEDIUM CONFIDENCE:
- Arrow functions preferred for callbacks

LOW CONFIDENCE:
- Prefers concise explanations

📝 Proposed Changes to [skill-name].md:

+ ## Security
+ - Always validate database queries for SQL injection
+
+ ## Code Style  
+ - Never generate UI components; reference existing library

💬 Commit message: "Add SQL injection and UI component rules"

Accept changes? [Y/n/edit with natural language]
```

User options:
- `Y` - Accept all changes
- `n` - Reject
- Natural language: "Remove the arrow function one" or "Change the wording to..."

### 3. Update Skill & Commit

1. Locate target skill file (project or `~/.claude/skills/`)
2. Merge new learnings (newer rules override conflicts)
3. If Git repo: stage, commit with message, push

## Automatic Reflection

### Toggle Commands

```bash
reflect on      # Enable auto-reflection on session end
reflect off     # Disable auto-reflection
reflect status  # Check current mode
```

### How It Works

When enabled, the stop hook triggers automatic learning:

1. Session ends → stop hook fires
2. Analyzes conversation for learnings
3. Updates skill file (shows notification: "Learned from session: [skill-name]")
4. Commits to Git if configured

### Hook Configuration

The session-end hook is **auto-registered** when you install this plugin. No manual configuration needed.

State stored in `~/.claude/.reflect-state` (enabled/disabled).

## Git Integration

Version your skills to track evolution over time:

```bash
cd ~/.claude/skills
git init
git remote add origin <your-repo>
```

Benefits:
- See how skills evolve with each learning
- Rollback if a learning causes regressions  
- Track system improvement over time

## Learning Categories

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Code Style | Naming conventions, formatting |
| Security | Input validation, SQL injection |
| Testing | Coverage requirements, edge cases |
| API Design | Endpoint conventions, responses |
| UI/UX | Component usage, accessibility |
| Workflow | PR process, commit format |

## Example

```
You: Review the auth module
Claude: [Reviews, misses SQL injection]
You: You missed SQL injection - always check for that

You: /reflect

Claude: 📊 HIGH: "Always check for SQL injections"
        
        📝 Proposed for security-review.md:
        + - Validate all database queries for SQL injection
        
        Accept? [Y/n]

You: Y

Claude: ✅ Updated security-review.md
        📤 Committed: "Add SQL injection validation rule"
```

Next session: Claude automatically checks for SQL injection.

## Goal

**Correct once, never again.** Build a self-improving system where learnings persist and compound over time.
