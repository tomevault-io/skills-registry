# Reverse Engineering Perplexity AI APIs

Discover, document, and implement undocumented Perplexity AI endpoints for pplx-sdk.

## When to use

Use this skill when:
- Discovering new API endpoints from perplexity.ai browser traffic
- Decoding request/response payloads from captured cURL commands
- Mapping SSE event types from streaming endpoints
- Extracting auth flows (cookies, tokens, session management)
- Adding new endpoint support to the SDK

## Instructions

### Step 1: Capture Traffic

```
DevTools (F12) → Network → XHR/Fetch
1. Perform action on perplexity.ai
2. Right-click request → Copy as cURL
3. Paste cURL for analysis
```

### Step 2: Decode Payload

Extract from the captured request:
- **URL path** (e.g., `/rest/sse/perplexity.ask`)
- **Method** (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- **Auth** (Bearer token from cookie `pplx.session-id`)
- **Request body** (JSON payload with field names and types)
- **Response format** (JSON, SSE stream, etc.)

### Step 3: Document Schema

For each field in the payload:
- Name, type, required/optional, default value
- What it controls (e.g., `mode: "concise"` = shorter answers)
- Discovered values (e.g., `model_preference` = "pplx-70b-chat" | "pplx-70b-deep")

### Step 4: Map to SDK Architecture

| Discovery | Target | Action |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| New endpoint | `transport/` | Add endpoint constant and method |
| Request fields | `domain/models.py` | Create Pydantic request model |
| Response fields | `domain/models.py` | Create Pydantic response model |
| SSE events | `transport/sse.py` | Add event type to parser |
| Auth variation | `shared/auth.py` | Add extraction method |
| Error codes | `core/exceptions.py` | Map to exception type |

### Step 5: Implement

Create the SDK implementation following the layered architecture:
1. Model in `domain/models.py`
2. Service in `domain/<service>.py`
3. Tests in `tests/test_<service>.py`

## Known API Surface

### Implemented
- `POST /rest/sse/perplexity.ask` — Main query endpoint (SSE streaming)

### Discovered (not yet implemented)
- Thread management (`/rest/threads/`)
- Collections (`/rest/collections/`)
- User profile (`/rest/user/`)
- File upload (`/rest/upload`)
- Sharing (`/rest/share/`)

## Anti-Detection Notes

- Use realistic `User-Agent` headers matching Chrome/Safari
- Include `Referer: https://www.perplexity.ai/` and `Origin` headers
- Consider TLS fingerprinting via curl_cffi with `impersonate="chrome120"`
- Rate limit requests to avoid detection
