# Skill: Review Architecture

## Purpose

Review code for **architecture** concerns only. Do not define scope (diff vs codebase) or perform language/framework/security analysis; those are separate atomic skills. Emit a **findings list** in the standard format for aggregation. Focus on module and layer boundaries, dependency direction, single responsibility, cyclic dependencies, interface stability, and coupling and extension points.

---

## Use Cases

- **Orchestrated review**: Used as a cognitive step when [review-code](../review-code/SKILL.md) runs scope → language → framework → library → cognitive.
- **Architecture-focused review**: When the user wants only boundaries, dependencies, and structure checked.
- **Refactor or onboarding**: Understand and critique current structure for planning or documentation.

**When to use**: When the task includes architecture or design review. Scope and code scope are determined by the caller or user.

---

## Behavior

### Scope of this skill

- **Analyze**: Architecture dimensions in the **given code scope** (files or diff provided by the caller). Do not decide scope; accept the code range as input. For large scope, consider layers or modules and summarize.
- **Do not**: Perform scope selection, language/framework conventions, or security review. Focus only on architecture and structure.

### Review checklist (architecture dimension only)

1. **Module and layer boundaries**: Are module/service boundaries clear? Are layers (e.g. API, domain, data) respected? Do high-level modules avoid depending on low-level details?
2. **Dependency direction**: Do dependencies point in the intended direction (e.g. inward toward domain, or toward stable abstractions)? No reverse or circular dependency direction at module level.
3. **Single responsibility**: Does each module/class have one clear responsibility? Are boundaries cohesive?
4. **Cyclic dependencies**: Are there cycles between modules, packages, or components? Suggest break points (e.g. extract interface, move shared code).
5. **Interface stability**: Are public APIs and interfaces stable and minimal? Are implementation details leaking across boundaries?
6. **Coupling and extension points**: Is coupling to concrete types or frameworks minimized where extension is expected? Are extension points (e.g. plugins, strategies) clear?

### Tone and references

- **Professional and technical**: Reference specific locations (file, module, or package). Emit findings with Location, Category, Severity, Title, Description, Suggestion.

---

## Input & Output

### Input

- **Code scope**: Files or directories (or diff) already selected by the user or scope skill. This skill does not decide scope; it reviews the provided code for architecture only.

### Output

- Emit zero or more **findings** in the format defined in **Appendix: Output contract**.
- Category for this skill is **cognitive-architecture**.

---

## Restrictions

- **Do not** perform scope selection, language, framework, or security review. Stay within architecture dimensions.
- **Do not** give conclusions without specific locations or actionable suggestions.
- **Do not** assume a specific architecture style (e.g. clean/hexagonal) unless the project states it; evaluate against general boundaries and dependency principles.

---

## Self-Check

- [ ] Was only the architecture dimension reviewed (no scope/language/security)?
- [ ] Are boundaries, dependency direction, responsibility, cycles, interfaces, and coupling covered where relevant?
- [ ] Is each finding emitted with Location, Category=cognitive-architecture, Severity, Title, Description, and optional Suggestion?
- [ ] Are module/package/file references precise enough to act on?

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Reverse dependency

- **Input**: Domain layer imports from infrastructure (e.g. DB driver) directly.
- **Expected**: Emit a finding for dependency direction; suggest interface in domain and implementation in infrastructure. Category = cognitive-architecture.

### Example 2: Cycle between packages

- **Input**: Package A imports B, B imports C, C imports A.
- **Expected**: Emit finding(s) identifying the cycle and suggest break point (e.g. extract shared interface or type to a neutral package). Category = cognitive-architecture.

### Edge case: Small or single-file scope

- **Input**: Single file or very small module.
- **Expected**: Review internal structure (responsibility, coupling to external types); if scope is too small for module-level concerns, state that and emit only findings that apply (e.g. single responsibility, interface clarity).

---

## Appendix: Output contract

Each finding MUST follow the standard findings format:

| Element | Requirement |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Location** | `path/to/file.ext` or module/package name (optional line or range). |
| **Category** | `cognitive-architecture`. |
| **Severity** | `critical` \| `major` \| `minor` \| `suggestion`. |
| **Title** | Short one-line summary. |
| **Description** | 1–3 sentences. |
| **Suggestion** | Concrete fix or improvement (optional). |

Example:

```markdown
- **Location**: `pkg/domain/order.go`
- **Category**: cognitive-architecture
- **Severity**: major
- **Title**: Domain imports infrastructure directly
- **Description**: Order service imports DB driver; domain should not depend on infrastructure.
- **Suggestion**: Define repository interface in domain; implement in infrastructure and inject.
```
