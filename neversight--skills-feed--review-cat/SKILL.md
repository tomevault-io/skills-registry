# ReviewCat

Analyze App Store reviews, generate intelligent replies, and extract competitive
insights using Apple's public and private APIs.

## API Access Tiers

ReviewCat works with two tiers of Apple endpoints:

| Tier | Auth | Scope | Reference |
|------|------|-------|-----------|
| **Public** | None | Any app (read-only reviews, search, lookup) | See [apple-endpoints.md](references/apple-endpoints.md) §1 |
| **Private** | JWT (App Store Connect) | Your own apps (full CRUD on reviews + responses) | See [apple-endpoints.md](references/apple-endpoints.md) §2 |

Choose the tier based on the task:

- **Own app** → prefer Private API (more data, filtering, responses, summarizations)
- **Competitor app** → must use Public API (RSS feed, iTunes Search)
- **Quick lookup / no auth available** → Public API

## Workflow 1 — Fetch & Analyze Own App Reviews

1. Generate a JWT token (see [apple-endpoints.md](references/apple-endpoints.md) §2.1)
2. Fetch reviews: `GET /v1/apps/{appId}/customerReviews`
   - Use `sort=-createdDate` for newest first
   - Use `filter[rating]=1,2` to focus on negative reviews
   - Use `filter[territory]=USA` for a specific country
   - Set `limit=200` and paginate via `links.next`
3. For version-specific reviews, first list versions with
   `GET /v1/apps/{appId}/appStoreVersions`, then query
   `GET /v1/appStoreVersions/{versionId}/customerReviews`
4. Run analysis on collected reviews (see [Workflow 5](#workflow-5--analyze-reviews))

## Workflow 2 — Fetch Competitor Reviews

1. Search for competitor: `GET https://itunes.apple.com/search?term={name}&media=software`
2. Extract `trackId` from results
3. Fetch reviews via RSS:
   ```
   GET https://itunes.apple.com/{country}/rss/customerreviews/page={1-10}/id={trackId}/sortby=mostrecent/json
   ```
4. Loop pages 1–10 (max 500 reviews per country)
5. For multi-country analysis, iterate over country codes: `us`, `gb`, `de`, `fr`, `jp`, `au`, `ca`, `br`, `kr`, `cn`
6. Parse entries from `feed.entry[]` — fields: `im:rating.label`, `title.label`, `content.label`, `author.name.label`, `im:version.label`

## Workflow 3 — Generate Replies to Reviews

Generate context-aware, professional developer responses to customer reviews.

### Reply Strategy

| Rating | Tone | Strategy |
|--------|------|----------|
| 1–2 stars | Empathetic, solution-focused | Acknowledge frustration, offer fix/workaround, invite follow-up |
| 3 stars | Grateful, improvement-oriented | Thank for feedback, highlight upcoming improvements |
| 4–5 stars | Warm, brief | Thank the user, reinforce positive experience |

### Instructions

1. Read the review's rating, title, body, and territory
2. Identify the core issue or sentiment
3. Select reply strategy based on rating
4. Draft response following patterns in [reply-templates.md](references/reply-templates.md)
5. Post via `POST /v1/customerReviewResponses` (private API only)

### Constraints

- Max response length: 5,970 characters (Apple's limit)
- Do NOT include personal information, legal promises, or pricing details
- Always be professional — never argue or be defensive
- Reference specific issues the user raised to show the reply is not generic
- For non-English reviews, respond in the same language as the review

## Workflow 4 — Competitor Comparison

Build a competitive analysis comparing your app with competitors.

1. Fetch your app's reviews (Workflow 1) and competitor reviews (Workflow 2)
2. For each app, compute:
   - **Average rating** (overall + per version)
   - **Rating distribution** (count per star)
   - **Sentiment score** — ratio of positive (4–5) to negative (1–2) reviews
   - **Review velocity** — reviews per week/month
3. Run theme extraction on each app's reviews (see Workflow 5)
4. Identify:
   - **Your strengths** — themes praised in your reviews but criticized in competitors
   - **Your gaps** — themes praised in competitors but criticized in your reviews
   - **Common pain points** — negative themes shared across all apps
   - **Feature requests** — features users ask for across all apps
5. Output a structured comparison report (see [analysis-prompts.md](references/analysis-prompts.md) §competitor-report)

## Workflow 5 — Analyze Reviews

Perform deep analysis on a set of collected reviews. See [analysis-prompts.md](references/analysis-prompts.md) for detailed prompt patterns.

### Theme Extraction

Categorize every review into one or more themes:

- **Bug report** — crashes, errors, broken features
- **Feature request** — missing functionality users want
- **UX complaint** — confusing UI, poor navigation, design issues
- **Performance** — slow, battery drain, storage usage
- **Pricing** — subscription cost, value perception, payment issues
- **Praise** — positive feedback on specific features
- **Support** — customer service experience

For each theme, track: count, average rating, representative quotes, trend direction.

### Sentiment Analysis

Classify each review as: `positive`, `neutral`, `negative`, `mixed`.

Use the following signals:
- Rating (primary signal): 1–2 = negative, 3 = neutral/mixed, 4–5 = positive
- Body text sentiment (secondary signal): override rating when text clearly contradicts it
  (e.g., 5-star review that says "app is terrible but I accidentally tapped 5 stars")

### Actionable Insights

From the analyzed reviews, extract:

1. **Top 5 issues** — most mentioned negative themes, sorted by frequency
2. **Top 5 praised features** — most mentioned positive themes
3. **Trending issues** — themes increasing in frequency over recent reviews
4. **Quick wins** — issues that appear fixable and are frequently mentioned
5. **Feature demand** — requested features ranked by mention count

## Workflow 6 — Executive Summary Report

Generate a concise report for stakeholders.

### Report Structure

```
## Review Summary — {App Name} — {Date Range}

### Key Metrics
- Total reviews: {n}
- Average rating: {x.x}/5
- Rating distribution: ★5: {n} | ★4: {n} | ★3: {n} | ★2: {n} | ★1: {n}
- Sentiment: {x}% positive, {x}% neutral, {x}% negative

### Top Issues
1. {Issue} — {count} mentions — "{representative quote}"
2. ...

### Top Praise
1. {Feature} — {count} mentions — "{representative quote}"
2. ...

### Trending
- ↑ Increasing: {themes getting worse}
- ↓ Decreasing: {themes improving}

### Recommendations
1. {Actionable recommendation based on data}
2. ...
```

## Workflow 7 — Rating Trend Monitoring

Track how ratings change over time.

1. Fetch reviews with `sort=createdDate` to get chronological order
2. Group reviews by time period (day/week/month)
3. Compute per-period: average rating, review count, sentiment ratio
4. Identify inflection points — sudden drops/spikes in rating
5. Correlate with app version releases (use `im:version` from RSS or version endpoint from private API)
6. Flag anomalies: rating drop > 0.5 stars, negative review spike > 2x average

## Pagination Reference

### Private API (App Store Connect)

Cursor-based. Follow `links.next` URL until absent:

```python
url = f"https://api.appstoreconnect.apple.com/v1/apps/{app_id}/customerReviews?limit=200&sort=-createdDate"
all_reviews = []
while url:
    resp = requests.get(url, headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"})
    data = resp.json()
    all_reviews.extend(data["data"])
    url = data.get("links", {}).get("next")
```

### Public API (RSS Feed)

Page-based. Iterate pages 1–10:

```python
for page in range(1, 11):
    url = f"https://itunes.apple.com/{country}/rss/customerreviews/page={page}/id={app_id}/sortby=mostrecent/json"
    resp = requests.get(url)
    entries = resp.json().get("feed", {}).get("entry", [])
    if not entries:
        break
    all_reviews.extend(entries)
```

## Rate Limits

| Endpoint | Limit | Backoff Strategy |
|----------|-------|-----------------|
| App Store Connect API | Undocumented — use moderate pace | Exponential backoff on 429/503 |
| iTunes Search / Lookup | ~20 req/min | Wait 3s between calls |
| RSS Feed | Undocumented — can get 403 | Wait 5s between country iterations |
