# SaaS Launch Audit

A comprehensive, repeatable audit workflow for SaaS products approaching launch. Provides clear PASS/FAIL states with single actionable next steps.

## Purpose

Validate launch readiness across 10 critical areas: validation, pricing, payments, AI economics, discovery, competitors, social presence, legal, trust infrastructure, and launch day operations. Incorporates 2026-specific guidance on outcome-based pricing, AI visibility optimization, and modern SaaS metrics.

## Workflow Overview

1. **Discovery Survey** - Gather project context (product type, audience, stage)
2. **Interactive Verification** - Actively verify items using browser tools and web queries
3. **PASS/FAIL Report** - Output each item with status and next step for failures
4. **Iterate** - Re-run audit after fixes until all items pass

## Discovery Survey

Before running the checklist, gather project context. Use AskUserQuestion:

**Questions to ask:**
1. Product type: B2B SaaS, B2C, Developer Tool, Marketplace, or Other?
2. Target audience/ICP: Who is the primary customer?
3. Current stage: Pre-MVP, Beta/Early Access, or Ready to Launch?
4. Does the product use AI/ML that affects unit economics?
5. Primary domain/URL to audit (if live)

**Platform recommendations based on product type:**
- **Developer Tools**: GitHub, Hacker News, Reddit, X, Dev.to
- **B2B SaaS**: LinkedIn, Product Hunt, G2/Capterra
- **B2C/Consumer**: X, TikTok, Instagram, YouTube
- **Indie Hacker**: Product Hunt, Indie Hackers, X, Reddit

## Audit Checklist (10 Sections)

### 1. Pre-Launch Validation

| Item | Verification Method |
|------|---------------------|
| 50+ discovery calls completed | Ask user |
| Pre-payment secured from 3+ customers | Ask user |
| Problem validated (not just interest) | Ask user for evidence |
| Manual service delivery tested | Ask user |

### 2. Pricing Strategy

Consult `references/pricing-2026.md` for detailed guidance.

| Item | Verification Method |
|------|---------------------|
| Pricing model selected (outcome/usage/hybrid) | Ask user, verify NOT per-seat only |
| Value metric identified | Ask user what outcome they charge for |

### 4. AI Economics (if applicable)

Consult `references/metrics-2026.md` for AI-first metrics.

| Item | Verification Method |
|------|---------------------|

## Key 2026 Insights (Research-Verified)

Embedded throughout this audit:

1. **Pricing**: Per-seat is declining (126% YoY growth in credit models). Use outcome-based or hybrid models. Note: pendulum swinging back toward simplicity.
2. **AI Economics**: Target AI costs < 30% of revenue. Traditional SaaS: 80-90% margins. AI-first: 50-65% margins.
3. **Discovery**: AI agents now ~33% of organic search. Only 12% of companies appear across all AI platforms. Server response < 200ms critical.
4. **Trust**: Trust-as-a-Product is a differentiator, not just compliance.
5. **Product Hunt**: 26.5% of launches get 500-1000 users. 49% fail by relying on PH alone. Warm outreach > cold DMs.
