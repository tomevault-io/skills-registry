# SaaS Launch Planner

## Purpose

Transform validated ideas into concrete, executable plans for building SaaS products in 3-4 weeks. Ensures subscription-first design, prevents scope creep, and prioritizes shipping fast to validate with paying customers.

---

## Core Principles

1. **Ship Fast, Validate with Paying Users** - 3-4 weeks to working product that users can pay for
2. **Subscription-First Mindset** - SaaS = recurring revenue, build for retention not just acquisition
3. **No Feature Creep** - Only core loop features in MVP, "nice to have" goes post-MVP
4. **Next.js + Supabase + Stripe Optimized** - Use proven stack's strengths, don't reinvent
5. **Revenue-Focused Building** - Every feature must answer "Who will pay?" and "What problem does this solve?"

---

## Planning Workflow

### Phase 1: Problem & Market Definition

**Required Information:**
- **Problem**: One sentence describing what problem you're solving
- **Current Solution**: How people solve this today (and why it sucks)
- **Willingness to Pay**: Evidence people would pay for better solution
- **Target Customer**: Precise description with pain level (1-10) and budget
- **Market Size**: >10k potential customers minimum

**Validation Checklist:**
- [ ] Talked to 10+ potential customers
- [ ] They currently pay for similar solutions
- [ ] This is a painkiller (must-have) not vitamin (nice-to-have)
- [ ] You can reach customers within budget
- [ ] Market size is large enough

---

### Phase 2: Pricing Strategy Selection

**Decision Tree:**
```
IF product requires teams → Per-Seat Pricing ($X/user/month)
ELSE IF usage varies greatly → Usage-Based Pricing ($base + $per-use)
ELSE IF clear feature differentiation → Tiered Pricing (Starter/Pro/Enterprise)
ELSE IF need viral growth → Freemium (free + paid)
```

**MVP Recommendation: Tiered Pricing (2-3 tiers maximum)**

**Standard MVP Pricing:**
- **Starter**: $29/month - Core features, single user, email support
- **Pro**: $79/month - All features, multiple users, priority support
- **Enterprise**: Custom - Post-MVP

**Trial Strategy:**
- **Recommended**: 14-day free trial (no credit card required)
- **Alternative**: 7-day trial (credit card required)
- **Goal**: 10-15% trial-to-paid conversion

**See references/PRICING_STRATEGIES.md for complete pricing models and optimization tactics.**

---

### Phase 3: Core User Loop Definition

**Template:**
```
Discovery & Signup:
1. User lands on landing page → Sees value proposition
2. User starts free trial → Creates account
3. User completes onboarding → First value within 5 minutes

Core Value Loop:
4. User [action 1] → System [response 1]
5. User [action 2] → System [response 2]
→ Value Delivered: [What user achieves]

Subscription Conversion:
7. Trial ending reminder → Upgrade prompt
8. User adds payment → Stripe Checkout
9. Subscription activated → Full access granted
10. User continues using → Retention tracked

Success Metrics:
- Activation: 60%+ users complete key action within 24h
- Conversion: 10-15% trial users become paying
- Retention: 85%+ paid users stay active monthly
```

---

### Phase 4: MVP Scope Definition

**Must Have Criteria:**
- ✅ Essential for core functionality
- ✅ Users can't get value without it
- ✅ Can be implemented in 3-5 days
- ✅ No complex 3rd party integrations
- ✅ Directly impacts conversion or retention

**SaaS-Specific Must Haves:**
- User authentication (email + social login)
- Basic subscription management
- Stripe payment integration
- Core feature set (2-3 main features only)
- User dashboard
- Basic settings page

**Post-MVP Features (Not Now):**
- Advanced analytics
- Team collaboration
- Mobile apps
- API access
- Integrations (Zapier, Slack)
- Custom branding
- Advanced automation

**Anti-Feature-Creep Rules:**

1. **One-Sentence Test**: If you can't explain why this feature is essential in one sentence, it doesn't go in MVP
2. **Manual Alternative Test**: If this can be done manually for first 100 users, defer it
3. **Value-Per-Day Test**: Does value added justify X days of development before having paying customers?

---

### Phase 5: Technical Architecture

**Fixed Tech Stack:**
- Frontend: Next.js 15 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- Backend: Next.js API Routes, Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- Auth: Supabase Auth (email + OAuth)
- Payments: Stripe Checkout + Billing + Webhooks
- Email: Resend or SendGrid
- Hosting: Vercel + Supabase

**Database Tables (Standard):**
```sql
profiles         -- User profiles (extends auth.users)
customers        -- Stripe customer mapping
subscriptions    -- Subscription status & plan info
[feature_tables] -- Your core feature data
```

**Key API Routes:**
```
POST /api/stripe/create-checkout-session  -- Start subscription
POST /api/stripe/customer-portal          -- Manage subscription
POST /api/webhooks/stripe                 -- Handle Stripe events
GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/[resource]      -- Core features
```

**See references/TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md for complete schemas, app structure, and Stripe integration code.**

- Days 1-2: Project setup + Authentication
- Days 3-5: Core feature implementation (1-2 key features)
- Weekend: Testing + polish

**Week 2: Payments + Subscription**
- Days 1-2: Stripe integration (checkout + webhooks)
- Days 3-4: Subscription management + billing page

**Week 3: Polish + Launch**
- Days 1-2: Landing page + pricing page
- Days 3-4: Final polish (onboarding, error handling, empty states)
- Day 5: Deploy + monitor + 🚀 LAUNCH

**Week 4: Validation + Iteration (Optional)**
- Get first users, gather feedback, monitor metrics, quick bug fixes

## Questions to Ask Before Building

**Product Questions:**
- Who will pay for this? (specific customer segment)
- What ONE problem does this solve? (single, clear problem)
- How do we measure success? (specific metrics)
- Why would they pay monthly? (ongoing value proposition)
- What's the alternative? (current solution)
- Why switch to us? (key differentiator)

**Pricing Questions:**
- What can customers afford? (price range research)
- What are competitors charging? (competitive analysis)
- What's our cost per user? (CAC, hosting, support)
- How will we handle trials? (credit card required or not)

**Scope Questions:**
- What can be manual initially? (MVP shortcuts)
- What features can wait? (post-MVP backlog)
- Where's the biggest risk? (technical unknowns)
- What's the critical path? (must-have sequence)

## Common SaaS Mistakes to Avoid

**Top 10 Mistakes:**
1. ❌ Building too many features → ✅ Focus on ONE thing
2. ❌ Complex pricing (5+ tiers) → ✅ 2-3 clear tiers
3. ❌ Ignoring churn → ✅ Build retention features day 1
4. ❌ Over-engineering → ✅ Use Next.js + Supabase (proven stack)
5. ❌ Building in isolation → ✅ Share progress, get feedback
6. ❌ Poor trial strategy → ✅ Email sequence + onboarding
7. ❌ Not testing payments → ✅ Test all Stripe scenarios
8. ❌ Ignoring failed payments → ✅ Dunning emails + retry logic
9. ❌ No onboarding → ✅ 3-step onboarding flow
10. ❌ Underpricing → ✅ Match market rates ($29+ minimum)

**See references/COMMON_MISTAKES.md for detailed explanations and solutions.**

---

## Critical Reminders

**DO ✅:**
- Start with pricing model first (it influences architecture)
- Talk to customers about pricing before building
- Keep pricing simple (2-3 tiers max)
- Set up Stripe webhooks early
- Test payment flows thoroughly (success + failure)
- Implement trial countdown prominently
- Monitor trial-to-paid conversion obsessively
- Track churn reasons

**DON'T ❌:**
- Build 5+ pricing tiers
- Defer billing integration
- Forget to test webhook failures
- Ignore trial expiration edge cases
- Make cancellation hard
- Ignore failed payments
- Hardcode pricing (use Stripe products)
- Skip webhook verification

---

**💡 Key Insight:** SaaS success = Build fast, charge early, retain relentlessly. Every decision should optimize for one of these three goals.

**🎯 Goal:** Not a perfect product, but a profitable one. Not every feature, but the right features. Not someday, but within 3-4 weeks.

**🚀 Remember:** Your first 10 paying customers teach you more than 1000 hours of planning. Ship, learn, iterate.
