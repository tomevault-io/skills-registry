# Sanskrit Skills Suite

Comprehensive Sanskrit learning tools organized by domain.

## Prerequisites

This skill suite requires **Python 3.10+** and **[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)** (Universal Python Packaging) to be installed on your system.

## Initial Setup

Before using the grammar or meter analysis tools for the first time, you must install the Sanskrit parser dependencies:

```bash
cd shared/scripts
uv sync --extra full
```

## Routing Instructions

1. **Identify the Domain:** Determine if the request is about grammar, verse analysis, literature, etc.
2. **Load Instructions:** Read the corresponding `SKILL.md` file (e.g., `vyakarana/SKILL.md`) to get specialized workflows and reference paths.
3. **Execute:** Follow the domain-specific instructions. Use `shared/` for common scripts and terminology.

## Available Modules

| Module | Purpose | Instructions |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| **sloka** | Analyzing a specific verse (anvaya, padachheda, chandas) | `sloka/SKILL.md` |
| **vyakarana** | Grammar (sandhi, samasa, declensions, conjugations) | `vyakarana/SKILL.md` |
| **kosha** | Word meanings, synonyms, etymology, gender | `kosha/SKILL.md` |
| **sahitya** | Literature (texts, authors, genres, rasa theory) | `sahitya/SKILL.md` |
| **stotra** | Devotional hymns, prayers, recitation guidance | `stotra/SKILL.md` |
| **shared** | Common scripts, Devanagari, and terminology | `shared/SKILL.md` |
