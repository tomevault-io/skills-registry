# Worktree Management Skill

Git worktree isolation for parallel agent development with simple, safe workflows.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Create isolated worktree for a task
/sc:worktree create feature-auth

# List all active worktrees
/sc:worktree list

# Propose changes for human review
/sc:worktree propose feature-auth

# Clean up stale worktrees
/sc:worktree cleanup
```

## Behavioral Flow

1. **Create** - Initialize isolated worktree with unique naming
2. **Validate** - Preflight checks (clean repo, no conflicts)
3. **Assign** - Spawn subagent with CWD set to worktree
4. **Work** - Agent operates in isolation, commits to branch
5. **Propose** - Push branch and create PR for human review
6. **Cleanup** - Remove merged/stale worktrees

## Commands

| Command | Purpose | Git Operations |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| `create <task-id>` | Create isolated worktree | `git worktree add -b wt/<task>` |
| `list` | Show all active worktrees | `git worktree list` |
| `status <task-id>` | Check worktree state | `git status`, `git log` |
| `cleanup [--all]` | Remove stale worktrees | `git worktree remove`, `prune` |
| `propose <task-id>` | Create PR for human review | `git push`, `gh pr create` |

## Flags

| Flag | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `--commits` | bool | true | Agent commits directly to branch |
| `--patches` | bool | false | Agent produces patch files only |
| `--run-tests` | bool | false | Run tests before proposing |
| `--force` | bool | false | Override existing worktree/branch |
| `--base` | string | main | Base branch for worktree |

## Evidence Requirements

This skill does NOT require hard evidence. Worktree operations are self-documenting through:
- Git worktree list output
- Branch history
- PR creation confirmation

## Naming Convention

Worktrees use deterministic naming to prevent collisions:

```
Path:   .worktrees/<task-id>/
Branch: wt/<task-id>
```

Example:
```
Path:   .worktrees/feature-auth/
Branch: wt/feature-auth
```

## Operations

### Create Worktree

```bash
/sc:worktree create feature-auth

# Executes:
# 1. mkdir -p .worktrees
# 2. git worktree add -b wt/feature-auth .worktrees/feature-auth
# 3. Returns worktree path for subagent CWD
```

### List Worktrees

```bash
/sc:worktree list

# Shows:
# - Active worktrees
# - Associated branches
# - Last commit info
```

### Check Status

```bash
/sc:worktree status feature-auth

# Shows:
# - Uncommitted changes
# - Commits ahead of base branch
# - Conflict warnings
```

### Propose Changes

```bash
/sc:worktree propose feature-auth

# Executes:
# 1. git push -u origin wt/feature-auth
# 2. gh pr create --title "feat: feature-auth" --body "..."
# 3. Returns PR URL for human review
```

### Cleanup Worktrees

```bash
/sc:worktree cleanup          # Remove merged worktrees
/sc:worktree cleanup --all    # Remove ALL worktrees
/sc:worktree cleanup feature-auth  # Remove specific worktree

# Executes:
# 1. git worktree remove .worktrees/<task-id>
# 2. git branch -d wt/<task-id>
# 3. git worktree prune
```

## Subagent Integration

When spawning a subagent to work in a worktree:

```bash
# 1. Create worktree
/sc:worktree create feature-auth

# 2. Spawn subagent with CWD
Task(
    prompt="Implement JWT authentication",
    subagent_type="general-purpose",
    # CWD implicitly set to .worktrees/feature-auth/
)

# 3. Agent works in isolation
# - All file operations scoped to worktree
# - Commits go to wt/feature-auth branch

# 4. Propose for review
/sc:worktree propose feature-auth
```

## Preflight Checks

Before creating a worktree, the skill validates:

1. **Repository State**
   - Repo is clean OR `--force` flag provided
   - Main branch is up to date

2. **Branch Availability**
   - `wt/<task-id>` branch doesn't exist OR explicit reuse
   - No conflicting remote branch

3. **Path Availability**
   - `.worktrees/<task-id>` doesn't exist OR `--force` flag

## Conflict Detection

Before proposing, the skill checks for conflicts:

```bash
# Fetch latest changes
git fetch origin main

# Check if worktree is behind
git merge-base --is-ancestor origin/main HEAD

# Warn but don't block if behind
# Human reviewer handles merge strategy
```

## Examples

### Single Agent Workflow

```bash
# Create worktree
/sc:worktree create add-logging

# Work in worktree (agent operates here)
# ... agent makes changes, commits ...

# Propose changes
/sc:worktree propose add-logging

# Human reviews PR, merges

# Cleanup
/sc:worktree cleanup add-logging
```

### Parallel Multi-Agent Workflow

```bash
# Orchestrator creates multiple worktrees
/sc:worktree create feature-auth
/sc:worktree create feature-logging
/sc:worktree create feature-metrics

# Spawn agents in parallel (each with own worktree)
# Agent A -> .worktrees/feature-auth/
# Agent B -> .worktrees/feature-logging/
# Agent C -> .worktrees/feature-metrics/

# Propose all changes
/sc:worktree propose feature-auth
/sc:worktree propose feature-logging
/sc:worktree propose feature-metrics

# Human reviews 3 PRs, merges sequentially

# Cleanup all
/sc:worktree cleanup --all
```

### Patch Mode (No Direct Commits)

```bash
/sc:worktree create refactor-api --patches

# Agent produces .patch files instead of commits
# Orchestrator reviews patches before applying

/sc:worktree propose refactor-api  # Creates PR from patches
```

## MCP Integration

### PAL MCP (Validation & Review)

| Tool | When to Use | Purpose |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `mcp__pal__precommit` | Before propose | Validate changes in worktree |
| `mcp__pal__codereview` | Before propose | Review worktree changes |
| `mcp__pal__consensus` | Conflict resolution | Multi-model merge strategy |

### PAL Usage Patterns

```bash
# Validate worktree changes before proposing
mcp__pal__precommit(
    path=".worktrees/feature-auth",
    step="Validating worktree changes",
    findings="Security, test coverage, completeness",
    compare_to="main"
)

# Review worktree branch
mcp__pal__codereview(
    review_type="full",
    step="Reviewing feature-auth worktree",
    relevant_files=[".worktrees/feature-auth/src/auth.py"]
)
```

### Rube MCP (Automation & Notifications)

| Tool | When to Use | Purpose |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `mcp__rube__RUBE_SEARCH_TOOLS` | GitHub integration | Find PR tools |
| `mcp__rube__RUBE_MULTI_EXECUTE_TOOL` | Propose command | Create PR, notify team |

### Rube Usage Patterns

```bash
# Create PR and notify team
mcp__rube__RUBE_MULTI_EXECUTE_TOOL(tools=[
    {"tool_slug": "GITHUB_CREATE_PULL_REQUEST", "arguments": {
        "repo": "myapp",
        "title": "feat: feature-auth from worktree",
        "body": "## Worktree: feature-auth\nCreated via /sc:worktree",
        "base": "main",
        "head": "wt/feature-auth"
    }},
    {"tool_slug": "SLACK_SEND_MESSAGE", "arguments": {
        "channel": "#pull-requests",
        "text": "New PR from worktree: wt/feature-auth"
    }}
])
```

## Flags (Extended)

| Flag | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `--pal-review` | bool | false | Use PAL codereview before propose |
| `--create-pr` | bool | true | Create GitHub PR via Rube |
| `--notify` | string | - | Notify via Rube (slack, teams) |
| `--draft` | bool | false | Create draft PR |

## Tool Coordination

- **Bash** - Git worktree commands, directory operations
- **Read** - Check worktree status and logs
- **Task** - Spawn subagents with worktree CWD
- **PAL MCP** - Pre-propose validation, code review
- **Rube MCP** - PR creation, team notifications

## Safety Guarantees

1. **Isolation** - Each worktree has separate working directory
2. **No Auto-Merge** - Human review required for all merges
3. **Unique Naming** - Deterministic paths prevent collisions
4. **Crash-Safe** - `cleanup --all` removes stale worktrees
5. **Warning-Only Conflicts** - Conflicts warn but don't block

## Limitations

- No automatic quality scoring (use CI/tests)
- No lease tracking (periodic cleanup instead)
- No sophisticated conflict resolution (human review)
- No auto-merge to main (PR-based workflow)
