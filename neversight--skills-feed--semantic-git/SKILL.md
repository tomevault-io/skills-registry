# Semantic Git

Manage Git commits using conventional commit format with atomic commits and concise messages.

## When to Use

- Committing changes to git
- Staging files for commit
- Creating commit messages
- Managing atomic commits
- Before pushing changes

## Core Principles

- **Atomic commits**: Stage and commit related changes together. Tests go with implementation code.
- **User confirmation**: Always confirm with user before committing and before moving to the next commit.
- **Conventional format**: Use conventional commit message format (feat, fix, etc.) unless directed otherwise.
- **Concise messages**: Keep messages brief and to the point. Omit description unless change is complicated.

## Commit Message Format

```
<type>[optional scope]: <subject>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Types

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.)
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `build`: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- `ci`: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks (updating build tasks, dependencies, etc.; no production code change)
- `revert`: Revert a previous commit

### Breaking Changes

Use `!` after the type/scope to indicate breaking changes:
- `feat!: add new API`
- `fix(api)!: change response format`

### Subject Line

- Use imperative mood: "add feature" not "added feature" or "adds feature"
- First letter lowercase (unless starting with proper noun)
- No period at the end
- Keep under 72 characters when possible

### Body and Footer

- Omit body unless change is complicated or requires explanation
- When needed, be concise and reference issues, PRs, or documentation
- Use footer for breaking changes: `BREAKING CHANGE: <description>`

## Workflow

1. **Implement atomic change**: Code + tests together
   - Use test: for test only changes
2. **Run CI checks**: Verify types, tests, and linting pass before staging
   - Prefer single CI command if exists (e.g., `pnpm ci`, `npm run ci`, `just ci`)
   - If no CI command, run checks individually (typecheck, test, lint)
   - If any check fails, stop and report - do not proceed
3. **Stage atomic changes**: Group related files together (implementation + tests)
4. **Suggest commit message**: Generate conventional commit message based on changes
5. **Confirm with user**: Always ask for confirmation before committing
6. **Commit**: Execute commit only after user approval
7. **Next commit**: Before staging next set of changes, confirm with user

## Automation Mode

If user requests "continue to X" or "automate until X":
- Proceed with atomic commits automatically
- Resume asking for confirmation when X point reached
- X can be: specific file, feature completion, test passing, etc.

## Stop and Ask Protocols

Stop and ask user before:
- Adding type ignores (`@ts-ignore`, `# type: ignore`, etc.)
- Adding suppressions (ESLint disable, pylint disable, etc.)
- Using `any` type or similar type escapes
- Uncertain how to proceed with implementation
- Requirements are unclear

## Examples

**Simple feature or behaviour change:**
```
feat: add user authentication
```

**Feature with scope:**
```
feat(api): add user endpoint
```

**Bug fix:**
```
fix: resolve memory leak in cache
```

**Breaking change:**
```
feat!: migrate to new API version
```

**Test-only change:**
```
test: improve unit tests for auth service
```

**Refactor (no behavior change):**
```
refactor: extract validation logic into separate function
```

**Complex change (with body):**
```
feat(api): add pagination support

Implements cursor-based pagination for large datasets.
See docs/api/pagination.md for details.
```
