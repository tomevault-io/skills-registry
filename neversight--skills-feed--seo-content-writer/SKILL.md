# SEO Content Generation Skill

Create high-quality, search-optimized content that ranks in traditional search engines and gets cited by AI platforms.

## Core Philosophy

Modern search optimization requires content that serves three audiences simultaneously:
1. **Human readers** seeking valuable, trustworthy information
2. **Traditional search engines** indexing and ranking content
3. **AI systems** extracting and citing authoritative answers

Write for humans first, structure for machines second. Quality content naturally satisfies all three.

## The Triple Optimization Framework

### 1. Traditional SEO (Search Engine Optimization)
Optimize for Google, Bing, and traditional search results.

### 2. AEO (Answer Engine Optimization)
Optimize for direct answer displays: featured snippets, AI Overviews, voice assistants.

### 3. GEO (Generative Engine Optimization)
Optimize for AI citations: ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, Gemini.

## Content Creation Workflow

### Step 1: Pre-Writing Analysis

1. **Clarify intent and audience**
   - Identify primary and secondary keywords
   - Determine search intent: informational, navigational, commercial, transactional
   - Understand the target audience's expertise level

2. **Analyze competition**
   - Review top-ranking content for target keywords
   - Identify gaps and opportunities
   - Note content length, structure, and depth

3. **Plan content structure**
   - Create outline with H2/H3 hierarchy
   - Map keywords to sections
   - Plan FAQ section for AEO opportunities

### Step 2: Write Using the Answer-First Pattern

Structure content to lead with answers:

```
[Title with Primary Keyword]

[Opening paragraph: Answer the main question immediately - 2-3 sentences]

[Table of Contents for long-form content]

## [H2: Primary subtopic]
[Lead with key information]
[Supporting details and context]

## [H2: Secondary subtopics...]

## Frequently Asked Questions
[Question-format headings with direct answers]

## Key Takeaways
[Bulleted summary of main points]
```

**Paragraph-Level Pattern:**
1. **Lead with the answer** in the first sentence
2. **Expand with context** in sentences 2-3
3. **Provide evidence** with data, examples, or expert quotes
4. **Link to related concepts** for topical depth

### Step 3: Apply E-E-A-T Signals

Include these elements throughout content:

- **Experience**: First-hand accounts, case studies, personal testing
- **Expertise**: Technical accuracy, correct industry terminology
- **Authoritativeness**: Citations from respected sources, expert quotes
- **Trustworthiness**: Transparent sourcing, balanced viewpoints, current information

Trust is paramount—Google states untrustworthy pages have low E-E-A-T regardless of other signals.

### Step 4: Optimize On-Page Elements

**Title Tag (50-60 characters):**
- Primary keyword near the beginning
- Compelling and click-worthy

**Meta Description (150-160 characters):**
- Include primary keyword naturally
- Clear value proposition
- Call to action when appropriate

**Header Structure:**
```
H1: Page title (one per page)
  H2: Major sections
    H3: Subsections
```

**URL:** Short, descriptive, includes primary keyword, hyphens between words

### Step 5: Add AEO/GEO Content Blocks

See `references/aeo-geo-patterns.md` for complete patterns.

**Quick reference blocks:**

- **Definition blocks** for "what is" queries
- **Step-by-step blocks** for "how to" queries
- **Comparison tables** for "vs" queries
- **Pros/cons blocks** for evaluation queries
- **FAQ sections** for question-based queries

### Step 6: Generate Schema Markup

Use `scripts/generate_schema.py` for valid JSON-LD, or see `references/schema-templates.md`.

Common schema types:
- **Article**: Blog posts, news articles
- **FAQPage**: FAQ content sections
- **HowTo**: Instructional content
- **Product**: E-commerce pages
- **LocalBusiness**: Location-based content

### Step 7: Final Quality Check

Before finalizing, verify checklist in `references/seo-checklist.md`:

- [ ] Primary keyword in title, H1, first paragraph, URL
- [ ] Direct answer to main query within first 100 words
- [ ] FAQ section with 3-5 question-format headings
- [ ] Statistics cited from authoritative sources
- [ ] Expert quotes or first-hand experience included
- [ ] Internal and external links included
- [ ] Meta description written
- [ ] Image alt text optimized
- [ ] Content is factually accurate and current

## GEO-Specific Optimization

AI platforms cite content based on clarity, authority, structure, and recency.

### Domain-Specific Tactics

| Domain | Effective Tactics |
|--------|-------------------|
| Law & Government | Statistics, official citations |
| Health & Medicine | Expert credentials, study citations |
| Technology | Technical precision, current data |
| Finance | Data-driven analysis, regulatory citations |
| Arts & Humanities | Quotations, cultural references |

### Key GEO Principles

1. State facts explicitly—avoid implied meanings
2. Add statistics (increases citation rates 15-30%)
3. Include named expert quotes
4. Use fluent, readable language
5. Cite authoritative sources with links

## Output Deliverables

When generating SEO content, provide:

1. **Main content** with proper heading hierarchy
2. **Meta data** (title tag, meta description)
3. **FAQ section** with 3-5 questions
4. **Schema markup** as JSON-LD (when requested)
5. **Internal linking suggestions** based on topic clusters

## Writing Quality and Avoiding AI Patterns

Natural, human-sounding writing is essential for both reader engagement and E-E-A-T signals. AI-detectable content undermines trust and authority.

### Key Principles

1. **Avoid em dash (—) overuse** — The em dash is the primary tell of AI writing. Use commas, colons, or parentheses instead.

2. **Replace AI-flagged words** — See `references/ai-phrases-to-avoid.md` for complete list:
   - delve → explore, examine
   - leverage → use, apply
   - robust → strong, solid
   - comprehensive → complete, thorough
   - pivotal → key, important

3. **Use plain English** — See `references/plain-english-alternatives.md`:
   - utilise → use
   - facilitate → help
   - commence → start
   - prior to → before

4. **Avoid formulaic openings**:
   - ❌ "In today's fast-paced world..."
   - ❌ "In the ever-evolving landscape of..."
   - ❌ "Let's delve into..."
   - ✅ Start with the main point directly

5. **Remove empty intensifiers**: very, extremely, incredibly, absolutely, truly

6. **Vary sentence structure** — Mix short and long sentences; avoid repetitive patterns

### Self-Check Before Publishing

- Read aloud — if phrases sound unnatural, revise
- Ask: "Would I say this in conversation?"
- Check for repetitive sentence structures
- Look for clusters of AI-flagged words
- Verify each intensifier adds genuine meaning
