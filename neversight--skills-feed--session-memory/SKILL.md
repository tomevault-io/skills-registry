# Session Memory Skill

## Purpose
Restore full working context from persistent memory **automatically at session start**. This prevents loss of context from previous sessions, crashes, or context window resets.

## When to Activate
**MANDATORY at session start** - This skill should activate automatically when:
- User starts a new coding session
- Context has been reset or compacted
- User returns to a project after time away
- User asks "what was I working on?" or similar

**DO NOT ask permission** - Just use it. The user expects context restoration.

## Orchestration Steps

### 1. Immediate Context Recall (First Action)
```
Call: recall({ days: 7, limit: 20 })
```

This returns:
- Recent checkpoints (last 7 days)
- Active plan (if any)
- Git context (branches, files changed)
- Work summary

### 2. Analyze Recalled Context
Examine the results to understand:
- What was the last task being worked on?
- Is there an active plan? What's its status?
- Were there any blockers or discoveries?
- What files were being modified?

### 3. Present Context to User
Provide a **concise summary** (2-3 sentences):
```
"Welcome back! You were working on [task] in the [branch] branch.
Your last checkpoint was [description].
[Active plan status if present]."
```

### 4. Offer Next Steps
Based on the context, suggest:
- Resume the previous task
- Review the active plan
- Start a new task
- Address any blockers mentioned

## Example Session Start

```markdown
**Context Restored:**

Last session (2 hours ago):
- Fixed JWT authentication timeout bug
- Added refresh token rotation
- Branch: feature/auth-improvements
- All tests passing

**Active Plan:** "Auth System Redesign" (75% complete)

**Suggested next steps:**
1. Continue with OAuth2 integration (next plan item)
2. Review test coverage
3. Start something new
```

## Error Handling

**If recall returns empty:**
- This is a new workspace or first session
- Explain that Goldfish will track work going forward
- Encourage checkpointing at key moments

**If recall fails:**
- Fall back to git status to understand workspace
- Explain memory system may need setup
- Continue without restored context

## Key Behaviors

### ✅ DO
- Call recall() as THE FIRST action in a session
- Present findings concisely
- Use recalled context to inform next actions
- Checkpoint new work to build memory

### ❌ DON'T
- Ask permission to recall (just do it)
- Overwhelm user with all checkpoint details
- Ignore active plans in the recall results
- Forget to use recalled git context

## Success Criteria

This skill succeeds when:
- User feels continuity between sessions
- No "what was I doing?" confusion
- Active plans are automatically resumed
- Git context matches recalled work

## Performance

- Recall operation: ~30-150ms
- Should complete before user notices
- Non-blocking, graceful degradation

**Remember:** Memory restoration is MANDATORY. Users expect it. Don't ask, just recall and present context naturally.
