# Shortcut CLI Skill

Interact with Shortcut stories and epics via the `short` CLI tool.

## Instructions

When invoked with `/shortcut $ARGUMENTS`:

### 1. Check Prerequisites

First, verify the `short` CLI is installed and authenticated:

```bash
which short
```

- If command not found: Guide user through installation (see Prerequisites section), then STOP
- If found: Continue to step 2

### 2. Parse $ARGUMENTS

Route based on the argument pattern (in priority order):

| Pattern | Action |
|---------|--------|
| No arguments | Show help menu with available commands |
| URL starting with `https://app.shortcut.com/` containing `/story/` | Extract story ID (number after `/story/`), fetch and display details |
| URL starting with `https://app.shortcut.com/` containing `/epic/` | Extract epic ID (number after `/epic/`), fetch and display details |
| `search <text>` | Search stories by text |
| `my` | List my assigned stories |
| `list` | List all stories (uses `short search` without filters) |
| `create` | Start interactive story creation flow |
| Numeric value only | Treat as story ID, fetch and display details |

**URL Parsing:**
- Story URL regex: `https://app\.shortcut\.com/[^/]+/story/(\d+)` → Extract group 1 as ID
- Epic URL regex: `https://app\.shortcut\.com/[^/]+/epic/(\d+)` → Extract group 1 as ID

### 3. Execute Command

Run the appropriate `short` CLI command from the Commands Reference section below.

**Input handling:**
- Always quote user-provided strings in commands
- Escape double quotes in user input by replacing `"` with `\"`

### 4. Present Results

Format output for readability:
- For story/epic details: Show ID, title, state, owner, description, and URL
- For search results: Show as a numbered list with ID, title, state
- For creation: Show success message with new story URL

After presenting results, suggest relevant follow-up actions.

### 5. Handle Errors

| Error Type | Detection | Response |
|------------|-----------|----------|
| CLI not found | `which short` returns empty | Show installation instructions, do NOT auto-install |
| Auth failure | Output contains "unauthorized" or "invalid token" | Guide user to run `short install` |
| Not found | Output contains "not found" | Confirm ID, suggest search command |
| Network error | Timeout or connection error | Ask user to check connection, retry |

short install

# Or set environment variable
export SHORTCUT_API_TOKEN="your-api-token"
```

## Commands Reference

short story <id> -t "<title>"

# Update description
short story <id> -d "<description>"

# Add comment
short story <id> -c "<comment>"

short api <path> -X PUT -f "key=value"

# DELETE request
