# Universal Claude Code Skill Builder

## Philosophy & Overview

### What Are Claude Code Skills?

Skills are structured knowledge packages that extend Claude Code's capabilities for specific domains. They follow a standardized format:
- YAML frontmatter for metadata
- Markdown content for instructions
- Progressive disclosure for context optimization
- Optional references/, scripts/, and assets/ for bundled resources

### Why Skills Matter

**Without Skills**: Every task requires full context in conversation, repeated explanations, and no knowledge persistence across sessions.

**With Skills**: Domain knowledge is packaged once, invoked by name, loaded progressively, and reused across all projects.

### When to Create Skills

Create skills when:
- You have domain-specific knowledge to capture (design systems, API patterns, deployment workflows)
- You repeat similar instructions frequently (testing patterns, code review standards)
- You want to share knowledge with team or community
- You need consistent execution of complex workflows

Don't create skills when:
- Information is one-time use
- Task is better suited for inline conversation
- Knowledge changes too rapidly to maintain

### Core Principles

**Progressive Disclosure**: Keep SKILL.md lean, bundle details in references/
- SKILL.md: Always loaded (overview, quick start, key workflows)
- references/: Loaded on-demand (comprehensive guides, deep details)
- scripts/: Loaded when execution needed (automation, validation)

**Imperative/Infinitive Voice**: Write action-oriented instructions
- Good: "Create skill structure using workflow pattern"
- Bad: "You should probably think about creating a skill structure"

**Trigger Keywords**: Include discoverable terms in description
- Include: Task verbs (create, build, validate), domain terms (FHIR, deployment, testing)
- Context: Where skill applies (medical integration, API design, code review)

---

## 6-Step Creation Process

### Step 1: Understand Requirements

**Objective**: Clearly define what the skill should accomplish

**Questions to Answer**:
- What problem does this skill solve?
- Who will use this skill? (You, team, community)
- What domain knowledge must be captured?
- What workflows need to be documented?
- Are there existing skills to reference or patterns to follow?

**Output**: Clear problem statement and scope definition

**Example**:
```
Problem: Developers waste time figuring out Railway deployment for each project
Scope: Document Railway deployment workflow for Node.js + React apps
Users: Development team
Domain: Deployment, Railway, Docker, environment configuration
Patterns: Workflow-based (sequential steps)
```

**References**: See [references/converting-docs-to-skills.md](references/converting-docs-to-skills.md) for converting existing documentation

---

### Step 2: Plan Structure

**Objective**: Choose organizational pattern and plan file structure

**Choose Organizational Pattern** (see [4 Organizational Patterns](#4-organizational-patterns)):

1. **Workflow-based**: Sequential processes with clear steps
   - Use when: Deployment, API integration, testing workflows
   - Structure: Step 1 → Step 2 → Step 3 → Result

2. **Task-based**: Independent operations without order dependency
   - Use when: Utilities, troubleshooting guides, debugging
   - Structure: Task A, Task B, Task C (any order)

3. **Reference/Guidelines**: Standards, patterns, design systems
   - Use when: Design systems, coding standards, style guides
   - Structure: Concepts, guidelines, examples

4. **Capabilities-based**: Integrated feature suites with multiple entry points
   - Use when: Complex systems, multiple related workflows
   - Structure: Feature A, Feature B, Feature C (interconnected)

**Plan File Structure**:
```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md (always)
├── references/ (if detailed guides needed)
│   ├── detailed-guide-1.md
│   └── detailed-guide-2.md
├── scripts/ (if automation needed)
│   └── helper-script.py
└── templates/ (if reusable patterns)
    └── template-file.md
```

**Progressive Disclosure Planning**:
- SKILL.md: <5,000 words (overview, quick start, key workflows)
- references/: Comprehensive details, long guides (10,000+ words okay)
- scripts/: Automation helpers (documented with --help)

**Output**: Organizational pattern chosen, file structure planned

**References**: See [references/reference-organization-strategies.md](references/reference-organization-strategies.md) for detailed planning

---

### Step 3: Initialize Skill

**Objective**: Create directory structure and scaffold files

**Manual Approach**:
```bash
# Create skill directory
mkdir -p .claude/skills/skill-name

# Create SKILL.md with frontmatter
cat > .claude/skills/skill-name/SKILL.md <<'EOF'
---
name: skill-name
description: [What it does]. Use when [triggers].
---

# Skill Name

## Overview
[Purpose in 1-2 sentences]

## Quick Start
[Basic usage]
EOF

# Create subdirectories if needed
mkdir -p .claude/skills/skill-name/references
mkdir -p .claude/skills/skill-name/scripts
```

**Automated Approach** (using scripts):
```bash
# Initialize with template
python scripts/init-skill.py skill-name --template workflow

# Initialize interactively
python scripts/init-skill.py skill-name --interactive
```

**YAML Frontmatter Template**:
```yaml
---
name: skill-name-in-hyphen-case
description: [What skill does in 1-2 sentences]. [Key features]. Use when [trigger scenarios with keywords].
---
```

**Description Formula**: What + Features + Triggers
- What: Primary purpose (1 sentence)
- Features: Key capabilities (optional, 1 sentence)
- Triggers: When to use with discoverable keywords (1 sentence)

**Output**: Directory structure created, SKILL.md scaffolded

**References**: See [references/yaml-frontmatter-complete-guide.md](references/yaml-frontmatter-complete-guide.md) for YAML details

---

### Step 4: Edit Content

**Objective**: Write comprehensive skill documentation

**SKILL.md Structure** (Workflow-based example):
```markdown
---
name: deployment-guide
description: Railway deployment workflow for Node.js + React apps...
---

# Deployment Guide

## Overview
Complete Railway deployment workflow for full-stack applications.

## Prerequisites
- Railway account
- GitHub repository
- Node.js project

## Workflow

### Step 1: Prepare Application
[Instructions]

### Step 2: Configure Railway

## References
- [Environment Configuration](references/environment-config.md)
- [Deployment Checklist](references/deployment-checklist.md)
```

**Writing Guidelines**:

1. **Use Imperative Voice**:
   - Good: "Configure environment variables"
   - Bad: "You should configure environment variables"

2. **Be Specific**:
   - Good: "Run `npm run build` to create production bundle"
   - Bad: "Build the application"

3. **Include Examples**:
   - Code blocks with actual examples
   - Before/after comparisons
   - Expected outputs

4. **Reference, Don't Duplicate**:
   - SKILL.md: Overview and workflow
   - references/: Detailed explanations
   - Link with: "See [references/file.md](references/file.md) for details"

**Output**: SKILL.md written, references created if needed

**References**: See [references/writing-style-imperative-guide.md](references/writing-style-imperative-guide.md) for writing standards

## 4 Organizational Patterns

### Pattern 1: Workflow-Based

**Use When**: Sequential processes with clear steps

**Structure**:
```markdown
## Workflow

### Step 1: [Action]
Instructions for step 1

### Step 2: [Action]
Instructions for step 2

### Step 3: [Action]
Instructions for step 3
```

**Examples**:
- Deployment workflows (prepare → configure → deploy → verify)
- API integration (authenticate → fetch → process → store)
- Testing workflows (setup → execute → validate → cleanup)

**Characteristics**:
- Order matters
- Each step builds on previous
- Clear progression
- Defined start and end points

**Best Practices**:
- Number steps clearly
- Include prerequisites at start
- Show expected outcomes for each step
- Provide troubleshooting per step

---

### Pattern 2: Task-Based

**Use When**: Independent operations without order dependency

**Structure**:
```markdown
## Tasks

### Task A: [Action]
Complete instructions for task A

### Task B: [Action]
Complete instructions for task B

### Task C: [Action]
Complete instructions for task C
```

**Examples**:
- Troubleshooting guides (different problems, different solutions)
- Utility collections (various independent tools)
- Command references (different operations)

**Characteristics**:
- Order doesn't matter
- Tasks are independent
- Can perform any subset
- Quick reference format

**Best Practices**:
- Make each task self-contained
- Use descriptive task names
- Include complete instructions per task
- Organize by category if many tasks

---

### Pattern 3: Reference/Guidelines

**Use When**: Standards, patterns, design systems, best practices

**Structure**:
```markdown
## Guidelines

### Guideline 1: [Concept]
Explanation and examples

### Guideline 2: [Concept]
Explanation and examples

## Reference

### Component A
Details and usage

### Component B
Details and usage
```

**Examples**:
- Design systems (colors, typography, components)
- Coding standards (style guide, patterns, conventions)
- API documentation (endpoints, parameters, responses)

**Characteristics**:
- Reference material
- Look-up format
- Examples and specifications
- Comprehensive coverage

**Best Practices**:
- Organize by category
- Include visual examples where applicable
- Provide usage examples
- Keep updated as standards evolve

---

### Pattern 4: Capabilities-Based

**Use When**: Integrated feature suites with multiple entry points

**Structure**:
```markdown
## Capabilities

### Capability A: [Feature]
How to use feature A
- Sub-feature 1
- Sub-feature 2

### Capability B: [Feature]
How to use feature B
- Sub-feature 1
- Sub-feature 2

## Integration
How capabilities work together
```

**Examples**:
- Complex systems (multiple interconnected features)
- Platforms (various ways to accomplish goals)
- Toolkits (collection of related capabilities)

**Characteristics**:
- Multiple features
- Features can be combined
- Flexible usage patterns
- Integration between features

**Best Practices**:
- Explain each capability clearly
- Show integration patterns
- Provide combination examples
- Include capability matrix

---

### Choosing the Right Pattern

**Decision Tree**:

1. **Is there a required sequence?**
   → Yes: **Workflow-based**
   → No: Go to 2

2. **Are operations independent?**
   → Yes: **Task-based**
   → No: Go to 3

3. **Is it primarily reference material?**
   → Yes: **Reference/Guidelines**
   → No: **Capabilities-based**

**Pattern Mixing**: You can combine patterns
- Primary pattern: Overall structure
- Secondary pattern: Individual sections

**Example**: Deployment skill might be:
- Primary: Workflow-based (deployment steps)
- Section: Reference (environment variables)
- Section: Task-based (troubleshooting)

---

## Progressive Disclosure Deep Dive

### The Three-Level System

**Level 1: SKILL.md** (Always Loaded)
- Size: <5,000 words ideal, <10,000 words maximum
- Content: Overview, quick start, primary workflows
- Purpose: Immediate context for Claude
- Loading: Automatic when skill invoked

**Level 2: references/** (On-Demand Loading)
- Size: Unlimited (10,000+ words okay)
- Content: Comprehensive guides, detailed explanations, specifications
- Purpose: Deep dives when needed
- Loading: Claude explicitly references when detail needed

**Level 3: scripts/** (Execution Loading)
- Size: Unlimited code
- Content: Automation scripts, validators, helpers
- Purpose: Executable tools
- Loading: When automation invoked

### When to Use Each Level

**Put in SKILL.md**:
- Skill overview and purpose
- Quick start guide
- Common workflows (80% use cases)
- Decision trees for choosing approaches
- Links to references for details

**Put in references/**:
- Comprehensive guides (>2,000 words)
- Detailed specifications
- In-depth explanations
- Reference tables and matrices
- Historical context
- Advanced techniques

**Put in scripts/**:
- Validation scripts
- Automation helpers
- Code generators
- Analysis tools
- Testing utilities

### Context Window Optimization

**Problem**: Large skills consume context window
**Solution**: Progressive disclosure

**Before Optimization** (Everything in SKILL.md):
```
SKILL.md: 15,000 words
Context used: ~30,000 tokens
Claude has: ~70,000 tokens remaining for work
```

**After Optimization** (Progressive disclosure):
```
SKILL.md: 3,000 words
references/: 12,000 words (loaded when needed)
Context used: ~6,000 tokens (initial)
Claude has: ~94,000 tokens remaining for work
```

**Result**: 5x context efficiency!

### Reference Linking Best Practices

**Good Reference Link**:
```markdown
For comprehensive YAML guide, see [references/yaml-frontmatter-complete-guide.md](references/yaml-frontmatter-complete-guide.md)
```

**What makes it good**:
- Clear description of what's in reference
- Full relative path
- Descriptive file name

**Bad Reference Link**:
```markdown
See the guide [here](references/guide.md)
```

**What's wrong**:
- Vague "here" link
- Non-descriptive file name
- Unclear what guide contains
