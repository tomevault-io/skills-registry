# Skill Harvester

Transform your past work into reusable Claude Code skills automatically.

## Overview

The Skill Harvester is a meta-skill that helps you systematically extract reusable patterns, workflows, and expertise from your Claude Code sessions and convert them into well-structured skills that can be shared and reused.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- Completing a significant project or work session
- Identifying repetitive patterns across multiple sessions
- Building organizational knowledge repositories
- Creating team-wide skill libraries
- Documenting complex workflows for future reuse
- Converting infrastructure/tooling expertise into skills
- After solving complex problems that could help future work

## Skill Harvesting Process

### 1. Reflection & Analysis

**Examine recent work:**
```bash
# Review recent git commits
git log --oneline -20

# Analyze file changes
git diff HEAD~10..HEAD --stat

# Check which files were most modified
git log --pretty=format: --name-only | sort | uniq -c | sort -rg | head -20
```

**Identify domains:**
- What technologies were used? (frameworks, languages, tools)
- What problems were solved? (deployment, testing, optimization)
- What patterns emerged? (error handling, API integration, workflow)
- What expertise was developed? (domain knowledge, best practices)

### 2. Skill Identification

**Questions to ask:**
1. **Reusability**: Could this help in future projects?
2. **Generalizability**: Does it apply beyond this specific context?
3. **Complexity**: Is it non-trivial enough to warrant a skill?
4. **Value**: Would others benefit from this pattern?
5. **Completeness**: Can it be documented as a standalone skill?

**Skill categories to consider:**
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes, cloud platforms, CI/CD
- **Backend**: API design, database optimization, authentication
- **Frontend**: Component patterns, state management, build optimization
- **DevOps**: Deployment strategies, monitoring, automation
- **Data Engineering**: ETL pipelines, data validation, transformation
- **Security**: Auth patterns, encryption, vulnerability scanning
- **Testing**: Test strategies, mocking, coverage analysis
- **Documentation**: API docs, architecture diagrams, runbooks

### 3. Skill Template Creation

**Essential components of a good skill:**

## Harvesting Strategies

### Strategy 1: Domain Expertise Extraction

When you've worked extensively with a specific tool or technology:

1. **Document the mental model**: How does it work? What are the key concepts?
2. **Capture common operations**: What do you do most often?
3. **Record gotchas**: What are the common pitfalls?
4. **Create quick reference**: What do you always look up?

**Example domains:**
- Database query optimization
- Docker multi-stage builds
- JWT authentication patterns
- GraphQL schema design
- Terraform module creation

### Strategy 2: Workflow Pattern Extraction

When you've developed an effective workflow:

1. **Map the steps**: What's the sequence of actions?
2. **Identify decision points**: Where are choices made?
3. **Document prerequisites**: What's needed to start?
4. **Capture success criteria**: How do you know it worked?

**Example workflows:**
- Blue-green deployments
- Feature branch review process
- Database migration strategies
- API versioning approaches

### Strategy 3: Problem-Solution Pattern Mining

When you've solved complex problems:

1. **Describe the problem**: What was broken/missing?
2. **Explain the diagnosis**: How did you identify it?
3. **Detail the solution**: What fixed it?
4. **Generalize the pattern**: How to prevent/solve similar issues?

**Example patterns:**
- Memory leak debugging
- Race condition resolution
- Performance bottleneck analysis
- Security vulnerability patching

### Strategy 4: Tool Mastery Documentation

When you've become proficient with a tool:

1. **Core operations**: What are the essential commands?
2. **Advanced features**: What are the power-user tricks?
3. **Integration patterns**: How does it work with other tools?
4. **Troubleshooting**: Common errors and fixes?

**Example tools:**
- kubectl for Kubernetes
- AWS CLI for cloud operations
- jq for JSON processing
- git for version control

## Tips for Effective Harvesting

### 🎯 Focus on Value

Harvest skills that:
- Save significant time
- Reduce errors
- Encode expertise
- Enable new capabilities
- Solve recurring problems

### 📝 Document Context

Include:
- Why this approach works
- When to use alternatives
- Trade-offs and considerations
- Real-world scenarios
- Lessons learned

### 🔄 Iterate and Improve

- Start with basic version
- Add examples from actual use
- Incorporate feedback
- Refine based on experience
- Version as needed

### 🤝 Share and Collaborate

- Contribute to team repositories
- Accept contributions
- Review and merge improvements
- Build on others' skills
- Create skill compositions

## Skill Composition

Combine multiple skills for powerful workflows:

```markdown
# Example: Full-Stack Deployment Skill

Combines:
- docker-optimization (build efficient images)
- kubernetes-deploy (deploy to cluster)
- database-migration (update schema)
- health-check-monitoring (verify deployment)
- rollback-strategy (revert if needed)
```

## Measurement and Tracking

Track the value of your skills:

```bash
# Track skill usage
echo "$(date): Used skill-harvester for project X" >> ~/.claude/skill-usage.log

# Count skill reuse
grep "skill-harvester" ~/.claude/skill-usage.log | wc -l

# Measure time saved
# Before: 4 hours to set up manually
# After: 20 minutes with skill
# Savings: 3.67 hours per use
```

## Advanced Patterns

### Pattern 1: Progressive Disclosure

Start with simple template, add complexity as needed:

1. **Basic**: Essential operations only
2. **Intermediate**: Common patterns and variations
3. **Advanced**: Edge cases and optimizations
4. **Expert**: Deep dives and internals

### Pattern 2: Skill Families

Create related skills that work together:

```
database-skills/
├── postgres-optimization/
├── postgres-backup/
├── postgres-replication/
└── postgres-monitoring/
```

### Pattern 3: Meta-Skills

Skills that help create or manage other skills:

- skill-harvester (this skill)
- skill-tester (validate skills work)
- skill-documenter (generate documentation)
- skill-versioner (manage versions)
