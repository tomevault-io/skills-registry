# Slack Memory Retrieval

This skill enables AI employees to efficiently retrieve and utilize stored memories to provide context-aware responses in Slack conversations.

## Core Purpose

Retrieve relevant memories from `{memories_path}` to inform the next response with appropriate context about people, projects, decisions, preferences, and work history.

## Quick Start

### Basic Workflow

Every memory retrieval follows this pattern:

1. **Analyze context** - Extract channel, user, keywords from conversation
2. **Read index.md** - Get overview of available memories
3. **Identify relevant files** - Based on context and index
4. **Load memories** - Read specific files needed
5. **Synthesize response** - Combine memories with current context

### Example: Simple Query

```
User (in #마케팅팀): "Q4 전략 어떻게 되고 있어?"

Step 1: Context Analysis
- Channel: #마케팅팀 (C123)
- Keywords: Q4, 전략

Step 2: Read Index
view {memories_path}/index.md
→ See Recent Updates, locate Q4-related items

Step 3: Load Relevant Files
view {memories_path}/channels/C123_마케팅팀.md
view {memories_path}/projects/Q4전략.md
view {memories_path}/meetings/ (find Q4 meetings)

Step 4: Respond
Synthesize information from channel context, project status, and meeting notes
```

## Memory Structure

The memory system uses a **hybrid approach**:

### Profile Files (One Per Entity)
- `channels/C123_마케팅팀.md` - Channel guidelines, preferences, static info
- `users/U456_김철수.md` - User profile, communication style

### Topic Files (Multiple Per Category)
- `projects/신제품런칭.md` - Project discussions
- `decisions/AWS전환_20251117.md` - Important decisions
- `meetings/2025-11-17-Q4회의.md` - Meeting notes
- `misc/마케팅팀_일상_20251117.md` - Casual conversations

### Directory Structure

```
{memories_path}/
├── index.md              # START HERE - navigation and stats
├── channels/             # Channel profile files (one per channel)
├── users/                # User profile files (one per user)
├── projects/             # Project topic files (multiple)
├── tasks/                # Task records
├── decisions/            # Decision records (date-stamped)
├── meetings/             # Meeting notes (date-stamped)
├── feedback/             # User feedback
├── announcements/        # Important announcements
├── resources/            # Internal docs and guides
├── external/news/        # External information
└── misc/                 # Uncategorized conversations
```

## Essential Rules

### Always Start with Index

**CRITICAL**: Every retrieval session must begin by reading index.md:

```bash
view {memories_path}/index.md
```

The index provides:
- Navigation structure
- Statistics (total channels, users, active projects)
- Recent updates (10 most recent changes)
- Quick links to key information

This one-time read gives you the complete map of available memories.

### Context-Driven Retrieval

Extract context from the conversation:

**Channel Context:**
```
Message in #마케팅팀 
→ Load: {memories_path}/channels/C123_마케팅팀.md
→ Check related_to metadata for connected info
```

**User Context:**
```
DM from @chulsoo
→ Load: {memories_path}/users/U123_김철수.md
→ Get communication_style, preferences
```

**Project Context:**
```
Question about "신제품 런칭"
→ Load: {memories_path}/projects/신제품런칭.md
→ Check milestones, status, participants
```

**Keyword Context:**
```
Question mentions "결정", "승인"
→ Search: {memories_path}/decisions/
→ Find relevant decision files
```

### Efficient Loading Strategy

**Tier 1: Always Load (if relevant)**
- index.md (overview)
- Current channel file (if in channel)
- Current user file (if DM or mentioned)

**Tier 2: Load as Needed**
- Project files (if project mentioned)
- Decision files (if asking about decisions)
- Meeting notes (if asking about meetings)

**Tier 3: Load Selectively**
- Tasks (only if specifically asked)
- Resources (only if referenced)
- External news (only if relevant)

Don't over-fetch. Use directory listings first:
```bash
view {memories_path}/projects/
# See available projects before loading specific files
```

## Retrieval Patterns

### Pattern 1: Channel Response

When responding in a channel:

```bash
# 1. Load channel context
view {memories_path}/channels/{channel_id}_{channel_name}.md

# 2. Check for channel guidelines
# Extract: tone, response_time, key_topics

# 3. Apply guidelines to response
# Adjust tone, format based on channel preferences
```

### Pattern 2: User-Specific Response

When responding to a specific user:

```bash
# 1. Load user profile
view {memories_path}/users/{user_id}_{name}.md

# 2. Check communication_style
# Extract: tone, detail_level, preferences

# 3. Personalize response
# Match user's preferred style and detail level
```

### Pattern 3: Project Status Query

When asked about project status:

```bash
# 1. Find project file
view {memories_path}/projects/
view {memories_path}/projects/{project_name}.md

# 2. Check metadata
# status, priority, milestones, participants

# 3. Get related info
# Check related_to for decisions, meetings

# 4. Provide comprehensive update
# Current status + recent activity + next steps
```

### Pattern 4: Decision History

When asked about past decisions:

```bash
# 1. Search decisions
view {memories_path}/decisions/

# 2. Load relevant decision file
view {memories_path}/decisions/{decision_name}.md

# 3. Extract key info
# decision_makers, rationale, alternatives_considered

# 4. Explain context
# Why decision was made + alternatives + outcome
```

### Pattern 5: Task History

When asked about completed work:

```bash
# 1. Check completed tasks
view {memories_path}/tasks/completed/

# 2. Filter by assignee/date
# Look for relevant assignee, date range

# 3. Summarize work
# List tasks + effort + outcomes
```

## Advanced Techniques

### Cross-Referencing

Follow the trail of related information:

```yaml
# In project file:
---
related_to:
  - decisions/기술스택선택.md
  - meetings/2025-10-20-기획회의.md
---
```

Load related files to build complete context.

### Metadata Filtering

Use metadata to filter without reading entire files:

```bash
# List directory first
view {memories_path}/projects/

# Check filenames and metadata
# Only load files matching criteria:
# - status: in_progress
# - priority: high
# - participants: includes current_user
```

### Temporal Context

Consider time-sensitivity:

```bash
# Recent Updates in index.md
→ Shows 10 most recent changes
→ Focus on these for "latest" questions

# File metadata: created, updated
→ Check dates to prioritize fresh info
```

### Tag-Based Discovery

Use tags for discovery:

```yaml
tags: [urgent, marketing, q4, approval-needed]
```

When user asks about "urgent items":
- Scan files for tags: urgent
- Collect across categories
- Present by priority

## Response Construction

### Synthesize, Don't Dump

**❌ Bad:**
```
"According to channels/마케팅팀.md, the response time is 1 hour.
According to projects/Q4전략.md, the status is in_progress.
According to meetings/기획회의.md..."
```

**✅ Good:**
```
"Q4 마케팅 전략은 현재 진행 중이며, 지난 기획회의에서 
주요 방향을 확정했습니다. 현재 MVP 개발 단계에 있고..."
```

Synthesize information naturally without explicitly citing sources.

### Apply Context Appropriately

**Channel Guidelines:**
If channel specifies "간결한 답변", keep response concise.

**User Preferences:**
If user prefers "bullet points", format accordingly.

**Project Status:**
Include relevant status without over-explaining.

### Maintain Conversational Flow

Integrate memories seamlessly into natural conversation:

```
User: "이번 주 미팅 어땠어?"

Response: "화요일 기획회의에서 신규 기능 3개를 최종 확정했어요. 
전반적으로 개발 일정에 대한 우려가 있었지만, 리소스 조정으로 
해결 가능할 것으로 보입니다."

(Draws from: meetings/기획회의.md + projects/신규기능.md)
```

## Important Guardrails

### What to Retrieve

✅ **Do retrieve:**
- Channel communication guidelines
- User preferences and profiles
- Project status and history
- Decision rationale and history
- Meeting notes and action items
- Completed task history
- Feedback and suggestions
- Resource documents

### What NOT to Retrieve

❌ **Don't retrieve:**
- Information outside {memories_path}
- System configuration files
- Scheduling requests (handled by scheduler agent)
- Agent identity info (name, org, team)

### Privacy and Access

- Only access files within {memories_path}
- Don't share sensitive information inappropriately
- Respect access_level metadata if present

### Efficiency

- Don't load unnecessary files
- Use directory listings before file reads
- Start with index.md, not individual files
- Follow the efficient loading strategy (Tier 1 → Tier 2 → Tier 3)

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Can't find relevant memory

**Solution:**
1. Check index.md for recent updates
2. Search broader category (e.g., misc/)
3. Check related_to in similar files
4. Inform user if information not available

### Issue: Conflicting information

**Solution:**
1. Prioritize newer information (check updated timestamp)
2. Consider context of each source
3. Mention both perspectives if relevant

### Issue: Too much information

**Solution:**
1. Prioritize by relevance to current question
2. Summarize rather than detail
3. Focus on actionable insights

### Issue: Memory seems outdated

**Solution:**
1. Check updated timestamp
2. Look for newer related files
3. Note timeframe in response
4. Suggest updating if critical

## Integration with Memory Management

This skill works in tandem with `slack-memory-store`:

**Memory Management (separate agent):**
- Stores new information
- Updates existing memories
- Maintains index

**Memory Retrieval (this skill):**
- Reads stored information
- Finds relevant context
- Informs responses

These are complementary skills for a complete memory system.

## Best Practices Summary

1. **Always start with index.md** - Get the map before exploring
2. **Extract context first** - Channel, user, keywords guide retrieval
3. **Load efficiently** - Directory listing → relevant files only
4. **Follow references** - Use related_to metadata
5. **Synthesize naturally** - Don't cite sources explicitly
6. **Apply preferences** - Use channel/user guidelines
7. **Stay current** - Prioritize recent updates
8. **Don't over-fetch** - Load what you need
9. **Respect guardrails** - Stay within {memories_path}
10. **Provide value** - Context-aware, relevant responses

## Example Workflows

### Example 1: Morning Briefing

```
User (DM): "오늘 뭐부터 시작하면 좋을까?"

# 1. Load user profile
view {memories_path}/users/U123_김철수.md
→ Get role: PM, team: Product

# 2. Load index
view {memories_path}/index.md
→ Check Recent Updates

# 3. Check ongoing tasks
view {memories_path}/tasks/ongoing/
→ Find tasks assigned to U123

# 4. Check active projects
view {memories_path}/projects/
→ Filter by participants including U123

Response: "오늘은 Q4 전략 최종안 검토가 가장 시급해 보입니다. 
오후 3시 승인 회의가 예정되어 있어서, 오전 중에 마무리하시면 좋을 것 같아요. 
그 외 신제품 기획서 작성도 진행 중이신데, 이번 주 금요일까지시니 여유가 있습니다."
```

### Example 2: Project Status Check

```
User (in #개발팀): "웹사이트 리뉴얼 어디까지 왔어?"

# 1. Load channel context
view {memories_path}/channels/C456_개발팀.md

# 2. Load index
view {memories_path}/index.md

# 3. Find project
view {memories_path}/projects/웹사이트리뉴얼.md
→ Get status, milestones, recent updates

# 4. Check related decisions
→ Follow related_to metadata

# 5. Check recent meetings
view {memories_path}/meetings/
→ Find recent discussions about this project

Response: "웹사이트 리뉴얼은 현재 70% 진행됐습니다. 
프론트엔드 개발은 완료됐고, 백엔드 API 통합 작업 중이에요. 
지난주 회의에서 디자인 시스템을 확정했고, 다음 주 화요일 
내부 테스트 예정입니다."
```

### Example 3: Decision Inquiry

```
User: "React vs Vue 어떻게 결정했었지?"

# 1. Load index
view {memories_path}/index.md

# 2. Search decisions
view {memories_path}/decisions/
→ Find "프론트엔드프레임워크선택.md"

# 3. Load decision file
view {memories_path}/decisions/프론트엔드프레임워크선택.md
→ Get decision_makers, alternatives, rationale

# 4. Check related meetings
→ Follow related_to for meeting notes

Response: "React를 선택했습니다. 9월 기술 검토 회의에서 
Vue도 고려했지만, 팀의 기존 React 경험과 생태계의 풍부함을 
이유로 React로 결정했어요. 특히 TypeScript 지원과 
대규모 커뮤니티가 주요 요인이었습니다."
```

## Performance Tips

**Tip 1: Batch Directory Reads**
```bash
# Once per session
view {memories_path}/projects/
view {memories_path}/channels/
# Then reference from memory
```

**Tip 2: Use Index Effectively**
```bash
# Index Recent Updates = quick scan of active areas
# No need to check every directory
```

**Tip 3: Smart Caching**
```bash
# Within a conversation:
# - Load channel context once
# - Load user profile once
# - Reuse for subsequent messages
```

**Tip 4: Selective Loading**
```bash
# If user asks "quick status":
# → Load index + 1-2 key files
# If user asks "detailed report":
# → Load index + multiple related files
```
