# Slop Score Analysis

Analyzes text for statistical patterns common in AI-generated writing.

## Usage

Run the analysis script on any text file:

```bash
bun run ./scripts/slop-score/analyze.js --all <filepath>
```

Always use the `--all` flag to include complete metrics.

## Output

Return the raw JSON output exactly as received. Do not summarize, interpret, or add commentary. The JSON output is the complete result.
