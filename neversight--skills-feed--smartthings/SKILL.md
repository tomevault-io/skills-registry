# SmartThings Skill

## Overview
Enables Claude to interact with Samsung SmartThings for controlling connected devices, creating automations, managing scenes, and integrating various smart home protocols.

## Quick Install

```bash
curl -sSL https://canifi.com/skills/smartthings/install.sh | bash
```

Or manually:
```bash
cp -r skills/smartthings ~/.canifi/skills/
```

## Setup

Configure via [canifi-env](https://canifi.com/setup/scripts):

```bash
# First, ensure canifi-env is installed:
# curl -sSL https://canifi.com/install.sh | bash

canifi-env set SAMSUNG_EMAIL "your-email@example.com"
```

## Privacy & Authentication

**Your credentials, your choice.** Canifi LifeOS respects your privacy.

### Option 1: Manual Browser Login (Recommended)
If you prefer not to share credentials with Claude Code:
1. Complete the [Browser Automation Setup](/setup/automation) using CDP mode
2. Login to the service manually in the Playwright-controlled Chrome window
3. Claude will use your authenticated session without ever seeing your password

### Option 2: Environment Variables
If you're comfortable sharing credentials, you can store them locally:
```bash
canifi-env set SERVICE_EMAIL "your-email"
canifi-env set SERVICE_PASSWORD "your-password"
```

**Note**: Credentials stored in canifi-env are only accessible locally on your machine and are never transmitted.

## Authentication Flow
1. Navigate to my.smartthings.com via Playwright MCP

- Rate Limited: Implement exponential backoff
- Hub Offline: Report hub connectivity status

## Self-Improvement Instructions

1. Document SmartThings interface changes
2. Update selectors for new layouts
3. Track new device integrations
4. Monitor automation feature updates

## Notes
