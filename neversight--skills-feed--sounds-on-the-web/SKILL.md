# Sounds on The Web

Sound is the forgotten sense in web design. The auditory cortex processes sound in ~25ms—nearly 10x faster than visual processing. A button that clicks feels faster than one that doesn't, even when visual feedback is identical.

## When to Apply

Reference these guidelines when:
- Adding audio feedback to interactions
- Designing confirmation or error states
- Building notification systems
- Creating immersive or game-like experiences
- Reviewing audio UX for appropriateness

## Core Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Speed | Sound reaches the brain faster than visuals (~25ms vs ~250ms) |
| Presence | Audio crosses the boundary between device and environment |
| Emotion | A single tone communicates success, error, tension, or playfulness |
| Complement | Sound should enhance, never replace visual feedback |

## When to Use Sound

### Good Candidates
- **Confirmations**: Payments, uploads, form submissions
- **Errors and warnings**: States that can't be overlooked
- **State changes**: Transitions that reinforce what happened
- **Notifications**: Interruptions that don't require visual attention

### Poor Candidates
- High-frequency interactions (typing, keyboard navigation)
- Decorative moments with no informational value
- Any action where sound would feel punishing

## Respecting User Preferences

```css
/* Use prefers-reduced-motion as proxy */
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  /* Disable or reduce audio */
}
```

- Provide explicit toggle in settings
- Allow volume adjustment independent of system volume
- Default to subtle, not loud

## Technical Implementation

- Basic `Audio` objects cover most cases
- Web Audio API for complex needs
- Keep audio files small and preloaded
- Match sound weight to action weight

## Counter-Arguments

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "Users will hate it" | Only if done poorly. Subtle, appropriate, optional sounds are not intrusive. |
| "It's inaccessible" | Sound complements, never replaces. Every audio cue needs a visual equivalent. |
| "It's technically complicated" | Basic audio playback is straightforward. Implementation burden is low. |
| "It's not professional" | Native apps use sound constantly. Web silence is historical accident, not design principle. |

## Getting Started

1. Pick a single interaction that feels flat
2. Add a subtle sound
3. Make it optional
4. See how it changes the feeling
5. Build vocabulary gradually

## Key Guidelines

- **Match weight**: Sound should reflect the importance of the action
- **Be informative**: Sound should communicate, not punish
- **Stay optional**: Always provide a way to disable
- **Learn from games**: They've perfected audio feedback for decades
