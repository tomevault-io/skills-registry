# Spaced Repetition Architecture

This document describes the translation-based spaced repetition system, its data
model, and study flow.

## Overview

- The SRS system is translation-pair based. Each `translation` row (a phrase
  pair) produces two cards:
  - `primary_to_secondary`
  - `secondary_to_primary`
- Cards store only scheduling state and foreign keys. The displayed text is
  pulled live from `phrase` rows.
- A deck contains translation pairs. Cards are scoped to a single deck.

## Data Model (WatermelonDB)

### Tables

- `deck`
  - Stores user-created decks and a default deck.
- `deck_translation`
  - Join table linking `deck` and `translation`.
- `srs_card`
  - Scheduling state for each direction of a translation pair.
- `srs_review_log`
  - Append-only review history for analytics and future FSRS upgrades.

### Key Fields

- `srs_card`
  - `deck_id`, `translation_id`, `direction`
  - `state` (`new`, `learning`, `review`, `relearning`)
  - `due_at`, `interval_days`, `ease`, `reps`, `lapses`, `step_index`
  - `stability`, `difficulty` (nullable; reserved for future FSRS)
- `srs_review_log`
  - `srs_card_id`, `deck_id`, `translation_id`, `direction`
  - `reviewed_at`, `rating` (`failed`, `hard`, `good`, `easy`)
  - before/after snapshots: `state_*`, `interval_*`, `ease_*`, `due_*`

## Scheduling

- Scheduling is SM-2 inspired (Anki-aligned) with learning steps.
- **Learning phase (new cards)**:
  - Failed: 1 minute (resets to step 0)
  - Hard: 5 minutes (stays at current step, doesn't advance)
  - Good: 10 minutes → 1 day (first press: 10m, second press: graduates to 1 day)
  - Easy: 4 days (immediately graduates)
- **Relearn steps**: `10m` (after lapsing a review card)
- **Review phase**:
  - Failed: -0.20 ease penalty, interval resets to 1 day, enters relearning
  - Hard: -0.15 ease, interval × 1.2
  - Good: interval × ease (no ease change)
  - Easy: +0.15 ease, interval × ease × 1.3
- Ease factor is clamped to minimum 1.3 (matching Anki).
- The next due time is stored as a timestamp to support intra-day learning
  steps.
- Review history is logged for each rating event.

## Daily Limits and Rollover

- Daily limits are per-deck:
  - `maxNewPerDay` - Maximum number of cards in 'new' state that can be seen for
    the first time each day
  - `maxReviewsPerDay` - Maximum number of review sessions for cards in
    'learning', 'review', or 'relearning' states each day
- Day rollover is computed with a configurable `dayStartHour` (default: 4am).
- Counts are derived from `srs_review_log` using the day start boundary:
  - New cards are counted by `state_before = 'new'` in the review log
  - Reviews are counted by `state_before != 'new'` in the review log
- **Important**: Daily limits are applied when the session queue is initially
  built. Cards reinserted later in the same session (because they are still due
  today) are not re-checked against daily limits.

## Study Queue

The queue is built per deck following these rules:

1. **New cards**: Only shown if under the daily limit (`maxNewPerDay`)
   - Fetches cards in 'new' state that are due (`due_at <= now`)
   - Limited to `maxNewPerDay - newCardsReviewedToday`
   - Sorted by `created_at` ascending (oldest first)

2. **Review cards**: Only shows cards that are actually due
   - Fetches cards in 'learning', 'review', or 'relearning' states where
     `due_at <= now`
   - Limited to `maxReviewsPerDay - reviewsCompletedToday`
   - Sorted by `due_at` ascending (most overdue first)

3. **Queue behavior**:
   - New and review cards are combined
   - The combined list is sorted by `due_at` and then adjusted to avoid adjacent
     cards with the same `translation_id`
   - During a session, the in-memory queue is updated in place (no automatic
     reload when exhausted)

### Example Scenario

Assume a deck with:

- 44 cards in 'new' state
- Settings: `maxNewPerDay = 20`, `maxReviewsPerDay = 200`

**Day 1 (First Session)**:

- User sees 20 new cards (maxNewPerDay limit)
- Each card reviewed with 'good' transitions to 'learning' state with first step
  (10 minutes)
- Remaining 24 new cards are NOT shown - they wait for subsequent days
- Session ends once no cards remain due today in the in-memory queue

**Day 1 (10+ minutes later)**:

- The 20 'learning' cards are now due for their next review
- User starts a new session and sees those 20 cards again (as reviews, not new
  cards)
- After completing learning steps, cards graduate to 'review' state

**Day 2**:

- User starts a new session and sees 20 more new cards (next batch from the 24
  remaining)
- Plus any cards from Day 1 that are due for review
- Pattern continues until all new cards have been introduced

**Day 3**:

- User starts a new session and sees final 4 new cards
- Plus any reviews that are scheduled for today
- No new cards remain after this

## UI Flow

- Review tab:
  - Deck picker, daily counts, and Start Review.
- Review session:
  - Prompt (front), reveal (back), rate with 4 buttons.
- Deck management:
  - Create/select decks, set active deck.
- Phrase detail:
  - Each translation pair can be assigned to a deck, which creates/updates its
    two cards.

## Review Session Flow (Queue Creation and Updates)

This section reflects the current implementation in `ReviewSessionScreen.tsx`
and `lib/srs/queue.ts`.

### Session Lifecycle

The review session follows a specific lifecycle:

1. **Screen Focus** → Session initializes (if not already initialized)
2. **Review Loop** → User rates cards, queue updates, next card loads
3. **Session End** → All cards scheduled for tomorrow or later
4. **Screen Blur** → Session state resets completely

When the screen loses focus (user navigates away), all session state is reset
via `useFocusEffect`. This ensures a fresh session starts when the user returns,
incorporating any new due cards.

### Session Initialization

On mount (or re-focus), `initializeSession()` runs once:

```
initializeSession()
├── Compute tomorrowStartMs via getNextStudyDayStart(now, dayStartHour)
├── getDailyLimitsRemaining(db, { deckId, now, dayStartHour, maxNewPerDay, maxReviewsPerDay })
│   ├── Query srs_review_log for reviews since day start
│   ├── Count new cards reviewed (state_before = 'new')
│   ├── Count reviews completed (state_before != 'new')
│   └── Return { newRemaining, reviewsRemaining }
├── getReviewQueue(db, { deckId, nowMs, reviewsRemaining, newRemaining })
│   ├── Fetch review cards (learning/review/relearning) where due_at <= now
│   ├── Fetch new cards where due_at <= now (up to newRemaining)
│   ├── Combine and pass through sortCardsMaintainingSeparation()
│   └── Return sorted queue
├── Store sessionCards and compute initial stats
├── countCardsStillDueToday(db, { cardIds, tomorrowStartMs })
└── Hydrate and display first card
```

> **Known limitation**: `tomorrowStartMs` is calculated once at session start
> and does not update during the session. If a user reviews across the
> `dayStartHour` boundary (e.g., starts at 3:50 AM and continues past 4:00 AM
> with default settings), the "due today" threshold becomes stale. This is
> acceptable because users rarely review across day boundaries, and the session
> resets when the screen loses focus.

### Loading the Next Card

`loadNextCard(queue, startIndex)` finds and displays the next due card:

```
loadNextCard(queue, startIndex)
├── If queue is empty → setCurrentItem(null), end session
├── getNextDueCardIndex({ queue, nowMs, startIndex })
│   └── Linear scan from startIndex, return first card where dueAt <= nowMs
├── If null and startIndex > 0 → Wrap around: getNextDueCardIndex({ queue, nowMs, startIndex: 0 })
│   └── Cards earlier in queue may have become due after being rescheduled
├── If still null → No due cards, setCurrentItem(null), end session
├── Re-fetch card from database (ensures fresh scheduling data)
├── hydrateCard(freshCard)
│   ├── Fetch translation, primary phrase, secondary phrase
│   ├── Determine front/back based on card.direction
│   └── Return { card, translation, front, back } or null on failure
├── If hydration fails → Remove card from queue, recursively try next
└── Set currentItem, showBack=false, update currentIndex
```

**Key behaviors:**

- **Wrap-around search**: If no due card is found from `startIndex` forward,
  searches from index 0 to catch cards that became due earlier in the queue
- **Fresh data**: Cards are re-fetched from the database before display to avoid
  stale scheduling data
- **Graceful hydration failure**: If a card can't be hydrated (missing
  translation/phrases), it's removed from the queue and the next card is tried

### Per-Rating Update Flow

When the user rates a card, `handleRate(rating)` executes:

```
handleRate(rating)
├── scheduleSm2Review(cardState, rating, nowMs)
│   └── Compute new { state, dueAt, intervalDays, ease, reps, lapses, stepIndex }
├── db.write()
│   ├── Update srs_card with new scheduling fields
│   └── Create srs_review_log entry with before/after snapshots
├── Decide reinsertion:
│   ├── If update.dueAt < tomorrowStartMs → Re-fetch card from DB
│   └── Otherwise → Card exits queue (scheduled for tomorrow+)
├── applyCardRescheduleToQueue({ queue, currentCardId, refreshedCard, tomorrowStartMs, currentIndex })
│   ├── Remove current card from queue
│   ├── If still due today → insertCardMaintainingSeparation(queue, refreshedCard)
│   └── Compute nextStartIndex (accounting for queue shifts)
├── Update sessionCards with new queue
├── countCardsStillDueToday(db, { cardIds, tomorrowStartMs })
├── Update sessionStats.remainingToday
├── Track completed cards:
│   └── If update.dueAt >= tomorrowStartMs → Add card.id to completedCardIds Set
├── If remainingToday === 0 → Session complete, setCurrentItem(null)
└── Otherwise → loadNextCard(newQueue, nextStartIndex)
```

### Queue Index Management

`applyCardRescheduleToQueue()` handles the complexity of maintaining correct
indices after queue mutations:

```
applyCardRescheduleToQueue({ queue, currentCardId, refreshedCard, tomorrowStartMs, currentIndex })
├── Remove current card: newQueue = queue.filter(c => c.id !== currentCardId)
├── If card still due today:
│   ├── insertCardMaintainingSeparation(newQueue, refreshedCard)
│   ├── Find reinsertedIndex
│   └── If reinsertedIndex <= currentIndex → nextStartIndex = currentIndex + 1
│       (Card inserted at/before our position, need to skip over it)
├── If nextStartIndex >= newQueue.length → Clamp (handled by wrap-around in loadNextCard)
└── Return { queue: newQueue, nextStartIndex }
```

### Translation Pair Separation

To avoid showing both directions of a translation pair back-to-back (e.g., "dog
→ perro" then "perro → dog"), two algorithms maintain separation:

**`sortCardsMaintainingSeparation(cards)`** - Initial queue sorting:

```
1. Sort cards by due_at ascending
2. Iterate looking for adjacent pairs with same translation_id
3. For each pair found:
   a. Look ahead up to 5 positions for a swap candidate
   b. Swap only if urgency difference < 1 hour
   c. If no forward candidate, look backward up to 5 positions
4. Repeat until no swaps made or max iterations reached
```

**`insertCardMaintainingSeparation(queue, card)`** - Reinsertion during session:

```
1. Find ideal position based on card.dueAt (maintain urgency order)
2. Check if insertion creates adjacent pair (same translation_id as neighbors)
3. If pair would be created:
   a. Search forward for next valid position
   b. Insert at first position with no adjacent pair
4. If no valid position found → Append to end
```

**Note**: If translation pairs are naturally more than 1 hour apart in `due_at`
with no other cards between them, they may appear sequentially. This is
acceptable since they're temporally distant anyway.

### Session Statistics

The session tracks:

- `totalInSession`: Number of cards in the initial queue
- `remainingToday`: Cards still due before `tomorrowStartMs` (recalculated after
  each rating)
- `completedCardIds`: Set of unique card IDs scheduled for tomorrow or later

`completedCardIds.size` represents unique cards completed, not total reviews. A
card reviewed multiple times during learning steps only counts once when it
finally graduates to tomorrow.
