# Specification

Expertise for working with software specifications.

## What Makes a Good Specification

A specification describes the **target state**—what the system looks like when complete.

| Specification IS | Specification is NOT |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Target state description | Implementation plan |
| Design decisions (what) | Decision rationale (why) |
| Declarative statements | Narrative explanations |

**Core principle: Constrain design, open implementation.**

- Specify all user-visible decisions
- Leave internal implementation choices to implementers
- If an implementer must guess a design decision, the specification is incomplete

**Anti-patterns:**
- `Note:` — If clarification needed, specification is unclear. Rewrite directly.
- `(Future)`, `(v2)` — Describes target state, not phases. Remove or split into separate spec.
- `(Optional)` — Either required for target state or belongs in Non-goals.

## Three Layers

Complete specifications address three layers:

| Layer | Purpose | Key Question |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| Intent | Why this exists | What problem for whom? |
| Design | What to build | What boundaries, interfaces, behaviors? |
| Consistency | How to stay unified | What patterns for similar problems? |

### Intent Layer

Provides context for judgment calls:

| Element | Role | Core |
|---------|------|------|
| Purpose | What problem the system solves | ✓ |
| Users | Who uses it, what they accomplish | ✓ |
| Impacts | What behavior changes indicate success (drives priority) | |
| Success criteria | What defines "done" and "working" | |
| Non-goals | What is explicitly out of scope | |

Without intent, implementers make technically correct but misaligned decisions.

### Design Layer

Defines observable behaviors and boundaries:

| Element | Role | Format | Core |
|---------|------|--------|------|
| System boundary | What's inside vs outside | See Boundary types | |
| User journeys | Task flows achieving impacts | Context → Action → Outcome | |
| Interfaces | Contracts between internal modules | - | |
| Presenter | How system presents to users | UI: colors, layout / CLI: output format / API: response structure | |
| Behaviors | Outcomes for each state × operation | State + Operation → Result | ✓ |
| Error scenarios | How failures are handled | - | ✓ |

**Boundary types:**

| Type | Defines | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Responsibility | What system does / does not do | "Validates input; does not store history" |
| Interaction | Input assumptions / Output guarantees | "Assumes authenticated user; Returns JSON only" |
| Control | What system controls / depends on | "Controls order state; Depends on payment service" |

### Consistency Layer

Establishes patterns for uniform implementation (all items enhance quality, none required for minimal spec):

| Concept | Role | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| Context | Shared understanding | "This is event-driven" |
| Terminology | Same concept uses same name throughout | "Order" not "Purchase/Transaction/Request" |
| Pattern | Recurring situation → approach | "State changes via events" |
| Form | Expected structure | "Events have type, payload", "Primary: #FF0000", "Errors to stderr" |
| Contract | Interaction agreement | "Handlers must be idempotent" |

Weave these into relevant sections rather than listing separately.

### Implementation Standards (Optional)

For projects requiring code-level consistency across multiple contributors or extended development periods.

| Category | Purpose | Examples |
|----------|---------|----------|
| Architecture | Module boundaries and dependencies | Clean Architecture, Hexagonal, Layered |
| Design Patterns | Reusable solutions | Repository, Factory, Strategy |
| Testing Style | Test structure and conventions | Given-When-Then, Arrange-Act-Assert |
| Code Organization | Directory structure and naming | Feature-based, layer-based, naming conventions |

**When to include:**
- Multiple contributors work on the codebase
- Development spans extended periods
- Codebase requires shared conventions

**When to skip:**
- Simple scripts or single-file utilities
- Prototypes or proof-of-concept
- Short-lived projects

## Quality Criteria

### Specification Rubric

Rate each item Y (yes) or N (no).

**Intent Layer**
| # | Criterion | Required | Y/N |
|---|-----------|----------|-----|
| 1 | Purpose stated in one sentence? | ✓ | |
| 2 | Target users identified? | ✓ | |
| 3 | Impacts (behavior changes) identified? | | |
| 4 | Success criteria measurable or verifiable? | | |

**Design Layer**
| # | Criterion | Required | Y/N |
|---|-----------|----------|-----|
| 5 | Each documented feature has defined behavior? | ✓ | |
| 6 | Error scenarios cover all documented features? | ✓ | |
| 7 | Interaction points (internal and external) have explicit contracts? | | |
| 8 | Implementer can build without clarifying questions? | ✓ | |

**Consistency Layer**
| # | Criterion | Required | Y/N |
|---|-----------|----------|-----|
| 9 | Key terms defined and used consistently throughout? | | |
| 10 | Recurring situations have named patterns? | | |
| 11 | Two implementers would produce compatible results? | | |

**Passing Criteria:**
- All Required Y → Specification is usable. Stop unless improving quality.
- All items Y → Specification is complete. Stop.
- Any Required N → Must address before implementation.
- Non-required N → Address only if relevant to project scope.

### Balance Check

| Question | Design Decision (specify) | Implementation Detail (open) |
|----------|---------------------------|------------------------------|
| User-visible? | Error messages, CLI output | Log format, variable names |
| Affects modules? | Interface signatures | Internal functions |
| Needs consistency? | Error handling pattern | Algorithm choice |
| Could misalign? | Business rules | Performance optimization |

**Test:** "If implemented differently, would users notice or would modules conflict?"

**Warning signs of over-specification:** internal implementation details, algorithm choices (unless user-visible)

**Warning signs of under-specification:** vague terms ("appropriate", "reasonable"), undefined behavior for reachable states

## Common Problems

| Problem | Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|---------|-------|-----|
| Missing intent | Technical tasks instead of user value | No purpose/users defined | Add intent layer |
| Undefined scenarios | Inconsistent edge case behavior | Incomplete state coverage | Enumerate all combinations |
| Over-specification | Implementer constrained unnecessarily | Implementation details included | Keep only observable behaviors |
| Inconsistent patterns | Similar problems solved differently | No shared conventions | Extract and reference patterns |
| Inconsistent terminology | Same concept has multiple names | No shared vocabulary | Define key terms, use consistently |
| Vague language | Ambiguous interpretation | "Handle appropriately" | Use specific values or criteria |
| Hidden assumptions | Works only in specific context | Unstated prerequisites | Make all assumptions explicit |
| Explanatory notes | "Note: because..." appears | Mixing rationale with spec | Rewrite as direct statement |
| Phase markers | "(Future)", "(v2)" in spec | Mixing planning with spec | Remove; spec describes target state |

## Applying This Knowledge

### Progressive Approach

Apply to both writing new specifications and improving existing ones. When improving, identify current phase and proceed from there.

| Phase | Focus | Output | Confirm |
|-------|-------|--------|---------|
| 1. Intent | Why and for whom | Purpose, Users, Impacts | Rubric #1-2 Y |
| 2. Scope | What's included | Feature list, User journeys (Context → Action → Outcome) | List complete |
| 3. Behavior | How it works | Feature behaviors, Error scenarios | Rubric #5-6, #8 Y |
| 4. Refinement | Quality | Patterns, Contracts, Terminology | Rubric #7, #9-11 as needed |

**Rules:**
- Do not write Phase 3 details until Phase 2 is confirmed
- Phase 2 defines user-facing flows; Phase 3 defines internal behaviors
- Return to earlier phases when new understanding emerges
- Specification is usable after Phase 3 (all Required Y)

### When Reviewing

Assess against three layers:

1. **Intent**: Can I explain why this system exists and for whom?
2. **Design**: Can I predict behavior for any user action?
3. **Consistency**: Will similar situations be handled similarly?

Key questions:
- Is this complete enough to implement without guessing?
- Are all design decisions explicit?
- Will two implementers produce compatible results?

Flag: missing layers, vague language, implementation details that should be open, design decisions that should be specified.

### Splitting Content

**Default: Keep everything in SPEC.md.**

Use this decision table to determine when to extract content:

| Decides | Expands | External | → Action |
|---------|---------|----------|----------|
| Y | - | - | Keep in SPEC.md |
| N | N | - | Keep in SPEC.md |
| N | Y | N | May extract (summary + link) |
| N | Y | Y | Extract (link only) |

**Conditions:**
- **Decides**: Cannot understand what to build without reading this
- **Expands**: Complete definition of a decision (all fields, all cases)
- **External**: Maintained by different role/tool

**Examples:**

| Content | Decides | Expands | External | → Action |
|---------|---------|---------|----------|----------|
| Feature behavior | Y | - | - | Keep |
| Decision table | Y | - | - | Keep |
| Error handling rules | Y | - | - | Keep |
| API endpoints (3-5) | N | N | - | Keep |
| Full DB schema (50+ fields) | N | Y | N | May extract |
| Complete test cases | N | Y | N | May extract |
| Figma design | N | Y | Y | Extract |

**When extracting:**
- SPEC.md keeps the decision/summary
- Link: `See [Schema](docs/schema.md) for field definitions`
- Detail documents follow same principles

| Type | Location |
|------|----------|
| Data structures | `docs/schema.md` |
| Visual design | `docs/design.md` or external |
| Test cases | `docs/tests.md` |

**When updating specifications:**
- First determine: decision or detail?
- Decisions go in SPEC.md, details may go in referenced documents
- If adding to external document, verify SPEC.md has the governing decision

**Writing tip:** Use tables (like this decision table) to define boundaries and rules. Tables make conditions explicit and reduce ambiguity.

## Handling Uncertainty

### Undecided design choices

Do not leave gaps. Instead:

1. Present options with tradeoffs
2. Request a decision
3. Document the choice

### Incomplete information

Mark explicitly what is decided vs pending:

```
## Technical Stack

Decided:
- Runtime: Node.js >= 20

To be decided:
- Database: PostgreSQL or SQLite
  (depends on deployment target)
```

### Conflicting requirements

Surface the conflict explicitly and request resolution rather than making assumptions.
