name: spike
description: Time-boxed technical investigation with structured output. Use for feasibility studies, architecture exploration, integration assessment, performance analysis, or risk evaluation. Creates spike tasks in ohno, enforces time-boxing, generates spike reports, and creates actionable follow-up tasks. Triggers on "spike on X", "investigate whether we can", "how hard would it be to", "what's the best approach for", or any exploratory technical question needing bounded research. Use when this capability is needed.

# Spike

Structured technical investigation to reduce uncertainty. Answer specific questions, not "explore X."

**Integrates with:**
- `ohno` — Creates spike task, tracks time-box, logs findings
- `project-harness` — Works within session workflow
- All domain skills — May invoke for specialized investigation

```

## Quick Start

### 1. Frame the Question

Transform vague concerns into spike-able questions:

| Vague | Spike Question |
|-------|----------------|
| "Look into caching" | "Can Redis reduce our API latency to <100ms for user lookups?" |
| "Explore auth options" | "Can we use OAuth2 with Google for our auth flow?" |
| "Check if X is possible" | "Can library X handle 10k concurrent connections?" |

**Good spike questions have:**
- A yes/no or A/B answer
- Measurable success criteria
- Clear scope boundaries

### 2. Define Time Box & Success Criteria

```markdown
## Spike Definition

**Question**: Can we use Cloudflare D1 for our multi-tenant data model?

**Time Box**: 3 hours
**Type**: Feasibility

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Row-level security works for tenant isolation
- [ ] Query performance acceptable (<50ms for typical queries)
- [ ] Migration path from current PostgreSQL clear

**Out of Scope**:
- Full migration implementation
- Performance tuning
- Production deployment
```

### 3. Create Spike Task in ohno

```bash
# Create spike task
ohno add "Spike: D1 multi-tenant feasibility" --type spike --estimate 3h

# Or via MCP
create_task({
  title: "Spike: D1 multi-tenant feasibility",
  type: "spike",
  estimate: "3h",
  tags: ["spike", "feasibility", "database"]
})
```

### 4. Investigate (with checkpoints)

```
START → 25% checkpoint → 50% checkpoint → 75% checkpoint → CONCLUDE
 │           │                │                │              │
 │           │                │                │              └─ Write report
 │           │                │                └─ Evaluate findings
 │           │                └─ Check: On track? Pivot needed?
 │           └─ Initial findings assessment
 └─ Begin investigation
```

**50% Checkpoint (critical):**
```markdown
## Spike Checkpoint: 1.5h of 3h elapsed

**Progress**: 
- [x] Set up D1 database
- [x] Created test tenant structure
- [ ] Performance benchmarks
- [ ] Migration path analysis

**On Track?**: Yes / No / Pivoting
**Blockers**: None
**Adjustment**: [if any]
```

### 5. Conclude with Decision

Every spike ends with ONE of:
- **GO**: Proceed with approach, create implementation tasks
- **NO-GO**: Don't proceed, document why
- **PIVOT**: Different approach needed, create new spike
- **MORE-INFO**: Specific additional info needed (rare, max 1 re-spike)

## Spike Types

| Type | Purpose | Typical Duration | Output |
|------|---------|------------------|--------|
| **Feasibility** | Can we do X? | 2-4h | Yes/no + proof |
| **Architecture** | How should we structure X? | 3-6h | Design decision |
| **Integration** | How connect to service X? | 2-4h | Working connection |
| **Performance** | Can X meet requirements? | 2-4h | Benchmarks |
| **Risk** | What could go wrong? | 2-4h | Risk register |

See [references/spike-types.md](references/spike-types.md) for detailed type-specific guidance.

## Spike Report Format

Generate report in `.claude/spikes/` folder:

```markdown
# Spike Report: [Title]

**Date**: 2026-01-18
**Duration**: 2.5h (of 3h budget)
**Type**: Feasibility
**Decision**: GO ✓ | NO-GO ✗ | PIVOT ↺ | MORE-INFO ?

## Question
Can we use Cloudflare D1 for multi-tenant data model with row-level security?

## Answer
**YES** — D1 supports row-level filtering, performance is acceptable for our scale.

## Evidence

### What Worked
- Created test database with 3 tenants, 10k rows each
- Queries with tenant_id filter: 15-30ms average
- No cross-tenant data leakage in security tests

### What Didn't Work
- Bulk inserts >1000 rows timeout (need batching)
- No native RLS — must enforce in application layer

### Proof of Concept
Location: `/spikes/d1-multi-tenant/`
\```typescript
// Key pattern: tenant isolation
const getData = async (tenantId: string) => {
  return db.prepare(
    "SELECT * FROM data WHERE tenant_id = ?"
  ).bind(tenantId).all();
};
\```

## Recommendation
Proceed with D1. Application-layer tenant isolation is acceptable given our controlled access patterns.

## Follow-up Tasks
1. [ ] Design tenant isolation middleware
2. [ ] Create migration script from PostgreSQL
3. [ ] Set up batch insert utility for bulk operations

## Time Log
- 0:30 - Environment setup, D1 database creation
- 1:00 - Schema design, test data generation
- 1:30 - Query performance testing
- 2:00 - Security boundary testing
- 2:30 - Documentation and report
```

## ohno Integration

### Creating Spike Tasks

Spikes are tasks with `type: spike`:

```bash
# CLI
ohno add "Spike: [question]" --type spike --estimate 3h --tags spike,feasibility

# After completion
ohno done <spike-id> --notes "GO - see .claude/spikes/spike-name.md"
```

### Creating Follow-up Tasks

After spike concludes, create implementation tasks:

```bash
# From spike findings
ohno add "Design tenant isolation middleware" --parent <epic-id> --tags d1,security
ohno add "Create PostgreSQL to D1 migration script" --parent <epic-id>
ohno add "Implement batch insert utility" --parent <epic-id>
```

### Spike Task States

```
planned → in_progress → done (with decision)
                     └→ blocked (if external dependency)
```

## Anti-Patterns

### During Definition

| Anti-Pattern | Example | Fix |
|--------------|---------|-----|
| Vague question | "Investigate caching" | "Can Redis reduce latency to <100ms?" |
| No success criteria | "See if it works" | Define measurable outcomes |
| Unbounded scope | "Explore all options" | Pick ONE option to test |
| Too long | "1 week spike" | Max 1 day, usually 2-4h |

### During Investigation

| Anti-Pattern | Example | Fix |
|--------------|---------|-----|
| Scope creep | "While I'm here, let me also..." | Stay on question |
| Rabbit holes | Deep-diving tangent | 50% checkpoint catches this |
| Building too much | Full implementation | Proof-of-concept only |
| No checkpoints | Realize late you're stuck | Check at 25%, 50%, 75% |

### At Conclusion

| Anti-Pattern | Example | Fix |
|--------------|---------|-----|
| No decision | "It depends" | Force GO/NO-GO/PIVOT |
| No documentation | Knowledge lost | Write spike report |
| Vague follow-ups | "Continue investigating" | Specific actionable tasks |
| Re-spike loop | Endless "more info needed" | Max 1 re-spike, then decide |

---

## Decision Framework

### When to GO

- Success criteria met
- Risks acceptable and mitigatable
- Clear implementation path
- Performance/feasibility confirmed

### When to NO-GO

- Fundamental blockers discovered
- Performance requirements unachievable
- Complexity too high for value
- Better alternatives identified

### When to PIVOT

- Original approach won't work
- New approach emerged during investigation
- Scope needs significant adjustment

### When to MORE-INFO (use sparingly)

- Specific, bounded additional info needed
- Can be obtained in ≤2h additional work
- NOT "let's investigate more"

## Question Framing Guide

Transform vague concerns into spike-able questions:

| Concern Type | Vague Version | Spike Question |
|--------------|---------------|----------------|
| Feasibility | "Can we use X?" | "Can X handle [specific requirement] within [constraint]?" |
| Performance | "Is it fast enough?" | "Can X achieve <[target]ms for [operation]?" |
| Integration | "Will it work with Y?" | "Can X connect to Y using [method] with [auth]?" |
| Architecture | "How should we build it?" | "Should we use A or B for [specific aspect]?" |
| Risk | "What could go wrong?" | "What are the top 3 failure modes of X?" |

See [references/question-patterns.md](references/question-patterns.md) for comprehensive examples.
