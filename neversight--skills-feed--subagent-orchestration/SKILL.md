description: Orchestrate multi-phase development workflows with strict role separation between implementers and validators. Automatically executes plans using separate subagents for implementation, validation, and fixing with auto-retry loops. Use when building complex systems requiring (1) Multi-step sequential or parallel development phases, (2) Automated validation with typecheck/build/tests after each phase, (3) Auto-retry fix loops until validation passes, (4) Complete execution after single user approval. Triggers include "implement this multi-phase plan", "build a system with phases", "create [complex system] following this architecture", "automate development workflow with validation", or any request for orchestrated development with multiple phases and quality checks. NOT for simple single-file tasks or exploratory coding. Use when this capability is needed.

# Orchestrator CLI

Orchestrate complex development workflows across multiple subagents with strict separation of implementation and validation roles.

## Core Principle

**User validates plan once at start, then orchestrator executes completely with no mid-flight stops.**

**YOU ARE THE ORCHESTRATOR**: You execute the plan by dispatching subagents through natural language. There is no code running this - you make all decisions about when to dispatch implementers, validators, and fixers based on the workflow described below.

**🚨 CRITICAL**: As the orchestrator, you NEVER write or generate code yourself. You ALWAYS dispatch implementers with the COMPLETE plan requirements and instructions on which part to proceed with.

## Execution Model

**YOU execute this workflow** by dispatching subagents at each step:

```
START
  │
  ▼
User validates and approves plan
  │
  ▼
YOU execute each phase:
  ├─ For each phase:
  │   ├─ YOU dispatch IMPLEMENTER subagent with COMPLETE requirements
  │   ├─ YOU dispatch VALIDATOR subagent (different one!) to READ and REVIEW code
  │   ├─ If validation FAILS:
  │   │   ├─ YOU dispatch FIXER subagent
  │   │   ├─ YOU dispatch VALIDATOR again
  │   │   └─ YOU REPEAT until validation PASSES (up to 3 attempts)
  │   └─ If validation PASSES:
  │       └─ YOU move to next phase
  │
  └─ After all phases:
      └─ YOU report completion to user
```

**Important**: "Automatic" means you execute all phases without stopping to ask the user - not that code runs this. YOU (the orchestrator) make all decisions and dispatch all subagents through natural language, but you NEVER write or generate code yourself.

## Quick Start

### 1. Prepare the Plan

Create a detailed plan document specifying:

- Numbered phases with clear requirements
- Inputs (files to read) and outputs (files to create)
- Validation criteria for each phase
- Dependencies between phases
- Phase type: Sequential or Parallel

See [references/plan-template.md](references/plan-template.md) for full template.

### 2. Get User Approval

Present plan to user and confirm:

- "Execute this plan automatically?"
- Once approved, begin execution
- No further user interaction needed

### 3. Execute Automatically

For each phase:

1. Dispatch implementer → create/modify files
2. Dispatch validator → check requirements, run tests
3. If fails → dispatch fixer → re-validate
4. If passes → next phase

### 4. Report Results

After all phases complete:

- Success summary with statistics
- Or failure report with diagnostics

## Concrete Example

**User request**: "Build a task manager API with database, services, and routes"

**Your execution**:

1. **Phase 1: Database Schema**
    - Dispatch implementer with COMPLETE requirements: "Create src/db/schema.ts with tasks table following these exact requirements [paste complete requirements from plan]"
    - Implementer creates file
    - Dispatch validator: "Read and REVIEW src/db/schema.ts to verify all requirements are met, then run type check"
    - Validator: PASS ✓

2. **Phase 2: Database Client**
    - Dispatch implementer with COMPLETE requirements: "Create src/db/client.ts using schema, following these exact requirements [paste complete requirements from plan]"
    - Implementer creates file
    - Dispatch validator: "ACTUALLY READ src/db/client.ts to verify all requirements are met, check error handling is correct, then run type check and build"
    - Validator: FAIL (missing error handling in connection logic)
    - Dispatch fixer: "Add error handling per validator report"
    - Dispatch validator again
    - Validator: PASS ✓

3. **Phase 3: Services (Parallel)**
    - Dispatch 3 implementers simultaneously with COMPLETE requirements:
      - Implementer A: "Create task.service.ts following these exact requirements [paste from plan]"
      - Implementer B: "Create user.service.ts following these exact requirements [paste from plan]"
      - Implementer C: "Create auth.service.ts following these exact requirements [paste from plan]"
    - Validate each independently (each validator READS the code) → all PASS ✓
    - Integration check (type check + build all together) → PASS ✓

4. **Phase 4: API Routes**
    - Dispatch implementer with COMPLETE requirements: "Create API routes using services, following these exact requirements [paste from plan]"
    - Dispatch validator: "ACTUALLY READ all route files to verify requirements are met, then run type check and build"
    - Validator: PASS ✓

**Result**: Report to user "All 4 phases complete, 1 fix iteration in Phase 2"

This took 4 phases, 1 parallel phase, 1 fix loop - all executed without asking user.

## Critical Rules

### 🚨 CRITICAL: Orchestrator Code Generation Rule

**THE ORCHESTRATOR MUST NEVER WRITE OR GENERATE CODE**

The orchestrator's job is to:
- Dispatch subagents with the COMPLETE plan requirements
- Provide clear instructions on which part/phase to work on
- Coordinate the workflow and track progress
- **NOT write, modify, or generate any code yourself**

If you need code written, dispatch an implementer subagent with the complete requirements.

### 🚨 CRITICAL: Validator Code Review Rule

**THE VALIDATOR MUST ACTUALLY READ AND VALIDATE THE CODE**

The validator's job is to:
- **Read and understand every line of code created/modified**
- **Manually verify each requirement from the plan is met**
- Check code quality, patterns, and implementation details
- **NOT just run validation commands (typecheck, build, tests)**
- Report specific issues with file paths and line numbers

Running validation commands is important, but it's NOT enough. You MUST ACTUALLY REVIEW THE CODE by reading through it and verifying requirements.

### Rule 1: Strict Role Separation

**NEVER let one subagent do both implementation and validation.**

| Role            | Does                                        | Does NOT                |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Implementer** | Creates files, writes code                  | Validate their own work |
| **Validator**   | **Reads code**, checks implementation, runs typecheck/build | Modify code             |
| **Fixer**       | Repairs issues found by validator           | Validate the fix        |

### Rule 2: Complete Execution

Once user approves plan:

- Execute all phases automatically
- No user interaction during execution
- Only stop if a phase fails after max fix attempts (3)
- Report final result to user

### Rule 3: Validation Loop

For each phase:

1. Dispatch implementer → create/modify files
2. Dispatch validator → **ACTUALLY READ AND REVIEW** the code, check requirements, run tests
3. If validation PASSES → phase complete, continue
4. If validation FAILS:
   - Dispatch fixer with validator report
   - Dispatch validator again
   - REPEAT until pass or max attempts reached

## Dispatching Subagents

Use the templates in [references/subagent-templates.md](references/subagent-templates.md) when dispatching.

**Quick reference**:

- **Implementer**: Gets **COMPLETE** phase requirements from plan, creates/modifies files, does NOT validate
- **Validator**: Gets implementation + requirements, **ACTUALLY READS AND REVIEWS** the code thoroughly, runs typecheck/build/tests, does NOT modify code
- **Fixer**: Gets validator report, fixes all issues, does NOT validate

### When dispatching implementers:

ALWAYS provide:
1. **The COMPLETE requirements section from the plan** (not a summary)
2. **Specific instructions on which part/phase to proceed with**
3. **List of files to read** for context
4. **List of files to create/modify**
5. **Clear boundaries** - what they should and should NOT do

### When dispatching validators:

ALWAYS provide:
1. **Files that were created/modified** (complete list)
2. **The COMPLETE requirements section from the plan**
3. **Validation criteria** (typecheck, build, code review)
4. **Instruction to ACTUALLY READ the code**, not just run commands

**Example dispatch** (see templates for full format):

```
You are the Implementer for Phase 2 - Database Client.

Requirements from plan:
- Create connection pool using Drizzle
- Export typed database client
- Load DATABASE_URL from environment

Read: src/db/schema.ts (to understand schema)
Create: src/db/client.ts

Do NOT validate your work - a validator will check it.
Report when complete.
```

See [references/subagent-templates.md](references/subagent-templates.md) for complete templates with all sections.

## Phase Types

### Sequential Phases

Execute one at a time in order:

- Phase 1 complete → Phase 2 → Phase 3...
- Each phase must validate before next starts

Example:

```
Phase 1: Database schema
  Implement → Validate → Pass

Phase 2: Environment setup
  Implement → Validate → Pass

Phase 3: API implementation
  Implement → Validate → Pass
```

### Parallel Phases

Execute multiple sub-tasks simultaneously:

- Dispatch all implementers at once
- Wait for all to complete
- Validate each independently
- Fix any failures
- All must pass before continuing

Example:

```
Phase 3: Core services (parallel)
  Dispatch simultaneously:
    - Implementer A: Git manager
    - Implementer B: Database manager
    - Implementer C: Manifest manager

  Wait for all three to complete

  Validate each:
    - Validator A checks Git manager
    - Validator B checks Database manager
    - Validator C checks Manifest manager

  If any fail, fix that specific one

  All pass → continue to Phase 4
```

See [references/workflow-patterns.md](references/workflow-patterns.md) for more examples.

## Error Handling

### Implementer Fails

If implementer cannot complete:

- Log the failure reason
- Retry implementer (up to 2 times)
- If still failing → HALT execution
- Report to user: "Phase X failed during implementation"

### Validation Fails (Normal Flow)

If validator finds issues:

- This is expected, enter fix loop
- Dispatch fixer with validator report
- Re-validate the fixes
- Loop until pass or max attempts (3)

### Validation Fails After Max Attempts

If still failing after 3 fix attempts:

- HALT execution
- Report to user with full details:
  - Which phase failed
  - Validator's issue report
  - Files with problems
  - Suggestion to revise plan

### Dependencies Missing

If required files from previous phase don't exist:

- Previous phase didn't complete properly
- HALT and report issue
- Don't try to continue

See [references/error-handling.md](references/error-handling.md) for detailed recovery strategies.

## Progress Reporting

### During Execution (Optional)

Can report progress without requiring response:

```
Progress: Phase 3 of 7 complete
Current: Phase 4 - API Layer
Status: Implementing...
```

### Final Report - Success

```
EXECUTION COMPLETE

All [N] phases completed successfully.

Phases:
✓ Phase 1: [Name]
✓ Phase 2: [Name]
✓ Phase 3: [Name]
...

Statistics:
- Total fix iterations: [N]
- Files created: [N]
- Files modified: [N]

Build: ✓
Type check: ✓

Execution complete.
```

### Final Report - Failure

```
EXECUTION FAILED

Failed at Phase [X]: [Name]

After 3 fix attempts, validation still failing.

VALIDATOR REPORT:
[Specific issues found]

FILES WITH ISSUES:
[List files with line numbers]

SUGGESTION:
Review and update the plan, then re-execute.
```

## Prerequisites

- Development environment with build tools
- Project with validation commands appropriate to the language/framework:
  - **Type checking** if applicable (e.g., `tsc --noEmit`, `mypy`, type checking tools)
  - **Build/compile** if applicable (e.g., `npm run build`, `cargo build`, compilation steps)
  - **Code quality checks** for any language (linting, formatting, tests)
- Plan document following the template format (see references/plan-template.md)
- Ability to dispatch multiple subagent instances

Validation should be adapted to the project's language and tooling, not limited to TypeScript.

## Summary

**YOU execute the workflow**:

1. User approves plan once
2. YOU dispatch subagents for each phase (implementer → validator → fixer if needed)
3. YOU continue through all phases without user input
4. YOU report results at the end

**🚨 CRITICAL RULES - READ CAREFULLY**:

1. **YOU (orchestrator) MUST NEVER WRITE OR GENERATE CODE**
   - Always dispatch implementers with COMPLETE plan requirements
   - Give clear instructions on which part/phase to work on
   - Your job is coordination, not coding

2. **Validators MUST ACTUALLY READ AND VALIDATE THE CODE**
   - Reading code line-by-line is REQUIRED
   - Running commands alone is NOT sufficient
   - Manual verification of each requirement is mandatory

3. **Strict role separation**: implementer ≠ validator ≠ fixer
4. **Auto-retry fixes** up to 3 validation attempts per phase
5. **Halt only** on max retry failures or environment issues
