# Suno Upload

Automatically upload Suno prompt files to suno.com using Chrome automation. This skill parses your `prompt.md` files and fills the Suno Create interface with all the necessary fields.

## ✅ Fully Automated - No Human Intervention Required

This skill achieves **complete end-to-end automation** of the Suno song creation process:

- ✅ **Parses prompt.md files** - Extracts title, lyrics, style, model, and all parameters
- ✅ **Navigates to Suno automatically** - Opens suno.com/create and switches to Custom mode
- ✅ **Fills ALL form fields** - Including complex React slider components
- ✅ **Slider automation working** - Uses coordinate-based dragging for precise control
- ✅ **Submits and monitors** - Clicks Create button and tracks generation
- ✅ **Validated and tested** - Successfully generated songs with full parameter control

**No manual intervention needed** - Just point it at a prompt.md file and let it work.

## Prerequisites

- **Chrome MCP server** must be installed and active
- **Suno account** with available credits
- **Prompt.md file** in the standard Suno song creator format

## When to Use

Use this skill to:
- Upload generated prompt.md files to Suno
- Automate the song creation process on suno.com
- Submit multiple prompts efficiently
- Avoid manual copy-paste of lyrics and settings

## Workflow

### Step 1: Locate Prompt Files

Search for `prompt.md` files in the current directory and subdirectories.

**If multiple files found:**
- Display list with:
  - File path
  - Song title (from YAML frontmatter)
  - Project name (from YAML frontmatter)
  - Last modified date
- Use AskUserQuestion for interactive selection
- Present options clearly with full context

**If single file found:**
- Automatically select it
- Display which file was selected
- Show basic info (title, project)

**If no files found:**
- Error message: "No prompt.md files found in the current directory or subdirectories."
- Guidance: "Please navigate to a directory containing Suno prompt files, or create a prompt using the suno-song-creator skill first."
- Exit gracefully

**Tools used:**
- Glob - Search for `**/prompt.md` pattern
- Read - Extract YAML frontmatter for file listing
- AskUserQuestion - Interactive file selection

### Step 2: Parse Prompt File

Read and extract data from the selected `prompt.md` file.

**Parsing Strategy:**

**1. YAML Frontmatter (lines 1-12):**
```yaml
---
title: "Song Title Here"
project: "Project Name"
---
```
- Extract `title:` value
- Remove surrounding quotes if present
- This becomes the "Song Title" field

**2. Structured Prompt (under "### Structured Prompt" heading):**

Find the heading `### Structured Prompt`, then extract everything between the triple backticks:

```
genre: "bubblegum pop, synth-pop, disco-influenced pop..."
vocal: "bright female pop vocals, playful delivery..."
instrumentation: "synth bass, disco-inspired drums..."
production: "polished modern pop, wide stereo mix..."
mood: "playful, sarcastic, witty, upbeat..."
```

**IMPORTANT:**
- Copy the entire block as-is (all 5 lines)
- Do NOT parse individual fields
- This complete block goes into Suno's "Styles" field
- Keep all quotes and formatting

**3. Lyrics Section (after "## Lyrics" heading):**

Find `## Lyrics`, then extract everything between the triple backticks:

```
///*****///

[Verse 1 | playful | bright production]
Lyrics text here...

[Chorus | upbeat | full production]
Chorus lyrics here...
```

**CRITICAL Parsing Rules:**
- **REMOVE the divider line**: Skip `///*****///` at the start (this is just a separator in the file)
- **KEEP all meta tags**: `[Verse 1 | playful | bright production]` - Suno uses these!
- **KEEP section markers**: `[Verse]`, `[Chorus]`, `[Bridge]`, etc.
- **KEEP all blank lines**: Preserve formatting exactly
- **Start from first actual lyric content**: After removing divider, begin with the first `[Verse...]` tag

**Example extraction:**
```
File contains:
///*****///

[Verse 1 | playful | bright production]
You showed up late...

Extract as:
[Verse 1 | playful | bright production]
You showed up late...
```

**4. Model Selection (from "### Model and Parameters" section):**

Look for the model specification near the top of this section:

```markdown
**Model:** v5 (cleanest audio, most natural vocals - best for modern pop)
```

**Extraction rules:**
- **Model**: Extract value after `**Model:**` and before the opening parenthesis
  - Expected values: "v5", "v4.5", "v4.5+", "v4"
  - Trim whitespace: "v5"
  - Default to "v5" if not specified

**5. Parameters (from "### Model and Parameters" section):**

Look for bullet points under this heading:

```markdown
- Weirdness: 40%
- Style Influence: 60%
- Vocal Gender: Female
- Exclude Styles: Rock, Metal, Country
```

**Extraction rules:**
- **Weirdness**: Extract number before `%` (e.g., "40" from "40%")
  - If range like "30-40%", use midpoint (35)
  - Convert to slider value: use as-is (0-100 scale)
- **Style Influence**: Extract number before `%` (e.g., "60" from "60%")
  - If range like "60-70%", use midpoint (65)
  - Convert to slider value: use as-is (0-100 scale)
- **Vocal Gender**: Extract value after `:` and trim whitespace
  - Expected values: "Female", "Male", or unspecified
  - Map to Suno's gender buttons
- **Exclude Styles**: Extract comma-separated list after `:`
  - Trim whitespace: "Rock, Metal, Country"
  - Keep as comma-separated string

**Graceful Handling:**
- If field missing: use sensible default or skip
- If malformed YAML: try regex extraction as fallback
- If lyrics section empty: error (lyrics required for Suno)
- If parameters missing: use Suno defaults (50% for sliders)

**Tools used:**
- Read - Read the prompt.md file
- Regex/string parsing - Extract structured data

**Validation:**
- Title exists and non-empty
- Lyrics exist and non-empty
- Structured prompt exists and non-empty
- Parameters are within valid ranges (0-100 for sliders)

### Step 3: Display Parsed Data

Show the user what was extracted from the file for verification:

**Format:**
```
📋 Parsed Prompt Data:

Title: "Fixer-Upper"
Project: "Pop Songs I Love"
Model: v5

Lyrics Preview (first 200 chars):
[Verse 1 | playful | bright production]
You showed up late with pizza stains
On that shirt you wore last Tuesday
Asked me if I'd do your laundry
While you played your gam...

(Note: Divider line removed for Suno upload)

Style/Genre (from structured prompt):
genre: "bubblegum pop, synth-pop, disco-influenced pop..."
[Full 5-line structured prompt shown]

Parameters:
- Weirdness: 40%
- Style Influence: 60%
- Vocal Gender: Female
- Exclude Styles: Rock, Metal, Country

Ready to upload to Suno!
```

**Purpose:**
- User can verify parsing was correct
- Catch any issues before automation starts
- Builds confidence in the process

### Step 4: Initialize Chrome Session

Set up the browser automation environment.

**Steps:**
1. Call `tabs_context_mcp` to get current tab state
   - Check if MCP tab group exists
   - Get available tab IDs
2. If no MCP tab group: call `tabs_context_mcp` with `createIfEmpty: true`
3. Create new tab: `tabs_create_mcp`
   - Fresh tab for Suno automation
   - Prevents interfering with user's existing tabs
4. Navigate to suno.com: `navigate(url: "https://suno.com")`
5. Wait for page load: `computer(action: wait, duration: 3)`

**Error handling:**
- If navigation fails: retry once, then ask user to check connection
- If tab creation fails: inform user and exit
- If already on suno.com: ask if should create new tab or use existing

**Tools used:**
- tabs_context_mcp - Get tab context
- tabs_create_mcp - Create new tab
- navigate - Navigate to URL
- computer (wait) - Wait for page load

### Step 5: Navigate to Create Interface

Navigate from the home page to the Create page in Custom mode.

**Steps:**

1. **Navigate to Create page:**
   ```
   - Use navigate tool: "https://suno.com/create"
   - OR use find + computer tools to click "Create" button
   - Wait 2 seconds for page load
   ```

2. **Switch to Custom mode:**
   ```
   - Use find tool: query="Custom tab button"
   - Use computer tool: left_click on the Custom button ref
   - Wait 1 second for mode switch
   ```

3. **Verify Custom mode loaded:**
   ```
   - Take screenshot for debugging (optional)
   - Use read_page to verify "Lyrics" field is present
   ```

**UI Elements to find:**
- Create button/link (ref varies, use find tool)
- Custom tab button (vs "Simple" mode)
- Lyrics textarea (confirms Custom mode loaded)

**Error handling:**
- If Create page doesn't load: retry navigation once
- If Custom button not found: take screenshot, inform user
- If timeout: ask user to check Suno status

**Tools used:**
- navigate - Direct URL navigation
- find - Locate UI elements by description
- computer - Click buttons
- read_page - Verify page loaded correctly

### Step 6: Fill Form Fields

Fill each form field with the parsed data.

**Field-by-field process:**

**a. Model Selector (at top of Create area)**
```
- Use find: query="v5" or "model selector dropdown"
- Location: Top of create area, near Simple/Custom tabs
- Current default: v5
- Click to open dropdown if not already showing target model
- Select the parsed model (v5, v4.5, v4.5+, or v4)
```
**Data:** Model from Step 2 (e.g., "v5")
**Note:** Based on UI exploration, the model selector is visible at the top
**Implementation:**
- If model is "v5" (default): may skip (already selected)
- If model is different: click dropdown and select appropriate option
- Use find to locate the specific model option
- Use computer.left_click to select

**b. Lyrics Textarea**
```
- Use find: query="lyrics textarea"
- Use form_input: ref=<lyrics_ref>, value=<full_lyrics_text>
- Or use computer.type if form_input fails
```
**Data:** Full lyrics from Step 2 (with divider line `///*****///` removed, but all meta tags like `[Verse 1 | ...]` preserved)

**c. Styles Field (Structured Prompt)**
```
- Use find: query="styles textbox" or "style of music"
- Use form_input: ref=<styles_ref>, value=<structured_prompt_block>
```
**Data:** Complete 5-line structured prompt block

**d. Song Title (Optional)**
```
- Use find: query="song title optional"
- Use form_input: ref=<title_ref>, value=<song_title>
```
**Data:** Title from YAML frontmatter

**e. Expand Advanced Options**
```
- Use find: query="Advanced Options"
- Use computer: left_click on Advanced Options button
- Wait 1 second for expansion
```

**f. Exclude Styles**
```
- Use find: query="exclude styles"
- Use form_input: ref=<exclude_ref>, value=<exclude_styles_list>
```
**Data:** Comma-separated exclusion list (e.g., "Rock, Metal, Country")

**g. Vocal Gender**
```
- Use find: query="Female" (or "Male" based on parsed data)
- Use computer: left_click on the appropriate gender button
```
**Data:** "Female" or "Male" from parameters
**Note:** If unspecified, skip this field (use Suno default)

**h. Weirdness Slider**

**Data:** Parsed weirdness value (0-100)

**Working Method (Coordinate-Based Dragging):**

Sliders in Suno are custom React components (DIVs with ARIA roles), not standard HTML inputs. They require coordinate-based mouse dragging to set values.

**Step-by-step implementation:**

1. **Find the slider element:**
   ```
   Use find: query="Weirdness slider"
   This returns a ref to the slider with role="slider"
   ```

2. **Calculate target position with JavaScript:**
   ```javascript
   const slider = document.querySelector('[role="slider"][aria-label*="Weirdness"]');
   const thumb = slider.children[slider.children.length - 1];
   const sliderRect = slider.getBoundingClientRect();
   const thumbRect = thumb.getBoundingClientRect();

   // Current thumb center position
   const startX = thumbRect.left + thumbRect.width / 2;
   const startY = thumbRect.top + thumbRect.height / 2;

   // Target position (e.g., 40% along slider width)
   const targetPercent = 40;  // Use parsed value
   const targetX = sliderRect.left + (sliderRect.width * (targetPercent / 100));
   const targetY = sliderRect.top + sliderRect.height / 2;
   ```

   Use javascript_tool to execute this and return coordinates

3. **Drag thumb to target position:**
   ```
   Use computer: left_click_drag
   - start_coordinate: [startX, startY] (from JavaScript)
   - coordinate: [targetX, targetY] (from JavaScript)
   ```

**Why this works:**
- React state updates when the mouse drag event completes
- Coordinate calculation ensures accurate positioning
- getBoundingClientRect() provides precise pixel positions
- Dragging the thumb (last child element) triggers React's onChange handler

**i. Style Influence Slider**

**Data:** Parsed style influence value (0-100)

**Working Method (Same as Weirdness):**

Use the identical coordinate-based dragging approach:

1. **Find the slider:**
   ```
   Use find: query="Style Influence slider"
   ```

2. **Calculate coordinates with JavaScript:**
   ```javascript
   const slider = document.querySelector('[role="slider"][aria-label*="Style Influence"]');
   const thumb = slider.children[slider.children.length - 1];
   const sliderRect = slider.getBoundingClientRect();
   const thumbRect = thumb.getBoundingClientRect();

   const startX = thumbRect.left + thumbRect.width / 2;
   const startY = thumbRect.top + thumbRect.height / 2;

   const targetPercent = 60;  // Use parsed value
   const targetX = sliderRect.left + (sliderRect.width * (targetPercent / 100));
   const targetY = sliderRect.top + sliderRect.height / 2;
   ```

3. **Drag to target:**
   ```
   Use computer: left_click_drag from [startX, startY] to [targetX, targetY]
   ```

**Important notes for both sliders:**
- Do NOT use form_input (fails with "Element type 'DIV' is not a supported form input")
- Do NOT set ARIA attributes directly (doesn't update React state)
- Do NOT use keyboard events (Arrow keys don't trigger state updates)
- DO use left_click_drag with calculated coordinates
- Precision: Usually accurate within ±1%, which is acceptable

**Implementation Notes:**
- Fill fields sequentially, not in parallel
- Wait 0.5 seconds between field fills for UI stability
- Take screenshot after critical fields for debugging
- If field not found, log warning and continue (optional fields)
- If required field fails, error and exit

**Tools used:**
- find - Locate form elements
- form_input - Fill text fields
- computer (left_click) - Click buttons, interact with sliders
- computer (type) - Fallback for text input
- computer (wait) - Stability pauses

### Step 7: Confirmation & Review

Before submitting, show the user what will be submitted and ask for confirmation.

**Process:**

1. **Take screenshot of filled form:**
   ```
   - Use computer: screenshot action
   - Capture the entire Create form area
   - User can visually verify all fields
   ```

2. **Display summary to user:**
   ```
   ✅ Suno Form Ready for Submission:

   Title: "Fixer-Upper"
   Lyrics: 140 lines (with meta tags preserved)
   Style: bubblegum pop, synth-pop, disco-influenced pop...
   Weirdness: 40%
   Style Influence: 60%
   Vocal Gender: Female
   Exclude Styles: Rock, Metal, Country

   [Screenshot of filled form displayed above]
   ```

3. **Ask for confirmation:**
   ```
   Use AskUserQuestion:
   - Question: "Submit this song to Suno for generation?"
   - Options:
     * "Yes, create the song" (proceed to submit)
     * "No, cancel" (exit without submitting)
   - Wait for explicit user response
   ```

4. **Handle response:**
   - If "Yes": proceed to Step 8
   - If "No": inform user and exit gracefully
     - Message: "Upload cancelled. The form has been filled but not submitted. You can manually review and submit in the browser if needed."

**Why this matters:**
- User has final control before spending credits
- Catch any parsing errors before submission
- Visual confirmation builds trust
- Prevents accidental submissions

**Tools used:**
- computer (screenshot) - Capture form
- AskUserQuestion - Get explicit confirmation

### Step 8: Submit & Monitor

Submit the form and monitor for song URLs.

**Submission:**

1. **Find Create button:**
   ```
   - Use find: query="Create song button" or "Create button"
   - Expected ref like: ref_943 (based on exploration)
   ```

2. **Click Create button:**
   ```
   - Use computer: left_click on Create button ref
   - Wait 3 seconds for submission processing
   ```

3. **Monitor for response:**
   ```
   - Page may redirect or update with song generation status
   - Look for success indicators or error messages
   - Wait up to 10 seconds for initial response
   ```

**URL Extraction (if generation starts):**

4. **Check for song URLs:**
   ```
   - Suno typically generates 2 songs per creation
   - URLs may appear immediately or after processing
   - Format: https://suno.com/song/[song-id]
   ```

5. **Extract URLs:**
   ```
   - Use read_page to get page content
   - Look for song URLs in the recent creations area
   - OR check the workspace/library section
   ```

6. **Display results to user:**
   ```
   ✅ Song submitted to Suno!

   Generation started. Suno is creating your song(s).

   URLs (check these for your songs):
   - https://suno.com/song/abc123-def456-...
   - https://suno.com/song/xyz789-uvw012-...

   Note: Songs may take 1-2 minutes to generate.
   Visit the URLs above to listen once ready.
   ```

**Error Handling:**

- **Submit button not found:**
  - Take screenshot
  - Error: "Could not find Create button. Suno UI may have changed."
  - Offer to show screenshot to user for manual completion

- **Validation errors from Suno:**
  - Read error messages from page
  - Display to user: "Suno validation error: [error message]"
  - Suggest fixes if recognizable (e.g., "Lyrics too short")

- **Network/timeout errors:**
  - Error: "Submission timed out. Please check Suno manually."
  - Provide form status: "Form was filled and Create button clicked, but response not received."

- **Credits exhausted:**
  - If error message about credits appears
  - Inform user: "Suno credits exhausted. Please purchase more credits and try again."

**URL Extraction Fallback:**

If URLs cannot be automatically extracted:
- Inform user: "Song submitted successfully, but URLs could not be extracted automatically."
- Guidance: "Check your Suno workspace at https://suno.com/me for your newly created songs."

**Tools used:**
- find - Locate Create button
- computer (left_click) - Submit form
- computer (wait) - Wait for processing
- read_page - Extract URLs and errors
- computer (screenshot) - Debugging

### Step 9: Completion

Wrap up the automation and provide final status.

**Success case:**
```
✅ Suno Upload Complete!

Song: "Fixer-Upper"
Status: Submitted and generating
URLs:
- [Song URL 1]
- [Song URL 2]

Songs typically generate in 1-2 minutes. Visit the URLs above to listen!
```

**Partial success case:**
```
✅ Suno Upload Submitted!

Song: "Fixer-Upper"
Status: Form submitted, URLs not yet available

Check your Suno workspace for the generated songs:
https://suno.com/me
```

**Failure case:**
```
❌ Suno Upload Failed

Error: [Specific error message]

The form was partially filled. You can:
1. Complete manually in the browser (tab is still open)
2. Try running /suno-upload again
3. Check the error message above for guidance
```

## Error Handling Patterns

**File Not Found:**
- Clear message about what went wrong
- Guidance on how to fix (navigate to correct directory, create prompt first)
- No stack traces or technical jargon

**Parsing Errors:**
- Show which field failed to parse
- Show the problematic content if helpful
- Suggest fixing the prompt.md file
- Offer to proceed with defaults if non-critical field

**Chrome Automation Failures:**
- Take screenshot at failure point
- Show screenshot to user (visual debugging)
- Provide context about what was being attempted
- Offer retry option if transient failure likely

**Suno UI Changes:**
- If element not found after reasonable attempts
- Error: "Suno UI may have changed. This skill needs updating."
- Recommend manual upload as fallback
- Ask user to report issue

**Network Issues:**
- Distinguish between local network and Suno server issues
- Suggest checking internet connection
- Offer retry option
- Timeout values should be generous (10+ seconds for submission)

## Usage Examples

**Example 1: Single prompt file**
```
User: "Upload this to Suno"
Skill:
- Finds single prompt.md in current directory
- Parses: "Fixer-Upper" pop song
- Displays parsed data
- Navigates to Suno, fills form
- Asks confirmation
- User: "Yes"
- Submits and returns URLs
```

**Example 2: Multiple prompt files**
```
User: "/suno-upload"
Skill:
- Finds 5 prompt.md files in subdirectories
- Lists all 5 with titles and projects
- Asks which to upload
- User selects #3
- Proceeds with upload workflow
```

**Example 3: Called from suno-song-creator**
```
User: Creates song with suno-song-creator
Skill (suno-song-creator):
- Generates prompt, saves to prompt.md
- Asks: "Upload to Suno now?"
- User: "Yes"
- Invokes suno-upload skill with file path
- suno-upload proceeds automatically
```

## Known Limitations

**Slider Precision:**
- Coordinate-based dragging achieves accuracy within ±1%
- This variance is negligible and acceptable for creative parameters
- Browser rendering and viewport size don't affect the calculation (uses getBoundingClientRect)

**URL Extraction:**
- Suno's generation is asynchronous
- URLs may not appear immediately
- Fallback: direct user to workspace

**UI Changes:**
- Suno may update their UI
- Skill may need updates when UI changes
- Reference selectors may break

**Credit Requirements:**
- Skill does not check credit balance beforehand
- User must have credits for submission to work
- Error appears only at submission time

## Maintenance Notes

If Suno UI changes, update these sections:
1. Step 5: Navigation paths and button refs
2. Step 6: Form field selectors and names
3. Step 8: Create button selector
4. URL extraction patterns

Test with real prompt.md files regularly to ensure parsing remains accurate.
