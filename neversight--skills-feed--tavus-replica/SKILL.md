# Tavus Replica Skill

Create lifelike AI digital twins for video generation and real-time conversations.

## Stock Replicas (Ready to Use)

No training needed. Use these IDs directly:
- `rfe12d8b9597` - Default stock replica
- `re8e740a42` - Nathan

Full list: https://docs.tavus.io/sections/replica/stock-replicas

## Create Custom Replica

### Training Video Requirements

1. **Duration**: 1 min talking + 1 min silence (same video)
2. **Quality**: 1080p minimum, stable camera at eye level
3. **Lighting**: Diffuse, even lighting, no shadows on face
4. **Audio**: Silent room, no background noise
5. **Framing**: Face fills at least 25% of frame
6. **Expression**: Start talking segment with a big smile
7. **Background**: Simple, static, no moving objects/people

### Consent Video

Required for personal replicas. Record yourself saying:
> "I, [full name], consent to the creation of a digital replica of my likeness for use with Tavus technology."

Can be separate video or at start of training video.

### API: Create Replica

```bash
curl -X POST https://tavusapi.com/v2/replicas \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "replica_name": "My Avatar",
    "train_video_url": "https://s3.../train.mp4",
    "consent_video_url": "https://s3.../consent.mp4",
    "callback_url": "https://your-webhook.com/tavus"
  }'
```

Response:
```json
{
  "replica_id": "r783537ef5",
  "status": "training",
  "training_progress": "0/100"
}
```

Training takes **4-6 hours**. You'll receive a webhook or poll status.

### API: Check Training Status

```bash
curl https://tavusapi.com/v2/replicas/{replica_id} \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Status values: `training`, `completed`, `error`

### API: List All Replicas

```bash
curl https://tavusapi.com/v2/replicas \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### API: Delete Replica

```bash
curl -X DELETE https://tavusapi.com/v2/replicas/{replica_id} \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## Best Practices

- Use desktop recording apps (QuickTime, Windows Camera) not browser
- Pre-signed S3 URLs must be valid for 24+ hours
- Phoenix-3 model is default and recommended
- Test with stock replicas before training custom ones
