# Tech Debt Mode

Identify, catalog, and eliminate technical debt.

## Core Philosophy

> "Deletion is the most powerful refactoring."

**The 40% Rule**: In AI-assisted coding, expect to spend 30-40% of your time on code health—reviews, smell detection, and refactoring. Without this investment, vibe-coded bases accumulate invisible debt that slows agents and breeds bugs. Schedule regular code health passes, not just reactive fixes.

Every line of code:

- Must be understood
- Must be tested
- Must be maintained
- Can contain bugs

**Less code = less of all the above.**

## Debt Indicators to Find

| Category         | What to Look For                              |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Comments**     | TODO, FIXME, HACK, XXX, "temporary"           |
| **Code Smells**  | Duplicated blocks, long functions (>50 lines) |
| **Type Issues**  | Missing hints, `Any` types, type: ignore      |
| **Dead Code**    | Unused functions, unreachable branches        |
| **Dependencies** | Outdated packages, unused imports             |
| **Complexity**   | Deep nesting, long parameter lists            |

## Process

### 1. Scan

Search for debt indicators across the codebase:

- Grep for TODO/FIXME comments
- Find functions over threshold length
- Identify files with type errors
- Check for unused exports

### 2. Categorize

For each finding, assess:

- **Severity**: How bad is this?
- **Effort**: How hard to fix?
- **Risk**: What could go wrong?

### 3. Prioritize

Focus on:

- 🎯 **Quick Wins** - Low effort, high impact
- 🔒 **Safety First** - Fix risky debt before adding features
- 📍 **Hot Paths** - Prioritize frequently-touched code

### 4. Fix or Document

- Simple fixes: Just do it (with tests)
- Complex fixes: Create a plan for later

## Quick Win Examples

```python
# Before: Dead import
from typing import List, Dict, Optional  # Only Optional used

# After
from typing import Optional
```

```python
# Before: Bare except
try:
    data = fetch()
except:
    pass

# After: Specific exception
try:
    data = fetch()
except ConnectionError:
    logger.warning("Failed to fetch data, using cache")
    data = get_cached()
```

## Tech Debt Report Format

```markdown
## Tech Debt Analysis

### Summary

- **Total issues found**: X
- **Critical**: X (fix immediately)
- **Quick wins**: X (easy to fix)
- **Requires planning**: X (complex)

### Findings

#### Critical 🔴

| Location     | Type     | Issue                     | Effort |
| ------------ | -------- | ------------------------- | ------ |
| `file.py:42` | security | bare except hiding errors | Low    |

#### Quick Wins 🎯

| Location      | Type   | Issue             | Effort |
| ------------- | ------ | ----------------- | ------ |
| `utils.py:10` | unused | import never used | Low    |

#### Requires Planning 📋

| Location | Type        | Issue              | Why Complex              |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------------ | ------------------------ |
| `api.py` | duplication | 3 similar handlers | Needs abstraction design |

## When Fixing Debt

- ✅ Run tests after each change
- ✅ Keep changes atomic and focused
- ✅ Verify no regressions
- ❌ Don't mix debt fixes with new features
- ❌ Don't "refactor" working code without reason

## Safe Deletion Patterns

Before removing code, verify it's unused:

```bash
# Check for usages
ag "function_name" --python

# Check imports
ag "from module import function_name"
```

Watch for code that might be used dynamically:

```python
# ✅ Safe to delete: unused import
from typing import List  # 'List' never used in file

# ✅ Safe to delete: unused variable
result = calculate()  # 'result' never read
log(value)  # This is the actual intent

# ✅ Safe to delete: dead branch
if False:  # Will never execute
    do_something()

# ⚠️ Verify first: might be used dynamically
def _helper():  # Underscore suggests private, but check usages
    pass

# ❌ Don't delete without checking: exported function
def public_api():  # Might be called by external code
    pass
```

Also watch for:

- Dynamically called code (`getattr`, `eval`)
- Reflection-based frameworks
- External API contracts
- CLI entry points

## Cleaning Checklist

```markdown
- [ ] Unused imports removed
- [ ] Unused variables removed
- [ ] Dead functions removed
- [ ] Commented-out code removed
- [ ] Debug statements removed
- [ ] Duplicate code consolidated
- [ ] Tests still pass
- [ ] Types still check
```

## Debt Prevention Tips

To prevent future debt:

- Add TODO with issue tracker link: `# TODO(JIRA-123): refactor after migration`
- Use type hints from the start
- Write tests before marking done
- Review for simplification opportunities
