# Terminal Execution Guidelines

This skill defines the standard workflows for executing terminal commands to ensure reliability and visibility of outputs, particularly in complex environments like WSL.

## 1. Primary Execution Method

Always prioritize structured execution tools over raw terminal input when possible.

1.  **Use `execute_command`**: Call the `execute_command` tool from the `terminal-runner` MCP server. This provides the most reliable way to get exit codes and standard output programmatically.
2.  **Fallback**: If `terminal-runner` is unavailable, use the standard `run_in_terminal` tool.

## 2. Handling Missing Output (WSL/Complex Environments)

In some environments (like WSL), terminal output may not be returned to the agent context correctly, or it may be truncated. If you suspect output is missing:

### File-Based Capture Workflow

1.  **Prepare Directory**: Ensure `.tmp/copilot/` exists.
2.  **Redirect Output**: Run the command redirecting both stdout and stderr to a file.
3.  **Read Result**: Use file reading tools to inspect the output.

### Common Patterns

**Capture stdout and stderr:**
```bash
some-command > .tmp/copilot/output.txt 2>&1
```

**Capture and view live (if interactive):**
```bash
some-command 2>&1 | tee .tmp/copilot/output.txt
```

**Capture exit code separately:**
```bash
some-command > .tmp/copilot/output.txt 2>&1; echo $? > .tmp/copilot/exit-code.txt
```

## 3. Best Practices

- **File Naming**: Use descriptive names for capture files (e.g., `.tmp/copilot/build-log.txt`, `.tmp/copilot/test-results.txt`).
- **Cleanup**: Periodically clean up the `.tmp/copilot/` directory to avoid confusion with stale data.
