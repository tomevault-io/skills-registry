name: test-health-check-setup
description: Get alerts in Slack when your A/B tests need attention. Use when you want daily health checks for your Intelligems tests, need to know when conversion drops or traffic is low, or want to monitor statistical significance progress. Sends one message per test with clear status indicators. Great for single-brand monitoring. Use when this capability is needed.

# /test-health-check-setup

Create the Intelligems Test Health Check automation through conversation.

**What you'll get:**
- Daily Slack messages with health status for each active test
- Alerts when tests need attention (conversion drops, low orders)
- Clear statistical outlook for each test
- One message per test (not per brand)

**Based on:** [Jerica's tutorial](https://docs.intelligems.io/developer-resources/external-api/build-an-automated-test-monitoring-integration-for-slack)

## Setup Workflow

Follow these steps in order. Ask questions conversationally, then create files directly.

### Step 1: Project Directory

Ask where to create the project files.

Default: current working directory. If it's empty or home directory, suggest creating `~/Desktop/intelligems-slack-health-check/`.

### Step 2: Slack Webhook

Ask: "Do you already have a Slack webhook URL, or do you need help creating one?"

**If they need help creating one:**

Guide them through:
1. Go to https://api.slack.com/apps
2. Click "Create New App" > "From scratch"
3. Name it "Intelligems Health Check" and select workspace
4. Click "Incoming Webhooks" in sidebar
5. Toggle "Activate Incoming Webhooks" to On
6. Click "Add New Webhook to Workspace"
7. Select the channel and click "Allow"
8. Copy the webhook URL (starts with `https://hooks.slack.com/services/`)

**If using Chrome browser automation:** Offer to guide them through the Slack API website step by step.

Once they have the URL, save it for Step 4.

### Step 3: Intelligems API Key

Ask: "What's your Intelligems API key?"

Format is `ig_live_xxxxxxxxxx`. If they don't have one, direct them to contact Intelligems support.

This is for a single brand - unlike the agency digest which handles multiple brands.

### Step 4: Optional Threshold Customization

Show the default thresholds and ask if they want to change any:

| Setting | Default | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `MIN_SESSIONS_FOR_SIGNIFICANCE` | 100 | Minimum visitors before analyzing |
| `MIN_ORDERS_FOR_SIGNIFICANCE` | 10 | Minimum orders before analyzing |
| `CONVERSION_DROP_ALERT_THRESHOLD` | 0.20 | Alert if conversion drops 20%+ |
| `MIN_CONFIDENCE_LEVEL` | 0.95 | 95% confidence for conclusions |

Ask: "These are the default thresholds. Want to customize any of them?"

### Step 5: Schedule Time

Ask: "What time should the daily health check run? (Default: 10:00 AM)"

Convert their answer to 24-hour format for the scheduler.

### Step 6: Create Files

Read the templates from `references/file-templates.md` and create these files in the project directory:

1. **intelligems_health_check.py** - Main script (copy exactly from template)
2. **config.py** - Fill in user's thresholds
3. **`.env`** - Fill in user's API key and Slack webhook
4. **requirements.txt** - Python dependencies (copy from template)
5. **`.gitignore`** - Protects credentials (copy from template)

### Step 7: Install Dependencies

Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

```bash
cd {PROJECT_DIR}
python3 -m venv venv
./venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This isolates packages and avoids conflicts with system Python.

### Step 8: Daily Scheduler (Optional, macOS only)

Ask: "Want to set up automatic daily health checks?"

If yes:

1. Create the plist file at `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.intelligems.health-check.plist` using template
2. Replace `{PROJECT_DIR}` with the actual project path (uses venv Python automatically)
3. Replace `{HOUR}` and `{MINUTE}` with user's chosen time
4. Load the scheduler: `launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.intelligems.health-check.plist`

Tell user: "Your computer needs to be on at the scheduled time for the check to run."

### Step 9: Test

Ask: "Want to run a test health check now?"

If yes, run:
```bash
./venv/bin/python3 intelligems_health_check.py
```

Check Slack for the message. The format should show:
- Header with status icon (checkmark or warning)
- Test name
- Runtime and sessions
- Control vs variant metrics
- Key metrics with lift percentages
- Statistical outlook

### Step 10: Confirm Setup

Summarize what was created:
- Files location
- API key configured (masked)
- Scheduler status and time
- Commands for later use

---

## Commands After Setup

```bash
# Run health check now (from project directory)
./venv/bin/python3 intelligems_health_check.py

# Check scheduler status (macOS)
launchctl list | grep health-check
```

---

## Customizing Thresholds Later

Edit `config.py`:

```python
# Alert if conversion drops more than this percentage
CONVERSION_DROP_ALERT_THRESHOLD = 0.20  # 20%

# Minimum data before analyzing
MIN_SESSIONS_FOR_SIGNIFICANCE = 100
MIN_ORDERS_FOR_SIGNIFICANCE = 10

# Confidence level for conclusions
MIN_CONFIDENCE_LEVEL = 0.95  # 95%
```

---

## Troubleshooting

**No Slack message?**
- Check the terminal for error messages
- Verify webhook URL in `.env`
- Verify API key format: `ig_live_xxxxxxxxxx`

**Scheduler not running (macOS)?**
```bash
launchctl list | grep health-check
```

**Getting warnings for healthy tests?**
- Adjust `CONVERSION_DROP_ALERT_THRESHOLD` in config.py
- Lower the percentage for stricter monitoring

## Differences from Agency Digest

| This Skill | Agency Digest |
|------------|---------------|
| Single brand | Multiple brands |
| Health alerts per test | Summary per brand |
| Conversion drop detection | Lift + confidence focus |
| Based on Jerica's tutorial | Based on Victor's approach |
