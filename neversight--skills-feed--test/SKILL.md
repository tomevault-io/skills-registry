**Use TaskList tool** to check for existing tasks related to this work.

If a related task exists, note its ID and mark it `in_progress` with TaskUpdate when starting.
</tasklist_context>

<rules_context>
**Check for project testing rules:**

**Use Glob tool:** `.ruler/testing.md`

**If file exists:** Read it for MUST/SHOULD/NEVER constraints on testing patterns, frameworks, and conventions.

**If `.ruler/` doesn't exist:** Continue without rules — they're optional.

<progress_context>
**Use Read tool:** `docs/progress.md` (first 50 lines)

Check for recently implemented features that need testing.

# Test Workflow

Create or review test strategy. Optionally run test suite. Supports vitest and playwright primarily.

## Process

### Step 1: Detect Test Setup

**Use Glob tool to find test framework config:**

| Glob Pattern | Framework |
|-------------|-----------|
| `vitest.config.*` | vitest |
| `playwright.config.*` | playwright |
| `jest.config.*` | jest |
| `cypress.config.*` | cypress |

### Step 1b: Verify Fail-Fast Configuration

**Tests must fail fast.** Don't waste time waiting.

**Check playwright.config.ts has sensible timeouts:**
- `timeout: 30_000` (30s max per test)
- `actionTimeout: 10_000` (10s per action)
- `expect.timeout: 5_000` (5s for assertions)

**If tests hit LLM APIs:** Use tighter timeouts (5-10s). See `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/llm-api-testing.md`

**Never:**
- Set global timeout to minutes "just in case"
- Retry 5+ times to mask flaky tests
- Use arbitrary sleeps

**Reference:** `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/agents/workflow/e2e-test-runner.md` for full Playwright config

### Step 2: Determine Intent

"What would you like to do?"
1. **Review strategy** — Analyze current test coverage and approach
2. **Create strategy** — Design test plan for a feature
3. **Run tests** — Execute test suite
4. **Fix failing tests** — Debug and fix

### For "Review Strategy"

**Analyze test coverage:**

**Use Glob tool:** `**/*.test.*`, `**/*.spec.*` — count test files

**Use Grep tool:** Pattern `coverage` in `vitest.config.*`, `playwright.config.*` — check coverage config

**Report:**
- Number of test files
- Unit vs E2E balance
- Coverage gaps (if measurable)
- Missing test patterns

### For "Create Strategy"

For the given feature:

1. **Unit tests** (vitest)
   - Pure functions
   - Component rendering
   - Hooks behavior

2. **Integration tests** (vitest)
   - Component interactions
   - API mocking

3. **E2E tests** (playwright)
   - Critical user flows
   - Happy path + key error states

Output test plan:
```markdown
## Test Strategy: [Feature]

### Unit Tests
- [ ] [Test case]: [What it verifies]

### Integration Tests
- [ ] [Test case]: [What it verifies]

### E2E Tests
- [ ] [Test case]: [What it verifies]
```

### For "Run Tests"

**Determine test type from context or ask:**
- Unit/Integration tests → Run inline
- E2E tests → Run as background agent (prevents terminal crashes)

**Unit/Integration (vitest/jest) — Run inline:**
```bash
# Vitest
pnpm vitest run

# With coverage
pnpm vitest run --coverage
```

**E2E tests (playwright/cypress) — Run as background agent:**
```
Task Bash run_in_background: true: "Run playwright e2e tests and report results.

Commands:
pnpm playwright test

If tests fail, capture:
- Which tests failed
- Error messages
- Screenshot paths (if any)

Report summary when complete."
```

**Why background agent for E2E:**
- Playwright spawns browsers which can consume significant resources
- If tests hang or crash, your main session continues
- Verbose trace output doesn't fill your context
- You can continue working while tests run

Report results. If failures, offer to debug.

### For "Fix Failing Tests"

Follow `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/disciplines/systematic-debugging.md`:
1. Read error message carefully
2. Understand what test expects
3. Determine if test or code is wrong
4. Fix at source

**CRITICAL: Never blame "network issues" vaguely.**

It is almost NEVER a network problem. Common actual causes:

| Error Pattern | Likely Cause | NOT the cause |
|---------------|--------------|---------------|
| "ECONNREFUSED" | Server not running, wrong URL | "Network issues" |
| "Timeout" | Slow operation OR payload too large | "Network issues" |
| "400 Bad Request" | Invalid payload format | "Network issues" |
| "500 Server Error" | Bug in your code | "Network issues" |

**For LLM API failures:** See `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/llm-api-testing.md`

## Test Patterns

From `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/testing-patterns.md`:

**Good tests:**
- Test behavior, not implementation
- One assertion per concept
- Clear names describing what's tested
- Real code over mocks when possible

**Bad tests:**
- Testing mock behavior
- Vague names ("test1", "it works")
- Implementation details in assertions

## LLM API Testing

When tests call LLM APIs (OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.), follow the guidance in:

`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/llm-api-testing.md`

Key points:
- Validate payloads with schema before sending
- Use fast models (-flash, -mini) for tests
- Set aggressive timeouts (5-10s)
- Never conclude "network issues" without evidence

<success_criteria>
Test workflow is complete when:
- [ ] Test framework detected and configured
- [ ] Strategy documented (if creating strategy)
- [ ] Tests written and passing (if creating tests)
- [ ] Failing tests diagnosed and fixed (if fixing)
- [ ] All tests pass (`pnpm vitest run` or equivalent)
- [ ] Optional: test quality review offered (if tests written)
- [ ] Progress journal updated
</success_criteria>

<test_quality_check>
After tests pass, optionally offer a quality check:

"Tests are passing. Would you like me to review the test quality (assertion meaningfulness, isolation, flaky patterns)?"

If accepted, spawn the test-quality-engineer agent:
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/agents/review/test-quality-engineer.md`

Present findings and offer to fix any issues found.
</test_quality_check>

<arc_log>
**After completing this skill, append to the activity log.**
See: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/arc-log.md`

Entry: `/arc:test — [X passing, Y failing]`
</arc_log>
