## Quick Reference

### Pytest Commands
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific file/directory
pytest tests/test_agent.py
pytest tests/unit/

# Run specific test
pytest tests/test_agent.py::test_health_endpoint
pytest -k "health"           # Match pattern

# Verbose output
pytest -v                    # Verbose
pytest -vv                   # Extra verbose
pytest -s                    # Show print statements

# Coverage
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html

# Stop on first failure
pytest -x
pytest --maxfail=3

# Parallel execution
pytest -n auto               # Requires pytest-xdist
```

## Test Structure

```python
# tests/test_agent.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import Mock, patch, AsyncMock
from agent import app, AgentService

class TestHealthEndpoint:
    """Tests for /health endpoint."""

    @pytest.fixture
    def client(self):
        """Create test client."""
        app.config['TESTING'] = True
        with app.test_client() as client:
            yield client

    def test_health_returns_200(self, client):
        """Health endpoint should return 200 OK."""
        response = client.get('/health')

        assert response.status_code == 200
        assert response.json['status'] == 'healthy'

    def test_health_includes_agent_name(self, client):
        """Health response should include agent name."""
        response = client.get('/health')

        assert 'agent' in response.json
```

## Fixtures

```python
# conftest.py
import pytest
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

@pytest.fixture(scope='session')
def engine():
    """Create test database engine."""
    return create_engine('sqlite:///:memory:')

@pytest.fixture(scope='function')
def db_session(engine):
    """Create fresh database session for each test."""
    Base.metadata.create_all(engine)
    Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
    session = Session()
    yield session
    session.rollback()
    session.close()
    Base.metadata.drop_all(engine)

@pytest.fixture
def sample_agent(db_session):
    """Create sample agent for testing."""
    agent = Agent(name='test-agent', type='claude')
    db_session.add(agent)
    db_session.commit()
    return agent

# Parametrized fixtures
@pytest.fixture(params=['claude', 'gpt', 'gemini'])
def agent_type(request):
    return request.param
```

## Mocking

```python
from unittest.mock import Mock, patch, MagicMock, AsyncMock

# Basic mock
def test_with_mock():
    mock_service = Mock()
    mock_service.process.return_value = {'status': 'ok'}
    result = handler(mock_service)
    mock_service.process.assert_called_once()

# Patch decorator
@patch('module.external_api')
def test_with_patch(mock_api):
    mock_api.fetch.return_value = {'data': 'test'}
    result = service.get_data()
    assert result == {'data': 'test'}

# Async mock
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_async_function():
    mock_client = AsyncMock()
    mock_client.fetch.return_value = {'result': 'success'}
    result = await async_handler(mock_client)
    assert result['result'] == 'success'
```

## Parametrized Tests

```python
@pytest.mark.parametrize('input,expected', [
    ('hello', 'HELLO'),
    ('world', 'WORLD'),
    ('', ''),
])
def test_uppercase(input, expected):
    assert uppercase(input) == expected

@pytest.mark.parametrize('agent_type,expected_model', [
    ('claude', 'claude-sonnet-4-20250514'),
    ('gpt', 'gpt-4'),
    ('gemini', 'gemini-pro'),
])
def test_model_selection(agent_type, expected_model):
    agent = create_agent(agent_type)
    assert agent.model == expected_model
```

## Coverage Configuration

```toml
# pyproject.toml
[tool.pytest.ini_options]
testpaths = ["tests"]
python_files = ["test_*.py"]
python_functions = ["test_*"]
addopts = "-v --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing --cov-fail-under=80"
markers = [
    "slow: marks tests as slow",
    "integration: marks integration tests",
]

[tool.coverage.run]
branch = true
source = ["src"]
omit = ["*/tests/*", "*/__init__.py"]
```

## Using Extended Thinking for Test Design

**Integration with Extended Thinking Skill:** Before writing tests for complex functionality, use deliberate reasoning to design comprehensive test strategies that cover edge cases, error paths, and system behaviors.

### Why Extended Thinking Improves Testing

1. **Deeper Coverage Analysis**: Systematic reasoning identifies edge cases that intuitive testing misses
2. **Hypothesis Formation**: Formulate testable hypotheses about system behavior
3. **Risk Assessment**: Identify high-risk areas requiring more thorough testing
4. **Test Strategy Optimization**: Balance coverage depth with execution time and maintenance cost
5. **Mutation Testing Insights**: Reason about what changes should/shouldn't break tests

### Extended Thinking Process for Test Design

```python
"""
EXTENDED THINKING TEMPLATE FOR TEST DESIGN
Use this template when designing tests for complex functionality.

PHASE 1: UNDERSTAND THE SYSTEM
<thinking>
What is the core functionality being tested?
- Input requirements and valid ranges
- Expected outputs and side effects
- Dependencies and external interactions
- State transitions and invariants

What are the system boundaries?
- Valid/invalid input boundaries
- Resource limits (memory, time, connections)
- Concurrency boundaries
- Security boundaries

What assumptions exist in the code?
- Preconditions that must hold
- Postconditions that should be verified
- Invariants that should never be violated
</thinking>

PHASE 2: IDENTIFY TEST SCENARIOS
<thinking>
Happy path scenarios:
- Most common use cases
- Expected input/output pairs
- Normal state transitions

Edge cases:
- Boundary values (min, max, zero, empty)
- Off-by-one scenarios
- First/last element handling
- State boundary transitions

Error paths:
- Invalid inputs
- Missing dependencies
- Resource exhaustion
- Concurrent access violations
- Network/IO failures

Integration scenarios:
- Component interaction patterns
- Data flow through system
- Side effects on other components
</thinking>

PHASE 3: FORMULATE TEST HYPOTHESES
<thinking>
For each scenario, formulate testable hypotheses:

H1: "When given valid input X, the system produces output Y"
H2: "When input exceeds maximum value, the system raises ValidationError"
H3: "When concurrent requests modify the same resource, only one succeeds"
H4: "When external API fails, the system retries 3 times with exponential backoff"

Each hypothesis should be:
- Specific and measurable
- Falsifiable through testing
- Linked to a requirement or behavior
</thinking>

PHASE 4: DESIGN TEST STRATEGY
<thinking>
Test pyramid considerations:
- Unit tests: Fast, isolated, numerous (70-80%)
- Integration tests: Medium speed, component interaction (15-20%)
- E2E tests: Slow, full system, critical paths only (5-10%)

Property-based testing opportunities:
- Invariants that should hold for all inputs
- Commutative/associative properties
- Round-trip properties (serialize/deserialize)

Mock vs real dependencies:
- Mock: Fast feedback, isolate failures, but may miss integration issues
- Real: Higher confidence, but slower and more complex setup

Coverage targets:
- Critical paths: 100% coverage
- Error handling: 90%+ coverage
- Edge cases: Identified through boundary analysis
</thinking>

PHASE 5: IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
<thinking>
Test execution order:
1. Unit tests for core logic
2. Integration tests for component boundaries
3. E2E tests for critical user journeys
4. Performance tests for scalability requirements
5. Security tests for authentication/authorization

Fixture strategy:
- Session-scoped: Database connections, external service mocks
- Function-scoped: Test data, isolated state
- Parametrized: Test multiple scenarios with same logic

Assertion strategy:
- Positive assertions: Verify expected behavior
- Negative assertions: Verify error handling
- State assertions: Verify side effects
- Performance assertions: Verify timing/resource usage
</thinking>

### Hypothesis-Driven Development (HDD) Pattern

HDD combines TDD with scientific method thinking for more robust test design.

```python
# Example: Testing a multi-tenant authorization system

"""
HYPOTHESIS: Users can only access resources within their organization.

TEST STRATEGY:
H1: User A in Org 1 can access Resource R1 in Org 1 → SHOULD PASS
H2: User A in Org 1 cannot access Resource R2 in Org 2 → SHOULD DENY
H3: Admin in Org 1 can access all resources in Org 1 → SHOULD PASS
H4: System admin can access resources across all orgs → SHOULD PASS
H5: Deleted user cannot access any resources → SHOULD DENY
H6: User with expired session cannot access resources → SHOULD DENY

RISK ASSESSMENT:
- High Risk: Cross-org data leakage (H2) - REQUIRES THOROUGH TESTING
- Medium Risk: Role escalation (H3, H4) - TEST ALL ROLE COMBINATIONS
- Medium Risk: Session management (H6) - TEST EXPIRATION EDGE CASES
- Low Risk: Normal access (H1) - BASIC COVERAGE SUFFICIENT

## Hypothesis-Driven Development Integration

HDD extends TDD by making test assumptions explicit and measurable.

### HDD Workflow

```
1. FORMULATE HYPOTHESIS
   "I believe that [system behavior] will [expected outcome] when [condition]"

2. DESIGN EXPERIMENT (TEST)
   - What inputs will test this hypothesis?
   - What outputs indicate hypothesis is correct/incorrect?
   - What side effects should be observed?

3. IMPLEMENT TEST
   - Write test that would pass if hypothesis is correct
   - Make hypothesis explicit in docstring
   - Include risk assessment

4. IMPLEMENT FUNCTIONALITY
   - Write minimal code to make test pass
   - Verify hypothesis was correct

5. REFINE HYPOTHESIS
   - If test fails, was hypothesis wrong or implementation wrong?
   - What new hypotheses does this suggest?
   - What edge cases does this reveal?
```

### HDD Example: Payment Processing

```python
"""
DOMAIN: Payment Processing
CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: Idempotent payment operations

HYPOTHESES:
H1: Duplicate payment requests with same idempotency key return same result

H4: Concurrent payments with different keys both succeed

## Mutation Testing

Mutation testing verifies that your tests actually detect bugs by introducing intentional bugs (mutations) and checking if tests fail.

```bash
# Install mutation testing tool
pip install mutmut

# Run mutation testing
mutmut run

# Show results
mutmut results

# Show specific mutation
mutmut show <mutation_id>
```

```python
"""
MUTATION TESTING STRATEGY

Mutation testing introduces code changes (mutations) to verify tests catch bugs:
- Replace + with - (arithmetic mutations)
- Replace == with != (comparison mutations)
- Remove if conditions (conditional mutations)
- Replace True with False (boolean mutations)

MUTATION SCORE TARGET: 80%+

If mutations survive (don't fail tests):
1. Add test case for that scenario
2. Or: Remove unreachable/unnecessary code
"""

# Example: Code that should have high mutation coverage
def calculate_discount(price: float, customer_type: str) -> float:
    """

## Advanced Pytest Patterns

### Async Testing

```python
import pytest
import asyncio

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_async_api_call():
    """Test asynchronous API call."""
    client = AsyncAPIClient()
    result = await client.fetch_data()
    assert result['status'] == 'success'

# Test with timeout
@pytest.mark.asyncio
@pytest.mark.timeout(5)  # Requires pytest-timeout
async def test_with_timeout():
    """Test that completes within timeout."""
    result = await slow_operation()
    assert result is not None

# Test concurrent operations
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_concurrent_operations():
    """Test multiple concurrent async operations."""
    tasks = [
        async_operation(i)
        for i in range(10)
    ]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    assert len(results) == 10
    assert all(r['success'] for r in results)
```

### Dynamic Fixtures with Factory Pattern

```python
import pytest
from factory import Factory, Faker, SubFactory
from models import User, Organization, Membership

# Factory definitions
class OrganizationFactory(Factory):
    class Meta:
        model = Organization

    id = Faker('uuid4')
    name = Faker('company')
    created_at = Faker('date_time')

class UserFactory(Factory):
    class Meta:
        model = User

    id = Faker('uuid4')
    email = Faker('email')
    organization = SubFactory(OrganizationFactory)

# Fixture using factories
@pytest.fixture
def user_with_org(db_session):
    """Create user with associated organization."""
    user = UserFactory()
    db_session.add(user)
    db_session.commit()
    return user

@pytest.fixture
def multiple_users_same_org(db_session):
    """Create multiple users in same organization."""
    org = OrganizationFactory()
    users = [UserFactory(organization=org) for _ in range(5)]
    db_session.add(org)
    db_session.add_all(users)
    db_session.commit()
    return users
```

### Snapshot Testing

```python
import pytest

def test_api_response_snapshot(snapshot, client):
    """
    Test API response matches snapshot.

    Useful for testing complex JSON responses or rendered output.
    First run creates snapshot, subsequent runs compare against it.
    """
    response = client.get('/api/user/123')

    # Compare full response against snapshot
    snapshot.assert_match(response.json(), 'user_response.json')

def test_rendered_template_snapshot(snapshot, client):
    """Test rendered HTML matches snapshot."""
    response = client.get('/profile')

    snapshot.assert_match(response.data.decode(), 'profile_page.html')
```

### Test Tagging and Organization

```python
import pytest

# Smoke tests - critical path only
@pytest.mark.smoke
def test_critical_user_login():
    """Critical path test run in every build."""
    pass

# Slow tests - run nightly
@pytest.mark.slow
def test_full_data_migration():
    """Slow test run in nightly builds."""
    pass

# Integration tests
@pytest.mark.integration
def test_payment_gateway_integration():
    """Integration test with external service."""
    pass

# Security tests
@pytest.mark.security
def test_sql_injection_prevention():
    """Security-focused test."""
    pass

# Run specific markers:
# pytest -m smoke          # Run only smoke tests
# pytest -m "not slow"     # Skip slow tests
# pytest -m "integration"  # Run only integration tests
```

## Test Data Management

### Test Data Builders

```python
class UserBuilder:
    """
    Builder pattern for creating test users with fluent interface.

    Provides explicit, readable test data construction.
    """

    def __init__(self):
        self._user = User(
            email="test@example.com",
            role="member",
            status="active"
        )

    def with_email(self, email: str):
        self._user.email = email
        return self

    def as_admin(self):
        self._user.role = "admin"
        return self

    def in_organization(self, org_id: str):
        self._user.org_id = org_id
        return self

    def deleted(self):
        self._user.status = "deleted"
        self._user.deleted_at = datetime.utcnow()
        return self

    def build(self) -> User:
        return self._user

# Usage in tests
def test_admin_can_delete_users():
    admin = UserBuilder().as_admin().build()
    target_user = UserBuilder().build()

    result = admin.delete_user(target_user)

    assert result.success is True
```

### Database Test Isolation Strategies

```python
# Strategy 1: Transaction rollback (fastest)
@pytest.fixture(scope='function')
def db_session_rollback(engine):
    """
    Create session that rolls back after each test.
    FASTEST but doesn't catch transaction-related bugs.
    """
    connection = engine.connect()
    transaction = connection.begin()
    session = Session(bind=connection)

    yield session

    session.close()
    transaction.rollback()
    connection.close()

# Strategy 2: Truncate tables (medium speed)
@pytest.fixture(scope='function')
def db_session_truncate(engine):
    """
    Truncate all tables after each test.
    MEDIUM speed, catches more transaction issues.
    """
    session = Session(bind=engine)

    yield session

    session.close()
    # Truncate all tables
    for table in reversed(Base.metadata.sorted_tables):
        session.execute(table.delete())
    session.commit()

# Strategy 3: Drop and recreate (slowest, most isolated)
@pytest.fixture(scope='function')
def db_session_recreate(engine):
    """
    Drop and recreate all tables for each test.
    SLOWEST but complete isolation.
    """
    Base.metadata.create_all(engine)
    session = Session(bind=engine)

    yield session

    session.close()
    Base.metadata.drop_all(engine)
```

## Best Practices Summary

1. **Think Before Testing**: Use extended thinking for complex test design
2. **Make Hypotheses Explicit**: Document what you're testing and why
3. **Property-Based Testing**: Verify invariants with random inputs
4. **Mutation Testing**: Verify tests actually catch bugs
5. **Test Pyramid**: 70% unit, 20% integration, 10% E2E
6. **Isolation**: Use appropriate database isolation strategy
7. **Readability**: Test code is documentation - make it clear
8. **Performance**: Fast tests run more often - optimize test execution
9. **Coverage**: Target 80%+ line coverage, 100% critical path coverage
10. **Continuous**: Run tests on every commit, extended tests nightly
