# Transcript Polisher

Transform raw podcast or interview transcripts into polished, professional documents that maintain authentic voice while dramatically improving readability and flow.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Processing raw podcast transcripts from automated services (Rev, Otter, Descript, YouTube auto-captions)
- Cleaning up interview recordings or video transcripts
- Preparing spoken content for publication as articles or show notes
- Converting conversational content into readable written format

**Not for:** Written content that wasn't originally spoken, pre-polished articles, or scripts that are already edited.

## Core Philosophy

**Balance authenticity with clarity**: Remove everything that doesn't add meaning while preserving what was actually said. Create the "ideal version" of what the speaker wanted to communicate—without changing their words or ideas.

**Target**: 25-35% length reduction while maintaining 100% fidelity to meaning.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Add Document Structure

Create proper header with:

```markdown
# [Guest Name]: [Compelling Episode Title]

*[Podcast Name] Episode - [Host Names]*

---

## Timestamped Outline
[Add 10 chapters maximum - see guidelines below]

---

## [Time] Chapter Title
[Content starts here]
```

**Timestamped Outline Rules** (My First Million style):
- Format: `**MM:SS** - Descriptive Chapter Title`
- 10 chapters maximum for 45-60 minute episodes
- Focus on major topic changes, not minute-by-minute
- Use compelling, specific titles (not generic descriptions)

**Good Examples:**
- ✅ **12:25** - The 13th Percentile to Grade Level Miracle
- ✅ **29:08** - Why Successful Reforms Don't Spread

**Poor Examples:**
- ❌ **12:25** - Michelle talks about her students
- ❌ **29:08** - Discussion about education reform

### Step 2: Identify and Label Speakers

Replace generic speaker markers (>>, Speaker 1, etc.) with actual names:
- **Bold all speaker names**: `**Isaac:** Content here`
- Use first names for casual podcasts, full names for professional interviews
- Be consistent throughout

### Step 3: Aggressive Editing Pass

Apply aggressive polishing while maintaining 100% fidelity. See [Editing Guidelines](references/editing-guidelines.md) for detailed rules.

**Quick checklist:**
- Remove ALL filler words ("um," "uh," "you know," "like," "so," "I mean")
- Consolidate false starts and restarts
- Pick the clearest version when speakers repeat themselves
- Remove verbal hedging ("kind of," "sort of," "I think," "probably") when excessive
- Cut conversational detours that don't serve the narrative
- Fix awkward grammar and incomplete thoughts
- Keep only 1-2 strongest examples if speaker gives 5+
- Add clarity to vague pronouns (minimal bracketed additions)

### Step 4: Preserve What Matters

**Never edit:**
- Unique voice and natural rhythm
- Exact wording of powerful statements
- Emotional moments and authenticity
- Specialized terminology
- Cultural references that reveal personality
- Natural dialogue patterns

### Step 5: Quality Check

Before finishing:
- [ ] Length reduced by 25-35%
- [ ] All filler words removed
- [ ] Speakers properly identified
- [ ] Chapter breaks added with compelling titles
- [ ] Grammar fixed but voice preserved
- [ ] Key insights and stories intact
- [ ] No meaning changed or paraphrased

## Quick Reference

For detailed examples and transformation patterns, see:
- [Editing Guidelines](references/editing-guidelines.md) - Complete rules with before/after examples
- [Structure Template](references/structure-template.md) - Header format and chapter guidelines

## Common Transcription Errors to Fix

**Auto-caption issues:**
- OCR errors (e.g., "quad code" → "Claude Code")
- Homophone mistakes (e.g., "their" vs "there")
- Missing punctuation
- Run-on sentences
- Mis-identified technical terms

**Audio transcription issues:**
- Speaker confusion
- Overlapping dialogue
- Background noise artifacts
- Timestamp errors

## Output Format

Final polished transcript should be:
- Markdown formatted
- Properly sectioned with timestamps
- Speaker names bold and consistent
- 25-35% shorter than original
- Grammar perfect but voice authentic
- Ready for publication or repurposing

## Critical Reminders

**100% Fidelity Rule:**
❌ Never paraphrase or change meaning
❌ Never add ideas not present in original
❌ Never remove key insights or stories
✅ Only remove redundancy and inefficiency
✅ Preserve exact wording of powerful statements
✅ Keep all substantive content

**Aggressive Editing:**
❌ "So, um, I think that, you know, what we really need to focus on..."
✅ "What we really need to focus on..."

**Voice Preservation:**
❌ Removing authentic expressions like "bugged the crap out of me"
✅ Keeping natural language that shows personality
