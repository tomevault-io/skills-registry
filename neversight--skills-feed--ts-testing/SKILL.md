description: Design, implement, and maintain high‑value TypeScript test suites using popular JS/TS testing libraries. Use this skill whenever the user is adding tests, debugging failing tests, or refactoring code that should be covered by tests. Use when this capability is needed.

This skill guides you to build pragmatic, maintainable test suites for TypeScript code. Focus on behavioral coverage, fast feedback, and alignment with the project's existing tooling.

The user is a TypeScript‑focused developer. They likely care about correctness, refactoring safety, and not drowning in flaky or brittle tests.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when:

- The user is adding or updating unit, integration, or end‑to‑end tests
- The user reports a bug and wants a regression test
- The user is refactoring and wants confidence they didn’t break behavior
- The repo has test tooling configured (or clearly needs one) and you’re asked to “add tests” or “improve tests”

Do **not** invent a new test stack if the repo already has one. First detect and follow the existing setup.

## Library preferences

Always align with the repo first (check `package.json`, `devDependencies`, config files):

- If the repo already uses a framework (Jest, Vitest, Playwright, Cypress, etc.), **stick with it**.
- Only suggest new libraries if there is no obvious testing stack yet.

When you **must choose**, prefer:

- **Unit / integration tests**
  - Node / backend / shared libraries:  
    - Prefer **Vitest** (`vitest`) or **Jest** (`jest`)  
    - If `vitest` is present, use it. Else if `jest` is present, use that.
- **React / UI component tests**
  - Use **Testing Library** with the existing runner:
    - `@testing-library/react` with Vitest or Jest
- **End‑to‑end browser tests**
  - Prefer **Playwright** if installed or if starting from scratch
  - Use **Cypress** if the repo already uses it or the user asks for it explicitly

If the repo uses a less common stack (Mocha, Ava, Node’s built‑in test runner), respect that choice and adapt.

## Core testing philosophy

Follow these principles:

- **Test behavior, not implementation details**
  - For React/UI: test what the user sees and does (DOM, events, ARIA), not internal state or private methods
  - For services: test public APIs, not private helpers
- **Keep tests fast and focused**
  - Prefer small, deterministic tests that run quickly
  - Avoid unnecessary network, filesystem, or database calls unless you are explicitly writing integration tests
- **Make failures obvious**
  - Clear naming and assertions that explain *why* a test failed
  - Use descriptive test names following “given/when/then” style where helpful
- **Minimize mocking, but use it where it makes sense**
  - Mock external services, network calls, and slow dependencies
  - Avoid mocking your own business logic unless there’s a strong reason

## Standard workflow

When asked to add or improve tests, follow this workflow:

1. **Detect the existing stack**
   - Inspect `package.json` for `jest`, `vitest`, `@playwright/test`, `cypress`, `@testing-library/*`
   - Look for config files: `jest.config.*`, `vitest.config.*`, `playwright.config.*`, `cypress.config.*`
   - Check `test`, `unit`, or `e2e` scripts in `package.json`

2. **Locate the right place for the test**
   - Mirror existing patterns:
     - If tests live in `__tests__` directories, follow that
     - If they use `*.test.ts` or `*.spec.ts`, do the same
   - For UI: place tests near the component (e.g. `Component.test.tsx`) if that’s the existing convention

3. **Write the test in a TS‑friendly way**
   - Use `.test.ts` / `.test.tsx` (or `.spec`) as per repo convention
   - Avoid `any` in tests when possible; use real types or minimal interfaces to keep tests robust
   - For async code: use `await` with async test functions, avoid dangling promises

4. **Follow library‑specific best practices**

   **Vitest / Jest**
   - Use `describe` / `it` or `test` with clear names
   - Prefer `vi.fn()` / `jest.fn()` for spies and mocks
   - For modules: use `vi.mock()` / `jest.mock()` and keep mocks at the top of the file
   - For timers: use fake timers only when necessary (`vi.useFakeTimers()` / `jest.useFakeTimers()`)

   **React Testing Library**
   - Use `render`, `screen`, and user interactions (`userEvent`)
   - Query by role, label, text as a user would (prefer `getByRole`, `getByLabelText`)
   - Avoid querying by test IDs unless there’s no good semantic alternative

   **Playwright / Cypress**
   - Use existing fixtures and helpers (e.g. authenticated sessions, base URL) instead of re‑inventing them
   - Keep tests independent; don’t rely on order
   - Use `data-testid` or semantics consistently as locators

5. **Add regression tests for reported bugs**
   - Reproduce the bug in a failing test first
   - Only then change the implementation to make the test pass
   - Name regression tests clearly (e.g. `it("does not crash when X is null (regression #123)")`)

6. **Running tests**
   - Use existing scripts, e.g. `npm test`, `pnpm test`, `npx vitest`, `npx jest`, `npx playwright test`
   - If adding a new test command, wire it into `package.json` scripts following existing style

## Patterns to prefer

- **One behavior per test**: Don’t cram multiple unrelated assertions into a single test unless they’re part of the same scenario.
- **Helper factories**: Use small factory functions for building test data (`makeUser`, `makeOrder`) instead of duplicating setup.
- **Explicit async handling**: Always `await` promises; avoid passing async callbacks to APIs that don’t expect them.

## Anti‑patterns to avoid

- Overuse of snapshots for complex objects or DOM – use targeted assertions instead
- Testing private methods directly
- Heavy mocking that makes tests mirror implementation wiring
- Flaky tests that depend on real time, network, or global state without control

## TypeScript‑specific guidance

- Use the project’s `tsconfig` for tests when possible (`tsconfig.test.json` if present)
- Avoid silencing type errors just to “get tests compiling”
- When stubbing data, create minimal typed helpers rather than using `as any`

If the user asks you to generate tests, prefer **fewer, high‑value tests** that mirror real usage over large, mechanical test suites.
