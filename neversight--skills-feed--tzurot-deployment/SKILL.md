# Deployment Procedures

**Invoke with /tzurot-deployment** for Railway operations.

## Deployment Procedure

### 1. Merge PR to develop (auto-deploys)

```bash
gh pr merge <PR-number> --rebase --delete-branch
```

### 2. Monitor deployment

```bash
railway status --json
railway logs --service api-gateway -n 100
```

### 3. Verify health

```bash
curl https://api-gateway-development-83e8.up.railway.app/health
```

## Rollback Procedure

```bash
git revert HEAD
git push origin develop
# Railway auto-deploys the revert
```

## Log Analysis

```bash
# Tail specific service
railway logs --service bot-client -n 50

# Search for errors
railway logs --service api-gateway | grep "ERROR"

# Trace request across services
railway logs | grep "requestId:abc123"

# Find errors
railway logs | grep '"level":"error"'
```

## Environment Variables

```bash
# Preview changes (ALWAYS dry-run first)
pnpm ops deploy:setup-vars --env dev --dry-run

# Apply to dev
pnpm ops deploy:setup-vars --env dev

# List all for a service
railway variables --service api-gateway --json

# Set single variable
railway variables --set "KEY=value" --service ai-worker --environment development

# DELETE - Use Dashboard (CLI cannot delete!)
```

## Database Migration Procedure

> ⚠️ **Prisma uses LOCAL migrations folder!** Checkout the branch matching deployed code first.

```bash
# 1. Checkout correct branch
git checkout main  # For production

# 2. Check status
pnpm ops db:status --env prod

# 3. Apply migrations
pnpm ops db:migrate --env prod --force
```

## Running Scripts Against Railway

```bash
# Generic pattern
pnpm ops run --env dev <command>

# One-off script
pnpm ops run --env dev tsx scripts/src/db/backfill.ts

# Prisma Studio
pnpm ops run --env dev npx prisma studio
```

## Service Restart

```bash
# Note: 'railway restart' doesn't exist, use redeploy
railway redeploy --service bot-client --yes
```

## Troubleshooting Checklist

| Symptom            | Check                           | Solution                |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Service crashed    | `railway logs -n 100`           | Check missing env vars  |
| Slow responses     | `railway logs \| grep duration` | Check DB/Redis          |
| Bot not responding | bot-client logs                 | Verify DISCORD_TOKEN    |
| Migration failed   | `pnpm ops db:status`            | Apply with `db:migrate` |
