## UI Aesthetic Guidelines

### Core Principle: Distinctive Over Generic

The fundamental challenge is avoiding convergence toward predictable, machine-generated aesthetics. Create frontends that surprise and delight through creative, distinctive choices.

**Key focus areas:**

#### 1. Typography

Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic choices like Arial, Inter, or Roboto.

**Strong alternatives by category:**

- **Serif**: Playfair Display, Lora, Crimson Text, Spectral, Merriweather
- **Sans-Serif**: Poppins, DM Sans, Outfit, Syne, Epilogue, Manrope
- **Display**: Bebas Neue, Righteous, Abril Fatface, Fredoka
- **Monospace**: JetBrains Mono, Fira Code, IBM Plex Mono

**Typography combinations:**

- Playfair Display (headlines) + Lora (body) = Editorial elegance
- Bebas Neue (headlines) + Poppins (body) = Modern impact
- Spectral (serif body) + Outfit (sans UI) = Inverted tradition

For detailed typography guidance, font pairings, and implementation best practices, see `references/ui-aesthetics.md`.

#### 2. Color & Theme

Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes.

**Theme inspiration sources:**

- **IDE themes**: Dracula, Nord, Tokyo Night, Catppuccin
- **Cultural aesthetics**: Japanese minimalism, Scandinavian cool, Brutalist high-contrast
- **Contextual**: Match product domain while subverting expectations

**Implementation:**

```css
:root {
  --color-background: #0a0e27;
  --color-surface: #1a1f3a;
  --color-primary: #00ff9f;
  --color-accent: #ff0080;
  --color-text-primary: #e0e0e0;
}
```

**Avoid:**

- Clichéd purple gradients on white backgrounds
- Generic blue-gray neutrals
- Evenly-distributed, timid palettes

For complete color system architecture, theme examples, and gradient techniques, see `references/ui-aesthetics.md`.

#### 3. Motion & Animation

Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions.

**Strategic approach:**

- Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML
- Use Motion library (Framer Motion) for complex React animations
- Orchestrate page loads with staggered animation delays
- Add purposeful micro-interactions on key elements

**Example - Staggered page load:**

```css
.hero-title {
  animation: fadeInUp 0.8s ease-out;
}
.hero-subtitle {
  animation: fadeInUp 0.8s ease-out 0.2s both;
}
.hero-cta {
  animation: fadeInUp 0.8s ease-out 0.4s both;
}
```

For comprehensive animation patterns, timing guidelines, and performance optimization, see `references/ui-aesthetics.md`.

#### 4. Backgrounds

Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Layer CSS gradients, use geometric patterns, or add contextual effects.

**Effective techniques:**

- Layered gradients for atmospheric depth
- Geometric patterns (dots, grids, stripes)
- Subtle noise textures
- Contextual effects (spotlight, vignette)

**Example - Atmospheric gradient:**

```css
background:
  radial-gradient(ellipse at top, rgba(102, 126, 234, 0.15), transparent),
  radial-gradient(ellipse at bottom, rgba(118, 75, 162, 0.15), transparent), #0a0e27;
```

For background pattern libraries, image overlay techniques, and advanced effects, see `references/ui-aesthetics.md`.

## UX Psychology Principles

### Core Principles

#### 1. Cognitive Load Management

Minimize mental effort required to process information.

**Progressive Disclosure**: Reveal information gradually.

- Use accordion menus, step wizards, expandable sections
- Apply to: Complex forms, feature-rich interfaces, data dashboards

**Visual Hierarchy**: Establish clear priority through size, color, contrast, spacing.

- Primary: Main action (largest, highest contrast)
- Secondary: Supporting actions (medium size/contrast)
- Tertiary: Optional details (smallest, lowest contrast)

#### 2. Decision-Making Psychology

**Anchoring Effect**: First information encountered influences subsequent judgments.

- Show original price before discounted price
- Display completion time estimates upfront
- Set defaults that guide optimal choices

**Framing Effect**: How information is presented affects decisions.

- Emphasize gains over losses ("95% success" vs "5% failure")
- Use action-oriented language
- Focus on benefits, not just features

**Loss Aversion**: People feel losses roughly twice as strongly as gains.

- "You'll lose your progress if you leave now"
- "Your discount expires in 24 hours"
- Balance with positive framing (avoid pure fear tactics)

#### 3. Attention and Memory

**Peak-End Rule**: Users judge experiences by peak moment and ending, not average.

- Optimize highest-impact moment in journey
- Ensure final interaction leaves positive impression
- Apply: Onboarding "aha moments", celebration on task completion

**Zeigarnik Effect**: Uncompleted tasks are remembered better.

- Progress bars showing partial completion
- "Continue where you left off" features
- Profile completion indicators

#### 4. Behavioral Design

**Nudge Theory**: Subtle cues guide beneficial actions without restricting choice.

- Pre-select recommended options (allow changing)
- Highlight suggested paths visually
- Default to privacy-protecting settings

**Gamification**: Game mechanics increase engagement.

- Points/scores, levels/tiers, badges/achievements
- Use when: Learning platforms, productivity tools, community engagement
- Ensure mechanics serve user goals, not just metrics

**Social Proof**: People look to others' behavior.

- User counts, testimonials, ratings/reviews
- Activity indicators, expert endorsements
- Use genuine, verifiable proof only

For comprehensive UX psychology principles, implementation patterns, and ethical guidelines, see `references/ux-psychology.md`.

## Applying UI/UX Patterns

### Integration Strategy

Effective design combines aesthetic distinctiveness with psychological insight:

1. **Start with UX foundation**: Understand user goals, pain points, and decision points
2. **Apply psychology patterns**: Choose relevant UX principles for the context
3. **Layer distinctive aesthetics**: Add visual personality that enhances (not distracts from) UX
4. **Orchestrate key moments**: Focus design and animation effort on peak experiences
5. **Test and refine**: Validate that beauty and usability reinforce each other

### Common Design Scenarios

#### Landing Page

**UX considerations:**

- Anchoring effect: Lead with compelling value proposition
- Visual hierarchy: Clear primary CTA
- Social proof: Testimonials and user counts

**UI execution:**

- Distinctive typography for hero headline
- Orchestrated page load animation (staggered reveals)
- Atmospheric background (not solid color)
- Sharp color accent on primary CTA

#### Registration Flow

**UX considerations:**

- Progressive disclosure: Multi-step form, not overwhelming single page
- Foot-in-the-door: Start with minimal ask (email), build trust
- Zeigarnik effect: Progress bar to encourage completion

**UI execution:**

- Clear step indicators with visual feedback
- Smooth transitions between steps
- Success micro-animations on field completion
- Cohesive color system reinforcing brand

#### Dashboard

**UX considerations:**

- Cognitive load: Progressive disclosure of advanced features
- Visual hierarchy: Primary metrics prominent
- Decision fatigue: Smart defaults, reduce choices

**UI execution:**

- Strong typographic scale for metric hierarchy
- Unique color palette (avoid generic blue-gray)
- Subtle background patterns for depth
- Purposeful animations on data updates

#### Onboarding

**UX considerations:**

- Peak-end rule: Deliver "aha moment" early, end with success celebration
- Gamification: Progress tracking, achievement on completion
- Sunk cost: Show investment to encourage completion

**UI execution:**

- Delightful animations on milestone completion
- Distinctive illustration style (not generic undraw.co)
- Celebration moment with confetti or unique visual
- Consistent motion language throughout flow

### Balancing Beauty and Usability

**The aesthetic-usability effect**: Beautiful designs are perceived as more usable, but actual usability must match aesthetic promise.

**Guidelines:**

- Don't use aesthetics to mask poor usability
- Ensure clarity isn't sacrificed for style
- Test with real users, not just designers
- Maintain accessibility standards (contrast, reduced motion)

**Accessibility checklist:**

- Text contrast: 4.5:1 minimum (normal), 3:1 (large)
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` for animations
- Ensure keyboard navigation works
- Test with screen readers for complex interactions

### Avoiding Generic Aesthetics

**Common pitfalls:**

- Purple gradient hero sections
- Rounded cards with drop shadows everywhere
- Generic illustrations and stock photos
- Cookie-cutter layouts
- Overused fonts (Inter, Roboto)

**Creating distinctiveness:**

1. Reference unexpected sources (architecture, fashion, art movements)
2. Combine contrasting aesthetics intentionally
3. Commit to strong direction (don't hedge with "safe" choices)
4. Add contextual details that relate to content
5. Break conventions intentionally
6. Develop a signature (recurring motifs, unique spacing)

**Validation questions:**

- Does this feel thoughtfully designed or machine-generated?
- Have I seen this exact combination before?
- Does this design have personality and point of view?
- Would a user remember this interface?
- Does the aesthetic match the product's unique context?
