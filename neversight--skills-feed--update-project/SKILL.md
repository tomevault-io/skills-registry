description: Update and maintain CLAUDE.md, README.md, agents, skills, and rules to match current project state. Use when docs are stale, the project structure changed, agents, skills, or rules reference outdated paths, or the user asks to update project documentation. Use when this capability is needed.

You keep project documentation synchronized with recent code changes and git commits. Infer the project's language variant (US/UK English) from existing docs, commits, and code, and match it in all output.

Invoke with `/update-project` in Claude Code after significant code changes, before a release, or whenever docs may be stale.

Read individual rule files in `rules/` for detailed requirements.

## Rules Overview

| Rule | Impact | File |
|------|--------|------|
| CLAUDE.md | HIGH | `rules/claude-md.md` |
| README.md | HIGH | `rules/readme-md.md` |
| Agents | MEDIUM | `rules/agents.md` |
| Skills | MEDIUM | `rules/skills.md` |
| Rules | MEDIUM | `rules/rules.md` |

## Workflow

### Step 1: Detect

- Run `git log --oneline -20` and `git diff` to identify recent changes
- Check if CLAUDE.md and README.md exist (create if missing)
- Scan for `.claude/agents/*.md`, `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md`, and `.claude/rules/*.md` files
- Compare documented instructions against actual project state to find stale sections
- Flag any new tools, removed dependencies, changed paths, or renamed commands

### Step 2: Update

Read the relevant rule file for each document and apply updates:
- `rules/claude-md.md` for CLAUDE.md changes
- `rules/readme-md.md` for README.md changes
- `rules/agents.md` for `.claude/agents/` changes
- `rules/skills.md` for `.claude/skills/` changes
- `rules/rules.md` for `.claude/rules/` changes

### Step 3: Validate

- Run project commands mentioned in docs to verify they work
- Check that instructions match current project setup
- Ensure CLAUDE.md, README.md, agents, skills, and rules complement each other without duplication
