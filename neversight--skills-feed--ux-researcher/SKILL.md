## Survey Design

### Survey Structure

```
1. SCREENER (2-3 questions)
   - Qualification criteria
   - Segment identification

2. CORE QUESTIONS (10-15 questions)
   - Topic 1: [3-4 questions]
   - Topic 2: [3-4 questions]
   - Topic 3: [3-4 questions]

```

### Question Types

**Rating Scales:**
```
Likert (Agreement): Strongly disagree → Strongly agree
Satisfaction: Very dissatisfied → Very satisfied
Frequency: Never → Always
Importance: Not important → Very important
NPS: 0-10 likelihood to recommend
```

**Best Practices:**
- Use consistent scale direction
- Include "Not applicable" option
- Randomize option order where appropriate
- Limit matrix questions
- Test on mobile

### Sample Size Calculator

```
For 95% confidence, 5% margin of error:

Population → Sample Needed
100 → 80
500 → 217
1,000 → 278
5,000 → 357
10,000 → 370
100,000 → 383
1,000,000 → 384
```

## Data Synthesis

### Affinity Mapping

```
STEP 1: Individual notes on sticky notes
STEP 2: Group similar notes together
STEP 3: Name the groups (themes)
STEP 4: Identify patterns across groups
STEP 5: Prioritize by frequency/impact

Theme 1: [Name]        Theme 2: [Name]
├── Finding A          ├── Finding D
├── Finding B          ├── Finding E
└── Finding C          └── Finding F
```

### Insight Development

```
OBSERVATION → INSIGHT → IMPLICATION

Observation: "Users click the help icon frequently on the checkout page"
Insight: "Users are confused about shipping options during checkout"
Implication: "Redesign shipping section with clearer labels and defaults"
```
