description: Suite of tools for creating elaborate, multi-component claude.ai HTML artifacts using modern frontend web technologies (React, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui). Use for complex artifacts requiring state management, routing, or shadcn/ui components - not for simple single-file HTML/JSX artifacts. Use when this capability is needed.

# Web Artifacts Builder

To build powerful frontend claude.ai artifacts, follow these steps:
1. Initialize the frontend repo
2. Develop your artifact by editing the generated code
3. Bundle all code into a single HTML file
4. Display artifact to user
5. (Optional) Test the artifact

**Stack**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Parcel (bundling) + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui

## Design & Style Guidelines

VERY IMPORTANT: To avoid what is often referred to as "AI slop", avoid using excessive centered layouts, purple gradients, uniform rounded corners, and Inter font.

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Initialize Project

Create a new React project with:
- React + TypeScript (via Vite)
- Tailwind CSS 3.4.1 with shadcn/ui theming system
- Path aliases (`@/`) configured
- 40+ shadcn/ui components pre-installed
- All Radix UI dependencies included
- Parcel configured for bundling

### Step 2: Develop Your Artifact

Build the artifact by editing the generated files.

### Step 3: Bundle to Single HTML File

Bundle the React app into a single HTML artifact. This creates `bundle.html` - a self-contained artifact with all JavaScript, CSS, and dependencies inlined.

**Requirements**: Your project must have an `index.html` in the root directory.

**What bundling does**:
- Installs bundling dependencies (parcel, @parcel/config-default, parcel-resolver-tspaths, html-inline)
- Creates `.parcelrc` config with path alias support
- Builds with Parcel (no source maps)
- Inlines all assets into single HTML using html-inline

### Step 4: Share Artifact with User

Share the bundled HTML file in conversation with the user so they can view it as an artifact.

### Step 5: Testing/Visualizing the Artifact (Optional)

Use available tools (including other Skills or built-in tools like Playwright or Puppeteer) to test/visualize the artifact. Avoid testing the artifact upfront as it adds latency between the request and when the finished artifact can be seen.
