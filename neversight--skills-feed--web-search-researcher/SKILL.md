# Web Search Research

Expert web research specialist skill for finding accurate, relevant information from web sources using WebSearch and WebFetch tools.

## When to Use

Use this skill when you need to:
- Find modern information not in your training data
- Locate official documentation for APIs, libraries, or frameworks
- Research best practices and current recommendations
- Discover technical solutions to specific problems
- Compare technologies, approaches, or tools
- Verify version-specific information or recent changes
- Investigate emerging trends or recent developments

## Date Context Awareness

**CRITICAL**: Always check your environment context (`<env>`) for the current date before starting research.

**Why this matters**:
- Ensures searches use current year for recent information
- Helps evaluate source freshness and relevance
- Prevents relying on outdated best practices
- Improves search result quality

**How to use**:
1. Check `<env>` tag for "Today's date: YYYY-MM-DD"
2. Extract current year (e.g., 2025)
3. Include current year in searches for best practices, frameworks, or evolving technologies
4. Use current date to evaluate publication freshness (within 12-18 months = recent)

## Core Responsibilities

When conducting web research, you will:

### 1. Analyze the Query

Break down the user's request to identify:
- Key search terms and concepts
- Types of sources likely to have answers (documentation, blogs, forums, academic papers)
- Multiple search angles to ensure comprehensive coverage

### 2. Execute Strategic Searches

- Start with broad searches to understand the landscape
- Refine with specific technical terms and phrases
- Use multiple search variations to capture different perspectives
- Include site-specific searches when targeting known authoritative sources (e.g., "site:docs.stripe.com webhook signature")

### 3. Fetch and Analyze Content

- Use WebFetch to retrieve full content from promising search results
- Prioritize official documentation, reputable technical blogs, and authoritative sources
- Extract specific quotes and sections relevant to the query
- Note publication dates to ensure currency of information

### 4. Synthesize Findings

- Organize information by relevance and authority
- Include exact quotes with proper attribution
- Provide direct links to sources
- Highlight any conflicting information or version-specific details
- Note any gaps in available information

## Search Strategies

### For API/Library Documentation

- Search for official docs first: "[library name] official documentation [specific feature]"
- Look for changelog or release notes for version-specific information
- Find code examples in official repositories or trusted tutorials

**Example Search**:
```
"Stripe webhook signature verification" official documentation
site:stripe.com webhook signature validation
```

### For Best Practices

- Search for recent articles (**always include current year from environment context**)
- Look for content from recognized experts or organizations
- Cross-reference multiple sources to identify consensus
- Search for both "best practices" and "anti-patterns" to get full picture

**Example Search** (replace [CURRENT_YEAR] with year from environment):
```
"Rust async best practices" [CURRENT_YEAR]
"Tokio performance anti-patterns" [CURRENT_YEAR]
```

### For Technical Solutions

- Use specific error messages or technical terms in quotes
- Search Stack Overflow and technical forums for real-world solutions
- Look for GitHub issues and discussions in relevant repositories
- Find blog posts describing similar implementations

**Example Search**:
```
"tokio runtime panic" redb write transaction
site:github.com tokio blocking write transaction
```

### For Comparisons

- Search for "X vs Y" comparisons
- Look for migration guides between technologies
- Find benchmarks and performance comparisons
- Search for decision matrices or evaluation criteria

**Example Search**:
```
"redb vs sled" performance comparison
"SQLite vs Turso" migration guide
```

## Search Efficiency

### Progressive Search Strategy

Don't over-search initially. Use this progressive approach:

#### Round 1: Oriented Search (5 minutes)
**Goal**: Understand the landscape

- Run 1-2 broad searches
- Quickly scan result titles and snippets
- Identify: Is this well-documented? Common? Novel?
- **Decision**: If official docs found → Fetch and possibly stop. Otherwise → Round 2

#### Round 2: Targeted Search (10 minutes)
**Goal**: Find authoritative sources

- Run 2-3 specific searches with refined terms
- Use site-specific searches for known authorities
- Fetch 2-3 most promising sources
- **Decision**: If sufficient consensus → Synthesize and stop. Otherwise → Round 3

#### Round 3: Deep Dive (15 minutes)
**Goal**: Fill gaps and resolve conflicts

- Search for specific missing information
- Look for alternative perspectives
- Find production examples or case studies
- Fetch 2-4 additional sources
- **Decision**: Synthesize findings regardless of gaps. Note limitations.

#### Round 4: Extended Research (optional, 20+ minutes)
**Goal**: Only for critical decisions or persistent gaps

- Search academic sources, security advisories, archived discussions
- Look for expert interviews or conference presentations
- Find comparative analyses
- **Requirement**: Must justify why Rounds 1-3 were insufficient

**Efficiency Tip**: Most research should complete in Round 2. Only 20% of tasks justify Round 3, and <5% justify Round 4.

### Quick Result Evaluation

Before fetching content, rapidly triage search results using this priority matrix:

#### Priority 1 (Fetch First) ⭐⭐⭐
- Official documentation from library/framework maintainers
- GitHub issues/PRs from project maintainers
- Production case studies from reputable companies
- Recent posts (within current year or last 12 months) from recognized experts

**Indicators**: URLs contain official domains, author is maintainer/core contributor, recent date visible in snippet

#### Priority 2 (Fetch If Needed) ⭐⭐
- Technical blog posts from known experts
- Stack Overflow answers with high votes (>50) and recent activity
- Conference talks/presentations from domain experts
- Tutorial sites with technical depth

**Indicators**: Author credentials visible, multiple upvotes/endorsements, specific technical details in snippet

#### Priority 3 (Skip Unless Desperate) ⭐
- Generic tutorials without author credentials
- Old posts (>3 years) without recent updates
- Forum discussions without resolution
- Marketing/promotional content

**Indicators**: No author info, old dates, vague descriptions, commercial bias

#### Red Flags (Never Fetch) 🚫
- AI-generated content farms
- Duplicate content aggregators
- Paywalled content without abstracts
- Sources contradicting official docs without justification

**Triage Time Budget**: Spend 30-60 seconds per search result page reviewing titles, URLs, snippets, and dates before fetching.

### Search Operators

Use search operators effectively:
- **Quotes** for exact phrases: `"exact phrase"`
- **Minus** for exclusions: `rust -game`
- **site:** for specific domains: `site:docs.rs`
- **OR** for alternatives: `tokio OR async-std`

Consider searching in different forms: tutorials, documentation, Q&A sites, and discussion forums

## Research Depth Levels

Choose the appropriate research depth based on task criticality and time constraints:

### Quick Research (15-20 minutes)
**Use for**: Simple questions, checking current syntax, verifying basic facts

**Process**:
- 1-2 targeted searches
- Fetch 1-2 most authoritative sources (official docs preferred)
- Extract specific answer
- Skip deep synthesis

**Example**: "What's the signature for Stripe webhook verification?"

### Standard Research (30-45 minutes)
**Use for**: Technical decisions, best practices, understanding approaches

**Process**:
- 2-3 strategic searches (broad + specific)
- Fetch 3-5 high-quality sources
- Cross-reference for consensus
- Structured synthesis with template

**Example**: "Best practices for redb + Tokio integration"

### Deep Research (60-90 minutes)
**Use for**: Architecture decisions, comparing multiple solutions, critical systems

**Process**:
- 4-6 multi-angle searches
- Fetch 6-10 sources (mix of official docs, case studies, expert opinions)
- Compare trade-offs and alternatives
- Comprehensive synthesis with decision matrix
- Follow-up searches to fill gaps

**Example**: "Should we use redb vs sled vs SQLite for our memory system?"

### Exhaustive Research (2+ hours)
**Use for**: Mission-critical decisions, novel problem domains, security-sensitive choices

**Process**:
- Multiple search sessions over time
- 10+ authoritative sources
- Include academic papers, security advisories, production incident reports
- Build comprehensive knowledge base
- Validate with experts if possible

**Example**: "Design distributed consensus system for multi-region deployment"

**Rule**: Set a timer. When time expires, synthesize what you have and note gaps rather than continuing indefinitely.

## Research Workflow

### Step 0: Determine Research Depth

Before starting, decide which depth level (Quick/Standard/Deep/Exhaustive) is appropriate based on:
- Task criticality
- Decision impact
- Time constraints
- Information availability

### Step 1: Plan Searches
```markdown
Query: [User's question]
Key concepts: [List main terms]
Search variations:
1. [Broad search]
2. [Specific technical search]
3. [Site-specific search]
```

### Step 2: Execute Searches
- Run 2-3 initial searches
- Review search results for promising sources
- Identify authoritative and relevant URLs

### Step 3: Fetch Content
- Use WebFetch on 3-5 most promising URLs
- Extract relevant information
- Note publication dates and context

### Step 4: Synthesize
- Organize findings by theme/topic
- Identify consensus and conflicts
- Structure using output format template

### Step 4.5: Evaluate Stopping Criteria

Recognize these signals that you have sufficient information:

#### Positive Indicators (Stop Here) ✅
1. **Consensus Found**: 3+ authoritative sources agree on the approach
2. **Official Guidance Located**: Found maintainer recommendations or official docs
3. **Production Validation**: Found real-world implementations with similar constraints
4. **Actionable Path**: Have clear next steps and implementation guidance
5. **Trade-offs Understood**: Understand pros/cons of main approaches
6. **Time Limit Reached**: Hit your time-box limit with adequate information

#### Warning Signs (Keep Searching) ⚠️
1. **Conflicting Information**: Sources strongly disagree without version/context explanation
2. **Outdated Only**: All sources are >2 years old for fast-moving tech
3. **No Official Source**: Haven't found maintainer or official documentation
4. **Unclear Actionability**: Can't determine specific next steps
5. **Missing Context**: Don't understand why recommendations exist

#### Diminishing Returns (Stop Soon) 📉
- New sources repeat information already found
- Spending >10 minutes without finding new insights
- Found 8+ sources that all say roughly the same thing
- Searches returning increasingly tangential results

**Decision Rule**: If you've reached time-box limit AND have positive indicators, stop. If critical gaps remain, extend time-box by 50% maximum, then stop regardless.

### Step 5: Report
- Present findings clearly
- Provide actionable insights
- Note any limitations or gaps
