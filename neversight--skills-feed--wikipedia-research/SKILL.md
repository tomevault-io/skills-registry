# Wikipedia Research Skill

Extract verifiable research from Wikipedia with full citation provenance, entity relationships, timelines, and verification reports for AI consumption.

## Why Use This Skill?

| Without Skill | With Skill |
|---------------|------------|
| Unstructured prose | Structured JSON with schema |
| "Various sources" | 12+ citations with DOIs, PMIDs |
| Claims float freely | Every claim mapped to citations |
| No verification possible | DOI/PMID validation included |
| Unknown reliability | Admiralty Code quality rating |
| No relationships | Entity + relationship extraction |
| No timeline | Chronological event mapping |
| Dead links undetected | Archive fallback included |

## Complete Research Workflow

### Phase 1: Extract

```python
from scripts.citation_extractor import CitationExtractor

extractor = CitationExtractor()
research = extractor.extract_article("Subject_Name")
```

### Phase 2: Verify

```python
from scripts.source_verifier import SourceVerifier

verifier = SourceVerifier()

# Verify all citations (DOI, PMID, URL checks)
citation_results = verifier.verify_citations(research['citations'])

# Detect inconsistencies
inconsistencies = verifier.detect_inconsistencies(research)

# Extract Wikipedia uncertainty flags ({{citation needed}}, etc.)
flags = verifier.extract_uncertainty_flags(wikitext)

# Generate verification report
report = verifier.generate_verification_report(
    research, citation_results, inconsistencies, flags
)
```

### Phase 3: Enrich

```python
from scripts.entity_extractor import EntityExtractor

entity_extractor = EntityExtractor()

# Extract people, organizations, publications mentioned
entities = entity_extractor.extract_entities(research)

# Map relationships (collaborators, employers, etc.)
relationships = entity_extractor.extract_relationships(
    research, entities, "Subject Name"
)

# Build chronological timeline
timeline = entity_extractor.build_timeline(research)

# Generate knowledge graph
graph = entity_extractor.generate_knowledge_graph(
    "Subject Name", entities, relationships, timeline
)
```

### Phase 4: Output

```python
from scripts.research_collector import ResearchCollector

collector = ResearchCollector()
collector.save_research({
    **research,
    'verification': report,
    'knowledge_graph': graph
}, "output.json")
```

## Scripts Reference

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `wikipedia_client.py` | Core API client with caching |
| `citation_extractor.py` | Extract & parse citations to CSL-JSON |
| `research_collector.py` | Multi-article research orchestration |
| `source_verifier.py` | **NEW:** Verify DOIs, PMIDs, detect dead links |
| `entity_extractor.py` | **NEW:** Extract entities, relationships, timelines |

## Verification Features

### Citation Validation

```python
verifier = SourceVerifier()
result = verifier.verify_citations(citations)

# Each citation gets:
# - status: 'verified', 'accessible', 'dead_link', 'archived'
# - doi_valid: True/False (checked against doi.org)
# - pmid_valid: True/False (checked against PubMed)
# - archive_url: Wayback Machine fallback if dead
```

### Uncertainty Detection

Automatically flags Wikipedia uncertainty templates:
- `{{citation needed}}` - Unsourced claim
- `{{disputed}}` - Contested information
- `{{original research}}` - May lack sources
- `{{outdated}}` - Information may be stale
- `{{who}}` / `{{when}}` - Vague attribution

### Inconsistency Detection

Cross-checks claims within the research:
- Date conflicts (PhD year differs between sections)
- Name variations
- Contradictory facts

## Entity & Relationship Extraction

### Entity Types

| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| `person` | Collaborators, mentors, colleagues |
| `organization` | Universities, companies, institutes |
| `publication_venue` | Journals, conferences |
| `concept` | Research fields, methods |

### Relationship Types

| Type | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `collaborator` | Research collaboration |
| `employment` | Work affiliation |
| `education` | Degree/training |
| `publication` | Published in venue |
| `award_from` | Received award from |

## Timeline Construction

Automatically extracts chronological events:

```json
{
  "timeline": [
    {"date": "2005", "type": "education", "description": "BSc from University of Manchester"},
    {"date": "2010", "type": "education", "description": "PhD from Humboldt University"},
    {"date": "2011", "type": "publication", "description": "Published protein structure paper"},
    {"date": "2016", "type": "award", "description": "Received Overton Prize"}
  ]
}
```

## Quality Metrics

### Source Quality (Admiralty Code)

| Rating | Score | Meaning |
|--------|-------|---------|
| A | 0.80+ | Completely reliable - most citations verified |
| B | 0.60-0.79 | Usually reliable |
| C | 0.40-0.59 | Fairly reliable |
| D | 0.20-0.39 | Not usually reliable |
| E | <0.20 | Unreliable |

### Confidence Scoring

**Method:** Additive heuristic based on citation metadata presence.

Each claim's confidence is the average score of its supporting citations, calculated as:

```
Base score:                 0.50
+ DOI present:             +0.20  (indicates peer-reviewed)
+ PMID present:            +0.15  (indexed in PubMed)
+ ISBN present:            +0.10  (published book)
+ URL present:             +0.05  (verifiable link)
+ Author info present:     +0.10  (attributable)
+ Publication venue named: +0.05  (traceable)
─────────────────────────────────
Maximum possible:           1.00
```

**Typical scores:**

| Citation Type | Score |
|---------------|-------|
| Journal article (DOI + PMID + author) | 0.95-1.0 |
| Journal article (DOI + author) | 0.85 |
| Book (ISBN + author) | 0.75 |
| Webpage (URL + author) | 0.65 |
| Bare URL only | 0.55 |
| Citation not found | 0.30 |

**Limitations of this approach:**

- Does NOT verify that the source actually supports the claim
- Does NOT perform semantic analysis of source content
- Assumes DOI ≈ peer-reviewed (not always true for preprints)
- No weighting by journal reputation or citation count

**For higher-confidence verification:** Use `source_verifier.py` to validate DOIs/PMIDs exist, then manually verify claim-source alignment for critical facts.

## Best Practices

1. **Always verify** - Run source_verifier on all research
2. **Check uncertainty flags** - Wikipedia often marks weak areas
3. **Build timelines** - Chronology reveals inconsistencies
4. **Extract relationships** - Context matters for understanding
5. **Save revision_id** - Wikipedia changes; enable reproducibility
6. **Use DOIs** - Most reliable citation identifiers
7. **Check archives** - Dead links often have Wayback copies
