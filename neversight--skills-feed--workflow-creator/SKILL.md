# Workflow Creator Skill

Creates multi-agent orchestration workflows for complex tasks that require coordination across multiple agents and phases.

## ROUTER UPDATE REQUIRED (CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP)

**After creating ANY workflow, you MUST update CLAUDE.md Section 8.6 "ENTERPRISE WORKFLOWS":**

```markdown
### {Workflow Name}

**Path:** `.claude/workflows/{category}/{workflow-name}.md`

**When to use:** {Trigger conditions}

**Phases:**

1. **{Phase Name}** - {Description}
   ...

**Agents Involved:**

- `{agent-name}` - {Role in workflow}
```

**Verification:**

```bash
grep "{workflow-name}" .claude/CLAUDE.md || echo "ERROR: CLAUDE.md SECTION 8.6 NOT UPDATED!"
```

**WHY**: Workflows not in CLAUDE.md will NEVER be invoked by the Router.

---

## When This Skill Is Triggered

1. **User requests complex orchestration** requiring multiple agents
2. **Repeatable multi-phase process** needs standardization
3. **Router identifies workflow gap** for common task pattern
4. **Existing workflow needs enhancement** or customization

## Quick Reference

| Operation                | Method                                                  |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Check existing workflows | `Glob: .claude/workflows/**/*.md`                       |
| Review workflow template | Read `.claude/templates/workflows/workflow-template.md` |
| Find relevant agents     | `Glob: .claude/agents/**/*.md`                          |
| Find relevant skills     | `Glob: .claude/skills/*/SKILL.md`                       |
| Create workflow          | Write to `.claude/workflows/<category>/<name>.md`       |

## Workflow Types

| Type       | Location                        | Purpose                               | Examples                             |
| ---------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Enterprise | `.claude/workflows/enterprise/` | Complex multi-phase development       | feature-development, c4-architecture |
| Operations | `.claude/workflows/operations/` | Runtime procedures, incident response | incident-response, deployment        |
| Rapid      | `.claude/workflows/rapid/`      | Quick, focused task automation        | fix, refactor, review                |
| Custom     | `.claude/workflows/`            | Project-specific patterns             | conductor-setup                      |

## Workflow Creation Process

### Step 1: Verify No Existing Workflow

```bash
# Search for relevant workflows
Glob: .claude/workflows/**/*.md
Grep: "<topic>" in .claude/workflows/
```

If a suitable workflow exists, consider enhancing it instead of creating a duplicate.

### Step 2.5: Workflow Pattern Research (MANDATORY)

Before creating a workflow, research existing patterns.

**1. Check existing workflows:**

```bash
Glob: .claude/workflows/**/*.md
```

**2. Research workflow patterns** (minimum 2 queries):

```javascript
WebSearch({ query: '[workflow-type] orchestration best practices' });
WebSearch({ query: '[domain] multi-agent workflow patterns' });
```

**3. Document patterns found** in workflow comments

**BLOCKING**: Workflow creation cannot proceed without pattern research. This ensures workflows follow established patterns rather than reinventing solutions.

### Step 2: Identify Phases and Agents

**Analyze the process to break into phases:**

| Question                           | Determines                       |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| What are the distinct stages?      | Phase boundaries                 |
| Which agent handles each stage?    | Agent assignments                |
| Can any stages run in parallel?    | Parallel execution opportunities |
| What outputs feed into next stage? | Data flow and handoffs           |
| What can go wrong at each stage?   | Error recovery procedures        |

**Common Phase Patterns:**

| Pattern                                      | Phases                        | When to Use |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------- |
| Discovery -> Design -> Review -> Implement   | Feature development           |
| Analyze -> Fix -> Test -> Deploy             | Bug fix workflow              |
| Explore -> Plan -> Review                    | Planning workflow             |
| Triage -> Investigate -> Resolve -> Document | Incident response             |
| Code -> Component -> Container -> Context    | C4 architecture documentation |

### Step 3: Define Agent Handoffs

For each phase transition, specify:

```markdown
### Phase 1 -> Phase 2 Handoff

**Output from Phase 1**: .claude/context/plans/phase1-output.md
**Input to Phase 2**: Read output from Phase 1
**Handoff validation**: [Check output exists and is valid]
```

### Step 4: Generate Workflow Definition

Write to `.claude/workflows/<category>/<workflow-name>.md`:

````markdown
---
name: { workflow-name }
description: { Brief description of workflow purpose }
version: 1.0.0
agents:
  - { agent-1 }
  - { agent-2 }
tags: [{ tag1 }, { tag2 }, workflow]
---

# {Workflow Title}

{Brief description of workflow purpose and when to use it.}

**Extended Thinking**: {Detailed explanation of workflow rationale, approach, and design decisions.}

## Overview

{Detailed description of what this workflow accomplishes.}

## Configuration Options

### {Option Category 1}

- **{value_1}**: {Description}
- **{value_2}**: {Description}

## Phase 1: {Phase Name}

### Step 1: {Step Name}

**Agent**: {agent-name}

**Task Spawn**:

```javascript
Task({
  subagent_type: 'general-purpose',
  description: '{Task description}',
  prompt: `You are the {AGENT_NAME} agent.

## Task
{Task description}

## Instructions
1. Read your agent definition: .claude/agents/{category}/{agent}.md
2. **Invoke skills**: Skill({ skill: "{skill-name}" })
3. {Additional instructions}
4. Save output to: .claude/context/{output-path}

## Context
- {Context item 1}
- {Context item 2}

## Memory Protocol
1. Read .claude/context/memory/learnings.md first
2. Record decisions to .claude/context/memory/decisions.md
`,
});
```
````

**Expected Output**: {Description of expected output}

## Phase 2: {Phase Name}

### Step 2: {Step Name} (Parallel)

**Agents**: {agent-a} + {agent-b} (spawned in parallel)

**Task Spawn**:

```javascript
// Spawn both agents in parallel for efficiency
Task({
  subagent_type: 'general-purpose',
  description: '{Agent A task}',
  prompt: `You are {AGENT_A}...`,
});

Task({
  subagent_type: 'general-purpose',
  description: '{Agent B task}',
  prompt: `You are {AGENT_B}...`,
});
```

**Expected Output**: {Description}

## Error Recovery

### If Phase 1 fails:

1. {Recovery step}
2. Restart Phase 1

### If Phase 2 review finds blockers:

1. {Recovery step}
2. Re-run reviews

## Success Criteria

- [ ] {Criterion 1}
- [ ] {Criterion 2}
- [ ] All agents completed their phases
- [ ] Memory files updated

## Usage Example

```javascript
// Router spawning workflow orchestrator
Task({
  subagent_type: 'general-purpose',
  description: 'Orchestrating {workflow-name} workflow',
  prompt: `Execute {workflow-name} workflow.

## Parameters
- {Parameter 1}
- {Parameter 2}

## Instructions
Follow the phased workflow in: .claude/workflows/{category}/{workflow-name}.md
`,
});
```

```

### Step 5: Validate Workflow References (BLOCKING)

**Before writing workflow file, verify ALL references are valid:**

| Reference | Validation |
|-----------|-----------|
| Agent files | All agents in `agents:` array exist in `.claude/agents/` |
| Skills | All skills referenced in prompts exist in `.claude/skills/` |
| Output paths | All output directories exist or will be created |
| Context files | All context files referenced are accessible |

**Validation checklist before writing:**
```

[ ] All referenced agents exist
[ ] All referenced skills exist
[ ] Output paths are valid
[ ] Error recovery procedures are complete
[ ] Success criteria are measurable

````

**BLOCKING**: Do not write workflow file if any reference is invalid.

### Step 5.5: Model and Tool Validation (CRITICAL)

**Model Validation for Agent Spawns (CRITICAL):**

When workflow templates spawn agents via Task tool:
- model field MUST be base name only: `haiku`, `sonnet`, or `opus`
- DO NOT use dated versions like `claude-opus-4-5-20251101`
- Choose model based on task complexity:
  - `haiku`: Quick validation, simple tasks
  - `sonnet`: Standard work (default)
  - `opus`: Complex reasoning, architecture

**Example:**
```javascript
// CORRECT
Task({
  model: 'sonnet',
  // ...
});

// WRONG - causes validation failures
Task({
  model: 'claude-sonnet-4-20250514',
  // ...
});
````

**Tools Array Validation:**

When specifying allowed_tools for spawned agents:

- Use standard tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, TaskUpdate, TaskList, etc.
- DO NOT include MCP tools (mcp\_\_\*) unless whitelisted in router-enforcer.cjs
- MCP tools cause router enforcement failures

**Allowed tools (standard):**

```javascript
allowed_tools: [
  'Read',
  'Write',
  'Edit',
  'Bash',
  'TaskUpdate',
  'TaskList',
  'TaskCreate',
  'TaskGet',
  'Skill',
];
```

**Restricted tools (require explicit whitelisting):**

- `mcp__Exa__*` - Only for evolution-orchestrator
- `mcp__github__*` - Only for specific GitHub operations
- Other MCP tools - Must be whitelisted in router-enforcer.cjs

**Validation checklist for agent spawns:**

```
[ ] Model field uses base name (haiku/sonnet/opus)
[ ] allowed_tools contains only standard tools OR explicitly whitelisted MCP tools
[ ] No dated model versions (e.g., claude-opus-4-5-20251101)
```

### Step 6: Update CLAUDE.md Section 8.6 (MANDATORY - BLOCKING)

**This step is AUTOMATIC and BLOCKING. Do not skip.**

After workflow file is written, you MUST update CLAUDE.md:

1. **Find Section 8.6** ("ENTERPRISE WORKFLOWS")
2. **Generate workflow entry** in this format:

```markdown
### {Workflow Name}

**Path:** `.claude/workflows/{category}/{workflow-name}.md`

**When to use:** {Trigger conditions - be specific}

**Phases:**

1. **{Phase 1 Name}** - {Brief description}
2. **{Phase 2 Name}** - {Brief description}
   ...

**Configuration Options:**

- {Option category}: `{values}`

**Agents Involved:**

- `{agent-name}` - {Role description}
```

3. **Insert in appropriate location** (alphabetical or at end of section)
4. **Verify with**:

```bash
grep "{workflow-name}" .claude/CLAUDE.md || echo "ERROR: CLAUDE.md NOT UPDATED - BLOCKING!"
```

**BLOCKING**: If CLAUDE.md update fails, workflow creation is INCOMPLETE. Do NOT proceed.

### Step 7: System Impact Analysis (BLOCKING)

**After creating ANY workflow, analyze and update system-wide impacts.**

```
[WORKFLOW-CREATOR] System Impact Analysis for: <workflow-name>

1. CLAUDE.md UPDATE (MANDATORY)
   - Add entry to Section 8.6 (Enterprise Workflows)
   - Add to Section 3 (Multi-Agent Workflows) if referenced by Router
   - Verify with grep

2. AGENT COORDINATION CHECK
   - Do all agents referenced exist?
   - Do agents need new skills for this workflow?
   - Should any agent's definition reference this workflow?

3. SKILL AVAILABILITY CHECK
   - Are all skills referenced available?
   - Does this workflow need new skills? -> Invoke skill-creator
   - Should existing skills be enhanced?

4. MEMORY INTEGRATION CHECK
   - Does workflow use Memory Protocol?
   - Are output paths writable?
   - Will artifacts be properly persisted?

5. RELATED WORKFLOW CHECK
   - Does this duplicate existing workflow functionality?
   - Should existing workflows reference this one?
   - Are there workflow dependencies to document?
```

### Validation Checklist (Run After Every Creation) - BLOCKING

```bash
# Validate workflow file exists
ls .claude/workflows/<category>/<workflow-name>.md

# Verify all referenced agents exist
for agent in $(grep -oE '\\.claude/agents/[^"]+\\.md' .claude/workflows/<category>/<workflow>.md); do
  [ -f "$agent" ] || echo "BROKEN: $agent"
done

# Verify all referenced skills exist
for skill in $(grep -oE 'skill: "[^"]+"' .claude/workflows/<category>/<workflow>.md | cut -d'"' -f2); do
  [ -f ".claude/skills/$skill/SKILL.md" ] || echo "BROKEN: $skill"
done

# Check CLAUDE.md has workflow entry - MANDATORY
grep "<workflow-name>" .claude/CLAUDE.md || echo "ERROR: Not in CLAUDE.md - WORKFLOW CREATION INCOMPLETE"
```

**Completion Checklist** (all must be checked):

```
[ ] Workflow pattern research completed (Step 2.5)
[ ] Workflow file created at .claude/workflows/<category>/<name>.md
[ ] All referenced agents exist in .claude/agents/
[ ] All referenced skills exist in .claude/skills/
[ ] Model fields use base names only (haiku/sonnet/opus)
[ ] allowed_tools arrays contain only standard or whitelisted tools
[ ] CLAUDE.md Section 8.6 updated
[ ] Workflow entry verified with grep
[ ] Memory Protocol included in all agent prompts
```

**BLOCKING**: If ANY item fails, workflow creation is INCOMPLETE. Fix all issues before proceeding.

## Iron Laws of Workflow Creation

These rules are INVIOLABLE. Breaking them causes silent failures.

```
1. NO WORKFLOW WITHOUT AGENT VALIDATION
   - Every agent referenced must exist in .claude/agents/
   - Verify with: ls .claude/agents/<category>/<agent>.md

2. NO WORKFLOW WITHOUT SKILL VALIDATION
   - Every skill referenced must exist in .claude/skills/
   - Verify with: ls .claude/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md

3. NO PARALLEL EXECUTION WITHOUT INDEPENDENCE
   - Only spawn agents in parallel if their work is independent
   - Dependent work must be sequential

4. NO HANDOFF WITHOUT OUTPUT SPECIFICATION
   - Every phase must specify its output location
   - Every phase must specify what it reads from previous phases

5. NO WORKFLOW WITHOUT MEMORY PROTOCOL
   - Every agent prompt must include Memory Protocol section
   - Without it, learnings and decisions are lost

6. NO CREATION WITHOUT CLAUDE.MD UPDATE
   - After creating workflow, add to Section 8.6
   - Unregistered workflows are never invoked by Router

7. NO CREATION WITHOUT SYSTEM IMPACT ANALYSIS
   - Check if new agents are needed
   - Check if new skills are needed
   - Document all system changes made

8. NO AGENT SPAWN WITHOUT MODEL VALIDATION
   - model field MUST be base name only: haiku, sonnet, or opus
   - DO NOT use dated versions like claude-opus-4-5-20251101
   - Dated versions cause validation failures

9. NO AGENT SPAWN WITH UNRESTRICTED MCP TOOLS
   - Use standard tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, TaskUpdate, etc.
   - MCP tools (mcp__*) require explicit whitelisting
   - Unwhitelisted MCP tools cause router enforcement failures

10. NO WORKFLOW WITHOUT PATTERN RESEARCH
    - Research existing workflow patterns before creating new ones
    - Minimum 2 WebSearch queries for domain patterns
    - Document patterns found in workflow comments
```

## Workflow Integration

This skill is part of the unified artifact lifecycle. For complete multi-agent orchestration:

**Router Decision:** `.claude/workflows/core/router-decision.md`

- How the Router discovers and invokes this skill's artifacts

**Artifact Lifecycle:** `.claude/workflows/core/skill-lifecycle.md`

- Discovery, creation, update, deprecation phases
- Version management and registry updates
- CLAUDE.md integration requirements

**External Integration:** `.claude/workflows/core/external-integration.md`

- Safe integration of external artifacts
- Security review and validation phases

---

## Cross-Reference: Creator Ecosystem

This skill is part of the **Creator Ecosystem**. After creating a workflow, consider whether companion creators are needed:

| Creator              | When to Use                                   | Invocation                          |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **agent-creator**    | Workflow needs agent not in `.claude/agents/` | `Skill({ skill: 'agent-creator' })` |
| **skill-creator**    | Workflow needs skill not in `.claude/skills/` | `Skill({ skill: 'skill-creator' })` |
| **hook-creator**     | Workflow needs entry/exit hooks               | Create in `.claude/hooks/`          |
| **template-creator** | Workflow needs code templates                 | Create in `.claude/templates/`      |
| **schema-creator**   | Workflow needs validation schemas             | Create in `.claude/schemas/`        |

### Integration Workflow

After creating a workflow that needs additional capabilities:

```javascript
// 1. Workflow created but needs new agent
Skill({ skill: 'agent-creator' });
// Create the agent, then update workflow's agents: array

// 2. Workflow needs new skill
Skill({ skill: 'skill-creator' });
// Create the skill, then reference in workflow prompts

// 3. Workflow needs hooks for critical steps
// Create hooks in .claude/hooks/workflows/<workflow-name>/
// Reference in workflow's hooks: section
```

### Post-Creation Checklist for Ecosystem Integration

After workflow is fully created and validated:

```
[ ] Does workflow need agents that don't exist? -> Use agent-creator
[ ] Does workflow need skills that don't exist? -> Use skill-creator
[ ] Does workflow need entry/exit hooks? -> Create hooks
[ ] Does workflow need input validation? -> Create schemas
[ ] Should workflow be part of larger orchestration? -> Update master-orchestrator
```

## Workflow Template Quick Reference

Use the template at `.claude/templates/workflows/workflow-template.md` for consistent structure.

**Key sections every workflow must have:**

1. **YAML Frontmatter**: name, description, version, agents, tags
2. **Overview**: Purpose and when to use
3. **Configuration Options**: Customizable parameters
4. **Phases**: Sequential or parallel execution blocks
5. **Task Spawns**: Actual Task() calls with full prompts
6. **Error Recovery**: What to do when phases fail
7. **Success Criteria**: How to verify workflow completed successfully
8. **Usage Example**: How Router should invoke the workflow
