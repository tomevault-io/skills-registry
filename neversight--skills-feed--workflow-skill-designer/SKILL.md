# Workflow Skill Designer

Meta-skill for creating structured workflow skills following the orchestrator + phases pattern. Generates complete skill packages with SKILL.md as coordinator and phases/ folder for execution details.

## Target Output Structure

The skill this meta-skill produces follows this structure:

```
.claude/skills/{skill-name}/
├── SKILL.md                    # Orchestrator: coordination, data flow, TodoWrite
├── phases/
│   ├── 01-{phase-name}.md      # Phase execution detail (full content)
│   ├── 02-{phase-name}.md
│   ├── ...
│   └── 0N-{phase-name}.md
├── specs/                      # [Optional] Domain specifications
└── templates/                  # [Optional] Reusable templates
```

## Core Design Patterns

Patterns extracted from successful workflow skill implementations (workflow-plan, project-analyze, etc.):

### Pattern 1: Orchestrator + Progressive Loading

**SKILL.md** = Pure coordinator. Contains:
- Architecture diagram (ASCII)
- Execution flow with `Ref: phases/0N-xxx.md` markers
- Phase Reference Documents table (read on-demand)
- Data flow between phases
- Core rules and error handling

**Phase files** = Full execution detail. Contains:
- Complete agent prompts, bash commands, code implementations
- Validation checklists, error handling
- Input/Output specification
- Next Phase link

**Key Rule**: SKILL.md references phase docs via `Ref:` markers. Phase docs are read **only when that phase executes**, not all at once.

### Pattern 2: TodoWrite Attachment/Collapse

```
Phase starts:
  → Sub-tasks ATTACHED to TodoWrite (in_progress + pending)
  → Orchestrator executes sub-tasks sequentially

Phase ends:
  → Sub-tasks COLLAPSED back to high-level summary (completed)
  → Next phase begins
```

### Pattern 3: Inter-Phase Data Flow

```
Phase N output → stored in memory/variable → Phase N+1 input
                  └─ or written to session file for persistence
```

Each phase receives outputs from prior phases via:
- In-memory variables (sessionId, contextPath, etc.)
- Session directory files (.workflow/active/{sessionId}/...)
- Planning notes (accumulated constraints document)

### Pattern 4: Conditional Phase Execution

```
Phase N output contains condition flag
  ├─ condition met → Execute Phase N+1
  └─ condition not met → Skip to Phase N+2
```

### Pattern 5: Input Structuring

User input (free text) → Structured format before Phase 1:
```
GOAL: [objective]
SCOPE: [boundaries]
CONTEXT: [background/constraints]
```

## Execution Flow

```
Phase 1: Requirements Analysis
   └─ Ref: phases/01-requirements-analysis.md
      ├─ Input source: commands, descriptions, user interaction
      └─ Output: workflowConfig (phases, data flow, agents, conditions)

Phase 2: Orchestrator Design (SKILL.md)
   └─ Ref: phases/02-orchestrator-design.md
      ├─ Input: workflowConfig
      └─ Output: .claude/skills/{name}/SKILL.md

Phase 3: Phase Files Design
   └─ Ref: phases/03-phase-design.md
      ├─ Input: workflowConfig + source content
      └─ Output: .claude/skills/{name}/phases/0N-*.md

Phase 4: Validation & Integration
   └─ Ref: phases/04-validation.md
      └─ Output: Validated skill package
```

**Phase Reference Documents** (read on-demand):

| Phase | Document | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| 1 | [phases/01-requirements-analysis.md](phases/01-requirements-analysis.md) | Analyze workflow requirements from various sources |
| 2 | [phases/02-orchestrator-design.md](phases/02-orchestrator-design.md) | Generate SKILL.md with orchestration patterns |
| 3 | [phases/03-phase-design.md](phases/03-phase-design.md) | Generate phase files preserving full execution detail |
| 4 | [phases/04-validation.md](phases/04-validation.md) | Validate structure, references, and integration |

## Input Sources

This meta-skill accepts workflow definitions from multiple sources:

| Source | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Existing commands** | Convert `.claude/commands/` orchestrator + sub-commands | `plan.md` + `session/start.md` + `tools/*.md` |
| **Text description** | User describes workflow in natural language | "Create a 3-phase code review workflow" |
| **Requirements doc** | Structured requirements file | `requirements.md` with phases/agents/outputs |
| **Existing skill** | Refactor/redesign an existing skill | Restructure a flat skill into phases |

## Frontmatter Conversion Rules

When converting from command format to skill format:

| Command Field | Skill Field | Transformation |
|---------------|-------------|----------------|
| `name` | `name` | Prefix with group: `plan` → `workflow-plan` |
| `description` | `description` | Append trigger phrase: `Triggers on "xxx"` |
| `argument-hint` | _(removed)_ | Arguments handled in Input Processing section |
| `examples` | _(removed)_ | Examples moved to inline documentation |
| `allowed-tools` | `allowed-tools` | Expand wildcards: `Skill(*)` → `Skill`, add commonly needed tools |
| `group` | _(removed)_ | Embedded in `name` prefix |

## Orchestrator Content Mapping

What goes into SKILL.md vs what goes into phase files:

### SKILL.md (Coordinator)

| Section | Content | Source |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Frontmatter | name, description, allowed-tools | Command frontmatter (converted) |
| Architecture Overview | ASCII diagram of phase flow | Derived from execution structure |
| Key Design Principles | Coordination rules | Extracted from command coordinator role |
| Execution Flow | Phase sequence with `Ref:` markers + Phase Reference table | Command execution process |
| Core Rules | Orchestration constraints | Command core rules |
| Input Processing | Structured format conversion | Command input processing |
| Data Flow | Inter-phase data passing | Command data flow |
| TodoWrite Pattern | Attachment/collapse lifecycle | Command TodoWrite sections |
| Post-Phase Updates | Planning notes / state updates between phases | Command inter-phase update code |
| Error Handling | Failure recovery | Command error handling |
| Coordinator Checklist | Pre/post phase actions | Command coordinator checklist |
| Related Commands | Prerequisites and follow-ups | Command related commands |

### Phase Files (Execution Detail)

| Content | Rule |
|---------|------|
| Full agent prompts | Preserve verbatim from source command |
| Bash command blocks | Preserve verbatim |
| Code implementations | Preserve verbatim |
| Validation checklists | Preserve verbatim |
| Error handling details | Preserve verbatim |
| Input/Output spec | Add if not present in source |
| Phase header | Add `# Phase N: {Name}` |
| Objective section | Add `## Objective` with bullet points |
| Next Phase link | Add `## Next Phase` with link to next |

**Critical Rule**: Phase files must be **content-faithful** to their source. Do NOT summarize, abbreviate, or simplify. The phase file IS the execution instruction - every bash command, every agent prompt, every validation step must be preserved.

```

## Design Decision Framework

When designing a new workflow skill, answer these questions:

| Question | Impact | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| How many phases? | Directory structure | 3-7 phases typical |
| Which phases are conditional? | Orchestrator logic | "Phase 3 only if conflict_risk >= medium" |
| What data flows between phases? | Data Flow section | sessionId, contextPath, configFlags |
| Which phases use agents? | Phase file complexity | Agent prompts need verbatim preservation |
| What's the TodoWrite granularity? | TodoWrite Pattern | Some phases have sub-tasks, others are atomic |
| Is there a planning notes pattern? | Post-Phase Updates | Accumulated state document across phases |
| What's the error recovery? | Error Handling | Retry once then report, vs rollback |
| Does it need auto mode? | Auto Mode section | Skip confirmations with --yes flag |
