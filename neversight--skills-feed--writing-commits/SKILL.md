# Writing Commits

Follow Conventional Commits: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`

## Types

| Type | Use For |
|------|---------|
| `feat` | New user-facing feature |
| `fix` | Bug fix |
| `docs` | Documentation only |
| `refactor` | Code change, no behavior change |
| `test` | Adding/fixing tests |
| `chore` | Build, deps, tooling |

## Rules

1. Subject: imperative mood, no period, ≤50 chars
2. Scope: optional area indicator (auth, api, ui)
3. Breaking changes: add `!` after type

## Examples

```bash
feat(auth): add Google OAuth login
fix(api): handle null user in profile endpoint
feat(api)!: change auth response format
chore(deps): upgrade Next.js to 15
```

## Anti-patterns

```bash
# ❌ Avoid
"fix stuff"
"updates"
"WIP"

# ✅ Prefer
"fix(auth): resolve token refresh race condition"
```

## PR Titles

Same format as commits. PR title becomes the squash commit message.

## PR Body

```markdown
## What
[Brief description]

## Why
[Context/motivation]

## Testing
[How verified]
```

## Branch Naming

```bash
# Format: type/short-description
feat/oauth-login
fix/token-refresh
chore/upgrade-deps

# With ticket numbers
feat/PROJ-123-oauth-login
fix/PROJ-456-token-refresh
```

Keep branches short-lived. Delete after merge.
