# Yield Opportunities

This skill provides comprehensive workflows for discovering and analyzing DeFi yield opportunities across multiple protocols, blockchains, and yield-generating strategies.

## Core Research Methodology

### Parallel Exploration Strategy (MAXIMIZE EFFORT)

When researching yield opportunities, launch multiple background agents IN PARALLEL:

1. **Librarian Agents** (3-6 concurrent) - Best for external research:
   - Protocol-specific yield documentation
   - Yield aggregator platforms
   - GitHub repositories for yield trackers
   - Liquidity mining programs
   - Staking/restaking opportunities
   - Cross-chain bridging options (if applicable)

2. **Direct Tools** - Use in parallel with librarian agents:
   - `websearch_web_search_exa` - For current APYs, platform comparisons
   - `grep_app_searchGitHub` - For open-source yield trackers
   - `webfetch` - To fetch specific documentation pages

## Yield Categories to Research

### 1. Staking (Delegation)

**What to find:**
- Native chain staking (validator delegation)
- Liquid staking protocols (LSTs)
- Restaking opportunities (EigenLayer, etc.)
- Minimum staking amounts
- Lock-up periods and unbonding times
- Current APY ranges
- Validator selection criteria

**Key Platforms by Chain:**
- **ETH:** Lido (stETH), Rocket Pool (rETH), EigenLayer
- **BNB:** Native BSC delegation, Ankr, Trust Wallet staking
- **SOL:** Marinade, Jito, Lido
- **Other Chain-Specific:** Research native staking options

### 2. Lending Protocols

**What to find:**
- Major lending platforms on the chain
- Supply APYs for the asset
- Borrow APYs (for leverage strategies)
- Protocol TVL and security/audit status
- Collateral factors and LTV limits
- Liquidation risks

**Top Platforms:**
- **ETH:** Aave, Compound, Morpho, Euler
- **BSC:** Venus, Alpaca Finance, Cream
- **Arbitrum/Optimism:** Aave V3, Radiant

### 3. Liquidity Farming (LP Pools)

**What to find:**
- Major DEXs on the chain (Uniswap, PancakeSwap, Curve, etc.)
- Top LP pools involving the asset
- APR/APY breakdown (trading fees + farm rewards)
- Impermanent loss risk assessment
- Pool liquidity and volume data
- Reward token quality

**Pool Types:**
- **Stablecoin pairs:** Lower impermanent loss, lower yields
- **Token pairs:** Higher impermanent loss, higher yields
- **V3 vs V2:** Different mechanics, active vs passive management

### 4. Yield Aggregators (Auto-Compounding)

**What to find:**
- Aggregator platforms supporting the chain
- Vault strategies for the asset
- Auto-compounding frequency
- Performance fee structure
- Vault TVL and track record
- Strategy description (what they do with your funds)

**Top Aggregators:**
- **Multi-chain:** Beefy Finance, Yearn Finance, Autofarm, Harvest
- **Chain-specific:** ACryptoS (BSC), Idle Finance (ETH)

### 5. Cross-Chain Opportunities (If applicable)

**What to find:**
- Can asset be bridged to other chains?
- Bridge options and fees
- Yield opportunities on destination chains
- Bridge security track record
- Whether bridging is worth the risk/cost

**Decision Framework:**
- Bridging only recommended if yield differential >5-10%
- Verify bridge security (official bridges preferred)
- Consider gas costs + bridge fees

## Reference Sources

### Primary Aggregators (Start Here)

| Platform | Coverage | Daily Updates |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| **DefiLlama** | 14,149 pools, 495 protocols, 110 chains | Yes |
| **Vaults.fyi** | 500+ vaults | Yes |
| **DexLender** | Stablecoin lending rates | Yes |
| **CoinMarketCap Yield** | Multi-asset, DeFi & CeFi | Yes |

### Protocol Documentation

Always reference official docs:
- Aave: https://docs.aave.com/
- Venus: https://docs-v4.venus.io/
- Beefy: https://docs.beefy.finance/
- PancakeSwap: https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/
- Curve: https://docs.curve.fi/

## Workflow for Single Asset Request

### Example: "I have BNB, how to earn?"

```
Step 1: Launch 5-6 librarian agents in parallel:
  - BNB staking options (delegation, liquid staking)
  - BSC lending protocols (Venus, Alpaca)
  - BNB liquidity farming (PancakeSwap, Biswap pools)
  - BSC yield aggregators (Beefy, Autofarm vaults)
  - BNB bridging options (if worth exploring)

Step 2: Run parallel websearch queries:
  - Current APYs for BNB staking
  - Venus Protocol BNB supply rates
  - PancakeSwap BNB pool APRs
  - Beefy BNB vault performance

Step 3: Collect and synthesize findings:
  - Organize by risk tolerance (Low/Medium/High)
  - Include current rates, requirements, risks
  - Provide decision framework

Step 4: Output structured recommendations:
  - Safest options (staking, single-token vaults)
  - Medium risk (lending, stablecoin LP)
  - High risk (volatile LP, farming)
  - Risk assessment for each option
```

## Risk Assessment Framework

### Risk Levels

| Level | Examples | Typical APY Range | Key Risks |
|-------|----------|------------------|-----------|
| **Low** | Native staking, liquid staking, CeFi vaults | 3-8% | Chain risks, price volatility |
| **Medium** | Lending, stablecoin LP, single-token vaults | 5-28% | Smart contract risk, liquidation |
| **High** | Token LP farming, yield aggregators | 20-100%+ | Impermanent loss, protocol risk |
| **Extreme** | New protocols, high-IL positions | 100%+ | Hack risks, rug scams |

### Must-Include Warnings

1. **Impermanent Loss (IL)**
   - Explain IL for liquidity pools
   - Note: Stablecoin pairs = minimal IL, Token pairs = high IL

2. **Smart Contract Risk**
   - Only recommend audited protocols with significant TVL
   - Check: Is this protocol audited? What's the TVL?

3. **Price Risk**
   - All yields are in the native asset
   - If asset drops, USD value drops

4. **Liquidation Risk**
   - For lending collateral positions
   - Keep LTV < 50% if borrowing

5. **Bridge Risk** (if bridging recommended)
   - Document bridge security
   - Note historical bridge hacks

## Output Structure

When presenting yield opportunities, use this format:

### 1. **Safest Options** (Low Risk)
- Method | APY | Requirements | Lock Period | Risk Notes

### 2. **Medium Risk** (Solid DeFi)
- Method | APY | Strategy | Trade-offs

### 3. **High Risk** (Maximum Yield)
- Method | APY | Strategy | Risks

### 4. **Risk Assessment**
- Detailed breakdown of each risk category
- What to watch out for

### 5. **Recommendation by Profile**
- Conservative / Balanced / Aggressive
- Best options for each user type

### 6. **Quick Start Guide**
- Step-by-step checklist
- Required tools (wallets, gas)
- Where to check current rates

## Agent Delegation Prompts

### Template for Librarian Agents

```
1. TASK: [Atomic task description]
2. EXPECTED OUTCOME: [Concrete deliverables with success criteria]
3. REQUIRED TOOLS: [Explicit tool whitelist]
4. MUST DO:
   - [Exhaustive requirements, leave nothing implicit]
   - [Get current 2025 information]
   - [Include URLs to official sources]
5. MUST NOT DO:
   - [Don't provide specific APY numbers - change too fast]
   - [Don't suggest protocols with known issues]
   - [Don't ignore risks]
6. CONTEXT: [User's situation and constraints]
```

### Example Prompt for Staking Research

```
1. TASK: Research [ASSET] staking options on [CHAIN]
2. EXPECTED OUTCOME: Complete list of staking options with validator info, APY ranges, how to stake, and requirements
3. REQUIRED TOOLS: websearch_web_search_exa, webfetch
4. MUST DO:
   - Research native chain staking validators (official docs)
   - Find current validator APYs and delegation process
   - Research liquid staking protocols
   - Document minimum amounts, lock periods, unbonding times
   - Include URLs to official staking interfaces
5. MUST NOT DO:
   - Don't recommend specific validators unless top-tier
   - Don't ignore staking risks (slashing, unbonding)
   - Don't speculate on future APY changes
6. CONTEXT: User has [ASSET] and wants safe staking yield
```

## Search Optimization

### Efficient Search Queries

Instead of broad queries, use specific patterns:

**Good:**
- "BNB BSC staking validators APY 2025"
- "Venus protocol BNB supply APY BSC"
- "PancakeSwap BNB liquidity pool APR"

**Avoid:**
- "yield opportunities" (too broad)
- "how to earn with BNB" (not specific enough)

### Time Management

- Stop searching when: Same info appearing across 3+ sources, or 2 iterations yielded no new data
- Parallel execution: Launch all librarian agents first, then direct tools
- Don't wait for librarian results - collect them all when needed
