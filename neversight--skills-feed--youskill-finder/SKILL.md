# YouSkill Finder

Get AI-powered skill recommendations for any open-ended task or scenario.

## When to Use

Use this skill when the user:
- Asks **"how to..."** or **"how can I..."** questions about building or automating something
- Describes a **scenario or goal** without a specific solution in mind
- Wants to know **what tools/skills exist** for a task
- Asks for **recommendations** on approaches to a problem
- Needs help with **workflow automation**, **integrations**, or **AI-assisted tasks**

**Examples:**
- "How can I automate code reviews?"
- "I want to build a data pipeline from Notion to a database"
- "Help me set up automated testing for my project"
- "What's the best way to sync data between two services?"
- "I need to create a scheduled report generator"

## Usage

```bash
npx @youware-labs/youskill "<describe the scenario or goal>"
```

**Example:**
```bash
npx @youware-labs/youskill "I want to automate code reviews with structured feedback"
```

> **Note:** AI-powered recommendations may take 1-2 minutes to process. If using this command via an AI agent or automated tool, set a higher timeout (3 minutes or more) to avoid premature termination.

## Output

Returns curated solutions with:
- **Title & Description** - What the solution does
- **Trigger Prompt** - Ready-to-use prompt to start the workflow
- **Required Skills** - GitHub links to install the skills
- **Comparison** - Trade-offs between different approaches
