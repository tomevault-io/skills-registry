# YouTube Title

This skill enables generation of high-performing YouTube video titles optimized for click-through rate (CTR). Titles are designed to spark curiosity, complement thumbnails, and compel viewers to click.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- The user asks to create a title for a YouTube video
- The user requests title ideas or brainstorming for video content
- The user wants to improve or optimize an existing video title
- Working on YouTube content creation and a title is needed
- The user asks for multiple title variations to test
- Researching and ideating a new YouTube video idea

## 🚨 MANDATORY READING 🚨

**CRITICAL**: Before generating ANY title, you **MUST** read and internalize the design requirements:
`references/design-requirements.md`

These requirements are **NON-NEGOTIABLE**. Every title must pass the design requirements checklist. Failure to follow these requirements will result in low-performing titles that do not drive clicks.

### Core Principles (Summary)

The design requirements document contains the complete specifications, but the core principles are:

1. **Curiosity is Mandatory**: Every title MUST prompt a specific question in the viewer's mind
2. **Complement, Don't Duplicate**: Title must work WITH the thumbnail, not repeat it
3. **No Generic Descriptions**: Titles that merely describe content are rejected
4. **Question Over Answer**: Raise questions, don't answer them in the title

## Prerequisites

### Gather Context

Before generating titles, it's critical that you have all of the context and information about the proposed video/episode, the user's youtube channel, target audience, etc. If you don't already have it from the conversation, you must first gather this information from the user's local context and filesystem, youtube data, and finally asking the user directly if needed.

Gather the following information:

### Required Information
- **Video topic/content**: What is the video about?
- **Target audience**: Who is this video for?
- **Key message**: What's the main takeaway or hook?

### Highly Recommended Information
- **Thumbnail description or image**: What does the thumbnail show? What text is on it?
- **Target emotion**: What emotion should the title evoke? (curiosity, shock, excitement, etc.)
- **Content type**: Educational, entertainment, vlog, tutorial, etc.

## Title Generation Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Context

Ask the user for required information if not already provided:

```
To create an optimized title, I need to understand:
1. What is the video about? (topic/content)
2. Who is your target audience?
3. What's the main hook or takeaway?
4. Do you have a thumbnail? If so, what does it show and what text is on it?
5. What emotion should the title evoke?
```

### Step 2: Read Design Requirements

**MANDATORY ACTION**: Read the complete design requirements:
`references/design-requirements.md`

This document contains:
- Curiosity generation requirements (MANDATORY)
- Thumbnail complementarity requirements (MANDATORY)
- Forbidden patterns to avoid
- Content type applications
- Title generation checklist
- High-performing vs low-performing patterns
- Quality standards and priority order

### Step 3: Identify the Question

Before writing any title, identify the specific question you want in the viewer's mind:

- What question will make them curious enough to click?
- Does this question align with the video content?
- Is the curiosity gap strong enough to drive action?

**Examples of good questions to prompt:**
- "What mistakes am I making?" → "Big Mistakes Small YouTube Creators Still Make!"
- "What happened?" → "I Should Have Seen This Coming..."
- "Why would someone do that?" → "the GRILLED CHEESE I ate every other day for 2 years"
- "Did they accept?" → "Offering People $100,000 To Quit Their Job"

### Step 4: Generate Title Options

Generate 3-5 title variations that:
1. Prompt the identified question
2. Complement (not duplicate) the thumbnail
3. Align with the target emotion
4. Follow content type best practices (educational vs entertainment)

**For each title, verify against the checklist:**
- [ ] **Curiosity Test**: Does this prompt a specific question?
- [ ] **Complementarity Test**: Does this work WITH the thumbnail (not duplicate it)?
- [ ] **Click Compulsion Test**: Is the curiosity gap strong enough?
- [ ] **Non-Descriptive Test**: Does this go beyond merely describing?
- [ ] **Target Audience Test**: Will this resonate with the demographic?

### Step 5: Present and Refine

Present the title options to the user with:
1. The title itself
2. The question it prompts in the viewer's mind
3. How it complements the thumbnail (if applicable)
4. Why it should drive clicks

Example presentation:

```
Here are 3 optimized title options:

1. "The AI Agent Mistake That Cost Me 10 Hours"
   - Prompts: "What mistake? How can I avoid it?"
   - Complements thumbnail showing frustrated face + error message
   - Creates urgency through time cost

2. "I Built This AI Agent Wrong (Here's What I Learned)"
   - Prompts: "What did they do wrong? What's the lesson?"
   - Personal experience framing creates relatability
   - Implies valuable learning without giving it away

3. "Why Your AI Agents Keep Breaking (And Mine Don't)"
   - Prompts: "Why do mine break? What's their secret?"
   - Creates contrast and curiosity
   - Positions viewer problem + solution tease
```

### Step 6: Iterate Based on Feedback

If the user requests changes:
1. Understand what aspect needs adjustment (curiosity, tone, length, etc.)
2. Regenerate while maintaining design requirements compliance
3. Re-verify against the checklist

## Common Patterns by Content Type

### Educational Content (How-to, Tutorials)
**Goal**: Frame instruction to spark curiosity, not just inform

- ✅ "The Secret Technique Pro Chefs Don't Want You to Know"
- ✅ "I Tried the 'Impossible' Coding Challenge"
- ✅ "Why Everyone Does [X] Wrong (And How to Fix It)"
- ❌ "How to Chop Onions Properly"
- ❌ "Python Tutorial for Beginners"

### Entertainment Content (Vlogs, Gaming)
**Goal**: Create intrigue through outcome uncertainty

- ✅ "Offering People $100,000 To Quit Their Job"
- ✅ "I Ate the Same Meal for 30 Days Straight"
- ✅ "They Didn't Believe Me Until..."
- ❌ "My Daily Vlog"
- ❌ "Playing Minecraft"

### Tech/AI Content (User's Channel)
**Goal**: Combine education with curiosity and problem-solving

- ✅ "The AI Agent Pattern Nobody Talks About"
- ✅ "I Broke Production With This One Line of Code"
- ✅ "Why Your AI Agents Fail (And How to Fix Them)"
- ❌ "Building AI Agents Tutorial"
- ❌ "How to Use Claude API"

## Quality Assurance

### Priority Order (from Design Requirements)
1. **Spark curiosity** (highest priority)
2. **Complement thumbnail**
3. **Raise viewer question**
4. **Create click compulsion**

### Rejection Criteria

**REJECT and regenerate if the title:**
- Merely describes the content without sparking curiosity
- Duplicates text that appears on the thumbnail
- Answers the question instead of raising it
- Uses generic patterns like "[Topic] Tutorial" without intrigue
- Fails the "What question does this raise?" test

### Success Criteria

**A successful title:**
- Prompts a specific, compelling question in the viewer's mind
- Works synergistically with the thumbnail
- Creates a curiosity gap strong enough to drive clicks
- Aligns with the target audience and content type
- Passes all 5 checklist items in the design requirements

## Notes

- **Curiosity is non-negotiable**: Description alone is insufficient
- **Always verify against checklist**: Every title must pass all 5 tests
- **Thumbnail coordination**: When possible, coordinate title with thumbnail design
- **Test multiple options**: Provide 3-5 variations for A/B testing consideration
- **Iterate ruthlessly**: Reject titles that don't meet standards, even if they're accurate
