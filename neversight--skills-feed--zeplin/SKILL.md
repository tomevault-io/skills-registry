# Zeplin Skill

## Overview
Enables Claude to use Zeplin for design-to-development handoff including accessing design specifications, downloading assets, viewing style guides, and managing design documentation.

## Quick Install

```bash
curl -sSL https://canifi.com/skills/zeplin/install.sh | bash
```

Or manually:
```bash
cp -r skills/zeplin ~/.canifi/skills/
```

## Setup

Configure via [canifi-env](https://canifi.com/setup/scripts):

```bash
# First, ensure canifi-env is installed:
# curl -sSL https://canifi.com/install.sh | bash

canifi-env set ZEPLIN_EMAIL "your-email@example.com"
canifi-env set ZEPLIN_PASSWORD "your-password"
```

## Privacy & Authentication

**Your credentials, your choice.** Canifi LifeOS respects your privacy.

### Option 1: Manual Browser Login (Recommended)
If you prefer not to share credentials with Claude Code:
1. Complete the [Browser Automation Setup](/setup/automation) using CDP mode
2. Login to the service manually in the Playwright-controlled Chrome window
3. Claude will use your authenticated session without ever seeing your password

### Option 2: Environment Variables
If you're comfortable sharing credentials, you can store them locally:
```bash
canifi-env set SERVICE_EMAIL "your-email"
canifi-env set SERVICE_PASSWORD "your-password"
```

**Note**: Credentials stored in canifi-env are only accessible locally on your machine and are never transmitted.

## Capabilities

- Export CSS/code snippets

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Get Design Specs
```
User: "What are the specifications for the header component?"
Claude: I'll pull up the header specs.
1. Opening Zeplin via Playwright MCP
2. Navigating to the project
3. Finding the header component
4. Extracting dimensions, colors, and fonts
5. Summarizing specifications
```

### Example 2: Download Assets
```
User: "Download all icons from the design system in SVG format"
Claude: I'll download the icons.
1. Opening the design system project
2. Navigating to assets section
3. Selecting all icons
4. Exporting as SVG format

4. Log style guide enhancements

## Notes
- Requires projects synced from design tools
- Supports Figma, Sketch, XD integrations
- Code snippets available in multiple languages
- Assets exportable in 1x, 2x, 3x scales
- Style guide requires pro/business plans
