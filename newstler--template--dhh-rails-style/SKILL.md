# DHH Rails Style Guide

Apply 37signals/DHH conventions to Ruby and Rails code.

## Core Philosophy

> "The best code is the code you don't write. The second best is the code that's obviously correct."

**Vanilla Rails is plenty:**
- Rich domain models over service objects
- CRUD controllers over custom actions
- Concerns for horizontal code sharing
- Records as state instead of boolean columns
- Database-backed everything (no Redis)
- Build solutions before reaching for gems

## What We Deliberately Avoid

| Avoid | Use Instead |
|-------|-------------|
| devise | Custom ~150-line auth |
| pundit/cancancan | Simple role checks in models |
| sidekiq | Solid Queue (database-backed) |
| redis | Database for everything |
| view_component | Partials |
| GraphQL | REST with Turbo |
| React/Vue | Hotwire + Stimulus |
| RSpec | Minitest |
| FactoryBot | Fixtures |

## Naming Conventions

### Methods

```ruby
# Verbs for actions
card.close
card.gild
board.publish

# Predicates return boolean
card.closed?
card.golden?
user.admin?

# Avoid set_ methods
# ❌ card.set_status("closed")
# ✅ card.close
```

### Concerns

Name as adjectives describing capability:

```ruby
module Closeable
  extend ActiveSupport::Concern
  # ...
end

module Publishable; end
module Watchable; end
module Searchable; end
```

### Scopes

```ruby
# Ordering
scope :chronologically, -> { order(created_at: :asc) }
scope :reverse_chronologically, -> { order(created_at: :desc) }
scope :alphabetically, -> { order(name: :asc) }
scope :latest, -> { order(created_at: :desc).limit(1) }

# Eager loading
scope :preloaded, -> { includes(:author, :comments) }

# Parameterized
scope :sorted_by, ->(column) { order(column) }
scope :created_after, ->(date) { where("created_at > ?", date) }
```

### Controllers

Nouns matching resources:

```ruby
# ❌ Bad: Custom actions
class CardsController
  def close; end
  def reopen; end
end

# ✅ Good: Nested resource
class Cards::ClosuresController
  def create; end   # POST /cards/:id/closure
  def destroy; end  # DELETE /cards/:id/closure
end
```

## REST Mapping

Transform custom actions into resources:

```
POST /cards/:id/close    → POST /cards/:id/closure
DELETE /cards/:id/close  → DELETE /cards/:id/closure
POST /cards/:id/archive  → POST /cards/:id/archival
POST /cards/:id/publish  → POST /cards/:id/publication
```

## Controller Patterns

```ruby
class Cards::ClosuresController < ApplicationController
  before_action :set_card

  def create
    @card.close(by: Current.user)
    redirect_to @card
  end

  def destroy
    @card.reopen(by: Current.user)
    redirect_to @card
  end

  private

  def set_card
    @card = Current.user.cards.find(params[:card_id])
  end
end
```

## Model Patterns

### State as Records

```ruby
# ❌ Bad: Boolean column
class Card < ApplicationRecord
  # closed: boolean
  def close
    update!(closed: true)
  end
end

# ✅ Good: State record
class Card < ApplicationRecord
  has_one :closure, dependent: :destroy

  def close(by: Current.user)
    create_closure!(closed_by: by)
  end

  def closed?
    closure.present?
  end
end

class Closure < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :card
  belongs_to :closed_by, class_name: "User"
end
```

### Concerns

```ruby
# app/models/concerns/closeable.rb
module Closeable
  extend ActiveSupport::Concern

  included do
    has_one :closure, as: :closeable, dependent: :destroy
    scope :closed, -> { joins(:closure) }
    scope :open, -> { where.missing(:closure) }
  end

  def close(by: Current.user)
    create_closure!(closed_by: by)
  end

  def reopen
    closure&.destroy
  end

  def closed?
    closure.present?
  end
end
```

## Current Attributes

```ruby
# app/models/current.rb
class Current < ActiveSupport::CurrentAttributes
  attribute :user, :session, :request_id

  def user=(user)
    super
    Time.zone = user&.time_zone || "UTC"
  end
end

# Usage anywhere
Current.user
Current.session
```

## Frontend Patterns

### Turbo Frames

```erb
<%= turbo_frame_tag dom_id(@card) do %>
  <%= render @card %>
<% end %>
```

### Turbo Streams

```erb
<%# app/views/cards/create.turbo_stream.erb %>
<%= turbo_stream.prepend "cards", @card %>
<%= turbo_stream.update "flash", partial: "shared/flash" %>
```

### Stimulus

```javascript
// Small, focused controllers
import { Controller } from "@hotwired/stimulus"

export default class extends Controller {
  static targets = ["menu"]

  toggle() {
    this.menuTarget.classList.toggle("hidden")
  }
}
```

## Testing

```ruby
# Minitest + fixtures
class CardTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
  test "can be closed" do
    card = cards(:open)
    card.close(by: users(:admin))
    assert card.closed?
  end
end
```

## Success Criteria

Code follows DHH style when:

- [ ] Controllers map to CRUD verbs on resources
- [ ] Models use concerns for horizontal behavior
- [ ] State tracked via records, not booleans
- [ ] No service objects or unnecessary abstractions
- [ ] Database-backed solutions (no Redis)
- [ ] Tests use Minitest with fixtures
- [ ] Turbo/Stimulus for interactivity
- [ ] No npm/yarn dependencies
