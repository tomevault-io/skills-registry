# Agent Guidelines & Operational Rules

## 1. The "Constitution" & Project Identity

**Project Name:** NextBlock CMS
**Mandate:** Build a premium, Open-Core Next.js CMS.
**Core Stack:** Next.js (App Router), Supabase, Tailwind CSS, Tiptap v3.

### Critical Rules

1.  **Strict Separation:** `libs/ui` and `libs/db` must be publishable as standalone packages. They cannot depend on `apps/nextblock`.
2.  **Open-Core Model:** The core is open-source (AGPL); premium extensions (like E-Commerce) are source-available but license-gated.
3.  **Distribution:** Users get a standalone app via `npm create nextblock`.

## 2. Operational Rules (Global Context)

- **Context First:** Before answering complex questions, always check `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/README.md` and relevant linked docs.
- **Strict Types:** Always use `strict: true` TypeScript. No `any` unless absolutely unavoidable and documented.
- **Target the App, Not the Template:** NEVER edit files in `apps/create-nextblock/templates/nextblock-template` directly. Always make changes in `apps/nextblock` (the core app). The template is synced from the core app via scripts.

## 3. Documentation Access

- Use the **`context7` MCP tool** to fetch the latest documentation for Next.js, Supabase, Nx, Tailwind, etc.
- Do not guess about API updates; verify with `context7` if unsure.

## 5. Project Knowledge Source (NotebookLM)

> [!TIP]
> **Use this for:** High-level roadmap, monetization strategy, and architectural "why" questions.
> **Notebook:** NextBlock CMS: Roadmap and Monetization Strategy

When you need deep context about the project's direction or specific architectural decisions not explained in the code:

1. **Query the Notebook:**

   ```bash
   python scripts/run.py ask_question.py --notebook-id nextblock-cms-roadmap-and-mone --question "Your question here"
   ```

2. **Wait for the answer:** It may take 10-20 seconds.
3. **Cite the source:** Mention that the info came from the project roadmap notebook.
