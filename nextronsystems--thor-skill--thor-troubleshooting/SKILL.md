description: Troubleshoot THOR runs that are stuck, slow, failing to start, stopping early, or produce missing output. Use when the user reports freezes, long runtimes, high CPU pauses, scan aborts, or licensing/update issues. Use when this capability is needed.

# THOR Troubleshooting Skill

Goal: diagnose the failure mode fast and propose minimal next actions.

Rules
- Assume AV/EDR interference until disproven (especially "frozen at 98%" style reports).
- For scan aborts: check last ~50 log lines first. Clear message = THOR's decision (Rescontrol/timeout). No message = external kill.
- Ask for exactly the minimum needed: platform + THOR version + command used + what "stuck" means (no progress? no output? stopped early?).
- Use Ctrl+C interrupt menu guidance when relevant.
- Prefer thor-util diagnostics when available.

Use these references when needed
- Stuck scans: reference/stuck-scans.md
- Scan aborts (Rescontrol, timeouts, AV/EDR kills): reference/scan-aborts.md
- AV/EDR interference patterns: reference/av-edr-interference.md
- Diagnostics: reference/diagnostics.md
- Performance and memory issues: reference/performance-and-resources.md
- Common pitfalls (fast empty scans, wrong paths): reference/common-pitfalls.md

Optional helper script
- scripts/quick-env-check.sh: quick info dump about folder permissions, free space, CPU/RAM, and THOR files present.

Output format
- Likely cause ranking (top 3)
- Next command(s) to run
- What evidence to collect (files/log snippets) if it persists
