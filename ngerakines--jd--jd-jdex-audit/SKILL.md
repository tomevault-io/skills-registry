# Johnny.Decimal JDex Audit

This skill compares a system's JDex (the authoritative index) against the
actual folder structure on disk, identifying mismatches and suggesting fixes.

---

## 1. Locate the System

### 1.1 Find the JD Root

Check common locations:

- `~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/JD/` (iCloud Drive)
- `~/Documents/JD/`
- `~/JD/`

If the user specifies a system code (e.g., "audit my P10 system"), target
that specific system. Otherwise, list all available systems and ask which
to audit.

### 1.2 Load the JDex

Read the JDex file at:

```
SYS/00-09 */00 */00.00 *JDex*
```

Parse it into a structured list of areas, categories, and IDs. Each entry
should capture:

- The AC.ID (or SYS.AC.ID) address
- The description/name
- Any +SUB entries

### 1.3 Snapshot the Filesystem

List all folders to depth 3 under the system root. Parse folder names to
extract AC.ID addresses, area ranges, and category numbers.

---

## 2. Compare JDex vs. Filesystem

Run three checks:

### 2.1 Orphaned JDex Entries

JDex entries that have no corresponding folder on disk.

These indicate either:
- A folder was deleted without updating the JDex
- A planned ID that was never created
- A typo in the JDex entry

### 2.2 Undocumented Folders

Folders on disk that have no corresponding JDex entry.

These indicate either:
- A folder was created without updating the JDex
- The JDex fell out of sync during manual organization
- A folder created by another tool or process

### 2.3 Name Mismatches

JDex entries whose description doesn't match the folder name, or folders
whose name doesn't follow the expected `AC.ID Description` format.

---

## 3. Check +SUB Indexes

For categories that use +SUB extensions:

### 3.1 Locate Index Files

+SUB categories typically have an index file (e.g., `51.01 Open-source project
index.md`). Find these by looking for files matching `*.md` at the category
or ID level that contain +SUB listings.

### 3.2 Compare Index vs. Folders

- List all `+NNNN` or `+CODE` folders within the ID
- Compare against the index file entries
- Flag missing or extra entries

---

## 4. Report Findings

Present a clear audit report to the user:

### Report Format

```markdown
## JDex Audit: [System name]

**Audit date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**JDex location:** [path]
**System root:** [path]

### Summary

| Check | Count |
|-------|-------|
| JDex entries | N |
| Filesystem folders | N |
| Orphaned JDex entries | N |
| Undocumented folders | N |
| Name mismatches | N |
| +SUB index issues | N |

### Orphaned JDex Entries (in JDex but no folder)

| AC.ID | Description | Suggested Action |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| 11.05 | Home improvement | Create folder or remove from JDex |

### Undocumented Folders (folder exists but not in JDex)

| Folder | Path | Suggested Action |
|--------|------|-----------------|
| 11.08 Garage storage | 10-19/11/11.08 | Add to JDex |

### Name Mismatches

| AC.ID | JDex says | Folder says | Suggested Action |
|-------|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| 11.03 | Home insurance | Homeowners insurance | Reconcile names |

### +SUB Index Issues

| Category | Issue | Details |
|----------|-------|---------|
| 51.01 | Missing from index | +0004 folder exists, not in index |
```

---

## 5. Offer Fixes

After presenting the report, offer to fix issues:

### Safe Fixes (do automatically with confirmation)

- **Add undocumented folders to JDex**: Append new entries matching the
  folder names.
- **Update +SUB index files**: Add missing entries to index files.

### Requires User Decision

- **Orphaned JDex entries**: Ask whether to create the missing folder or
  remove the JDex entry.
- **Name mismatches**: Ask which name is correct (JDex or folder) and
  update the other.

### Never Do Automatically

- **Delete folders**: Even if they appear orphaned, never delete without
  explicit user confirmation.
- **Rename folders**: Name changes can break references. Always confirm first.
- **Create new areas or categories**: These are structural decisions.

---

## 6. Regenerate JDex (Optional)

If the user requests it, offer to regenerate the JDex entirely from the
folder structure:

1. Walk the filesystem and build a complete list of areas, categories, and IDs.
2. Preserve any JDex-only metadata (cross-system references, notes, +SUB
   descriptions) from the existing JDex.
3. Write the new JDex, merging filesystem reality with JDex metadata.
4. Present the result for user approval before overwriting.

**Warning**: Regeneration loses any JDex entries that don't have corresponding
folders. Always confirm before proceeding.

---

## 7. Multi-System Audit

When auditing multiple systems:

1. Audit each system independently.
2. Present per-system reports.
3. Optionally check cross-system references: if P10.34.01 is referenced by
   F50.32.01, verify that both the source and the reference exist.
4. Provide a combined summary at the end.
