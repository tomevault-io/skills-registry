# ClawMail

Inbound email proxy for AI agents. Poll and manage email via REST API.

## First-Time Setup

If no token is configured, provision one for the user:

1. Ask what local part they want (e.g., "pinchy") and a recovery email
2. Run: `{baseDir}/scripts/clawmail.sh create <local> <recovery_email>`
3. Save the returned token by patching the gateway config:

```
gateway config.patch {"skills":{"entries":{"clawmail":{"env":{"CLAWMAIL_TOKEN":"cm_...","CLAWMAIL_API_URL":"https://clawmail.dev"}}}}}
```

4. Tell the user to save the token somewhere safe — it won't be shown again

## Existing Setup

If already configured, `CLAWMAIL_TOKEN` and `CLAWMAIL_API_URL` are set in `openclaw.json` under `skills.entries.clawmail.env`.

## CLI

```bash
{baseDir}/scripts/clawmail.sh <command>
```

Commands:

- `inbox` — list emails (`--unread` for unread only)
- `read <id>` — get full email body
- `mark-read <id>` — mark as read
- `archive <id>` — archive email
- `delete <id>` — delete email
- `create <local> <recovery_email>` — create new address
- `health` — check API status

## Direct API

All authenticated endpoints use `Authorization: Bearer cm_...`

```
GET    /api/mail               — list emails (?unread=true&limit=50)
GET    /api/mail/:id           — full email
PATCH  /api/mail/:id           — update {is_read, is_archived}
DELETE /api/mail/:id           — delete email
POST   /api/addresses          — create {local, recovery_email}
POST   /api/recover            — recover {address, recovery_email}
DELETE /api/addresses/me       — delete address + all mail
```

## Polling Pattern

Check inbox during heartbeats or on a cron:

```bash
CLAWMAIL_TOKEN=cm_... {baseDir}/scripts/clawmail.sh inbox --unread
```

If unread_count > 0, read and summarize new emails for the user.
