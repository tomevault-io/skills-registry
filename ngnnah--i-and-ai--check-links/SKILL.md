# /check-links

Validate internal URLs and relative paths across the repository to ensure all links are valid and maintained.

## Instructions

1. **Scan for files containing links**:
   - Search all markdown files (`**/*.md`)
   - Optionally include other file types if specified (`.rst`, `.txt`, source code comments)

2. **Extract internal links** using these patterns:
   - Markdown links: `[text](relative/path.md)`
   - Markdown references: `[text]: relative/path.md`
   - Image links: `![alt](relative/path.png)`
   - HTML links: `<a href="relative/path">`
   - Anchor links: `[text](#heading)` (validate heading exists)

   **Exclude from validation:**
   - External URLs (starting with `http://`, `https://`, `mailto:`, etc.)
   - Template placeholders (containing `{{`, `${`, etc.)

3. **Validate each link**:
   - Check if the target file/directory exists
   - For anchor links (`#heading`), verify the heading exists in the target file
   - For links to specific line numbers (`file.py:42`), verify the file has that many lines
   - Resolve paths relative to the file containing the link

4. **Report findings**:

   **Summary:**

   ```
   Files scanned: X
   Links found: Y
   Valid: Z
   Broken: N
   ```

   **Broken Links:** (grouped by source file)

   ```
   src/README.md:
     - Line 15: [docs](./missing-file.md) → File not found
     - Line 42: [API](#api-reference) → Heading not found

   docs/guide.md:
     - Line 8: [config](../config.yaml) → File not found
   ```

   **Valid Links:** (only if verbose mode requested)
   - List all validated links

5. **Provide fix suggestions**:
   - For each broken link, suggest possible corrections:
     - Similar file names that exist (fuzzy match)
     - Files that were recently renamed (check git history)
     - Correct relative path if the file exists elsewhere

## Modes

### Check Mode (default)

```
/check-links
/check-links docs/
```

Validate all links and report issues without making changes.

### Fix Mode

```
/check-links --fix
```

Interactively offer to fix broken links:

1. Show each broken link
2. Suggest possible replacements
3. Ask for confirmation before updating

### Watch Mode (for file moves)

```
/check-links --update old/path.md new/path.md
```

When a file is moved/renamed, find and update all links pointing to it:

1. Search for all references to the old path
2. Show files that will be updated
3. Replace old paths with new paths

## Common Patterns to Validate

| Link Type     | Pattern           | Validation                  |
| ------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------- |
| Relative file | `./file.md`       | File exists                 |
| Parent dir    | `../file.md`      | File exists                 |
| Repo root     | `/docs/file.md`   | File exists from repo root  |
| Directory     | `./folder/`       | Directory exists            |
| Anchor        | `#heading`        | Heading exists in same file |
| File + anchor | `file.md#heading` | File and heading exist      |
| Image         | `![](./img.png)`  | Image file exists           |

## Integration with Git

When run without arguments, prefer checking:

1. Files changed in current branch (vs main)
2. Staged files
3. All files (if no changes detected)

This helps catch broken links before commits.
