# /web-screenshot

Save images and screenshots from web content to a git-managed resources folder with descriptive naming.

## Instructions

When saving images from web content:

### 1. Naming Convention

Save files to `resources/screenshots/` using this format:

```
YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS_topic_slug.ext
```

**Components:**

- `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`: Timestamp (e.g., `20260122-143052`)
- `topic`: Category/source (e.g., `google-doodle`, `github`, `docs`)
- `slug`: Brief description in kebab-case (e.g., `mlk-day-2026`, `react-hooks-diagram`)
- `ext`: Original file extension (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.gif`, `.webp`)

**Examples:**

- `20260122-143052_google-doodle_mlk-day-2026.png`
- `20260115-091230_github_actions-workflow-diagram.png`
- `20260120-162045_docs_api-architecture.jpg`

### 2. Saving Process

```bash
# Get current timestamp
TIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)

# Download with descriptive name
curl -L -o "resources/screenshots/${TIMESTAMP}_topic_slug.ext" "IMAGE_URL"
```

### 3. Verify and Display

After saving:

1. Use the `Read` tool to verify the image was saved correctly
2. Display the image to the user
3. Confirm the saved path

### 4. Git Tracking

All screenshots in `resources/screenshots/` are git-tracked. After saving:

- Files are ready for commit
- Use descriptive commit messages: `docs: add screenshot of [topic]`

### 5. Index File

Update `resources/screenshots/INDEX.md` with a clickable link to the file:

```markdown
## Screenshots

| Date       | File                                                                                               | Description           | Source         |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | -------------- |
| 2026-01-22 | [`20260122-143052_google-doodle_mlk-day-2026.png`](20260122-143052_google-doodle_mlk-day-2026.png) | MLK Day Google Doodle | doodles.google |
```

**Format:** `[filename](filename)` - links to the file in the same directory for one-click viewing.

## Examples

**User:** "What's the Google Doodle today? Save it as a screenshot"
**Action:** Fetch doodle, save as `20260122-143052_google-doodle_mlk-day-2026.png`

**User:** "Save this architecture diagram"
**Action:** Download image, save as `20260122-150000_docs_system-architecture.png`

**User:** "Screenshot the GitHub Actions workflow"
**Action:** Capture/fetch image, save as `20260122-160000_github_actions-workflow.png`
