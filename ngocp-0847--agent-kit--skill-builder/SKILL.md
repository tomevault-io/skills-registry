4. **Integration Test**: Does it work with target AI agents?

### Automated Testing

```python
# Example validation script
def validate_skill(skill_path):
    # Check file structure
    assert os.path.exists(f"{skill_path}/SKILL.md")
    
    # Validate frontmatter
    with open(f"{skill_path}/SKILL.md") as f:
        content = f.read()
        assert "name:" in content
        assert "description:" in content
    
    # Check content quality
    assert len(content) > 1000  # Minimum content length
    assert "## Purpose" in content
    assert "## Instructions" in content
```

### User Acceptance Testing

```markdown
## Test Scenarios

name: code-review-checklist
description: Systematic code review process with quality gates and best practices
version: 1.0.0
license: MIT
tags: [code-review, quality, process]

```

```markdown
# Code Review Checklist

Systematic approach to conducting thorough, constructive code reviews.

## Purpose

This skill provides a structured checklist for code reviews that ensures:
- Code quality and maintainability
- Security and performance considerations
- Team knowledge sharing
- Consistent review standards

## Instructions

### Phase 1: Initial Assessment

**Objective**: Quick overview and scope understanding

**Steps**:
1. Read the PR description and linked issues
2. Understand the business context and requirements
3. Identify the scope and complexity of changes
4. Check if automated tests pass

**Expected Output**:
- Understanding of what the code should accomplish
- Assessment of review complexity (simple/medium/complex)

### Phase 2: Code Quality Review

**Objective**: Evaluate code structure and implementation

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Code follows team style guidelines
- [ ] Functions are single-purpose and well-named
- [ ] Complex logic is commented and explained
- [ ] No obvious bugs or logic errors
- [ ] Error handling is appropriate
- [ ] No code duplication (DRY principle)

name: api-design-principles
description: REST API design guidelines and best practices for scalable, maintainable APIs
version: 1.0.0
license: MIT
tags: [api, rest, design, backend]
---
```

```markdown
# API Design Principles

Comprehensive guidelines for designing REST APIs that are intuitive, scalable, and maintainable.

## Core Principles

### 1. Resource-Oriented Design
APIs should model business entities as resources with clear hierarchies.

**Good**:
```
GET /users/123/orders/456
POST /users/123/orders
```

**Bad**:
```
GET /getUserOrder?userId=123&orderId=456
POST /createOrderForUser
```

### 2. HTTP Methods Semantics
Use HTTP methods according to their intended semantics.

| Method | Purpose | Idempotent | Safe |
|--------|---------|------------|------|
| GET | Retrieve resource | Yes | Yes |
| POST | Create resource | No | No |
| PUT | Update/replace resource | Yes | No |
| PATCH | Partial update | No | No |
| DELETE | Remove resource | Yes | No |

## 🔍 Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

#### Issue 1: Skill Not Recognized by AI Agent

**Symptoms**:
- Agent doesn't activate skill automatically
- Skill not found in available skills list

**Causes**:
- Incorrect file location
- Missing or malformed frontmatter
- Agent not configured to scan skills directory

**Solutions**:
1. Verify file is in correct location (`.cursor/skills/`, `.claude/skills/`, etc.)
2. Check frontmatter syntax and required fields
3. Restart AI agent to refresh skill cache
4. Explicitly mention skill name in prompt

#### Issue 2: Instructions Too Vague

**Symptoms**:
- Users can't follow instructions successfully
- AI agent produces inconsistent results
- Frequent clarification requests

**Causes**:
- Steps lack specific details
- Missing examples or context
- Assumptions about user knowledge

**Solutions**:
1. Add specific, actionable steps
2. Include concrete examples
3. Define technical terms and concepts
4. Test with users unfamiliar with the domain

#### Issue 3: Skill Too Complex

**Symptoms**:
- Users abandon skill partway through
- Instructions feel overwhelming
- Poor adoption rates

**Causes**:
- Trying to solve too many problems
- Lack of clear phases or milestones
- Missing quick-start options

**Solutions**:
1. Break into smaller, focused skills
2. Add progressive complexity levels
3. Provide quick-start and comprehensive paths
4. Include progress indicators
