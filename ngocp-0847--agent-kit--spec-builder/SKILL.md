## 🚀 Usage Instructions

### How to Use This Skill

1. **Provide the Feature Request**
   - Describe what you want to build
   - Include any context, constraints, or requirements
   - Mention target users and use cases

2. **Let the Skill Work**
   - The skill will guide you through all three phases
   - Ask clarifying questions if needed
   - Iterate on each document

3. **Review and Refine**
   - Review generated documents
   - Request modifications or additions
   - Ensure all stakeholders understand

4. **Track Implementation Progress**
   - Use the generated tasks as a checklist
   - Mark tasks as completed as you implement them
   - Update task status and notes as needed

### Example Invocation

```
Use spec-builder to generate a full spec for:
"Implement user authentication with 2FA, email verification, 
and session expiry handling in our web app."
```

### What You'll Get

After running this skill, you'll have three comprehensive documents:

1. **requirements.md** - Clear user stories and acceptance criteria
2. **design.md** - Technical architecture and component design
3. **tasks.md** - Detailed implementation tasks ready for developers

These documents are optimized for:
- Human developers to understand the system
- AI coding agents (Cursor, Copilot) to implement tasks
- Product teams to validate requirements
- Stakeholders to review scope and approach

---

## 💡 Best Practices

### When Creating Requirements
- Focus on WHAT, not HOW
- Make acceptance criteria testable
- Include both positive and negative cases
- Consider accessibility and internationalization

### When Creating Design
- Start high-level, then drill down
- Document WHY decisions were made
- Consider scalability from the start
- Think about error cases and edge conditions

### When Creating Tasks
- Keep tasks small and focused
- Make dependencies explicit
- Include clear acceptance criteria
- Provide enough context for independent work

### Quality Checklist
- ✅ Can a developer implement this without asking questions?
- ✅ Can QA create test cases from the requirements?
- ✅ Can an AI agent understand the task breakdown?
- ✅ Are trade-offs and risks documented?
- ✅ Is the scope clear (what's included and excluded)?

## 📝 Output File Organization

After running this skill, organize output files as:

```
project-root/
├── .claude/
│   └── specs/
│       └── [feature-name]/
│           ├── requirements.md
│           ├── design.md
│           └── tasks.md
```

Or place them in a dedicated specs directory:

```
project-root/
├── docs/
│   └── specs/
│       └── [feature-name]/
│           ├── requirements.md
│           ├── design.md
│           └── tasks.md
```

---

## � Iteratrion and Updates

This skill can also help you:

- **Refine existing specs**: Provide an existing spec document and ask to improve it
- **Update for changes**: When requirements change, update all three documents
- **Generate partial specs**: Only generate requirements or design if that's what you need
- **Compare approaches**: Generate multiple design options for evaluation

---

## 🎯 Success Metrics

A good spec generated by this skill should:

1. **Be Complete**: Cover all aspects from requirements to implementation
2. **Be Clear**: Anyone can understand without additional context
3. **Be Actionable**: Tasks can be implemented immediately
4. **Be Testable**: Acceptance criteria are specific and measurable
5. **Be Maintainable**: Easy to update as requirements evolve

```markdown
### Task #3: Implement 2FA Enrollment API

**Description**: Create API endpoint for users to enroll in 2FA

**Expected Output**:
- POST /api/v1/auth/2fa/enroll endpoint
- Returns QR code and backup codes
- Stores TOTP secret securely

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Endpoint returns 200 with QR code data
- [ ] Secret is encrypted before storage
- [ ] 10 backup codes generated
- [ ] Rate limiting applied (5 requests/hour)
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Q: The generated spec is too detailed**
A: Ask to generate a "lightweight" or "minimal" version

**Q: Need more technical depth**
A: Request "detailed technical design with code examples"

**Q: Tasks are too large**
A: Ask to "break down tasks into smaller sub-tasks of 2-4 hours each"

**Q: Need specific format**
A: Specify your organization's format: "Use our company's standard template"
