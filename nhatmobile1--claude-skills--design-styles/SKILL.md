# Design Styles

Apply professional design aesthetics to web and app projects with comprehensive style guidance, recommendations, and implementation details.

## How to Use This Skill

### 1. Apply a Specific Style by Name

When user mentions a style (e.g., "use glassmorphism", "apply brutalist design", "make it minimalist"):

1. Read `references/design-styles-comprehensive-reference.md` and locate the requested style
2. Extract key characteristics, color palettes, typography, and layout principles
3. Provide specific, actionable implementation guidance:
   - Color schemes with hex codes
   - Typography recommendations (font families, sizes, weights)
   - Layout principles (spacing, grid, structure)
   - CSS/code examples demonstrating the style
   - Component-specific guidance (buttons, cards, navigation, etc.)
4. Reference real-world examples from the guide

**Example response structure:**
```
I'll apply [STYLE NAME] to your project.

**Key Characteristics:**
- [List 3-5 defining features]

**Color Palette:**
- Primary: [hex codes]
- Secondary: [hex codes]
- Accents: [hex codes]

**Typography:**
- Headings: [font family, weights]
- Body: [font family, size]

**Layout Principles:**
- [Spacing guidelines]
- [Grid structure]
- [Key layout features]

**Implementation:**
[CSS/code examples]

**Real-world examples:** [List 2-3 from reference]
```

### 2. Recommend Styles Based on Criteria

When user asks "what design style for [X]?" or describes their project/audience/brand:

1. Read the comprehensive reference
2. Analyze based on user's criteria:
   - **Industry** → Check "Choosing the Right Style → By Industry"
   - **Target Audience** → Check "Choosing the Right Style → By Target Audience"
   - **Brand Personality** → Check "Choosing the Right Style → By Brand Personality"
   - **Project Type** → Match to industry categories
3. Recommend 2-4 appropriate styles with brief rationale
4. Ask user to select preferred style or provide more context

**Example response structure:**
```
Based on [CRITERIA], I recommend these design styles:

1. **[STYLE NAME]** - [Why it fits, 1-2 sentences]
2. **[STYLE NAME]** - [Why it fits, 1-2 sentences]
3. **[STYLE NAME]** - [Why it fits, 1-2 sentences]

Which style resonates with your vision? Or I can provide more details about any of these.
```

### 3. Browse/List Available Styles

When user asks "what design styles are available?" or "show me style options":

1. Read the comprehensive reference
2. Present the Quick Reference Table or organized categories
3. Offer to provide details on any specific style
4. Can filter by category if user specifies (e.g., "show me retro styles", "what are the modern styles?")

### 4. Combine with Frontend-Design Skill

When working alongside the frontend-design skill:

1. This skill provides the aesthetic direction (colors, typography, layout principles)
2. Frontend-design skill implements the actual code
3. Pass clear design specifications from this skill to frontend-design
4. Reference the comprehensive guide for style-specific patterns

When suggesting combinations, ensure they complement each other and don't create visual conflict.

## Implementation Guidelines

When providing implementation details:

### Color Palettes

Provide specific hex codes:
- Primary colors (2-3)
- Secondary/accent colors (2-3)
- Neutral colors (grays, backgrounds)
- Text colors (with contrast ratios for accessibility)

### Typography

Specify:
- Font families (with web-safe alternatives or Google Fonts)
- Heading hierarchy (H1-H6 sizes and weights)
- Body text size and line height
- Letter spacing for specific styles when relevant

### Layout Principles

Define:
- Spacing system (e.g., 8px grid, specific margins/padding)
- Grid structure (columns, gutters)
- Border radius values
- Shadow specifications (for relevant styles)
- Responsive breakpoints

### Code Examples

Provide CSS/code demonstrating:
- Component styling (buttons, cards, inputs)
- Layout patterns
- Style-specific effects (glass blur, neumorphic shadows, etc.)
- Responsive behavior

### Accessibility Considerations

Note any accessibility concerns for the style:
- Color contrast ratios (WCAG AA minimum)
- Motion sensitivity (for kinetic/motion-first styles)
- Touch target sizes
- Focus states

## Best Practices

1. **Always reference the comprehensive guide** - Load `references/design-styles-comprehensive-reference.md` to get accurate, detailed information
2. **Be specific and actionable** - Don't just describe the style, provide implementation details
3. **Include real examples** - Reference the examples listed in the comprehensive guide
4. **Consider accessibility** - Always note accessibility requirements for each style
5. **Suggest combinations thoughtfully** - Ensure hybrid styles complement each other
6. **Match to user context** - Consider industry, audience, and brand when recommending
7. **Provide visual hierarchy** - Explain how the style creates hierarchy and guides user attention
8. **Note trend longevity** - Reference whether the style is timeless or trend-dependent
