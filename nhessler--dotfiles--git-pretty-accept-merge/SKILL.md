# Git Pretty Accept Merge Workflow

This skill guides Claude through the proper git merge workflow based on the "pretty accept merge" pattern that preserves branch history and keeps commits clean.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- The project's CLAUDE.md or documentation specifies this as the merge workflow
- Merging feature branches that should preserve their history
- Asked to follow a "no fast-forward" or "--no-ff" merge strategy
- Working with projects that use rebase-first merge patterns

## Workflow Steps

Follow these steps in order:

### Step 1: Checkout main

```bash
git checkout main
```

### Step 2: Pull latest from origin

```bash
git pull origin main
```

### Step 3: Check if feature branch needs rebasing

Check the merge base to see if the feature branch has diverged from main:

```bash
git merge-base main <feature-branch>
git rev-parse main
```

If these return different commits, the branch needs rebasing.

### Step 4: Rebase feature branch (if needed)

If the branch needs rebasing:

```bash
git checkout <feature-branch>
git rebase main
```

Handle any conflicts that arise during rebase.

### Step 5: Merge with --no-ff

After rebasing (or if no rebase was needed):

```bash
git checkout main
git merge --no-ff <feature-branch> -m "<merge-commit-message>"
```

## Merge Commit Message Format

The merge commit should be high-level and explain what the branch accomplishes:

```
Merge branch 'feat/feature-name'

High-level summary of what this feature branch adds to the project.

Key additions:
- Bullet point 1
- Bullet point 2
- Bullet point 3
```

## Key Principles

- Always use `--no-ff` to preserve branch history
- Rebase feature branches to keep history clean
- The merge commit message should provide context for the overall feature
- Small fixes can be committed directly to main when appropriate
