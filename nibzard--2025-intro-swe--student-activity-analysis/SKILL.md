# Student Activity Analysis Skill

## When to Use This Skill

Invoke this skill when the user:
- Asks to "update the student activity analysis"
- Asks "how are students doing?" or "check student progress"
- Mentions checking class activity, lab submissions, or project work
- Wants to see who has completed labs or is actively contributing
- Needs to verify student participation or identify at-risk students

## Overview

This skill automates the analysis of student git activity in a software engineering course. It reads from a canonical student roster (OFFICIAL_STUDENT_ROSTER.json), queries git history, checks file systems, and generates a comprehensive markdown report (STUDENT_ACTIVITY_ANALYSIS.md).

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 0: Sync with Main Branch (CRITICAL)

**Always start by syncing with the main branch** to ensure you're analyzing the latest activity:

```bash
git fetch origin main
git merge origin main -m "Sync with main before analysis"
```

⚠️ **Why this is critical:** Without syncing, you may miss up to 76% of student activity that exists on the main branch but not on your current branch.

### Step 1: Collect Activity Data

Run the data collection script:

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/student-activity-analysis/collect_data.py
```

This script will:
- Read OFFICIAL_STUDENT_ROSTER.json
- Query git logs for each student (handling multiple usernames)
- Check lab01 completion (intro.py files)
- Check lab03 folders
- Analyze project folder activity
- Generate STUDENT_ACTIVITY_DATA.json

### Step 2: Generate Report

Run the report generation script:

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/student-activity-analysis/generate_report.py
```

This script will:
- Read STUDENT_ACTIVITY_DATA.json
- Generate formatted markdown tables
- Calculate statistics
- Write to STUDENT_ACTIVITY_ANALYSIS.md

### Step 3: Review and Commit

Review the generated report and commit if everything looks good:

```bash
git add STUDENT_ACTIVITY_ANALYSIS.md STUDENT_ACTIVITY_DATA.json
git commit -m "Update student activity analysis - $(date +%Y-%m-%d)"
git push -u origin <branch-name>
```

## Handling Edge Cases

The real world is messy. Students don't always follow instructions perfectly. This skill is designed to handle common inconsistencies:

### Edge Case 1: Multiple GitHub Usernames

**Problem:** A student may have multiple GitHub usernames or commit under different names.

**Example from roster:**
```json
"github_username": "jcuzic/Zlicone"
```

**Solution:** Split on "/" and query git with all usernames:
```bash
git log --all --author="jcuzic\|Zlicone" --oneline | wc -l
```

### Edge Case 2: Name Variations and Diacritics

**Problem:** Student names in folders may not match roster exactly due to diacritics or spelling.

**Roster:** "Stipe Ćubelić"
**Folder:** `students/lab03/scubelic/`

**Solution:** Use fuzzy matching when checking for folders:
- Convert names to lowercase
- Remove diacritics (ć→c, š→s, ž→z)
- Check for partial matches

### Edge Case 3: Lab Submissions in Wrong Location

**Problem:** Student may create intro.py in the wrong directory.

**Expected:** `students/<github_username>/intro.py`
**Actual:** `students/intro.py` or `students/lab01/<name>/intro.py`

**Solution:** Search entire students/ directory:
```bash
find students/ -name "intro.py" -type f
```

Then manually verify which file belongs to which student.

### Edge Case 4: Stale or Orphaned Project Folders

**Problem:** Project folders exist but no students in roster claim them.

**Examples:**
- `projects/garderoba/` (no team registered)
- `projects/climate-analyzers-asmith-bjohnson/` (demo data?)

**Solution:**
- List all projects in report
- Mark unmatched folders as "Unknown Team"
- Show commit count to help identify ownership

### Edge Case 5: Team Lead with No Commits

**Problem:** Student is listed as project lead but has 0 commits in project folder.

**Possible reasons:**
- Commits under different username
- Work done in different branch
- Administrative lead (not technical)

**Solution:**
- Mark as "Lead Only - Verify" status
- Manually review git log for project folder
- Check if commits exist under alternative username

## Validation and Error Handling

Before finalizing the report, validate:

1. **Student count matches:** Number of students in report = Number in roster
2. **No missing projects:** All project folders are accounted for
3. **Date ranges make sense:** First commit < Last commit
4. **Status classifications are consistent:**
   - "Very Active" = 15+ commits
   - "Active" = 5-14 commits
   - "Low Activity" = 2-4 commits
   - "Minimal Activity" = 1 commit
   - "No Git Activity" = 0 commits

If validation fails:
- Report the discrepancy
- Show which students/projects are problematic
- Ask user if manual review is needed

## Output Format

The generated STUDENT_ACTIVITY_ANALYSIS.md should include:

1. **Overview Statistics**
   - Total students (from roster)
   - Students with activity
   - Activity percentage

2. **Student Activity Table**
   - ALL students (even those with 0 commits)
   - Sorted by activity level (most active first)
   - Columns: Name, GitHub, Commits, Status, Lab01, Lab03, Project Role
   - NO email addresses (kept in JSON only)

3. **Project Teams Table**
   - ALL project folders
   - Columns: Project, Total Commits, Team Lead, Status
   - Include "Unknown" projects

4. **Recommendations**
   - Students needing attention (0 commits)
   - Positive highlights (very active students)

## Testing the Skill

To test this skill manually:

1. Create a test branch
2. Invoke the skill
3. Verify output contains all 52 students
4. Check that statistics add up correctly
5. Manually verify a few commit counts with `git log`

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Script says "OFFICIAL_STUDENT_ROSTER.json not found"**
A: Make sure you're in the repository root directory `/home/user/2025-intro-swe/`

**Q: Git log shows no commits for a student I know has commits**
A: Check if they have multiple GitHub usernames. Update roster with "username1/username2" format.

**Q: Student has intro.py but script doesn't detect it**
A: Check the file path. Script searches entire students/ directory but may need manual verification.

**Q: Project folder exists but not in any team's project_folder field**
A: This is an orphaned project. Script will mark it as "Unknown Team" - may need manual investigation.

## Files Managed by This Skill

- **OFFICIAL_STUDENT_ROSTER.json** (READ ONLY - never modified by scripts)
- **STUDENT_ACTIVITY_DATA.json** (Generated by collect_data.py)
- **STUDENT_ACTIVITY_ANALYSIS.md** (Generated by generate_report.py)

## Key Lessons Learned

1. **Always sync with main first** - Missing this step caused 76% of activity to be missed initially
2. **Include ALL enrolled students** - Even those with 0 activity need to be in the report
3. **Separate static from dynamic data** - Roster is manual, activity data is automated
4. **Handle real-world messiness** - Students use multiple usernames, misspell names, put files in wrong places
5. **Make it deterministic** - Same git state should produce same report every time
