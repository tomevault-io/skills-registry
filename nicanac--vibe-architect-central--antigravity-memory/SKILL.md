## Objective

Master the creation of effective Antigravity memory systems using either MEMORY.md files or the modular `.agent/rules/` directory. This skill covers file hierarchy, content structure, path-scoped rules, formatting, emphasis techniques, and common anti-patterns to avoid.

Memory files are automatically loaded at session startup, consuming tokens from your 200k context window. Every instruction competes with Antigravity's ~50 built-in instructions, leaving ~100-150 effective instruction slots for your customizations.

**Two approaches available:**

- **MEMORY.md** - Single file, simpler, best for small projects
- **.agent/rules/** - Modular files with optional path-scoping, best for large projects

## Quick Start

### Bootstrap New Project

Run `/init` in Antigravity to auto-generate a MEMORY.md with project structure.

Or create manually at project root:

```markdown
# Project Name

## Tech Stack

- [Primary language/framework]
- [Key libraries]

## Commands

- `npm run dev` - Start development
- `npm test` - Run tests
- `npm run build` - Build for production

## Code Conventions

- [2-3 critical conventions]

## Important Context

- [1-2 architectural decisions worth knowing]
```

### Quick Add Memory

Press `#` during a Antigravity session to quickly add new memory items without editing the file directly.

### Edit Memory

Use `/memory` command to open MEMORY.md in your system editor.

## File Hierarchy

Antigravity loads MEMORY.md files in a specific order. Higher priority files are loaded first and take precedence.

### Loading Order

| Priority    | Location                                                         | Purpose                                  | Scope             |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| 1 (Highest) | `/Library/Application Support/AntigravityCode/MEMORY.md` (macOS) | Enterprise policy (managed by IT)        | All org users     |
| 2           | `./MEMORY.md` or `./.agent/MEMORY.md`                            | Project memory (git-tracked)             | Team via git      |
| 2           | `./.agent/rules/*.md`                                            | Modular rules (git-tracked)              | Team via git      |
| 3           | `~/.agent/MEMORY.md`                                             | User preferences (global)                | All your projects |
| 3           | `~/.agent/rules/*.md`                                            | Personal modular rules (global)          | All your projects |
| 4 (Lowest)  | `./CLAUDE.local.md`                                              | Personal project prefs (auto-gitignored) | Just you          |

### Recursive Loading

Antigravity recurses UP from current directory to root, loading all MEMORY.md files found.

Running Antigravity in `foo/bar/` loads:

1. `foo/bar/MEMORY.md`
2. `foo/MEMORY.md`
3. Root-level files

Antigravity also discovers MEMORY.md in SUBTREES when reading files in those directories.

### Monorepo Strategy

For monorepos, use layered approach:

```
root/
├── MEMORY.md              # Universal: tech stack, git workflow
├── apps/
│   ├── web/MEMORY.md      # Frontend-specific patterns
│   └── api/MEMORY.md      # Backend-specific patterns
└── packages/
    └── shared/MEMORY.md   # Shared library conventions
```

Root file defines WHEN to use patterns; subtree files define HOW.

## Rules Directory

The `.agent/rules/` directory provides a **modular alternative** to monolithic MEMORY.md files. Instead of one large file, you organize instructions into multiple focused markdown files.

### When to Use Rules

**Use `.agent/rules/` when:**

- Project has many distinct concerns (testing, security, API, frontend)
- Different rules apply to different file types
- Team members maintain different areas
- You want to update one concern without touching others

**Use MEMORY.md when:**

- Project is small/simple
- All rules are universal
- You prefer a single source of truth

### Rules Structure

```
.agent/rules/
├── code-style.md      # Formatting and conventions
├── testing.md         # Test requirements
├── security.md        # Security checklist
├── frontend/
│   ├── react.md       # React-specific patterns
│   └── styles.md      # CSS conventions
└── backend/
    ├── api.md         # API development rules
    └── database.md    # Database conventions
```

**Key points:**

- All `.md` files are discovered recursively
- No imports or configuration needed
- Same priority as MEMORY.md
- Supports symlinks for sharing rules across projects

### Path Scoped Rules

Rules can be scoped to specific files using YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
paths: src/api/**/*.ts
---
# API Development Rules

- All API endpoints must include input validation
- Use the standard error response format
```

**Path patterns supported:**

| Pattern                | Matches                                    |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `**/*.ts`              | All TypeScript files in any directory      |
| `src/**/*`             | All files under `src/` directory           |
| `src/components/*.tsx` | React components in specific directory     |
| `src/**/*.{ts,tsx}`    | TypeScript and TSX files (brace expansion) |
| `{src,lib}/**/*.ts`    | Files in multiple directories              |

**Rules without `paths` frontmatter** load unconditionally for all files.

### User Level Rules

Create personal rules that apply to all your projects:

```
~/.agent/rules/
├── preferences.md    # Your coding preferences
├── workflows.md      # Your preferred workflows
└── git.md            # Your git conventions
```

User-level rules load before project rules, giving project rules higher priority for overrides.

### Symlinks Support

Share common rules across multiple projects using symlinks:

```bash
# Symlink a shared rules directory
ln -s ~/shared-claude-rules .agent/rules/shared

# Symlink individual rule files
ln -s ~/company-standards/security.md .agent/rules/security.md
```

Circular symlinks are detected and handled gracefully.

## Content Framework

Structure your MEMORY.md using the WHAT-WHY-HOW framework:

**WHAT** - Project Context: Tech stack, directory structure, architecture
**WHY** - Purpose: Architectural decisions, why patterns exist
**HOW** - Workflow: Commands, testing, git workflow, verification steps

```markdown
## Tech Stack

- Next.js 15 with App Router
- PostgreSQL via Prisma ORM

## Architecture Decisions

- Server Components for data fetching
- All forms use TanStack Form

## Commands

- `pnpm dev` - Start dev server
- `pnpm test:ci` - Run tests
- `pnpm build` - Production build

## Git Workflow

- Branch: `feature/name` or `fix/name`
- Run tests before committing
```

See [resources/section-templates.md](resources/section-templates.md) for complete templates.

## Emphasis Techniques

Antigravity follows emphasized instructions more reliably. Use these techniques strategically for critical rules.

### Keyword Hierarchy

Use emphasis keywords in order of severity:

| Keyword       | Use For               | Example                                      |
| ------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **CRITICAL**  | Non-negotiable rules  | `**CRITICAL**: Never commit secrets`         |
| **NEVER**     | Absolute prohibitions | `NEVER: Push directly to main`               |
| **ALWAYS**    | Mandatory behaviors   | `ALWAYS: Run tests before pushing`           |
| **IMPORTANT** | Significant guidance  | `IMPORTANT: Keep components under 300 lines` |
| **YOU MUST**  | Explicit requirements | `YOU MUST: Use TanStack Form for forms`      |

### Formatting Patterns

**Bold + CRITICAL keyword:**

```markdown
**CRITICAL**: Always run tests before pushing code
```

**Capitalized emphasis:**

```markdown
IMPORTANT: Do not commit environment variables
YOU MUST: Follow the git workflow outlined below
NEVER: Include API keys in code
ALWAYS: Use TypeScript strict mode
```

**Strikethrough for forbidden options:**

```markdown
- `pnpm test:ci` - Run tests (use this)
- ~~`pnpm test`~~ - NEVER use (interactive mode)
```

**Visual markers (use sparingly):**

```markdown
⚠️ WARNING: This affects production data
🔒 SECURITY: Never commit secrets to git
```

### Placement Strategy

Order matters. Antigravity pays more attention to:

1. **First items** in each section (put critical rules first)
2. **Repeated items** across sections (repeat critical rules in context)
3. **Emphasized items** with CRITICAL/NEVER/ALWAYS keywords

Structure your file with critical rules first:

```markdown
## Code Conventions

### Critical Rules

- **NEVER** commit .env files
- **ALWAYS** run tests before pushing
- **CRITICAL**: Use TanStack Form for ALL forms

### General Guidelines

- Prefer Server Components
- Keep components under 300 lines
```

### Repetition For Emphasis

For extremely important rules, repeat in multiple relevant contexts:

```markdown
## Forms

**CRITICAL**: Use TanStack Form for ALL forms

## Before Editing

- **CRITICAL**: Use TanStack Form for forms

## Code Review Checklist

- [ ] Forms use TanStack Form (**CRITICAL**)
```

## Writing Effective Instructions

### Golden Rule

Show your MEMORY.md to someone with minimal project context. If they're confused, Antigravity will be too.

### Be Specific

Vague instructions cause inconsistent behavior:

```markdown
❌ VAGUE:

- Format code properly
- Write good tests
- Follow best practices

✅ SPECIFIC:

- Run `pnpm lint` before committing (Prettier configured)
- Write tests in `__tests__/` using Vitest
- Use TanStack Form for all forms (see `src/features/form/`)
```

### Show Dont Tell

When format matters, show examples:

```markdown
❌ TELLING:
Use conventional commits with type and description.

✅ SHOWING:

## Commit Format

feat(auth): implement JWT authentication

Add login endpoint and token validation

Types: feat, fix, refactor, docs, test, chore
```

### Eliminate Ambiguity

Replace vague phrases with clear directives:

| Ambiguous            | Clear Alternative                   |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| "Try to..."          | "Always..." or "Never..."           |
| "Should probably..." | "Must..." or "May optionally..."    |
| "Generally..."       | "Always... except when [condition]" |
| "Consider..."        | "If [condition], then [action]"     |

### Define Edge Cases

Anticipate questions and answer them:

```markdown
❌ INCOMPLETE:
Run tests before pushing.

✅ COMPLETE:

## Testing

- Run `pnpm test:ci` before pushing
- If tests fail, fix before committing
- New features require tests in `__tests__/`
- Minimum 80% coverage for new code
```

### Provide Decision Criteria

When Antigravity must make choices, give criteria:

```markdown
## Component Choice

**Use Server Component when:**

- Data fetching only
- No user interaction needed

**Use Client Component when:**

- User interaction required
- Browser APIs needed (localStorage, window)
```

### Separate Obligation Levels

Clearly distinguish requirements from suggestions:

```markdown
## API Development

### Must Have

- Input validation with Zod
- Error handling for all endpoints

### Nice to Have

- Pagination for list endpoints
- Caching headers

### Must Not

- Expose internal errors to clients
- Log sensitive data
```

## Size Constraints

### Limits

- **Ideal**: 100-200 lines maximum
- **Practical max**: 300 lines before splitting
- **Universal items**: Under 60 lines

**Why these limits matter:**

- Antigravity reliably follows ~150-200 total instructions
- Antigravity's system prompt uses ~50 instructions
- Leaves ~100-150 slots for YOUR instructions
- Irrelevant content degrades instruction-following

### Scaling Strategy

When exceeding limits:

1. Move task-specific details to separate files
2. Link from MEMORY.md with descriptions
3. Use progressive disclosure pattern

```markdown
## Detailed Guides

- **API Routes**: See [docs/api-patterns.md](docs/api-patterns.md)
- **Testing**: See [docs/testing-guide.md](docs/testing-guide.md)
- **Deployment**: See [docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md)
```

## Imports Feature

MEMORY.md supports importing other markdown files:

```markdown
## External References

@docs/coding-standards.md
@~/.agent/my-global-preferences.md
@./team-conventions.md
```

### Import Rules

- Supports relative and absolute paths
- Home directory expansion with `~`
- Recursive imports up to 5 levels deep
- NOT evaluated inside code blocks or backticks

## Anti Patterns

### Never Include

**Code Style Rules** - Use linters instead (LLMs are expensive, linters are free)

**Secrets** - NEVER include API keys, database URLs, tokens, credentials

**Too Much Content** - Link to docs instead of embedding 500+ lines

**Extensive Code** - Reference files instead (code examples become outdated)

**Vague Instructions** - Be specific (see `<writing_effective_instructions>`)

### Examples What To Avoid

```markdown
❌ BAD:

- Use 2-space indentation (use Prettier instead)
- DATABASE_URL=postgresql://... (never include secrets)
- [500 lines of API docs] (link to external file)
- Format code properly (too vague)

✅ GOOD:

- ESLint/Prettier configured (see .eslintrc)
- Credentials in `.env` (never committed)
- API guide: See [docs/api.md](docs/api.md)
- Run `pnpm lint` before committing
```

## Examples

For complete examples, see reference files:

- **Minimal example**: [resources/section-templates.md](resources/section-templates.md) (templates section)
- **Comprehensive SaaS**: [resources/comprehensive-example.md](resources/comprehensive-example.md)
- **Project-specific**: [resources/project-patterns.md](resources/project-patterns.md) (Next.js, Express, Python, Monorepo)

## Workflow

### Decision Point

**ALWAYS ASK FIRST: Storage Strategy**

Before creating or updating memory files, ask the user:

> Do you want to use a single MEMORY.md file or split into separate `.agent/rules/` files?
>
> **Option 1: Single MEMORY.md** - All instructions in one file (simpler, best for small projects)
> **Option 2: Modular .agent/rules/** - Split by concern with optional path-scoping (better for large projects)

Use AskUserQuestion to present these options before proceeding.

**Decision guide:**

- **Choose MEMORY.md** if: < 100 lines of instructions, simple project, universal rules
- **Choose .agent/rules/** if: 100+ lines, multiple file types with different rules, team maintains different areas

### Creating New

**Creating New Memory (MEMORY.md approach)**

1. Start with `/init` or minimal template
2. Add tech stack and commands first
3. Add conventions as you encounter friction
4. Test with real tasks
5. Iterate based on Antigravity's behavior

### Creating Rules

**Creating New Memory (.agent/rules/ approach)**

1. Create `.agent/rules/` directory
2. Start with one file per major concern:
   - `general.md` - Universal project rules
   - `testing.md` - Testing conventions
   - `code-style.md` - Code conventions
3. Add path-scoped rules as needed:
   ```yaml
   ---
   paths: src/api/**/*.ts
   ---
   # API rules here
   ```
4. Test with real tasks in different file contexts
5. Split or merge files based on usage patterns

### Maintaining

**Maintaining Memory Files**

1. Review quarterly (or when project changes significantly)
2. Remove outdated instructions
3. Add patterns that required repeated explanation
4. Keep MEMORY.md under 200 lines (or split to .agent/rules/)
5. Use `#` for quick additions during work

### Migrating to Rules

**Migrating from MEMORY.md to .agent/rules/**

When MEMORY.md exceeds 200 lines:

1. Identify distinct sections (testing, API, frontend, etc.)
2. Create `.agent/rules/` directory
3. Move each section to its own file
4. Add `paths` frontmatter where rules are file-type specific
5. Keep only universal essentials in MEMORY.md (or delete it)
6. Test to ensure rules load correctly

### Troubleshooting

**Common Issues**

| Problem                          | Solution                                         |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Antigravity ignores instructions | Reduce file size, add emphasis (CRITICAL, NEVER) |
| Context overflow                 | Use `/clear`, split into .agent/rules/ files     |
| Outdated information             | Review quarterly, remove stale content           |
| Instructions conflict            | Consolidate, use hierarchy (root vs subtree)     |
| Rules not loading                | Check file is `.md`, in correct directory        |
| Path rules not applying          | Verify glob pattern matches target files         |

## Advanced Features

### Local Overrides

Use `CLAUDE.local.md` for personal preferences (auto-gitignored):

- Personal shortcuts and aliases
- Editor-specific settings
- Local testing commands

### Settings Integration

MEMORY.md works alongside `settings.json`:

- `settings.json`: Permissions, allowed tools, environment variables
- `MEMORY.md`: Context, conventions, workflow instructions

### Progressive Disclosure

For complex projects, link to detailed docs. Antigravity only loads when relevant:

```markdown
## References

- **Database**: See [docs/database.md](docs/database.md)
- **API**: See [docs/api.md](docs/api.md)
```

## Success Criteria

A well-crafted Antigravity memory system:

**For MEMORY.md approach:**

- Loads in under 200 lines
- Contains only project-specific context (not general knowledge)
- Uses emphasis for critical rules (CRITICAL, NEVER, ALWAYS)
- Avoids code style rules (use linters)
- Contains NO secrets or credentials
- Provides clear commands for common tasks
- Follows WHAT-WHY-HOW structure

**For .agent/rules/ approach:**

- Each file focused on one concern (testing, API, security, etc.)
- Path-scoped rules use accurate glob patterns
- No duplicate rules across files
- Files organized in logical subdirectories
- Symlinks used for shared rules across projects

**Both approaches:**

- Gets updated as project evolves
- Improves Antigravity's first-try accuracy on tasks
- User was asked which approach they prefer before implementation
