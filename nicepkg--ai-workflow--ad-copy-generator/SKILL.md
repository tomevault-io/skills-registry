## Platform-Specific Best Practices

### Google Ads
- Include keywords in headlines (improves Quality Score)
- Use numbers and stats ("Save 50%", "10x Faster")
- Include brand name in at least 2 headlines
- Use power words: Free, New, Exclusive, Limited, Proven
- Always include CTA: Get, Try, Start, Discover, Learn

### Meta Ads
- Hook in first 3 words (most scroll quickly)
- Use emojis sparingly for B2C, avoid for B2B
- Ask questions to increase engagement
- Social proof performs well (X customers trust us)
- Video: Hook in first 3 seconds

### LinkedIn Ads
- Professional tone, but not boring
- Lead with value, not sales pitch
- Industry-specific language builds credibility
- Stats and data resonate with B2B audience
- Thought leadership angle often outperforms direct sales

### TikTok Ads
- Casual, authentic tone (not corporate)
- Hook in first 1-2 seconds
- Trending sounds/formats increase reach
- User-generated content style performs best
- Strong CTA at the end
