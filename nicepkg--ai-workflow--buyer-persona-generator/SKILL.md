## Best Practices

### Data Sources for Personas

2. **Sales Team Input** - Win/loss analysis, common objections
3. **Support Tickets** - Frequent issues, language used
4. **Analytics** - Demographics, behavior patterns
5. **Social Listening** - LinkedIn, communities, forums
6. **Review Sites** - G2, Capterra, Trustpilot reviews
7. **Competitor Analysis** - Who are they targeting?

### Validation Checklist
- [ ] Based on real customer data, not assumptions
- [ ] Sales team recognizes and agrees with personas
- [ ] Includes actual customer quotes
- [ ] Covers full buying committee (not just champion)
- [ ] Addresses both rational and emotional factors
- [ ] Includes specific messaging guidance
- [ ] Updated within last 6 months

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Creating too many personas (3-5 is ideal)
- Making personas too generic
- Ignoring the "blocker" persona
- Assuming B2B decisions are purely rational
- Not updating personas as market changes
- Creating personas without sales team input

## Integration

Works well with:
- **marketing-strategy-pmm** - Use personas in positioning
- **content-brief** - Create persona-targeted content

- **email-template-generator** - Personalized email sequences
