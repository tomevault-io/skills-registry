# Capture Triage

## What This Does

Turns mobile captures into actionable tasks in your Ready queue. Everything captured has
intent - this skill makes it explicit so task-clarity-scanner can decide what's important.

## Who It's For

Ed - capturing quick thoughts in Drafts Pro throughout the day.

## The Philosophy

> Everything captured has intent. Route to Ready, let task-clarity-scanner decide what
> moves to Someday/Maybe.

No passive filing. Every capture becomes a decision point.

---

## Paths

```
Inbox:      /Users/eddale/Documents/COPYobsidian/MAGI/Zettelkasten/Inbox/
Processed:  /Users/eddale/Documents/COPYobsidian/MAGI/Zettelkasten/Inbox/Processed/
Daily note: /Users/eddale/Documents/COPYobsidian/MAGI/Zettelkasten/YYYY-MM-DD.md
Projects:   /Users/eddale/Documents/COPYobsidian/MAGI/Zettelkasten/PROJECT - *.md
Contacts:   /Users/eddale/Documents/COPYobsidian/MAGI/Zettelkasten/CONTACT - *.md
```

---

## Important: Naming Clarification

| Term | What It Means |
|------|---------------|
| Inbox **folder** | `/Zettelkasten/Inbox/` - where Drafts Pro sends mobile notes |
| Captures **section** | `## Captures` in daily note - links to docs created today |
| Ready **destination** | `## Ready` section in daily note - where triaged tasks go |

**Remember:** This skill reads from the Inbox FOLDER and routes to the Ready SECTION.
Tasks go to Ready section only - Captures section is for document links.

---

## Instructions

### Step 1: Check Inbox Folder (Root Only)

**Important:** Only check files directly in Inbox/, NOT subdirectories.

```bash
ls /Users/eddale/Documents/COPYobsidian/MAGI/Zettelkasten/Inbox/*.md 2>/dev/null
```

If no files found: Report "No captures waiting" and stop.
If files found: Continue to Step 2.

### Step 2: Load Context

Pull active project names from mission-context skill AND:

```
Glob: /Users/eddale/Documents/COPYobsidian/MAGI/Zettelkasten/PROJECT - *.md
```

Build a list of project names for matching.

### Step 3: Read and Classify Each Capture (Background OK)

**This step can run in background.** Read and classify all captures before surfacing to user.

For each `.md` file in Inbox:
1. Read full content
2. **Extract source URL from frontmatter** (see Step 3b)
3. Detect if already-processed (see Step 3a)
4. Classify by intent (see Step 4)

Surface to user only after ALL files are read and classified.

### Step 3b: Extract Source URLs

**For x-bookmark files** (filename starts with `x-`):
- Read `tweet_url` from YAML frontmatter
- This URL MUST be included when routing to Ready

**For other captures with URLs:**
- Check for `url:`, `source_url:`, or `link:` in frontmatter
- Check for markdown links `[text](url)` in body
- Preserve any URLs found for routing step

### Step 3a: Detect Already-Processed Content

If capture content looks like a summary (has structure, headers, quotes sources):
- Flag as `[PROCESSED]`
- Will suggest routing as REFERENCE
- Won't offer research-swarm (already researched)

**Signals of processed content:**
- Has markdown headers (##, ###)
- Contains bullet lists with structured info
- Quotes or attributes other sources
- Looks like notes from a video/article

### Step 4: Classify Each Capture

**Priority Rule:** Inline hints override auto-detection. Check for these FIRST:
- `IDEA:` or `Idea:` → IDEA
- `Research:` → RESEARCH (triggers swarm option)
- `for [Project Name]` → PROJECT_UPDATE
- `Task:` or `TODO:` → TASK

**Auto-Detection (if no inline hint):**

| Signal | Classification |
|--------|----------------|
| Starts with verb (call, email, buy, check, send, schedule) | TASK |
| Contains `Research:` hint or explicit question needing investigation | RESEARCH |
| "What if..." or speculative language | IDEA |
| Mentions active project name | PROJECT_UPDATE |
| Person's name + action context | CONTACT |
| Links, articles, saved content, observations | REFERENCE |

### Step 5: Show Classification Preview (Two-Step)

**Two-Step Pattern:** Show preview table first, then ask decision in a separate message.
Let user absorb the information before asking what to do.

---

#### Step 5a: Present the Table

Show what you found. Let user absorb the information first:

```
## Capture Triage Preview

Found [N] captures. Here's how I've classified them:

| # | File | Preview | Classification | Suggested Routing |
|---|------|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| 1 | note1.md | "Call dentist..." | TASK | Ready: Call dentist (MM-DD) |
| 2 | note2.md | "What if we..." | IDEA | Ready: Consider: [idea] (MM-DD) |
| 3 | summary.md | [PROCESSED] "Article about..." | REFERENCE | Ready: Review: [title] (MM-DD) |
| 4 | question.md | "Research: how do..." | RESEARCH | Spawn research-swarm? |
```

**Pause here.** Let the user see and absorb the table before asking for a decision.

---

#### Step 5b: Ask for Decision

After showing the table, ask ONE question using AskUserQuestion:

```
How would you like to proceed?

1. **Approve all** - Route everything as shown
2. **Go one-by-one** - Review each item individually
3. **Modify** - Change specific classifications before routing
4. **Skip all** - Don't process any captures right now
```

**Key points:**
- Show [PROCESSED] flag for already-summarized content
- RESEARCH items present in preview table with spawn option - user approves before spawning
- Let user approve, modify, or skip before any changes

### Step 6: Route by Classification

After approval, route each capture:

| Classification | Destination | Format |
|----------------|-------------|--------|
| TASK | Ready | `- [ ] [action] (MM-DD)` |
| IDEA | Ready | `- [ ] Consider: [idea] (MM-DD)` |
| REFERENCE | Ready | `- [ ] Review: [linked title](URL) - brief context (MM-DD)` |
| RESEARCH | If approved: spawn agent | See Step 7 |
| PROJECT_UPDATE | Project file | Timestamped append to `## Context Gathered` |
| CONTACT | Create note + Ready | `- [ ] Follow up with [Name] (MM-DD)` |

**IMPORTANT: Review tasks MUST include links.**

For REFERENCE items, always include the source link so Ed can find it:
- X bookmarks: `[Title](https://x.com/author/status/ID)`
- Articles: `[Article Title](URL)`
- Obsidian docs: `[[Document Name]]`
- YouTube: `[Video Title](URL)`

If a capture has no URL but references external content, note this: `(source needed)`

---

**Edit Instructions:**

For each item routed to Ready:
1. Open today's daily note at:
   `/Users/eddale/Documents/COPYobsidian/MAGI/Zettelkasten/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
2. Find the `## Ready` section
3. Use Edit tool to append the task in the format shown above
4. **Do NOT add to `## Captures`** - that section is for document links only

Example Edit operation:
```
old_string: "## Ready\n- [ ] existing task"
new_string: "## Ready\n- [ ] existing task\n- [ ] [new task from capture] (01-06)"
```

**If creating PROJECT or CONTACT files:** Those files get created separately, and a
LINK to them goes in Ready as a task (e.g., `- [ ] [[PROJECT - Name]] - brief desc`).

### Step 7: Handle Research (Only When Requested)

**Only spawn research-swarm if:**
- User explicitly approved during Step 5 preview
- Capture has `Research:` inline hint AND user confirmed

For each approved RESEARCH item:

```
Task(
  description="Research: [Topic]",
  prompt="Research question: [Full capture content]

  Use research-swarm pattern to investigate. Save findings to Zettelkasten.
  When complete, add review task to Ready: '- [ ] Review: [[Research - Topic]] (MM-DD)'",
  subagent_type="research-swarm",
  run_in_background=true
)
```

Add placeholder to daily note:
```
- [RESEARCH] [Topic] - swarm running in background
```

### Step 8: Handle Contacts

When a capture mentions a person with action context:

1. Check if `CONTACT - [Name].md` exists
2. If exists: Append to `## Interactions` section
3. If new: Create contact note using template
4. Always add follow-up task to Ready

**Contact Note Template:**

```markdown
---
type: contact
created: YYYY-MM-DD
source: capture-triage
---

# [Person Name]

## Context
[Original capture content]

## Interactions
- YYYY-MM-DD: Initial capture - [summary]

## Follow-up
[Any implied next steps]
```

### Step 9: Move to Processed

After routing each capture:

```bash
mv "[Inbox file]" "[Processed folder]"
```

Move files to Inbox/Processed/ as safety net (preserves originals).

### Step 10: Generate Triage Summary

```markdown
## Capture Triage - YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM

**Processed:** N items | **Research spawned:** M (if any)

### Routed to Ready
- [N] tasks
- [N] ideas (Consider:)
- [N] references (Review:)

### Research Running
- [Topic] - spawned at HH:MM

### Actions Taken
- Moved N files to Inbox/Processed/
- Created CONTACT - [Name].md (if any)
- Updated PROJECT - [Name].md (if any)
```

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Dry Run Preview

**Inbox folder contains 4 files:**

```
1. "Call dentist Monday about cleaning"
2. "What if we did a 5-day hook challenge?"
3. [PROCESSED] "Summary of Karpathy video - 6 paradigm shifts..."
4. "Research: how do successful coaches use AI?"
```

**Skill shows:**

```
## Capture Triage Preview

| # | Capture | Classification | Suggested Action |
|---|---------|----------------|------------------|
| 1 | "Call dentist..." | TASK | → Ready: "Call dentist Monday (01-05)" |
| 2 | "What if we..." | IDEA | → Ready: "Consider: 5-day hook challenge (01-05)" |
| 3 | [PROCESSED] "Summary of Karpathy..." | REFERENCE | → Ready: "Review: [Karpathy video](URL) - 6 paradigm shifts (01-05)" |
| 4 | "Research: how do coaches..." | RESEARCH | → Spawn research-swarm? |

Approve all, modify, or skip items?
```

### Example 2: After Approval

User approves all, including research swarm for #4.

**Result:**
- Ready gets 3 new tasks + 1 research placeholder
- Research-swarm spawns in background
- All 4 files moved to Processed/
- Summary generated

---

## Guidelines

- **Two-step preview** - Show table first, ask decision second (separate messages)
- **Ready, not Captures** - All triaged items become tasks in `## Ready` section
- **Dry run is standard** - Always show preview before routing
- **Respect inline hints** - They override auto-detection
- **Research-swarm is opt-in** - Ask before spawning
- **[PROCESSED] content** - Flag summaries, suggest REFERENCE routing
- **Everything to Ready** - Let task-clarity-scanner handle prioritization
- **Preserve originals** - Move to Processed/ folder as safety net
- **Review tasks need links** - Always include source URL or wikilink so Ed can find the content

## Version History

| Version | Date | Changes |
|---------|------|---------|
| 1.0 | 2025-01-05 | Initial build as inbox-triage |
| 2.0 | 2025-01-05 | Renamed to capture-triage, added dry run, AskUserQuestion flow, all routes to Ready |
| 2.1 | 2026-01-06 | Renamed folder Captures→Inbox, split Step 5 into two-step preview, explicit Ready section routing, background OK for classification |
| 2.2 | 2026-01-12 | Added requirement: Review tasks MUST include source links (URL or wikilink). Added Step 3b to extract URLs from frontmatter (especially x-bookmark tweet_url) |

---

## Notes & Learnings

- Day 1 test processed 32 captures with backlog - dry run prevented overwhelm
- [PROCESSED] detection helps avoid re-researching already-summarized content
- Research-swarm opt-in prevents runaway agent spawning
- Review tasks without links are useless - Ed can't find the content to review (added v2.2)
