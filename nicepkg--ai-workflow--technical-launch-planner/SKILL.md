# Technical Launch Planner

## Overview

Plan and execute successful launches for technical products, developer tools, APIs, SDKs, and platforms. This skill provides frameworks, checklists, and templates specifically designed for technical audiences and developer-focused products.

**Built for:**
- Developer tools and platforms
- APIs and SDKs
- Technical infrastructure products
- B2D (Business-to-Developer) products
- SaaS with technical buyers

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Assess Your Launch Tier

Run the interactive assessment:

```bash
scripts/assess_launch_tier.sh
```

This determines if your launch is:
- **Tier 1** (Major/GA) - New product, major version, significant expansion
- **Tier 2** (Standard) - New features, integrations, regional expansion
- **Tier 3** (Minor) - Updates, improvements, small features

### 2. Generate Launch Plan

Create your comprehensive launch plan:

```bash
scripts/generate_launch_plan.sh
```

Provides structured plan with:
- Timeline and milestones
- Stakeholder responsibilities
- Developer enablement checklist
- Go-to-market activities
- Launch day playbook

### 3. Validate Readiness

Before launch, check readiness:

```bash
scripts/validate_readiness.sh
```

Validates:
- Documentation completeness
- Technical assets ready
- Stakeholder alignment
- Messaging finalized
- Metrics instrumentation

## Core Launch Framework

### Launch Tiers

Different launches require different levels of investment:

| Tier | Type | Examples | Investment |
|------|------|----------|------------|
| **Tier 1** | Major | GA launch, new product, major version | Full GTM, events, PR |
| **Tier 2** | Standard | New features, integrations, SDKs | Selective GTM, blog, docs |
| **Tier 3** | Minor | Updates, improvements, patches | Changelog, in-app |

See `references/launch_tiers.md` for complete framework.

## Developer Launch Best Practices

### 1. Documentation First

**Launch is NOT ready without:**
- ✅ Getting started guide
- ✅ API reference
- ✅ At least 3 code samples
- ✅ Integration guide

**Developer rule:** "If it's not documented, it doesn't exist"

---

### 2. Show, Don't Tell

**Developers want to see code:**

**Good:**
```python
# Initialize the SDK
import acme_sdk

client = acme_sdk.Client(api_key="your_key")
result = client.widgets.create(name="My Widget")
print(result.id)
```

**Bad:**
"Our SDK makes it easy to create widgets with just a few lines of code"

---

### 3. Interactive > Passive

**Engagement hierarchy:**
1. 🥇 Interactive tutorial/playground
2. 🥈 Live demo
3. 🥉 Demo video
4. ❌ Static screenshots

---

### 4. Honest Technical Communication

**Developers appreciate:**
- Limitations clearly stated
- Performance characteristics
- Pricing transparency
- Migration complexity
- Breaking changes

**Developers hate:**
- Overpromising
- Hidden limitations
- Surprise breaking changes
- Vendor lock-in

---

### 5. Community-First Approach

**Engage where developers are:**
- Answer questions on Stack Overflow
- Be active in GitHub discussions
- Respond on Hacker News
- Join relevant Discord/Slack
- Participate in Reddit AMAs

**Don't:**
- Spam communities
- Ignore negative feedback
- Delete critical comments
- Only show up for launches

---

## Technical Metrics

### Developer Adoption Metrics

**Activation:**
- Sandbox/trial sign-ups
- First API call within 24 hours
- SDK downloads
- "Hello World" completions

**Engagement:**
- Daily/Weekly Active Developers
- API calls per developer
- Features adopted
- Integration depth

**Retention:**
- Day 7, 30, 90 developer retention
- Churn rate
- NPS (Developer)

See `references/metrics_frameworks.md` for complete guide.

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Launching Without Complete Docs

**Problem:** "Docs will be ready soon" = Dead launch

**Solution:** Docs are non-negotiable. Delay launch if needed.

---

### Pitfall 2: Marketing-Speak for Developers

**Problem:** "Revolutionary", "Seamless", "Game-changing"

**Solution:** Use concrete technical language, metrics, code.

---

### Pitfall 3: Ignoring Migration Complexity

**Problem:** Breaking changes with no migration guide

**Solution:** Clear migration guide, migration tools, version support plan.

---

### Pitfall 4: Over-Indexing on Launch Day

**Problem:** All effort on Day 1, nothing for ongoing adoption

**Solution:** Plan 4-week post-launch content calendar.

---

### Pitfall 5: No Developer Feedback Loop

**Problem:** Launch and disappear

**Solution:** Active community engagement, regular office hours.

---
