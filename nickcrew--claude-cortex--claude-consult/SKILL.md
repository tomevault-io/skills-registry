description: Consult Claude specialist agents during implementation for codebase understanding, pattern checking, security review, debugging help, and more. Use this skill whenever you're unsure about conventions, stuck on a failure, or need expert input before writing code. Does not replace the formal review gates in agent-loops — this is for mid-implementation consultation. Use when this capability is needed.

# Claude Consult

Get expert help from Claude specialist agents during implementation. Each agent
has domain-specific skills pre-loaded and tools scoped to its role.

**This is NOT a replacement for the review gates.** The `agent-loops` skill
defines formal code review (`specialist-review`) and test audit
(`test-review-request`) gates that run after implementation. This skill is for
asking questions **during** implementation — before you've written code, while
you're writing it, or when you're stuck.

## When to Use

- "How does this module work?" — before implementing
- "Does my approach match existing conventions?" — while implementing
- "Is this pattern secure?" — before committing to a design
- "Why is this test failing?" — when stuck
- "What do the testing standards say about X?" — before writing tests
- "Is this component accessible?" — during UI work

## How to Invoke

```bash
claude -p --agent <agent-name> "<your question>"
```

All agents run headless (`-p` / print mode). They read the codebase, apply their
loaded skills, and return an answer to stdout. Capture or pipe as needed:

```bash
# Direct invocation
claude -p --agent debugger "Why is test_auth_flow failing in src/auth/tests.py?"

# Capture to variable
ANSWER=$(claude -p --agent security-auditor "Is the input validation in src/api/handler.py safe?")

# Save to file
claude -p --agent architect-reviewer "Does adding a cache layer between api and db match the existing architecture?" > /tmp/arch-advice.md
```

## Operating Rules

### 1. Consult, don't delegate implementation

These agents advise — they don't write your code. Read the answer, apply it
yourself. The agent may suggest approaches, but **you** implement them.

### 2. Scope your questions

Bad: `"Review everything in src/"`
Good: `"Is the input validation in src/api/handler.py:45-60 safe against injection?"`

Narrow questions get better answers and use fewer tokens.

### 3. Don't replace review gates

Consulting `security-auditor` during implementation doesn't skip the formal
`specialist-review` gate afterward. The review gates exist for independent
verification — consulting during implementation is for getting guidance early.

### 4. Use the cheapest agent that works

For factual lookups (where is X, what does the standard say), prefer
`search-specialist` or the language-specific agents. Reserve
`security-auditor`, `debugger`, and `performance-engineer` for questions
that need deeper analysis.

### 5. One question per invocation

Each `claude -p --agent` call is a cold start. Don't try to batch multiple
unrelated questions in one call — they'll get shallow treatment. Ask one
focused question per invocation.

## Relationship to agent-loops

```
agent-loops                          claude-consult
─────────────                        ──────────────
Formal review gates                  Mid-implementation help
Runs AFTER implementation            Runs DURING implementation
Produces reports with P0-P3          Answers questions directly
Required before merge                Optional, use as needed
specialist-review + test-review      Any agent from the roster
```

Both skills are designed to work together. Consult agents while implementing
to prevent issues, then run the formal review gates to verify nothing was missed.
