# Feature Development Workflow

Step-by-step process for developing features properly.

## Phase 1: Design
**Agents:** `system-architect`

- Design feature architecture
- Identify components and boundaries
- Define API contracts
- Document data flow

**Output:** Architecture diagram, component list, API contracts

## Phase 2: Planning
**Agents:** `requirements-analyst`

- Break down into implementable tasks
- Identify dependencies
- Estimate timeline
- Define acceptance criteria

**Output:** Task breakdown, dependency graph, timeline

## Phase 3: Implementation

- Implement feature following architecture
- Work in small, testable increments
- Commit frequently with clear messages

## Phase 4: Review
**Agents:** `code-reviewer`, `security-auditor`

- Code review for quality and standards
- Security review for vulnerabilities
- Focus: auth, input validation, data access

**Blocking:** Must pass before proceeding

## Phase 5: Testing
**Agents:** `test-automator`

- Unit tests (80% coverage target)
- Integration tests
- E2E tests for critical paths

## Phase 6: Performance
**Agents:** `performance-engineer`

Validate against thresholds:
- Response time: <200ms
- Memory usage: <100MB
- Bundle size: <500KB

## Phase 7: Documentation
**Agents:** `technical-writer`

- API documentation
- User guide updates
- Changelog entry

## Phase 8: Deployment Prep
**Agents:** `deployment-engineer`

Checklist:
- [ ] Version bump
- [ ] Changelog updated
- [ ] Migration scripts ready
- [ ] Rollback plan documented

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Security scan clean
- [ ] Performance within limits
- [ ] Documentation complete

## Rollback Plan
1. Revert database migrations
2. Restore previous version
3. Notify stakeholders
