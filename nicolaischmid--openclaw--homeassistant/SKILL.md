# Home Assistant (REST) — Quick Use

## Security first
- Prefer a **dedicated Home Assistant user** for this assistant.
- Use a **Long-Lived Access Token** (LLAT) from that user.
- **Never** commit tokens to git; store them in `secrets/` (gitignored).
- If HA is exposed on the public internet, ensure **HTTPS**, strong auth, and ideally IP restrictions / VPN.

## Setup (one-time)
1) Set your HA base URL (you have: `https://ghar.nicolaischmid.de`).
2) Save token to a local secret file:
   - `mkdir -p /root/.openclaw/workspace/secrets`
   - `chmod 700 /root/.openclaw/workspace/secrets`
   - write token to: `/root/.openclaw/workspace/secrets/ha_token`
   - `chmod 600 /root/.openclaw/workspace/secrets/ha_token`

Optional env overrides:
- `HA_URL` (default taken from `secrets/ha_url` if present)
- `HA_TOKEN` (default read from `secrets/ha_token`)

## Inventory / context
- The current device/entity overview lives in:
  - `skills/homeassistant/references/inventory-nice.md` (most useful controls)
  - `skills/homeassistant/references/inventory.md` (broader controllable list)
- Refresh anytime by running:
  - `node scripts/ha-refresh-context.mjs`

## Commands
Wrapper script (JSON by default):

- Ping:
  - `node scripts/ha.mjs ping`

- Get entity state:
  - `node scripts/ha.mjs state light.living_room`

- Call a service:
  - `node scripts/ha.mjs call light turn_on '{"entity_id":"light.living_room","brightness_pct":50}'`

- List entities (compact):
  - `node scripts/ha.mjs list --domain light`

## REST endpoints (reference)
- `GET /api/`
- `GET /api/states/<entity_id>`
- `POST /api/services/<domain>/<service>` with JSON body
