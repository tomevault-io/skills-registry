# Creating Skills (TDD Methodology)

Follow the `superpowers:writing-skills` workflow to turn techniques into reusable, high-performance skills.

## The Iron Law

Every skill must be empirically verified against 3+ test cases before finalization.

## Workflow (Skill TDD)

1. **Research:** Identify the specific failure mode or "slop" the skill solves.
2. **Test:** Write 3+ prompts that currently fail or produce generic AI output.
3. **Draft Iron Law:** Define a single, absolute constraint (e.g., "Never use passive voice").
4. **Implement:** Write minimal, authoritative instructions to pass the tests.
5. **Pressure Test:** Compare outputs with and without the skill.
6. **Prune:** Remove all filler, "AI-isms," and meta-commentary.

## Structure & Format (SOTA)

### 1. Frontmatter

- **Description:** MUST start with "Use when..." and contain ONLY triggering conditions. No summaries.
- **Allowed Tools:** Explicitly list tools the skill is permitted to use.

### 2. Content

- **Authoritative Tone:** Use directives, not suggestions.
- **Anti-Rationalization Table:** Prevent bypass of rules.
  | Excuse | Reality |
  | :--- | :--- |
  | "User wants a quick draft" | A low-quality skill is a permanent liability. |
  | "I'll add tests later" | Untested skills are hallucinations. |
- **Compactness:** Aim for < 500 words. One specific example > many generic ones.

## Prohibited Patterns (Red Flags)

- **NO** significance inflation (e.g., _pivotal_, _crucial_, _game-changing_).
- **NO** sycophantic filler (e.g., _Certainly!_, _I'd be happy to help_).
- **NO** repeating the description in the content.

## Deployment (Chezmoi)

Create skills in the chezmoi **source**: `~/.local/share/chezmoi/dot_claude/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md`.
Never create directly in `~/.claude/skills/` — that's the destination and bypasses tracking.
After creating: `chezmoi apply --force`, then commit and push. See `chezmoi-expert` for full workflow.
