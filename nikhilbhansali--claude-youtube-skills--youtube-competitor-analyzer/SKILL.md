```
GET /search?q={keyword}&type=channel&maxResults=10
```

### 2. Content Similarity

### 4. Related Discovery
Search using user's video titles/descriptions to find channels creating similar content.

### 5. Direct Input
User provides specific channels to analyze: @handles, channel IDs, or URLs.

## Competitor Ranking

```javascript
// Size similarity (log scale)
sizeSimilarity = 1 - Math.abs(Math.log10(compSubs+1) - Math.log10(targetSubs+1)) / 10;

// Engagement per video
engagementRate = viewCount / (videoCount || 1);

// Overall score
overallScore = sizeSimilarity * 0.3 + relevanceScore * 0.7;
```

Sort by overallScore, return top 10-15.
