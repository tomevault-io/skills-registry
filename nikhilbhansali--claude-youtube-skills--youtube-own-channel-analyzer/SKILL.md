# YouTube Own Channel Analyzer

Analyze your YouTube channel's performance using the YouTube Data API v3.

## Setup

1. **API Key**: Get from [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) - enable YouTube Data API v3
2. **Channel ID**: Accept channel ID (UC...), @handle, or full URL

## API Endpoints

```
BASE_URL = https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3

# Channel details
GET /channels?part=snippet,statistics,contentDetails,brandingSettings&id={channelId}&key={API_KEY}

# Channel videos (paginated)
GET /search?part=snippet&channelId={channelId}&order=date&type=video&maxResults=50&key={API_KEY}

# Video details (batch up to 50 IDs)
GET /videos?part=snippet,statistics,contentDetails&id={videoIds}&key={API_KEY}
```

## Analysis Workflow

### 1. Resolve Channel ID
```
@handle → Search API with handle, get channelId from result
/channel/UC... → Extract directly
/c/name or /user/name → Use forUsername parameter
```

### 2. Fetch Data
- Channel: snippet, statistics, contentDetails, brandingSettings
- Videos: Paginate through search results, then batch video details

### 3. Analyze

**Content Types** - Categorize by title/description patterns:
| Type | Pattern |
|------|---------|
| Tutorial | tutorial, how to, guide, learn |
| Review | review, unbox, first look, comparison |
| Vlog | vlog, day in, life, daily |
| Educational | explain, education, lesson |
| Gaming | gameplay, game, gaming, stream |
| Music | music, song, cover, lyrics |

**Duration Buckets**: Short (<5min), Medium (5-15min), Long (15-30min), Very Long (30+min)

**Performance Metrics**:
- View-to-sub ratio: views/subscribers (benchmark: 10-20%)
- Engagement rate: (likes+comments)/views (benchmark: 1-5%)
- Like rate: likes/views (benchmark: 3-7%)
- Comment rate: comments/views (benchmark: 0.5-2%)
- Viral threshold: views > 5x subscribers
- Underperforming: views < 10% subscribers

**Upload Patterns**: Track day-of-week, hour-of-day, consistency (stddev of days between uploads)

**Title Analysis**: Track numbers, emojis, questions, brackets, caps usage, common words

return (parseInt(match[1])||0)*3600 + (parseInt(match[2])||0)*60 + (parseInt(match[3])||0);
```

## Quota Notes
