# Deal Sourcing Agent

Transform CLI-based discovery into a guided, conversational workflow for sourcing consumer companies.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill activates when you want to:
- Find new investment prospects
- Run the discovery pipeline
- Source companies in specific sectors (CPG, health tech, travel, marketplaces)
- Review and push qualified signals to Notion CRM

**Trigger phrases:**
- "Help me find new deals"
- "Run the discovery pipeline"
- "Source companies in [sector]"
- "What new prospects do we have*"
- "Check for new SEC filings"

## Quick Start

**Simplest invocation:**
```
User: "Find me some new deals"
```

The skill will guide you through 6 steps: Configuration → Collection → Processing → Review → Push → Health Check.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Configuration
Ask which collectors to run and which sectors to focus on.

**Collector Presets:**
| Preset | Collectors | Duration | Best For |
|--------|-----------|----------|----------|
| Fast | github, sec_edgar, companies_house | ~2 min | Quick daily scan |
| All | 16 collectors | ~10 min | Comprehensive weekly search |
| Custom | User selects | Varies | Specific signal types |

**Validation Gate:** User confirms configuration before proceeding.

### Step 2: Collection
Execute collectors and report results.

```bash
python run_pipeline.py collect --collectors <preset>
```

**Output:** Signals collected, duplicates found, collector status (✓/✗)

**Decision Point:**
- A) Proceed to processing
- B) Adjust collectors
- C) Cancel

### Step 3: Processing
Run verification gate and thesis filter on collected signals.

```bash
python run_pipeline.py process
```

**Output:**
- Qualified signals (ready for push)
- Held signals (need review)
- Rejected signals (excluded by thesis)

**Decision Point:**
- A) Review qualified signals
- B) Push all qualified to Notion
- C) Review held signals
- D) Show metrics

### Step 4: Review (Optional)
Display top qualified signals with confidence scores.

```bash
python run_pipeline.py pipeline qualified --limit 20
```

**Output:** Table with company name, canonical key, confidence, signal types, why now.

**Decision Point:**
- A) Push all to Notion
- B) Filter further
- C) Exclude specific companies

### Step 5: Push to Notion
Sync qualified signals to Notion CRM.

```bash
# Dry run preview
python run_pipeline.py pipeline push --dry-run

# Actual push (after confirmation)
python run_pipeline.py pipeline push --confirm
```

**Output:**
- Prospects created (Status: "Source" or "Tracking")
- Prospects updated
- Prospects skipped (duplicates)
- Notion URLs

### Step 6: Health Check
Run post-execution diagnostics and recommend next steps.

```bash
python run_pipeline.py health --json
```

**Output:**
- Component health (Database, APIs, cache)
- Anomaly detection results
- Rate limit status
- Recommendations (review held signals, schedule next run)

## Collector Guide

See [references/collector-guide.md](references/collector-guide.md) for complete list of 16 collectors, API requirements, and signal strengths.

**Fast Preset Collectors:**
- **github** - Trending repos, spike detection (0.5-0.7 confidence)
- **sec_edgar** - SEC Form D filings (0.6-0.8 confidence)
- **companies_house** - UK incorporations (0.6-0.8 confidence)

## Error Handling

### Missing API Keys
If a collector fails due to missing credentials:

```
⚠ Missing API Key: GITHUB_TOKEN

Setup:
1. Generate token at: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Add to .env file: GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxx
3. Restart skill

Alternative: Run other collectors without GitHub
```

### Rate Limits
If rate limited:

```
⚠ GitHub Rate Limit Exceeded

Resets at: 2026-01-31 14:30 UTC (in 42 minutes)

Options:
  A) Wait 42 minutes, then retry
  B) Run other collectors
  C) Use authenticated token (increases limit)
```

### Zero Qualified Signals
If no signals pass verification:

```
ℹ No Qualified Signals

Results: 0 qualified, 12 held, 3 rejected

Next Steps:
  A) Review held signals
  B) Adjust thesis filters
  C) Run different collectors
```

For complete troubleshooting guide, see [references/troubleshooting.md](references/troubleshooting.md).

## Notion Schema

The pipeline pushes to Notion with these fields:
- **Status:** "Source" (multi-source, high confidence) or "Tracking" (single source)
- **Discovery ID:** Unique identifier for tracking
- **Canonical Key:** Deduplication key (domain:example.com)
- **Confidence Score:** 0.0-1.0 routing score
- **Signal Types:** Multi-select (github, sec_edgar, etc.)
- **Why Now:** Narrative explaining timing

See [references/notion-schema.md](references/notion-schema.md) for complete schema and routing logic.

## Examples

### Basic Usage
[See examples/basic-usage.md](examples/basic-usage.md)

User: "Find me some new deals"
→ Guided through Fast preset (2 min)
→ 12 qualified signals pushed to Notion

### Sector-Specific
[See examples/sector-specific.md](examples/sector-specific.md)

User: "Source consumer CPG companies"
→ Collectors filtered by CPG keywords
→ Thesis filter emphasizes food/beverage/beauty

### Advanced Options
[See examples/advanced-options.md](examples/advanced-options.md)

- Run single collector
- Dry-run mode for testing
- View detailed metrics
- Import from CSV

## Common Scenarios

| Scenario | Command Flow |
|----------|--------------|
| Daily quick scan | Fast preset → Process → Push |
| Weekly deep dive | All preset → Review held → Push selected |
| Sector focus | Custom collectors → Filter by keywords |
| Debug low signals | Metrics → Health → Adjust collectors |
