# Nano Banana Prompting

Interactive prompt crafting for Nano Banana Pro image generation. This skill guides users through a structured process to create effective prompts by clarifying intent and applying proven techniques.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Reference Materials

Before asking questions, check if the user has provided:

- **Reference images** - Photos to use for character consistency, style, or composition
- **Existing prompts** - Previous attempts to improve upon
- **Visual references** - Screenshots or examples of desired output

If reference materials are available, this affects which techniques apply (e.g., Reference Role Assignment, Character Consistency).

### Step 2: Clarify Intent with Questions

Use the `AskUserQuestion` tool to understand the user's goal. Ask questions in batches of 2-4, focusing on the most important aspects first.

#### Core Questions (always ask)

1. **Output Type** - What kind of image?
   - Photo/realistic
   - Illustration/artistic
   - Infographic/educational
   - Product shot/commercial
   - UI mockup/design

2. **Subject** - Who or what is the main focus?
   - Person (with or without reference)
   - Object/product
   - Scene/environment
   - Concept/abstract

#### Technique-Specific Questions (based on answers)

**If Photo/Realistic:**
- What era or camera style? (modern DSLR, 1990s film, 2000s digital)
- Specific lighting? (golden hour, studio, flash)
- Aspect ratio needed? (16:9, 9:16, 1:1)

**If Reference Images Provided:**
- What role for each image? (pose, style, color palette, background)
- Should character identity be preserved?
- Combine images or use as style reference?

**If Text Needed:**
- What text should appear?
- What font style? (serif, sans-serif, handwritten)
- Where should text be placed?

**If Educational/Infographic:**
- What concept to explain?
- Target audience level?
- Should it include labels, arrows, flow?

### Step 3: Determine Prompt Style

Based on user responses, select the appropriate prompt format from `references/guide.md`:

| User Need | Recommended Style |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Simple, quick generation | Narrative Prompt (Technique 1) |
| Precise control over details | Structured Prompt (Technique 2) |
| Era-specific aesthetic | Vibe Library + Photography Terms (Techniques 3-4) |
| Magazine/poster with text | Physical Object Framing (Technique 5) |
| Conceptual/interpretive | Perspective Framing (Technique 6) |
| Diagram/infographic | Educational Imagery (Technique 7) |
| Editing existing image | Image Transformation (Technique 8) |
| Multiple views/panels | Multi-Panel Output (Technique 9) |
| Multiple reference images | Reference Role Assignment (Technique 12) |

### Step 4: Generate the Prompt

Construct the prompt by:

1. **Loading `references/guide.md`** to access technique details
2. **Applying relevant techniques** based on Step 3 selection
3. **Cross-checking** against guide examples for proper formatting
4. **Including negative prompts** if needed (Technique 10)
5. **Specifying aspect ratio/resolution** if required (Technique 11)

#### Prompt Construction Checklist

- [ ] Subject clearly defined
- [ ] Action/pose specified (if applicable)
- [ ] Location/background described
- [ ] Style/aesthetic anchored
- [ ] Technical specs included (aspect ratio, lighting, camera)
- [ ] Text integration specified (if needed)
- [ ] Negative prompts added (if needed)
- [ ] Reference image roles assigned (if using references)

### Step 5: Present and Iterate

Present the generated prompt to the user with:

1. **The prompt** - Ready to use
2. **Technique explanation** - Why this structure was chosen
3. **Variation suggestions** - Alternative approaches to try

Offer to refine based on feedback.

### Step 6: Generate the Image

After the user is satisfied with the prompt, recommend using the **nano-banana** skill to generate the actual image. Inform the user:

> "Your prompt is ready! Would you like me to generate the image now? I can use the nano-banana skill to create it."

If the user agrees, invoke the `nano-banana` skill with the crafted prompt.
