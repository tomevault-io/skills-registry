# Quality Gates

Run code quality checks for the lazyopencode project. This skill executes the same checks used in pre-commit hooks plus tests.

## Quality Checks

The following checks are run in order:

| Check | Command | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **Ruff Lint** | `uv run ruff check src tests --fix` | Lint code and auto-fix issues |
| **Ruff Format** | `uv run ruff format src tests` | Format code consistently |
| **Mypy** | `uv run mypy src` | Static type checking |
| **Pytest** | `uv run pytest tests/ -q` | Run test suite |

## Usage

To run all quality gates:

```bash
scripts/check_quality.sh
```

Or run individual checks as needed using the commands above.

## Workflow

1. Run the `scripts/check_quality.sh` script from the project root
2. Review any failures and fix issues
3. Re-run until all checks pass
4. Present user with concise summary of results in markdown table format

## Common Issues

- **Ruff lint failures**: Usually auto-fixed. If not, check the error message for manual fixes needed.
- **Mypy errors**: Type annotation issues. Add or fix type hints as indicated.
- **Test failures**: Review test output, fix failing tests or underlying code.
