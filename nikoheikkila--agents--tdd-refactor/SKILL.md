# TDD Refactor Phase - Improve Code Quality and Design

## Quality Gates

- **Definition of Done adherence** - Ensure all tests are passing by running all tests before starting any activity.
- **Code smells** - Identify and eliminate code smells such as duplicated code, long methods, large classes, and complex conditionals.
- **Security requirements** - Address any security considerations.
- **Performance criteria** - Meet any performance requirements.

## Core Principles

### Code Quality Improvements

- **Remove duplication** - Extract common code into reusable classes and methods. Follow the "Rule of Three" meaning knowledge should be abstracted only after it has been used in three places.
- **Improve readability** - Use intention-revealing names and clear structure aligned with the domain.
- **Apply SOLID principles**
  - **Single Responsibility Principle** - Ensure each class and method has one and only one reason to change.
  - **Open/Closed Principle** - Make code open for extension but closed for modification.
  - **Liskov Substitution Principle** - Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
  - **Interface Segregation Principle** - Use specific abstract classes rather than general ones.
  - **Dependency Inversion Principle** - Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations.
- **Simplify complexity** - Break down large methods, reduce cognitive and cyclomatic complexities.

### Design Excellence

- **Class length** - Keep the length of classes under 100 lines.
- **Method length** - Keep the length of methods under 10 lines.
- **Composition over inheritance** - Prefer writing small focused classes and compose behaviour from them.
- **Dependency injection** - Use dependency injection through class constructor arguments.
- **Modularization** - Organize code into coherent modules and packages.
- **Pydantic models** - Leverage Pydantic for configuration objects, data, and domain models.

### Test Quality

- **Fast tests** - Ensure tests remain fast and isolated.
- **Coverage maintenance** - Test coverage must not decrease during refactoring.

### Safe Refactoring Patterns

Use battle-tested refactoring techniques:

- **Extract Constant** - Move magic numbers and strings to named constants.
- **Extract Method** - Break down long methods into smaller ones.
- **Extract Class** - Split large classes with multiple responsibilities.
- **Rename** - Use intention-revealing names for variables, methods, and classes.
- **Inline Variable/Method** - Simplify code by removing unnecessary indirection.
- **Move Method/Field** - Relocate code to more appropriate locations.
- **Replace Conditional with Polymorphism** - Use objects instead of complex conditionals.

### Documentation

- **Update documentation** - Revise inline comments and docstrings to match refactored code. Ensure the documentation always answers to question WHY instead of WHAT.
- **Record decisions** - Document non-obvious design decisions made during refactoring.

### Performance & Quality Validation

- **Avoid premature optimization** - Only optimize when there are actual performance issues.
- **Remove dead code** - Eliminate unused imports, variables, and unreachable code.
- **Run static analysis** - Use linters and type checkers to catch issues early.

## Execution Guidelines

1. **Ensure green tests** - All tests must pass before refactoring can start. Verify this by running all tests.
2. **Small incremental changes** - Refactor in tiny, atomic steps.
3. **Apply one improvement at a time** - Focus on a single refactoring technique.
4. **No test code modifications** - Do NOT modify any test code during refactoring.
5. **Continuous testing** - Run tests after EACH and EVERY change.
6. **Coverage preservation** - Ensure test coverage doesn't decrease during refactoring.
7. **Static analysis** - Run linters and static analysis tools after changes.
8. **API stability** - Validate that publicly exposed APIs and contracts remain unchanged.
9. **Rollback readiness** - Revert to a previous working state when tests become unstable or complexity increases to the point you cannot reason about the changes.

## Refactor Phase Checklist

### Before Starting

- [ ] All tests pass before starting.
- [ ] Current test coverage recorded.

### During Refactoring

- [ ] Linters and static analysis tools run successfully.
- [ ] Tests pass after every change.
- [ ] Specific refactoring technique documented.
- [ ] No modifications made to test code.

### After Refactoring

- [ ] Code readability and design improved.
- [ ] All tests remain green.
- [ ] Test coverage is maintained or improved.
- [ ] Public APIs and contracts unchanged.
- [ ] Unused code removed (imports, variables, dead code).
- [ ] Documentation updated (comments, docstrings).
- [ ] Performance improved where applicable.

### Technical Debt

- [ ] Remaining refactoring opportunities documented and suggested to the user.
- [ ] Non-obvious design decisions recorded.
- [ ] Breaking changes or impacts flagged.
