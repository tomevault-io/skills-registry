description: Coding standards, modular architecture, and common execution patterns for the PolyFlup Python backend.

## Python Coding Standards

### Modular Architecture
The backend is modularized into packages:
- `src.trading.orders`: Order management (limit, market, batch, positions).
- `src.data.market_data`: Data fetching (polymarket, binance, indicators, price validation).
- `src.trading`: Centralized execution logic (`execution.py`, `logic.py`, `strategy.py`).
- `src.trading.position_manager`: Position lifecycle management (entry, exit, scale-in, stop-loss, reconciliation).

### Standard Trade Execution
```python
from src.trading import execute_trade
# Execute a trade with full tracking and notifications
trade_id = execute_trade(trade_params, is_reversal=False)
```

### Imports
- Use absolute imports from `src.*`
- Group imports: standard library → third-party → local
- Always import from `src.config.settings` for configuration constants

### Formatting
- **Indentation**: 4 spaces
- **Line length**: ~90 characters
- **Strings**: Double quotes preferred
- **Docstrings**: Triple double-quotes with brief description

### Error Handling & Logging
- Use `log_error(text, include_traceback=True)` from `src.utils.logger` for all exceptions.
- Always log errors with context: `log(f"[{symbol}] Order failed: {e}")`.
- Graceful degradation: return neutral/safe values on error.
- Use emojis in logs (👀 Monitoring, 🚀 Execution, ✅ Success, ❌ Error).

### Thread Safety & Synchronization (v0.4.2+)
- Use threading locks for shared resources: `with position_lock: ...`
- Always confirm order fills before cancellation to prevent race conditions
- Implement reconciliation systems for order tracking consistency
- Use `recent_fills` tracking to prevent duplicate processing
- Add synchronization locks for all critical trading operations

### Confidence Algorithm Standards (v0.4.2+)
- Cap confidence at 85% maximum to prevent overconfidence
- Validate price movements before high-confidence trades (>75%)
- Implement multi-confirmation systems for extreme confidence levels
- Use directional voting with weighted signal aggregation
- Test confidence ranges (0-100%) and bias validation thoroughly

### Bayesian Confidence Calculation (v0.5.0+)
- **Dual Calculation System**: Both additive and Bayesian methods are calculated simultaneously for A/B testing
- **Configuration Flag**: `BAYESIAN_CONFIDENCE` in `src/config/settings.py` toggles between methods (default: NO)
- **Bayesian Formula**:
  ```python
  # Start with market prior from Polymarket orderbook
  prior_odds = p_up / (1 - p_up)
  log_odds = ln(prior_odds)

  # Accumulate evidence from all signals
  for each signal:
      evidence = (score - 0.5) * 2  # -1 to +1
      log_LR = evidence * 3.0 * quality  # Calibration with quality
      log_odds += log_LR × weight

  # Convert to probability
  confidence = 1 / (1 + exp(-log_odds))
  ```
- **Quality Factors** (0.7-1.5x): Applied to log-likelihood strength for each signal
- **Market Prior**: Anchors calculation to Polymarket orderbook probability
- **A/B Testing**: Both methods stored in `raw_scores` dictionary and database for comparison
- **Database Schema**: Migration 007 adds `additive_confidence`, `additive_bias`, `bayesian_confidence`, `bayesian_bias`, `market_prior_p_up` columns

### Audit Trail Requirements (v0.4.2+)
- Log all scale-in order lifecycle events with consistent formatting
- Use standardized emojis: 🎯 (placement), ✅ (filled), 🧹 (cancellation), ⚠️ (race condition)
- Include order IDs, sizes, prices, and timestamps in all audit logs
- Maintain separate audit trails for notifications, reconciliation, and position management
- Log notification processing with order ID extraction details

### Database Safety Standards
- Always use `db_connection()` context manager
- Pass active cursors to write functions within transactions
- Implement migration system for schema changes
- Use `schema_version` table to track database versions
- Prevent deadlocks with proper cursor management

### Configuration Management
- Centralize all settings in `src.config.settings`
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Implement validation for critical thresholds (MIN_EDGE, confidence caps)
- Document all configuration options in `.env.example`
- Add price validation settings for high-confidence trades

### Testing Standards
- Create comprehensive test suites for algorithm validation
- Test confidence ranges (0-100%), bias validation, and safety features
- Implement integration tests for multi-confirmation systems
- Validate price movement detection and manipulation prevention
- Test race condition prevention and synchronization

### Performance Optimization
- Use efficient API calls with proper caching
- Implement batch processing for multiple orders
- Monitor execution times and optimize critical paths
- Use WebSocket connections for real-time data where possible
- Optimize notification processing with efficient order ID extraction

### Documentation Standards
- Update README.md with latest features and improvements
- Maintain detailed strategy documentation in docs/STRATEGY.md
- Document all risk profiles in docs/RISK_PROFILES.md
- Keep migration guide updated in docs/MIGRATIONS.md
- Document new position flow in docs/POSITION_FLOW.md

### Code Quality Standards
- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Implement proper error handling with specific exception types
- Write comprehensive docstrings for all public functions
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines with project-specific adaptations
- Implement comprehensive audit trail logging

### Security Standards
- Never commit private keys or sensitive credentials
- Use secure methods for API key storage and access
- Implement proper input validation for all external data
- Use parameterized queries for database operations
- Secure notification processing with robust parsing

### Deployment Standards
- Use Docker for consistent deployment environments
- Implement proper logging aggregation for production
- Monitor system health and performance metrics
- Use proper process management and restart policies
- Deploy with comprehensive monitoring and alerting

### Monitoring & Alerting
- Implement comprehensive audit trail logging
- Monitor for race conditions and synchronization issues
- Track order fill rates and reconciliation success
- Alert on unusual patterns or system errors
- Monitor confidence algorithm performance and validation
- Track notification processing success rates

### Version Control Standards
- Use semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Create detailed release notes for each version
- Tag releases with comprehensive change descriptions
- Maintain backward compatibility where possible
- Document all improvements in release tags

### Balance Validation & Position Sync (v0.4.4+)
- **Enhanced Balance Validation**: Symbol-specific tolerance for API reliability issues (XRP, etc.)
  - Default: 0.8 reliability weight, 0.2 position trust factor, 5-minute grace period
  - XRP: 0.3 reliability weight (lower trust), 0.3 position trust, 15-minute grace period
- **Real-Time Exit Order Validation**: 1-second cycle size validation to catch mismatches immediately
- **Rounding Threshold**: Use 0.05 share threshold for exit order repair to prevent infinite loops
- **Bi-Directional Healing**: Sync database size with actual wallet balance when discrepancies detected
  - Sync if balance > DB size + 0.0001 (immediate, no cooldown)
  - Sync if age > 60s AND scale-in age > 60s AND |balance - size| > 0.0001
- **Grace Period Logic**: 
  - 60-second grace period after buy/scale-in before balance validation
  - 10-minute grace period for zero balance before ghost trade settlement (increased from 5m)
- **API Retry Strategy**: Exponential backoff with symbol-specific retry counts
  - Default: 2 retries with 1.0s delay
  - XRP: 3 retries with 2.0s delay
  - Crypto markets: +1 extra retry with 1.5x delay multiplier
- **Geographic Restrictions**: Detect and skip retries for geo-blocked APIs
- **Database as Source of Truth**: For exit orders, always trust database position size over balance API

### Position Monitoring & Reporting (v0.4.3+)
- **Clean Position Reports**: Aligned format with directional emojis (📈 UP winning, 📉 DOWN winning)
- **Status Indicators**: Visual indicators for exit plan status (⏰ active, ⏳ pending, ⏭️ skipped)
- **Trade ID Display**: Show trade ID for all positions in monitoring output
- **Spam Reduction**: Removed debug logging spam for cleaner production logs
- **Min Size Handling**: Silent skip for positions below MIN_SIZE (5.0 shares) with status display

### Notification Processing (v0.4.3+)
- **Multi-Field Order ID Extraction**: Robust parsing with fallback to multiple field names
- **Concise Logging**: Streamlined notification processing logs with symbol and price info
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient handling of multiple notifications at once
