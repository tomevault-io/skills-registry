Perform a comprehensive read-only review of code changes.

**Scope:** By default, review the current git branch changes using the command below. However, if the user specifies a different scope (e.g., specific files, a directory, a PR, or a commit range), respect that and adjust your review accordingly.

**CRITICAL: This is a READ-ONLY review. Do NOT:**
- Make any code changes
- Create or modify files
- Run git commands (commit, push, merge, etc.)
- Only exception: You may run git commands to READ information (diff, log, status, show)

**Steps:**

1. **Gather changes** - For default branch review, run this command:
```bash
MAIN_WORKTREE=$(git worktree list | head -1 | awk '{print $1}'); CURRENT_DIR=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel); if [ "$MAIN_WORKTREE" != "$CURRENT_DIR" ]; then BASE=$(git -C "$MAIN_WORKTREE" branch --show-current); else BASE="main"; fi; echo "=== Base branch: $BASE ===" && echo "" && echo "=== STATUS ===" && git status && echo "" && echo "=== COMMIT LOG ===" && git log $BASE..HEAD --oneline && echo "" && echo "=== COMMITTED CHANGES ===" && git diff $BASE...HEAD && echo "" && echo "=== UNCOMMITTED CHANGES ===" && git diff HEAD
```
  - If in a worktree, this uses the repo root's current branch as the base (not main)
  - If not in a worktree, uses `main` as the base branch (unless the user specifies otherwise)
  - **IMPORTANT**: This includes BOTH committed changes (vs base branch) AND uncommitted/unstaged changes

2. **Parallel Analysis** - After gathering the diff, launch sub-agents IN PARALLEL using the Task tool to analyze each area concurrently:
  - Sub-agent 1: Security Issues analysis
  - Sub-agent 2: Performance Concerns analysis
  - Sub-agent 3: Cross-Platform Compatibility analysis
  - Sub-agent 4: Type Safety and DRY Violations analysis
  - Sub-agent 5: Potential Bugs and Cleanup analysis
  - Sub-agent 6: Analytics Events and CLAUDE.md Documentation analysis
  - Sub-agent 7: Jotai Patterns Compliance analysis (see docs/JOTAI.md for patterns)

   Each sub-agent should receive the diff content and return findings for its specific area. Wait for all sub-agents to complete, then synthesize their findings into the final report.

**Analysis Required:**

Provide your review in the following format:

## Branch Summary
[Brief 2-3 sentence description of what this branch does]

## Detailed Findings

### Database Changes
[List any schema changes, migrations, new tables/columns, or note "None"]

### Security Issues
[List potential security vulnerabilities:]
- XSS vulnerabilities
- SQL injection risks
- Exposed secrets/API keys
- Authentication/authorization gaps
- Unsafe deserialization
- Missing input validation
[Note "None found" if clean]

### Performance Concerns
[List potential performance issues:]
- N+1 queries
- Inefficient loops or algorithms
- Memory leaks
- Missing database indexes
- Large payload sizes
- Unnecessary re-renders
[Note "None found" if clean]

### Cross-Platform Compatibility (OSX/Windows/Linux)
[Check for platform-specific issues that could break functionality on different operating systems:]
- **File paths**: Hardcoded separators (/ vs \) instead of path.join() or path.resolve()
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: Hardcoded 'Meta' or 'Cmd' instead of platform-aware shortcuts (should use 'CmdOrCtrl' or detect platform)
- **Environment variables**: Platform-specific env vars (e.g., HOME vs USERPROFILE)
- **System commands**: Bash/shell commands that don't work on Windows (should use cross-platform alternatives)
- **File system case sensitivity**: Code assuming case-insensitive file systems (macOS/Windows) that will break on Linux
- **Line endings**: Missing .gitattributes or code that assumes LF vs CRLF
- **Native dependencies**: Binaries or node modules that need platform-specific builds
- **Process handling**: Platform-specific process spawning or signal handling
- **File permissions**: Unix-style chmod/permissions that don't translate to Windows
- **Path length limits**: Windows MAX_PATH (260 char) limitations not accounted for
[Note "Fully compatible" or "Not applicable" if clean]

### Dependencies
[Check package.json, package-lock.json for changes:]
- New packages added: [name@version - purpose]
- Version updates: [name: old → new]
- Removed packages: [name]
[Note "No changes" if none]

### Logging Assessment
[Evaluate if logging is appropriate, too verbose, or missing. Note any console.log that should be removed]

### Type Safety Issues
[List any `any` types, missing type definitions, or type assertions that should be reviewed]

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) Violations
[Identify duplicated code that should be extracted into shared utilities, functions, or components:]
- Repeated logic blocks across files
- Copy-pasted code with minor variations
- Similar patterns that could be abstracted
- Missed opportunities to use existing utilities
[Note "None found" if clean]

### Potential Bugs
[List specific scenarios that should be tested, edge cases not handled, null checks missing, etc.]
- Bug 1: [description]
- Bug 2: [description]

### Cleanup Needed
[List commented code, debug statements, unused imports, TODOs, etc.]
- Item 1: [description + file:line]
- Item 2: [description + file:line]

### Other Concerns
[Any additional issues not covered above:]
- Breaking changes to APIs or interfaces
- Missing error handling
- Accessibility issues
- Missing documentation
- Test coverage gaps

### Analytics Events
[Evaluate whether PostHog analytics events should be added for this feature/change. See docs/ANALYTICS_GUIDE.md for implementation details.]

Consider adding analytics for:
- New user-facing features (track adoption/usage)
- New UI interactions (buttons, dialogs, workflows)
- Feature settings or preferences changes
- Error scenarios that would help diagnose issues
- Performance-sensitive operations (with timing categories)

Do NOT add analytics for:
- Internal refactors with no user-visible changes
- Bug fixes (unless tracking the bug occurrence is valuable)
- Test-only changes
- Documentation changes

If analytics should be added, suggest specific events following the naming conventions:
- Use snake_case: `feature_used`, `dialog_opened`
- Use noun_verb pattern: `file_opened`, `session_created`
- Group with prefixes: `ai_*`, `file_*`, `window_*`, `project_*`

[Note "Not needed for this change" if analytics are not applicable, or list suggested events]

### Jotai Patterns Compliance
[Evaluate whether Jotai atom usage follows the patterns documented in docs/JOTAI.md:]

**Check for these issues:**
- **Independent atoms for session state**: Session-related atoms (mode, model, title, etc.) MUST be derived atoms that read from `sessionStoreAtom`, not independent atoms with their own storage
- **Async atoms causing Suspense**: Derived atoms that combine other atoms MUST be synchronous - no `async` keyword or `await import()` inside atom definitions
- **Dynamic imports in atoms**: NEVER use dynamic imports inside atoms - use static imports at the top of the file
- **Component-level IPC subscriptions**: Components should read from atoms, NOT subscribe to IPC events directly (see Centralized IPC Listener Architecture)
- **Lifting state up anti-pattern**: Editor content should NOT be stored in parent components - editors own their state
- **Missing atom families**: Per-session or per-entity state should use atomFamily, not plain atoms with maps/objects

**Good patterns to verify:**
- Atom families for session-keyed state
- Derived read-write atoms for session metadata
- Centralized IPC listeners updating atoms
- Synchronous derived atoms for combining state

[Note "No Jotai changes" if no atom code was modified, "Patterns followed correctly" if compliant, or list specific violations]

### CLAUDE.md Documentation
[Evaluate whether CLAUDE.md should be updated to document new patterns, conventions, or workflows introduced by this change.]

**SHOULD update CLAUDE.md when the change introduces:**
- New architectural patterns or conventions that future development should follow
- New commands, scripts, or workflows (npm scripts, build commands, etc.)
- New environment variables or configuration options
- Changes to important file locations or directory structure
- New IPC channels or API patterns
- New CSS variables or theming conventions
- New database tables, columns, or data patterns
- New error handling patterns or conventions
- Platform-specific behavior or requirements
- New testing patterns or approaches
- Security considerations that affect development
- External tool or dependency setup requirements

**Should NOT update CLAUDE.md for:**
- Bug fixes that don't change patterns or conventions
- Internal refactors with no workflow impact
- New components/features that follow existing documented patterns
- Minor UI tweaks or styling changes
- Test additions following existing test patterns
- Dependency version bumps (unless they change workflows)
- Code cleanup or dead code removal
- Changes already covered by existing documentation

[Note "Not needed for this change" if no documentation updates are required, or specify which sections of CLAUDE.md should be updated and what content should be added]

## Suggested Commit Message
[Provide a well-formatted commit message for the entire branch following the project's commit style, but DO NOT create the commit]

## File-by-File Analysis

**Note:** Include ALL files with changes - both committed and uncommitted/unstaged changes.

| --- | --- |
| path/to/file1.ts | [Explain what changed and why - focus on WHAT and WHY, not line-by-line details] |
| path/to/file2.ts | [Explain what changed and why - focus on WHAT and WHY, not line-by-line details] |
| path/to/file3.tsx | [Explain what changed and why - focus on WHAT and WHY, not line-by-line details] |
