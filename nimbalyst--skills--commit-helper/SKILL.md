description: Impact-focused git commit messages. Use when the user wants to commit changes with a well-crafted message. Use when this capability is needed.

Prepare a git commit following these steps:

1. Run `git status` and `git diff` to see changes
2. Review recent commits (`git log --oneline -5`) to match the style
3. Draft a concise commit message:
  - Start with type prefix: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `chore:`
  - **Focus on IMPACT and WHY, not implementation details**
  - The title should describe the user-visible outcome or bug fixed
  - Use bullet points (dash prefix) only if there are multiple distinct changes
  - Keep each line under 72 characters
  - No emojis
4. Run the `developer_git_commit_proposal` tool to propose the commit to the user
  - Do NOT run `git add` - the widget handles staging when the user confirms

**Commit Message Guidelines:**
- Lead with the problem solved or capability added, not the technique used
- BAD: "feat: add pre-edit tagging for non-agentic AI providers"
- GOOD: "fix: OpenAI/LMStudio diffs now persist across app restarts"
- BAD: "refactor: extract helper function for validation"
- GOOD: "fix: prevent crash when user input is empty"
- The body can explain HOW if it's non-obvious, but title = IMPACT

**Issue Linking (for auto-close):**
- If fixing a Linear issue, include `Fixes NIM-XXX` on its own line after the title
- For GitHub issues, use `Fixes #XXX` or `Closes #XXX`

**Important:**
- Do NOT add "Co-Authored-By" or any attribution lines
- Do NOT add marketing taglines or links
- Be direct and factual
- Keep it brief - avoid unnecessary details about what wasn't changed
