# Documentation Auditor

Systematically audit documentation against the actual codebase to determine accuracy, staleness, and relevance.

## When to Use This Skill

Invoke this skill when:
- Auditing documentation for accuracy
- Cleaning up stale docs after refactoring
- Validating that docs match implementation
- Building a documentation health report

## Methodology

### Phase 1: Document Classification

For each document, determine its **type**:

| Type | Description | Validation Approach |
|------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Architecture** | System design, module structure | Cross-reference with actual directory structure and imports |
| **API Reference** | Endpoints, schemas, contracts | Check against route files and schema definitions |
| **Implementation Guide** | How to do X | Verify code patterns still exist |
| **Feature Spec** | What a feature does | Check if feature exists and behaves as described |
| **Migration/Plan** | One-time work | Check if work is complete (then archive or delete) |
| **Concept/Philosophy** | Design principles | Usually still valid unless product direction changed |

### Phase 2: Extract Verifiable Claims

Read the document and extract **verifiable claims**:

```
CLAIM: "Files are organized in src/services/"
VERIFICATION: Check if path exists
RESULT: TRUE/FALSE

CLAIM: "Use AuthService for authentication"
VERIFICATION: Check if class exists and is used
RESULT: TRUE/FALSE

CLAIM: "Data isolation is enforced via tenant_id"
VERIFICATION: Check entity definitions and access patterns
RESULT: TRUE/FALSE
```

### Phase 3: Code Cross-Reference

For each claim, determine what code to check:

| Claim Type | What to Check |
|------------|---------------|
| Directory structure | `ls`, `find` commands |
| Class/function exists | `Grep` for definition |
| Import patterns | `Grep` for import statements |
| API endpoints | Check route files |
| Database schema | Check entity/model files |
| Configuration | Check config files |

### Phase 4: Accuracy Assessment

Rate each document:

| Rating | Meaning | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **ACCURATE** | All claims verified | Keep as-is |
| **MOSTLY_ACCURATE** | Minor discrepancies | Update specific sections |
| **OUTDATED** | Major claims false | Rewrite or delete |
| **OBSOLETE** | Describes removed features | Delete or archive |
| **ASPIRATIONAL** | Describes future state | Keep but label as "Target" |

## Output Format

For each document audited, produce:

```markdown
## [Document Name]

**Path:** `docs/path/to/file.md`
**Type:** Architecture | API | Guide | Spec | Migration | Concept
**Rating:** ACCURATE | MOSTLY_ACCURATE | OUTDATED | OBSOLETE | ASPIRATIONAL

### Verifiable Claims

| Claim | Verification | Result |
|-------|--------------|--------|
| [claim 1] | [how checked] | TRUE/FALSE |
| [claim 2] | [how checked] | TRUE/FALSE |

### Accuracy Score
X/Y claims verified (Z%)

### Recommendation
- **Action:** KEEP | UPDATE | DELETE | ARCHIVE | MARK_AS_TARGET
- **Reason:** [1-2 sentences]
- **If UPDATE, changes needed:**
  - [ ] Change X to Y
  - [ ] Remove section Z
  - [ ] Add missing info about W
```

## Staleness Signals

Watch for these indicators of stale docs:

### High-Confidence Staleness
- References deleted files/directories
- References renamed classes/functions
- Describes deprecated features
- Migration plan for completed work

### Medium-Confidence Staleness
- Old dates (>6 months) with no updates
- References "TODO" or "Phase 2" without completion
- Diagrams that don't match code structure

### Low-Confidence Staleness
- Generic descriptions that might still apply
- Conceptual content without specific code references

## Audit Workflow

### Single Document Audit

```
1. Read the document fully
2. Classify by type
3. Extract 5-10 verifiable claims
4. For each claim:
   a. Determine verification method
   b. Execute verification (read code, check paths)
   c. Record result
5. Calculate accuracy score
6. Determine rating and recommendation
7. Output structured report
```

### Batch Audit (Directory)

```
1. List all documents in directory
2. Quick-scan each (first 50 lines)
3. Prioritize by likely staleness (dates, keywords)
4. Full audit highest-priority first
5. Group results by recommendation
6. Produce summary report
```

## Common Directories to Cross-Reference

Adapt these to the project structure:

```
src/                    # Source code root
src/services/           # Service implementations
src/routes/ or src/api/ # API endpoints
src/models/ or src/db/  # Database schema
src/config/             # Configuration
tests/                  # Test files
```

## Example Audit

### Input Document: `docs/AUTHENTICATION.md`

**Quick Scan:**
- Title mentions "Authentication System"
- References JWT tokens and session management
- Last updated 8 months ago

**Verifiable Claims:**
1. "AuthService class handles all authentication" -> Grep for AuthService
2. "Sessions stored in Redis" -> Check config and imports
3. "JWT tokens expire after 24 hours" -> Check token configuration

**Results:**
1. TRUE - AuthService exists at src/services/auth.ts
2. FALSE - Sessions now stored in database, Redis removed
3. TRUE - Token expiry configured as 24h

**Rating:** MOSTLY_ACCURATE (2/3 claims valid)
**Action:** UPDATE
**Changes needed:**
- [ ] Update session storage section (Redis -> Database)
- [ ] Add note about migration date

## Self-Improvement

After each audit session, identify:
1. **New staleness signals** discovered
2. **False positives** (docs flagged stale but actually valid)
3. **Missed staleness** (docs marked valid but actually stale)

Use these patterns to improve future audits.
