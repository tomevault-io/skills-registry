# Zoho CRM Integration

## Critical: Tasks Are a Separate Module

Zoho CRM has **separate modules** for different record types:

| Module | Purpose | Key Fields |
|--------|---------|------------|
| Leads | Unqualified prospects | Lead_Status, Email, Phone |
| Contacts | Qualified individuals | Account_Name, Email, Phone |
| Deals | Sales opportunities | Stage, Amount, Closing_Date |
| Accounts | Companies/organizations | Account_Name, Industry |
| **Tasks** | Action items with due dates | Subject, Due_Date, Status, Priority |

**Tasks are NOT fields on Leads.** They are standalone records that can be associated with Leads, Contacts, Deals, or Accounts via the `What_Id` field.

## Quick Start: Finding Overdue Tasks

When user asks about "overdue" items, they almost always mean **Tasks**:

```
User: "What are the overdue tasks?" or "What leads are overdue?"

Step 1: ZOHOCRM_SEARCH_RECORDS(module="Tasks", criteria="(Due_Date:less_than:TODAY)")
```

Done. One call to the Tasks module with a date filter.

## Situational Handling

### Situation: User asks about "overdue" anything

Trigger phrases: "overdue tasks", "overdue leads", "what's past due", "follow-ups due", "what do I need to do"

**Required action:** Query the Tasks module, NOT Leads.

```
ZOHOCRM_SEARCH_RECORDS(
  module="Tasks",
  criteria="(Due_Date:less_than:TODAY)"
)
```

Optional filters:
- By status: `(Due_Date:less_than:TODAY)and(Status:equals:Not Started)`
- By priority: `(Due_Date:less_than:TODAY)and(Priority:equals:Highest)`

### Situation: User asks about leads/contacts/deals

Trigger phrases: "show me leads", "list contacts", "what deals are closing"

**Required action:** Query the appropriate module directly.

```
# List leads
ZOHOCRM_SEARCH_RECORDS(module="Leads")

# Leads by status
ZOHOCRM_SEARCH_RECORDS(module="Leads", criteria="(Lead_Status:equals:Contacted)")

# Deals closing this month
ZOHOCRM_SEARCH_RECORDS(module="Deals", criteria="(Closing_Date:between:2026-02-01,2026-02-28)")
```

### Situation: User asks to create a task

**Required action:** Use the Tasks module with required fields.

```
ZOHOCRM_CREATE_RECORD(
  module="Tasks",
  data={
    "Subject": "Follow up with lead",
    "Due_Date": "2026-02-10",
    "Status": "Not Started",
    "Priority": "High"
  }
)
```

To associate with a Lead/Contact/Deal, include `What_Id`:
```
data={
  "Subject": "Follow up",
  "Due_Date": "2026-02-10",
  "What_Id": "7170963000000598816"  # Lead/Contact/Deal ID
}
```

### Situation: User asks about a specific lead's tasks

**Required action:** Search Tasks filtered by the associated record.

```
Step 1: Find the Lead ID (if not known)
ZOHOCRM_SEARCH_RECORDS(module="Leads", criteria="(Full_Name:contains:John)")

Step 2: Search Tasks associated with that Lead
ZOHOCRM_SEARCH_RECORDS(module="Tasks", criteria="(What_Id:equals:<lead_id>)")
```

### Situation: User asks to update a task

**Required action:** Get task ID first, then update.

```
Step 1: ZOHOCRM_SEARCH_RECORDS(module="Tasks", criteria="(Subject:contains:follow up)")
Step 2: ZOHOCRM_UPDATE_RECORD(module="Tasks", id=<task_id>, data={"Status": "Completed"})
```

## Module Field Reference

### Tasks Module

| Field | Type | Values |
|-------|------|--------|
| Subject | String | Task title |
| Due_Date | Date | YYYY-MM-DD format |
| Status | Picklist | Not Started, Deferred, In Progress, Completed, Waiting for input |
| Priority | Picklist | Highest, High, Normal, Low, Lowest |
| What_Id | Lookup | Associated record ID (Lead, Contact, Deal) |
| Owner | Lookup | Assigned user |

### Leads Module

| Field | Type | Values |
|-------|------|--------|
| First_Name | String | |
| Last_Name | String | |
| Full_Name | String | Auto-generated |
| Email | Email | |
| Lead_Status | Picklist | Not Contacted, Contacted, Working, Qualified, etc. |
| Lead_Source | Picklist | Advertisement, Web, Referral, etc. |

## Criteria Syntax

Zoho uses COQL-style criteria:

```
(Field_Name:operator:value)
(Field1:equals:value1)and(Field2:contains:value2)
(Field1:equals:value1)or(Field2:equals:value2)
```

| Operator | Usage | Example |
|----------|-------|---------|
| equals | Exact match | `(Status:equals:Completed)` |
| contains | Partial match | `(Subject:contains:follow)` |
| starts_with | Prefix match | `(Full_Name:starts_with:John)` |
| less_than | Date/number comparison | `(Due_Date:less_than:2026-02-01)` |
| greater_than | Date/number comparison | `(Amount:greater_than:10000)` |
| between | Range | `(Due_Date:between:2026-02-01,2026-02-28)` |

**Special value:** `TODAY` - use for current date comparisons.

## Error Recovery

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| "Module not found" | Wrong module name | Use exact names: Leads, Contacts, Deals, Accounts, Tasks |
| "Invalid criteria" | Malformed COQL | Check parentheses and operator syntax |
| "Field not found" | Wrong field name | Use API names (Full_Name, not "Full Name") |
| "No records found" | Query too restrictive | Broaden criteria, check spelling |

## Anti-Patterns

| Wrong | Right |
|-------|-------|
| Search Leads for "overdue" items | Search Tasks module with Due_Date filter |
| Look for "Next_Action" field on Leads | Tasks are a separate module, not a field |
| Ask user for field names | Check available fields via ZOHOCRM_GET_FIELDS |
| Assume Tasks are part of Leads | Tasks are standalone records linked via What_Id |
| Use date strings like "today" | Use literal dates (2026-02-05) or TODAY keyword |

## Common Queries

```
# All overdue tasks
ZOHOCRM_SEARCH_RECORDS(module="Tasks", criteria="(Due_Date:less_than:TODAY)")

# Overdue tasks not completed
ZOHOCRM_SEARCH_RECORDS(module="Tasks", criteria="(Due_Date:less_than:TODAY)and(Status:not_equal:Completed)")

# High priority tasks
ZOHOCRM_SEARCH_RECORDS(module="Tasks", criteria="(Priority:equals:High)")

# Tasks due this week
ZOHOCRM_SEARCH_RECORDS(module="Tasks", criteria="(Due_Date:between:2026-02-03,2026-02-09)")

# All leads with status "Contacted"
ZOHOCRM_SEARCH_RECORDS(module="Leads", criteria="(Lead_Status:equals:Contacted)")

# Deals closing this month
ZOHOCRM_SEARCH_RECORDS(module="Deals", criteria="(Closing_Date:between:2026-02-01,2026-02-28)")
```
