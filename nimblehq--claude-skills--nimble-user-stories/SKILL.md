# Nimble User Stories

## Process Workflow

Follow this sequence when writing user stories:

1. **Fetch latest documentation** - Always start by fetching the relevant documentation URL(s) to get current standards
2. **Identify story type** - Determine if this is a feature, bug, or chore
3. **Apply appropriate template** - Use the correct format for the story type
4. **Validate completeness** - Ensure all required sections are present
5. **Check naming conventions** - Verify labels, titles, and formatting match standards

## Documentation Sources

Before writing any user story, fetch the relevant live documentation:

- **Backlog Organization**: https://nimblehq.co/compass/product/backlog-management/organization/
- **Writing Stories**: https://nimblehq.co/compass/product/backlog-management/user-stories/
- **Feature Stories**: https://nimblehq.co/compass/product/backlog-management/user-stories/features/
- **Bug Stories**: https://nimblehq.co/compass/product/backlog-management/user-stories/bugs/
- **Chore Stories**: https://nimblehq.co/compass/product/backlog-management/user-stories/chores/

**Important**: Always fetch the documentation before writing stories. The live docs contain the most current standards, templates, examples, and best practices.

## Writing Feature Stories

**Always fetch latest documentation first:**
https://nimblehq.co/compass/product/backlog-management/user-stories/features/

### Quick Reference Template (verify with live docs)

```
As a [Who], [When], I [can/must] [action verb] [What]

## Why
What user problem this solves and what business value it creates.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Specific, observable behavior
- Clear success conditions
- No room for interpretation

## Technical Considerations
(Optional) Implementation guidance or constraints

## Design
(Optional) Figma links or design screenshots

## Resources
(Optional) API docs, references, implementation examples
```

### Naming Conventions (verify with live docs)

**Features**: Pattern `<user> <requirement> <action> <item>`
- Examples: "User can view past orders", "Admin can delete ticket"
- Label: `$<user>-<action>-<item>`

**Modules**: Short, descriptive names
- Examples: "Order Management", "Authentication"
- Label: `#<module-name>`

Fetch the documentation for complete details on user value validation, Definition of Done, core components, and feature breakdown best practices.

## Writing Bug Reports

**Always fetch latest documentation first:**
https://nimblehq.co/compass/product/backlog-management/user-stories/bugs/

### Quick Reference Template (verify with live docs)

```
[Clear title stating the issue - NOT user story format]

## Environment
- Platform: Web/Android/iOS
- Device: e.g., iPhone 10
- OS: e.g., iOS 13
- Version: e.g., 0.12.0 (519)
- Environment: staging/production

## Prerequisites
Specific conditions needed to recreate the issue.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Step 1
2. Step 2
3. Step 3

## Expected Behavior
What should happen (with screenshots if possible)

## Actual Behavior
What actually happens (with screenshots/videos)
```

Example title: "On the Homepage, the heading is the wrong font"

Fetch the documentation for complete guidance on environment details, prerequisites, reproduction steps, and attachment requirements.

## Writing Chores

**Always fetch latest documentation first:**
https://nimblehq.co/compass/product/backlog-management/user-stories/chores/

### Quick Reference Template (verify with live docs)

```
[Clear title stating the task]

## Why
Purpose and benefit of this chore

## Acceptance Criteria
- Task 1
- Task 2
- Behaviors to verify in QA

## Resources
Links, documentation, or materials needed
```

### Key Guidelines (verify with live docs)

- Product Manager adds chores to sprint
- Should be completable within one day
- Do not require estimation
- Common types: refactoring, POC, research, dependencies, test coverage, setup tasks

Fetch the documentation for complete details on chore types, handling, and acceptance criteria.

## Backlog Organization

**Always fetch latest documentation first:**
https://nimblehq.co/compass/product/backlog-management/organization/

### Standard Labels (verify with live docs)

- **Module**: `#<module-name>` (e.g., `#authentication`)
- **Feature**: `$<feature-name>` (e.g., `$user-list-tickets`)
- **Chore**: `!<chore-name>` (e.g., `!setup-ci-cd`)
- **Version**: `@<semver>` (e.g., `@1.2.2`)
- **Initial scope**: `initial-scope` (for all initial project stories)

### Priority Levels (verify with live docs)

- **High**: Time-sensitive, blocks work (e.g., users can't login, API down)
- **Medium**: Default priority
- **Low**: No urgency (e.g., minor UI changes, documentation)

### Workflow States (verify with live docs)

Backlog → Ready for Development → In Development → In Code Review → Ready for QA → Completed

### Versioning (verify with live docs)

Semantic Versioning: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
- MAJOR: Breaking changes
- MINOR: New features (backward compatible)
- PATCH: Bug fixes (backward compatible)

Fetch the documentation for complete details on modules, features, workflow states, and label usage.

## Best Practices

**Fetch documentation for complete best practices guidance.**

### Core Principles

**DO:**
- Use specific user roles (not "system" or "developer")
- Validate meaningful user value
- Keep stories small and focused
- Write clear, testable acceptance criteria
- Use standardized labels consistently
- Write "Why" at feature level

**DON'T:**
- Split stories by technical layers
- Use generic/vague feature names
- Let technical complexity dictate boundaries
- Forget version labels

## Example Workflow

**User request**: "Create user stories for an order history feature"

**Response process**:
1. Fetch https://nimblehq.co/compass/product/backlog-management/user-stories/features/
2. Fetch https://nimblehq.co/compass/product/backlog-management/organization/
3. Review the fetched documentation for current templates and examples
4. Identify the module (e.g., "Order Management", `#order-management`)
5. Define the feature with Why, labels, and documentation
6. Break down into user stories following the template
7. Apply appropriate labels (`$feature-name`, `@version`, etc.)
8. Validate against best practices
