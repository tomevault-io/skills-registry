# Project Reference Library

Import external documents into a curated `docs/library/` directory with structured YAML front-matter. Other CPM skills automatically discover and reference these documents during planning and execution.

## Input

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` to determine the action:

1. **Batch front-matter action**: If `$ARGUMENTS` is exactly `consolidate` (no file path after it), proceed to the Batch Front-Matter Workflow below.
2. **Consolidate action**: If `$ARGUMENTS` starts with `consolidate` followed by a file path (e.g. `consolidate docs/library/coding-standards.md`), extract the file path and proceed to the Consolidation Workflow below.
3. **Intake action**: If `$ARGUMENTS` is a file path or URL, use it as the source document for intake.
4. **No arguments**: Ask the user what document they want to import. Use AskUserQuestion:
   - **Import a local file** — Provide a file path
   - **Import from a URL** — Provide a URL

## Intake Workflow

Import a document into the project library with generated front-matter.

**State tracking**: Before starting Step 1, create the progress file (see State Management below). Each step below ends with a mandatory progress file update — do not skip it. After saving the final library document, delete the file.

### Step 1: Read Source Document

Read the source document:

- **File path**: Use the Read tool to read the file. If the file doesn't exist, tell the user and stop.
- **URL**: Use the WebFetch tool to retrieve the content. If the fetch fails, tell the user and stop.

Present a brief summary of the document to the user — what it covers, how long it is, what kind of content it contains (standards, architecture, guidelines, etc.).

**Update progress file now.**

### Step 2: Generate Front-Matter

Analyse the document content and generate the six required front-matter fields:

- **`title`**: A clear, concise title derived from the document's heading or content.
- **`source`**: The original file path or URL the document was imported from.
- **`added`**: Today's date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
- **`last-reviewed`**: Same as `added` (first import is the first review).
- **`scope`**: Array of CPM skill names this document is relevant to. See Auto-Scope Suggestion below.
- **`summary`**: A CPM-oriented distillation of the document — actionable constraints, decisions, rules, and conventions that downstream skills need. This is NOT a human abstract; it's written for CPM skills to use during triage. Keep it to 2-5 sentences focused on what matters for planning and implementation.

#### Auto-Scope Suggestion

Analyse the document content to suggest which skills should reference it. Use these heuristics:

| Content signals | Suggested scope |
|---|---|
| Architecture decisions, system design, component boundaries, integration patterns | `discover`, `spec`, `do` |
| Coding standards, style guides, naming conventions, linting rules | `do` |
| API contracts, data models, schema definitions | `spec`, `stories`, `do` |
| Business rules, domain logic, workflow descriptions | `discover`, `spec`, `stories` |
| Security policies, compliance requirements, access control | `spec`, `do` |
| Team conventions, process guidelines, collaboration norms | `all` |
| Glossaries, terminology, domain language | `all` |

Present the suggested scope to the user with AskUserQuestion. Show the suggested values and let them adjust:

- **Accept suggested scope** — Use the suggested scope values
- **Adjust scope** — Let the user modify the list

Valid scope values: `discover`, `spec`, `stories`, `do`, `party`, `all`. The value `all` is a shorthand that matches every skill — don't combine it with individual skill names.

Present the complete generated front-matter to the user for confirmation before proceeding.

**Update progress file now.**

### Step 3: Write Library Document

1. Create the `docs/library/` directory if it doesn't exist.
2. Derive a filename from the title — kebab-case, no number prefix (library docs are a collection, not a sequence). For example: `coding-standards.md`, `architecture-decisions.md`, `api-contracts.md`.
3. Write the document with front-matter prepended:

```markdown
---
title: {title}
source: {source path or URL}
added: {YYYY-MM-DD}
last-reviewed: {YYYY-MM-DD}
scope:
  - {skill name}
  - {skill name}
summary: >
  {CPM-oriented summary — actionable constraints and rules
  for downstream skills}
---

{original document content}
```

4. Tell the user the saved file path.

**Update progress file now, then delete the progress file.**

## Consolidation Workflow

Reconcile accumulated amendments on a library document into a clean, updated version.

This action is invoked as `/cpm:library consolidate <file-path>`.

### Step 1: Read and Analyse

1. Read the specified library document with the Read tool. If it doesn't exist, tell the user and stop.
2. Parse the document into three parts:
   - **Front-matter**: The YAML block between `---` delimiters
   - **Original content**: Everything after front-matter up to the first `## Amendment` heading (or end of file if none)
   - **Amendments**: All `## Amendment` blocks, in order

3. If no amendments exist, tell the user there's nothing to consolidate and stop.

4. Present a summary: how many amendments, their dates and categories, any apparent contradictions.

### Step 2: Produce Reconciled Version

1. Analyse the original content and all amendments together.
2. Produce a reconciled version of the document that integrates amendment observations into the original content body. The goal is a clean, current document — not original-plus-patches.
3. **Flag contradictions**: If amendments contradict the original content or each other, flag these explicitly to the user rather than silently resolving them. Present the contradiction and ask the user which direction to take.
4. Update the front-matter:
   - `last-reviewed`: Today's date
   - `summary`: Refreshed to reflect the reconciled content
5. Remove all `## Amendment` blocks from the body (their content is now integrated).

### Step 3: User Approval and Save

1. Present the reconciled version to the user for review. Show a clear before/after summary of what changed.
2. Use AskUserQuestion to gate the save:
   - **Save the reconciled version** — Write the file
   - **Make adjustments** — Let the user request changes before saving
   - **Cancel** — Keep the original document unchanged
3. If approved, write the reconciled document using the Write tool (full replacement is appropriate here since the user is approving the complete new version).
4. Tell the user the updated file path.

## Batch Front-Matter Workflow

Scan the library for documents missing front-matter and add it. This action is invoked as `/cpm:library consolidate` (with no file path argument).

**State tracking**: Before starting Step 1, create the progress file (see State Management below). Each step below ends with a mandatory progress file update — do not skip it. After processing all documents, delete the file.

### Step 1: Scan Library

1. Use the Glob tool to find all `docs/library/*.md` files. If the directory doesn't exist or contains no `.md` files, tell the user there are no library documents to process and stop.
2. Read each file's first line with the Read tool. Check whether the file starts with `---` (the opening delimiter of YAML front-matter).
   - Files starting with `---`: **has front-matter** — skip.
   - Files not starting with `---`: **bare** — queue for processing.
3. If all files already have front-matter, tell the user: "All library documents already have front-matter. Nothing to do." Stop.
4. Present the list of bare files to the user.

**Update progress file now.**

### Step 2: Batch Summary

Present a summary to the user: "Found {N} documents without front-matter: {filenames}." Use AskUserQuestion to confirm before processing:

- **Proceed** — Process all bare documents
- **Cancel** — Stop without making changes

If cancelled, stop the workflow.

**Update progress file now.**

### Step 3: Generate Front-Matter per Document

For each bare document in the queue, process one at a time:

1. Read the full document content with the Read tool.
2. Analyse the content and generate the six required front-matter fields:
   - **`title`**: Derived from the document's heading or content.
   - **`source`**: The document's current file path (e.g. `docs/library/coding-standards.md`).
   - **`added`**: Today's date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
   - **`last-reviewed`**: Same as `added`.
   - **`scope`**: Use the Auto-Scope Suggestion heuristics from the Intake Workflow section above to suggest which skills should reference this document.
   - **`summary`**: A CPM-oriented actionable distillation, following the same guidelines as the Intake Workflow (written for skills, not humans; 2-5 sentences of actionable constraints).
3. Present the generated front-matter to the user with AskUserQuestion:
   - **Accept suggested scope** — Use the suggested scope values
   - **Adjust scope** — Let the user modify the list
4. If a document's content can't be meaningfully analysed, skip it with a warning to the user and move to the next document. Do not abort the batch.

**Update progress file now** (record which documents have been processed and which remain).

### Step 4: Write Front-Matter

For each document that was approved in Step 3:

1. Prepend the front-matter block (with `---` delimiters) to the existing file content. Use the Write tool with the complete file contents — front-matter followed by the original body. The original body content must not be modified.
2. Tell the user the updated file path.
3. If a document can't be written, skip it with a warning to the user and continue to the next document. Do not abort the batch.

After all documents are processed, tell the user how many were updated and delete the progress file.

**Update progress file now, then delete the progress file.**

## State Management

Maintain `docs/plans/.cpm-progress-{session_id}.md` during the intake and batch front-matter workflows for compaction resilience.

**Path resolution**: All paths in this skill are relative to the current Claude Code session's working directory. When calling Write, Glob, Read, or any file tool, construct the absolute path by prepending the session's primary working directory. Never write to a different project's directory or reuse paths from other sessions.

**Session ID**: The `{session_id}` in the filename comes from `CPM_SESSION_ID` — a unique identifier for the current Claude Code session, injected into context by the CPM hooks on startup and after compaction. Use this value verbatim when constructing the progress file path. If `CPM_SESSION_ID` is not present in context (e.g. hooks not installed), fall back to `.cpm-progress.md` (no session suffix) for backwards compatibility.

**Resume adoption**: When a session is resumed (`--resume`) or context is cleared (`/clear`), `CPM_SESSION_ID` changes to a new value while the old progress file remains on disk. The hooks inject all existing progress files into context — if one matches this skill's `**Skill**:` field but has a different session ID in its filename, adopt it:
1. Read the old file's contents (already visible in context from hook injection).
2. Write a new file at `docs/plans/.cpm-progress-{current_session_id}.md` with the same contents.
3. After the Write confirms success, delete the old file: `rm docs/plans/.cpm-progress-{old_session_id}.md`.
Do not attempt adoption if `CPM_SESSION_ID` is absent from context — the fallback path handles that case.

**Create** the file before starting Step 1. **Update** it after each step completes. **Delete** it only after all output artifacts (library documents, batch results) have been confirmed written — never before. If compaction fires between deletion and a pending write, all session state is lost.

**Also delete** `docs/plans/.cpm-compact-summary-{session_id}.md` if it exists — this companion file is written by the PostCompact hook and should be cleaned up alongside the progress file.

Use the Write tool to write the full file each time (not Edit — the file is replaced wholesale).

### Intake / Consolidation Format

```markdown
# CPM Session State

**Skill**: cpm:library
**Action**: {intake or consolidate}
**Step**: {N} of 3 — {Step Name}
**Source**: {file path or URL being imported, or file being consolidated}
**Output target**: docs/library/{filename}.md

## Completed Steps

### Step 1: Read Source Document
{Summary — document type, length, key content areas}

### Step 2: Generate Front-Matter
{Summary — title, scope values chosen, summary generated}

### Step 3: Write Library Document
{Summary — file path written}

{...include only completed steps...}

## Next Action
{What to do next}
```

### Batch Front-Matter Format

```markdown
# CPM Session State

**Skill**: cpm:library
**Action**: batch-front-matter
**Step**: {N} of 4 — {Step Name}
**Documents found**: {total count}
**Documents remaining**: {count not yet processed}

## Bare Documents
{List of file paths queued for processing}

## Completed Documents

### {filename}
{Summary — title assigned, scope values chosen}

{...continue for each processed document...}

## Next Action
{What to do next — e.g. "Process next document: {filename}" or "All documents processed, delete state file"}
```

## Front-Matter Schema Reference

Every library document must have exactly these six fields in its YAML front-matter:

```yaml
---
title: {string, required}       # Human-readable document title
source: {string, required}      # Original file path or URL
added: {date, required}         # Date imported (YYYY-MM-DD)
last-reviewed: {date, required} # Date last reviewed or amended (YYYY-MM-DD)
scope:                          # Array of skill names this doc is relevant to
  - {string}                    # Valid: discover, spec, stories, do, party, all
summary: >                      # CPM-oriented actionable distillation
  {string}                      # Written for skills, not humans. 2-5 sentences.
---
```

**Consistency rules**:
- All fields are required — never omit any.
- Date format is always `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- Scope values are lowercase skill names. `all` is a shorthand for every skill — don't combine with individual names.
- Summary focuses on actionable constraints, decisions, and rules — not a description of what the document is about.

## Amendment Format Reference

When `/cpm:retro` amends a library document, it appends blocks in this format:

```markdown
## Amendment — {YYYY-MM-DD} (via retro)

**Source**: {path to retro file}
**Category**: {observation category}

{Observation text — what was learned and what should change}
```

The consolidation action reads and reconciles these blocks. This format is the contract between retro write-back and consolidation.

## Guidelines

- **Low friction intake.** The user provides a path or URL; CPM does the rest. Minimise questions — auto-suggest, then confirm.
- **Summaries are for machines.** The front-matter summary is read by other CPM skills during triage, not by humans browsing a docs folder. Write it as actionable constraints: "PSR-12 with Pint enforcement. Repository pattern for data access. No inline SQL outside migrations." Not: "This document describes the team's PHP coding standards."
- **One document, one file.** Don't split or merge source documents. Import them as-is with front-matter prepended.
- **Graceful on failure.** If a URL can't be fetched or a file doesn't exist, tell the user and stop. Don't partially import.
- **Consolidation is user-controlled.** Never auto-consolidate. The user decides when amendment accumulation warrants a clean-up pass.
