# Template Discoverability & Scaffolding

Explore and customise the templates used by CPM artifact-producing skills. CPM uses a two-tier template system:

- **Structural templates** are data contracts parsed by downstream skills. They cannot be overridden — their format is fixed. Examples: problem briefs, specs, epic docs, review files, retro files.
- **Presentational templates** can be overridden with project-level files at `docs/templates/`. They control how information is presented but aren't parsed by other skills. Examples: product briefs, ADRs, communications.

## Subcommands

This skill dispatches based on `$ARGUMENTS`:

- No arguments or `list` → **List** all templates
- `preview {skill}` → **Preview** a template skeleton
- `scaffold {skill}` → **Scaffold** an override file

If `$ARGUMENTS` doesn't match any subcommand, show the help text with available subcommands.

## List

Show all CPM artifact-producing skills with their template metadata. Present as a formatted table:

| Skill | Output Format | Type | Override Path |
|-------|--------------|------|---------------|
| `cpm:discover` | Problem brief | Structural | — (fixed) |
| `cpm:brief` | Product brief | Presentational | `docs/templates/brief.md` |
| `cpm:spec` | Specification | Structural | — (fixed) |
| `cpm:architect` | ADR | Presentational | `docs/templates/architect.md` |
| `cpm:epics` | Epic doc | Structural | — (fixed) |
| `cpm:do` | Epic doc updates | Structural | — (fixed) |
| `cpm:ralph` | Ralph loop command | Structural | — (fixed) |
| `cpm:present` | Communication | Presentational | `docs/templates/present/{format}.md` |
| `cpm:review` | Review file | Structural | — (fixed) |
| `cpm:retro` | Retro file | Structural | — (fixed) |

After showing the table, check for existing overrides:
1. **Glob** `docs/templates/*.md` and `docs/templates/present/*.md`.
2. If any overrides exist, list them: "Active overrides: {paths}".
3. If none exist, note: "No project-level overrides found."

## Preview

Usage: `/cpm:templates preview {skill}`

Show the template skeleton for the specified skill. This displays the embedded default template — the markdown structure the skill uses when no project override exists.

To preview a template:
1. Parse `{skill}` from `$ARGUMENTS` (e.g. `brief`, `architect`, `present`). Accept with or without the `cpm:` prefix.
2. Read the corresponding SKILL.md file from the skill directory.
3. Find the output format section (usually under `## Output`) and extract the template from the markdown code block.
4. Display the template to the user.

This works for both structural and presentational templates — users can preview any template to understand the expected format, even if they can't override structural ones.

## Scaffold

Usage: `/cpm:templates scaffold {skill}`

Create a project-level override file for a presentational template. This copies the embedded default template to `docs/templates/` where the user can customise it.

To scaffold a template:
1. Parse `{skill}` from `$ARGUMENTS`.
2. **Check if the template is presentational**. If it's structural, tell the user: "The {skill} template is structural (used as a data contract by downstream skills) and cannot be overridden. Run `/cpm:templates preview {skill}` to view the format."
3. Determine the override path:
   - `cpm:brief` → `docs/templates/brief.md`
   - `cpm:architect` → `docs/templates/architect.md`
   - `cpm:present` → Ask which format to scaffold, then `docs/templates/present/{format}.md`
4. Check if the override file already exists. If so, tell the user and ask whether to overwrite.
5. Read the embedded default template from the skill's SKILL.md.
6. Create the `docs/templates/` directory (and `present/` subdirectory if needed) if it doesn't exist.
7. Write the template to the override path.
8. Tell the user: "Scaffolded template at `{path}`. Edit this file to customise the output format for `{skill}`."

## Guidelines

- **No state management needed.** This skill is stateless — it doesn't produce planning artifacts or run multi-phase facilitation. No progress file required.
- **Fast and informational.** List, preview, and scaffold should each complete in a single response. No AskUserQuestion gating needed for list or preview.
- **Respect the two-tier boundary.** Never scaffold a structural template override. The distinction exists to protect data contracts between skills.
