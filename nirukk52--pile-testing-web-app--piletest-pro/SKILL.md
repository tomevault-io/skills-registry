# PileTest Pro Domain Knowledge

This skill provides domain expertise for pile load testing and IS 2911-compliant report generation.

## Quick Reference

### Test Types & Load Multipliers

| Test Type | Code | Load Multiplier | Description |
|-----------|------|-----------------|-------------|
| Initial Vertical | `IVPLT` | 2.5× design load | First test on new piles |
| Routine Vertical | `RVPLT` | 1.5× design load | Production/working piles |
| Lateral | `LATERAL` | 2.5× design load | Horizontal resistance |
| Uplift/Pullout | `UPLIFT` | 2.5× design load | Upward resistance |

### Core Formulas

```typescript
// Load from pressure (MT)
load = (pressureKgCm2 × ramAreaCm2) / 1000

// Average settlement (mm)  
avgSettlement = (dg1 + dg2 + dg3 + dg4) / enabledGaugeCount

// Net settlement (mm)
netSettlement = maxSettlement - elasticRebound

// Safe load from 12mm criterion (MT)
safeLoad_12mm = (2/3) × loadAt12mmSettlement

// Safe load from ultimate criterion (MT)  
safeLoad_ultimate = 0.5 × loadAt10PercentDiameter
```

### Pass/Fail Criteria (IS 2911)

**Vertical Tests (IVPLT/RVPLT)**:
- Net settlement ≤ 12mm (or 2% of pile diameter, whichever is less)
- Safe load = **minimum** of design load, safeLoad_12mm, safeLoad_ultimate

## Workflow

### 1. Calculate Results
See `references/is2911-standards.md` for detailed calculation steps.

### 2. Generate Report
See `references/report-structure.md` for PDF section specifications.

### 3. Validate Readings
For IS 2911 compliance validation, see `scripts/validate_readings.py`.

## Files

- **references/is2911-standards.md** - Complete IS 2911 Part 4 acceptance criteria
- **references/report-structure.md** - PDF report section specifications  
- **references/test-types.md** - Detailed test type configurations
- **scripts/validate_readings.py** - Python validation for readings
- **assets/templates/** - HTML report template patterns

## Key Implementation Points

### Settlement Calculations

1. **Max Settlement**: Highest `avgSettlementMm` during LOADING phase
2. **Elastic Rebound**: Max settlement minus final settlement after full unload
3. **Net Settlement**: Permanent settlement after load removal

### Safe Load Determination

```
governingCriterion = 
  if (settlementLimit was reached) → "SETTLEMENT_12MM"
  if (10% diameter was reached) → "ULTIMATE_10PCT_DIA"  
  else → "DESIGN_LOAD"

safeLoadAdopted = min(
  designLoadT,
  safeLoadFromSettlementT,  // (2/3) × load at 12mm
  safeLoadFromUltimateT     // (1/2) × load at 10% dia
)
```

### Chart Configuration

- X-axis: Load (MT)
- Y-axis: Settlement (mm) - **inverted** (0 at top, increases downward)
- Curves: Loading (blue), Holding (amber), Unloading (green)
- Annotations: 12mm limit line, safe load vertical line
