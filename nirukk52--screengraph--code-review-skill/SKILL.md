# Code Review

## Overview

Conduct focused, structured code reviews that emphasize understanding over criticism. Reviews prioritize questions about ambiguity and code/data flow rather than nitpicking style. Each review produces a consistent format with summary, assumptions, and priority-based comments.

## When to Use This Skill

Trigger this skill when:
- Reviewing pull requests or code changes
- User explicitly requests "review this code" or "conduct a code review"
- Analyzing a diff or set of file changes
- Evaluating code before merge or deployment
- JIRA tickets reference code changes that need review

## Review Format

All code reviews follow this structure:

### 1. What These Changes Do
3-5 concise bullet points summarizing the intent and scope of changes.

**Example:**
- Adds GraphQL endpoint for querying user preferences
- Refactors authentication middleware to support JWT tokens
- Introduces caching layer for frequently accessed data

### 2. Assumptions
Brief bullet points documenting assumptions made during the review.

**Example:**
- Assuming PostgreSQL is the target database (not explicitly stated)
- Type definitions suggest this is part of a larger refactor
- Error handling strategy follows existing patterns in the codebase

### 3. Priority Comments

Comments organized into three priority levels. Each comment is 50-150 words maximum.

#### High Priority
Issues that must be addressed before merge:
- Security vulnerabilities
- Data loss risks
- Breaking changes without migration path
- Critical logic errors
- Major performance regressions

#### Medium Priority
Issues that should be addressed soon:
- Unclear code/data flow requiring clarification
- Missing error handling
- Ambiguous function behavior
- Type safety concerns
- Potential edge cases

#### Low Priority
Suggestions for future improvement:
- Code organization opportunities
- Documentation enhancements
- Minor performance optimizations
- Consistency improvements

## Review Process

### Step 1: Identify Changes Scope
Read through all modified files to understand:
- What functionality is being added/modified/removed
- Which systems/services are affected
- Whether this is a feature, bug fix, refactor, or chore

### Step 2: Check for JIRA Reference
Scan commit messages, PR descriptions, and file paths for JIRA ticket references:
- Pattern: `FR-###`, `BUG-###`, `TD-###`, `CHORE-###`
- If found, prepare to save review document in the JIRA folder: `jira/{category}/{ticket-id}/code-review-{date}.md`

**JIRA Folder Structure:**
```
jira/
├── feature-requests/
│   └── FR-XXX/
│       ├── code-review-2025-11-09.md
│       └── DESCRIPTION.md
├── bugs/
│   └── BUG-XXX/
├── tech-debt/
│   └── TD-XXX/
└── chores/
    └── CHORE-XXX/
```

### Step 3: Analyze Code Flow
Focus on understanding:
- **Data flow**: How data moves through functions/components
- **Control flow**: Branching logic, error paths, edge cases
- **Dependencies**: What this code relies on and what relies on it
- **Assumptions**: What must be true for this code to work correctly

### Step 4: Formulate Questions
Instead of prescriptive feedback, ask questions about:
- Ambiguous behavior: "What happens when userId is null here?"
- Flow clarity: "How does error propagate from this async call?"
- Missing context: "Is there a reason we're not validating input X?"
- Edge cases: "Have we considered the case where the array is empty?"

### Step 5: Prioritize Feedback
Categorize each comment:
- **High**: Must fix before merge (security, correctness, data integrity)
- **Medium**: Should address (clarity, robustness, maintainability)
- **Low**: Nice to have (style, organization, minor optimizations)

### Step 6: Write Review
Use the review template from `assets/review-template.md` and populate all sections:
1. **What These Changes Do** (3-5 bullets)
2. **Assumptions** (as many bullets as needed, keep short)
3. **High Priority** (only critical issues)
4. **Medium Priority** (questions and concerns)
5. **Low Priority** (suggestions for future)

### Step 7: Save Review Document
If JIRA ticket found:
- Save to `jira/{category}/{ticket-id}/code-review-{YYYY-MM-DD}.md`
- Use today's date for the filename

If no JIRA ticket:
- Present review inline in the conversation

## Review Principles

### DO Focus On
✅ Understanding code intent and flow  
✅ Asking questions about ambiguity  
✅ Identifying security and correctness issues  
✅ Flagging unclear data flow  
✅ Noting missing error handling  
✅ Highlighting assumptions that need validation  

### DON'T Focus On
❌ Nitpicking style preferences  
❌ Subjective code organization debates  
❌ Minor naming suggestions  
❌ Formatting (linters handle this)  
❌ Personal preference for syntax  
❌ Extensive refactoring suggestions (unless critical)  

### Question Framing
Always frame feedback as questions or observations, not commands:

**Good:**
- "What happens if the API returns null here?"
- "Should we validate userId before passing to the database?"
- "Is there a reason we're not handling the rejected promise?"

**Avoid:**
- "You need to add validation here."
- "This should use async/await instead."
- "Change this to use map() instead of forEach()."

## Word Count Guidelines

Keep reviews concise:
- **What These Changes Do**: 1-2 sentences per bullet
- **Assumptions**: 1 sentence per bullet
- **Comments**: 50-150 words each (strictly enforced)

Short, focused reviews are more actionable than lengthy critiques.

## Example Review

**What These Changes Do:**
- Adds real-time WebSocket connection management for live screen updates
- Introduces connection pooling to handle up to 1000 concurrent sessions
- Implements automatic reconnection logic with exponential backoff

**Assumptions:**
- Redis is available and configured for session storage
- Frontend implements WebSocket protocol correctly
- Network latency is acceptable for real-time requirements

**High Priority:**
- Memory leak risk: WebSocket connections appear to be held indefinitely without cleanup when clients disconnect unexpectedly. Should we implement a timeout or heartbeat mechanism?

**Medium Priority:**
- Error handling: What happens when Redis connection fails mid-session? The code doesn't appear to handle this case, which could leave clients in an inconsistent state.
- Type safety: The `message` parameter in `handleIncomingMessage()` is typed as `any`. Can we define a discriminated union for the expected message types?

**Low Priority:**
- Consider extracting the reconnection logic into a separate utility function for reusability across other real-time features.
