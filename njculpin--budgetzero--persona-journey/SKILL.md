# Game Loopers Product & UX Verification Skill

## Skill Name
**user-journey-verification**

## Purpose
Comprehensively test and verify all persona journeys across Game Loopers personas, leveraging the project-product-manager and ux-flow-designer agents to identify friction points, ensure consistency, and generate actionable improvement recommendations.

This skill produces a detailed `REPORT.md` in the root directory documenting findings, prioritized recommendations, and implementation roadmap.

---

## Scope

### Personas Covered (MVP Phase)
This skill tests user journeys for all current personas defined in `PERSONAS.md`:

1. **Game Designer** - Creates products by combining assets, manages royalties
2. **3D Modeler** - Publishes embeddable STL products, earns royalties
3. **Illustrator/Artist** - Licenses artwork via embeddable products
4. **Consumer/Buyer** - Purchases complete game packages

### Future Personas (Deferred)
Documented but not tested until Phase 3:
- Printer (3D printing service provider)
- Painter (miniature painting service provider)

---

## Verification Framework

### 1. User Journey Testing

For each persona, the skill will:

**A. Map Complete User Flows**
- Account creation and onboarding
- Primary goal achievement (create/publish/purchase)
- Secondary interactions (collaboration, discovery, community)
- Edge cases and error states

**B. Identify Friction Points**
Using the **ux-flow-designer** agent to analyze:
- Cognitive load at each step
- Decision fatigue and confusion points
- Missing feedback or unclear states
- Excessive clicks or form fields
- Mobile responsiveness issues

**C. Verify Business Rules**
Using the **project-product-manager** agent to ensure:
- Product status system (draft, private, public, archived)
- Embeddability rules (is_embeddable flag, royalty configuration)
- Publishing validation (products need files OR components)
- Revenue distribution (10% platform fee, owner share, royalties)
- RLS security policies

**D. Check Consistency**
Cross-persona consistency verification:
- UI patterns (BEM CSS, design tokens)
- Form validation messaging
- Error handling and recovery
- Success state feedback
- Navigation patterns

---

### 2. UX Best Practices Audit

The skill applies industry-standard UX principles:

**Progressive Disclosure**
- Are complex features revealed gradually?
- Do first-time users see appropriate guidance?
- Are power users able to access advanced features?

**Error Prevention & Recovery**
- Are destructive actions confirmed?
- Do forms validate in real-time?
- Are error messages actionable with recovery paths?
- Can users undo or go back?

**Feedback & Affordance**
- Do buttons clearly indicate their purpose?
- Is loading state visible for async operations?
- Are success/failure states communicated clearly?
- Does the UI respond immediately to interactions?

**Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 Level AA)**
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus indicators visible and clear
- Screen reader compatibility (ARIA labels)
- Color contrast ratios
- Touch target sizes (mobile)

**Conversion Optimization**
- Is the primary CTA obvious on each page?
- Are form fields minimized to essentials?
- Is trust established (transparent pricing, clear policies)?
- Are abandonment points minimized?

---

### 3. Agent Orchestration

The skill coordinates multiple specialized agents:

#### Phase 1: Strategic Analysis (project-product-manager)
- Review current implementation against product goals
- Identify scope creep or missing requirements
- Validate business rule enforcement
- Check code quality (no unused vars/imports/any types)
- Assess technical debt and scalability

**Deliverable**: Strategic assessment document

#### Phase 2: Flow Design Review (ux-flow-designer)
- Analyze all critical user flows per persona
- Map entry points, decision points, exit states
- Identify friction and suggest improvements
- Recommend component patterns (aligned with BEM)
- Provide accessibility recommendations

**Deliverable**: Flow analysis with diagrams and recommendations

#### Phase 3: Synthesis & Reporting
Combine findings into prioritized report:
- **P0 Critical Issues** (blocking launch/sales)
- **P1 High Impact** (significant UX friction or inconsistency)
- **P2 Medium Impact** (nice-to-have improvements)
- **P3 Future Enhancements** (deferred to post-MVP)
