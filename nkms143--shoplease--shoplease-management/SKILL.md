# ShopLease Management Skill

Specialized business logic for the SUDA Shop Lease Manager. Read the reference files listed below as needed — do not load all of them at once.

## Reference Files

- **[references/schema.md](references/schema.md)** — Supabase table schemas, field definitions, and data conventions. Read when: querying or writing to the DB, unsure of field names or types.
- **[references/business_rules.md](references/business_rules.md)** — Penalty formula, Invoice vs Ledger distinction, GST rules, waiver logic, DCB engine, notice escalation. Read when: implementing or debugging financial calculations.
- **[references/module_map.md](references/module_map.md)** — Which `js/core/` function to call for each workflow. Read when: implementing a feature and need to know the right core function to use.

## Directives

Business workflows are documented in `directives/`:

| Directive | When to Read |
|-----------|-------------|
| `directives/penalty_calculation.md` | Penalty policy, modes (MONTHLY/DAILY), historical rates |
| `directives/rent_collection.md` | Recording rent payments, receipt generation |
| `directives/dcb_report.md` | DCB report generation and columns |
| `directives/waiver_processing.md` | Granting and applying penalty waivers |
| `directives/notice_generation.md` | Defaulter identification and notice escalation |
| `directives/gst_reconciliation.md` | GST collected vs remitted reconciliation |
| `directives/shop_ledger.md` | Real-time shop balance statement |
| `directives/lease_management.md` | Renewal, termination, new applicant onboarding |
| `directives/invoice_generation.md` | Monthly invoice snapshot generation |

## Key Principles

1. **Check `js/core/` first** — `PenaltiesCore`, `GSTCore`, `PaymentsCore`, `ReportsCore` cover all financial calculations. Do not reimplement.
2. **All data via `Store` or RPCs** — Use `Store.get*()` (sync, cached) and `Store.save*()` for UI state. For heavy data aggregation (like ledgers or archiving), use Supabase RPCs (e.g., `get_shop_ledger_summary`).
3. **Shop IDs are strings** — Always normalize to zero-padded string: `String(shopNo).padStart(2, '0')`.
4. **Penalties are historical** — Use the `window.PenaltiesCore` functions to handle the rate that applied at the time, not today's rate.
5. **Invoice ≠ Ledger** — Do not try to reconcile them. See `references/business_rules.md`.
