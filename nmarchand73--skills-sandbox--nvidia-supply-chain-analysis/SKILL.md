# Nvidia Supply Chain Analysis

Advanced toolkit for analyzing the complete Nvidia semiconductor supply chain ecosystem, identifying trading opportunities, and anticipating market movements based on supply chain dynamics.

## Quick Start

For immediate analysis of current supply chain status:

```bash
# Full supply chain overview with signals
python scripts/fetch_supply_chain_data.py --format summary

# Technical analysis scan for opportunities  
python scripts/technical_analysis.py --scan

# Upcoming earnings catalysts
python scripts/earnings_calendar.py
```

## Core Analysis Workflows

### 1. Supply Chain Health Assessment

Evaluate the current state of Nvidia's supply chain:

```bash
# Fetch comprehensive supply chain data
python scripts/fetch_supply_chain_data.py

# Review correlations and dependencies
# Look for correlation breaks (<0.3) as opportunity signals
# Monitor companies with beta >1.5 for leveraged exposure
```

Key metrics to examine:
- **Correlation to NVDA**: >0.7 indicates tight coupling
- **3-month momentum**: Identify leaders and laggards
- **Volatility**: >50% suggests elevated risk
- **Volume patterns**: Unusual volume precedes moves

### 2. Trading Signal Generation

Identify actionable opportunities across the ecosystem:

```bash
# Scan for technical buy/sell signals
python scripts/technical_analysis.py --scan

# Deep dive on specific ticker
python scripts/technical_analysis.py --ticker TSM --period 6mo
```

Signal priorities:
1. **RSI extremes** (<30 or >70) with volume confirmation
2. **MACD crossovers** in Tier-2/3 suppliers
3. **Breakout patterns** in equipment stocks (leading indicators)
4. **Bollinger Band** squeezes in memory names

### 3. Event-Driven Analysis

Track and anticipate catalyst impacts:

```bash
# Get complete event calendar
python scripts/earnings_calendar.py --calendar

# Analyze specific ticker's earnings impact
python scripts/earnings_calendar.py --ticker NVDA
```

Earnings sequence strategy:
1. Equipment companies report first → Leading signal
2. Memory suppliers → Pricing/supply updates
3. TSMC → Manufacturing confirmation
4. Nvidia → Final confirmation
5. System integrators → Deployment trends

### 4. Bottleneck Identification

Monitor critical constraints:

```python
# Check HBM availability (primary bottleneck)
python scripts/fetch_supply_chain_data.py --ticker SK
python scripts/fetch_supply_chain_data.py --ticker MU

# CoWoS packaging capacity (secondary bottleneck)
python scripts/technical_analysis.py --ticker TSM
```

Current bottlenecks (2024-2025):
- **HBM3/HBM3E memory**: SK Hynix, Micron
- **Advanced packaging**: TSMC CoWoS
- **EUV capacity**: ASML equipment delivery

### 5. Pair Trading Opportunities

Identify and execute relative value trades:

```python
# Compare correlated pairs
# High correlation pairs (>0.7): NVDA/TSM, AMAT/LRCX
# Competitive pairs: NVDA/AMD, TSM/INTC
# Memory pairs: MU/SK

# Look for 2+ standard deviation spreads
```

## Supply Chain Tiers & Dependencies

For detailed relationships, consult: `references/supply_chain_map.md`

### Critical Dependencies
- **NVDA → TSM**: 100% of advanced GPU production
- **TSM → ASML**: EUV lithography monopoly
- **NVDA → SK Hynix**: Primary HBM supplier
- **NVDA → SMCI**: Server integration partner

### Risk Propagation
- Equipment orders → 6-9 month signal
- Foundry utilization → 3-4 month signal  
- Memory pricing → 2-3 month signal
- Hyperscaler capex → 2-3 month signal

## Advanced Analysis Strategies

For comprehensive strategies, see: `references/analysis_strategies.md`

### Leading Indicator Sequence
1. **ASML backlog** → Future capacity (9-12 months)
2. **Equipment billings** → Capacity additions (6-9 months)
3. **TSM utilization** → Supply tightness (3-4 months)
4. **Memory pricing** → Cost pressures (2-3 months)
5. **Hyperscaler capex** → Demand signals (1-3 months)

### Portfolio Construction
```
Aggressive Growth (Higher Risk):
- 40% NVDA
- 20% SMCI  
- 20% Equipment (ASML, AMAT)
- 20% Memory (MU, SK)

Balanced Exposure:
- 30% NVDA
- 30% TSM
- 20% Equipment basket
- 10% Memory
- 10% System integrators

Conservative/Hedged:
- 25% NVDA
- 25% TSM
- 25% Diversified equipment
- 15% Large-cap integrators (DELL, HPE)
- 10% Cash/Hedges
```

## Risk Management

### Key Risk Factors
1. **Taiwan geopolitical risk** - Affects TSM, ASX
2. **China restrictions** - Impacts equipment 20-30% revenue
3. **Technology transitions** - 3nm migration risks
4. **Competitive threats** - AMD, Intel alternatives
5. **Demand digestion** - Hyperscaler pause risk

### Hedging Strategies
- Put spreads on high-beta names before earnings
- Inverse semiconductor ETFs (SOXS) for systemic hedges
- Pair trades to neutralize market risk
- Geographic diversification (Korea, Europe, US)

## Real-Time Monitoring

### Daily Checklist
1. Pre-market: Check Asian suppliers (TSM, SK Hynix)
2. Equipment stocks as leading indicators
3. Memory pricing trends
4. Unusual options activity
5. Correlation breaks or extremes

### Weekly Review
- Supply chain aggregate momentum
- Earnings calendar updates
- Insider transaction patterns
- Analyst revision trends
- Technical setup scans

### Event Preparation
- Reduce exposure before equipment earnings
- Add on supply chain confirmation
- Hedge before NVDA reports
- Watch for cluster catalysts
