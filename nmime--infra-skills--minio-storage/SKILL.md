# MinIO Storage

S3-compatible storage for platform services. (Updated: January 2026). All scripts are **idempotent** - uses `helm upgrade --install`.

## MinIO Image Source Change

As of October 2025, MinIO no longer provides official Docker images. Use one of these alternatives:

| Option | Image | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **Chainguard (Recommended)** | `cgr.dev/chainguard/minio` | Free tier, vulnerability-free |
| **Bitnami** | `bitnami/minio` | Community maintained |
| **Build from source** | Self-built | Requires Go 1.24+ |

## Modes

| Tier | Mode | Replicas |
|------|------|----------|
| minimal/small | standalone | 1 |
| medium/production | distributed | 4 |

## Installation

See [references/installation.md](references/installation.md) for deployment options:
- Standalone: Single replica for minimal/small tiers
- Distributed: 4 replicas for medium/production tiers

## Integrations

- GitLab (artifacts, uploads, LFS)
- Loki (log storage)
- Backups
