## V. PROMPT GENERATION FORMULA

**Essential Structure:**
```
[GENRE] + [VOICE + CHARACTERISTICS] + [INSTRUMENTS] + 
[SPACE] + [TEMPO] + [EMOTION] + [REFERENCES] + [LANGUAGE]
```

**Never Omit (The Five Pillars):**
1. `sacred neoclassical electronic` (genre)
2. `boys choir` or `female choir` (voice type)
3. `crystalline minimal vibrato` (timbral signature)
4. `7-8 voices polyphony` (texture)
5. `cathedral reverb` (space)
6. `transcendent spiritual` (emotion)
7. `ERA Enigma LIBERA` (references)
8. `pseudo-Latin` or `wordless` (language)

**Variable Elements:**
- Tempo: 60-70 BPM (meditative) OR 120-140 BPM (energetic)
- Dynamics: 0.5 (moderate) OR 0.7 (dramatic)
- Voice mix: boys only, female only, or mixed
- Instrumentation: core synth + optional orchestral

## VII. QUICK DECISION TREE

**User Request → Analysis:**

1. **Extract mood/context** from user message
2. **Match to template:**
   - Keywords like "meditate", "peaceful" → Meditative
   - Keywords like "dance", "energy" → Energetic
   - Keywords like "epic", "dramatic" → Cinematic
   - Keywords like "relax", "sleep" → Ambient
   - Keywords like "romantic", "nostalgic" → French Synthpop
   - Keywords like "ethnic", "world" → World Sacred
3. **Generate prompt** using formula
4. **Provide:**
   - Main prompt (for Suno/Udio)
   - Lyrics template (if applicable)
   - Title suggestion
   - Timing notes (if Style Reference)

---

## VIII. ANTI-PATTERNS (AVOID)

❌ Heavy bass / sub-bass dominance  
❌ Aggressive dynamics (>0.7)  
❌ Excessive vibrato (>0.3)  
❌ Autotune abuse  
❌ Pure instrumental (only 19% collection)  
❌ Trap hi-hats / dubstep wobbles  
❌ Rock guitars / distortion  
❌ Dark, low timbres / male bass  
❌ Hyper-quantized robotic timing  
❌ Dry, close-mic'd production  
❌ Compression "wall of sound"

## IX. GOLDEN RULES

**The Five Pillars:** Sacred + Electronic + Choir + Cathedral + Transcendent

**Mantra:** "If it's not sacred electronic choir with cathedral reverb creating transcendence, it's not Laimis."

**80/20 Rule:** 80% needs met by Universal Prompt + adjustments (tempo, voice mix, energy, text). 20% needs custom prompts.

**Quality Checklist:**
- ✅ Includes "sacred" or "spiritual"
- ✅ Specifies choir type
- ✅ Mentions "crystalline" or "ethereal"
- ✅ States "minimal vibrato"
- ✅ Defines polyphony (7-8 voices)
- ✅ Includes "cathedral reverb"
- ✅ Sets BPM
- ✅ Names ERA/Enigma/LIBERA
- ✅ Specifies transcendent mood
- ✅ Indicates text approach

---

## X. WHEN TO READ REFERENCES

**Read [complete_analysis.md](references/complete_analysis.md) when:**
- User asks for detailed taste description
- Needs psychological analysis
- Wants full statistical breakdown
- Asks "why" about preferences

**Read [artist_database.md](references/artist_database.md) when:**
- User asks about specific artists
- Needs Style Reference tracks with timing
- Wants complete playlist content
- Asks for similar artists

**Read [prompt_library.md](references/prompt_library.md) when:**
- Needs complete prompt variations
- Wants lyrics templates (pseudo-Latin, French, wordless)
- Troubleshooting generation issues
- Creating complex/custom prompts

---

## XI. EMERGENCY FALLBACKS

**If request unclear:**
1. Ask: "Mood: meditative, energetic, dramatic, or ambient?"
2. Ask: "Voice: boys choir, female choir, or mixed?"
3. Ask: "Tempo: slow (60-70), medium (100-110), or fast (120-140)?"
4. Match to closest specialized prompt

**If generation fails:**
- Too modern → Add "vintage 80s production, analog warmth"
- Not enough choir → "pure crystalline voices, prominent choir"
- Wrong tempo → Explicitly state BPM + mood
- Lacks space → "cathedral reverb vast, wide stereo"
- Missing drama → "dramatic builds, emotional crescendos"

---

## XII. THE ULTIMATE PROMPT

If only ONE prompt allowed:

```
sacred neoclassical electronic synthpop 80s, ethereal boys choir and female choir 7 voices crystalline polyphony, minimal vibrato, analog synth Prophet-5 warm pads, cathedral reverb vast, orchestral strings subtle, 70 BPM meditative building to 130 BPM climax, moderate dynamics, transcendent melancholic hope spiritual otherworldly, ERA Enigma LIBERA aesthetic, pseudo-Latin, vintage production multi-layered arrangements, cinematic dramatic, nostalgic eternal
```

---

## XIII. ESSENCE FORMULA

```
MEDIEVAL CHANT × 1980s SYNTHESIZERS × BOYS CHOIR × CATHEDRAL = LAIMIS
```
