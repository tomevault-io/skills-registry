# Security Vulnerability Scanner

Perform a comprehensive security assessment following the methodology a senior security engineer
would use during a manual code audit, augmented by automated pattern detection.

## Workflow Overview

1. **Reconnaissance** — understand the codebase (languages, frameworks, architecture, dependencies)
2. **Automated pattern scan** — run `scripts/pattern_scanner.py` against the target
3. **Manual deep-dive** — analyze critical areas the script cannot reliably assess
4. **OWASP Top 10 analysis** — systematic review; see `references/owasp-top10.md`
5. **Language-specific checks** — see `references/language-checks.md`
6. **Dependency audit** — inspect manifests for known-vulnerable packages
7. **Threat modeling** — consider attack surface specific to the application
8. **Severity classification** — assign CVSS-aligned severity per finding
9. **Report generation** — produce structured report; see `references/report-template.md`

---

## Step 1: Reconnaissance

Before scanning, characterize the target to scope the review.

Determine:
- Primary languages and frameworks (inspect file extensions, imports, config files)
- Application type (web app, API, CLI, library, mobile, IaC)
- Entry points (HTTP routes, CLI args, message queues, cron jobs)
- Data stores (databases, caches, file storage, cloud services)
- Authentication / authorization model in use
- Deployment target (cloud provider, container, serverless, on-prem)
- Dependency manifests (`package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `go.mod`, `pom.xml`, `Gemfile`, `Cargo.toml`, `*.csproj`, etc.)

Use `find`, `grep`, and directory listing to build this picture quickly.

---

## Step 2: Automated Pattern Scan

Run the bundled scanner against the target directory:

```bash
python3 /path/to/security-scan/scripts/pattern_scanner.py <TARGET_DIR> [--lang <LANG>] [--output json|text]
```

The script searches for high-signal vulnerability patterns (hardcoded secrets, injection sinks, dangerous function calls, insecure configurations) and outputs findings with file paths and line numbers. Use its output as the starting evidence base; every finding must be manually verified in Step 3.

If the script is unavailable or the target requires deeper analysis, use `grep -rn` with patterns from `references/language-checks.md`.

---

## Step 3: Manual Deep-Dive

Focus manual analysis on areas automated scanning cannot reliably assess:

**Authentication & session management** — verify password hashing (bcrypt/argon2/scrypt, not MD5/SHA1), session token entropy, cookie flags (Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite), token expiration, MFA implementation.

**Authorization & access control** — trace every privileged endpoint; confirm authorization checks are present and correct. Look for IDOR by checking whether object lookups are scoped to the authenticated user. Verify role-based checks are applied server-side, not just in the UI.

**Input validation & output encoding** — trace user-controlled data from entry point to sink. Confirm parameterized queries (not string concatenation) for SQL. Confirm context-appropriate output encoding for HTML, JavaScript, URL, and CSS contexts. Check file upload handling (type validation, storage location, filename sanitization).

**Cryptography** — verify use of vetted libraries (not hand-rolled crypto), strong algorithms (AES-256-GCM, RSA-2048+, ECDSA P-256+, SHA-256+), proper IV/nonce handling, secure key storage (not in source), and TLS 1.2+ enforcement.

**Error handling & logging** — ensure stack traces and internal details are not exposed to users. Verify security-relevant events are logged (auth failures, access denied, input validation failures) with sufficient context for forensics but without logging sensitive data (passwords, tokens, PII).

**Business logic** — review workflows for race conditions, TOCTOU bugs, price/quantity manipulation, privilege escalation through state manipulation, and abuse of multi-step processes.

## Step 4: OWASP Top 10 Analysis

Read `references/owasp-top10.md` for the detailed checklist organized by OWASP 2021 category (A01–A10). Systematically evaluate each category against the codebase. Record which categories have findings and which are not applicable.

---

## Step 5: Language-Specific Checks

Read `references/language-checks.md` and apply the section(s) matching the target's languages. These contain language-idiomatic vulnerability patterns and dangerous API usage.

---

## Step 6: Dependency Audit

Inspect each dependency manifest found in Step 1:

- Extract package names and pinned versions.
- For well-known vulnerable packages, flag them (e.g., `lodash` < 4.17.21, `log4j` < 2.17.1).
- Note unpinned or floating version ranges that could pull vulnerable versions.
- Flag dependencies with no recent maintenance (>2 years since last release) as elevated risk.
- If internet access is available, cross-reference against known CVE databases.

---

## Step 7: Threat Modeling (Lightweight)

Based on Steps 1–6, identify the top 3–5 attack scenarios most relevant to this application:

- What is the most valuable asset an attacker would target? (user data, credentials, financial transactions, admin access)
- What is the most exposed attack surface? (public API, file upload, authentication flow)
- What would a skilled attacker try first given the findings so far?

Summarize these scenarios in the report's Executive Summary.

---

## Step 8: Severity Classification

Assign each finding a severity using this CVSS-aligned rubric:

| Severity | CVSS Range | Criteria |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| **CRITICAL** | 9.0–10.0 | Remotely exploitable with no/low privilege required, leads to full system compromise, data breach, or RCE. Active exploits may exist. |
| **HIGH** | 7.0–8.9 | Exploitable with some prerequisites, significant impact on confidentiality, integrity, or availability. |
| **MEDIUM** | 4.0–6.9 | Requires specific conditions or chained exploitation, moderate impact. |
| **LOW** | 0.1–3.9 | Minimal impact, defense-in-depth improvement, best-practice deviation. |
| **INFORMATIONAL** | 0.0 | Observation or recommendation with no direct exploitability. |

Each finding must include: a unique ID, title, severity, OWASP category (A01–A10), CWE ID, affected file(s) and line(s), description, evidence (code snippet), attack scenario, remediation with secure code example, and references.

---

## Step 9: Report Generation

Read `references/report-template.md` for the full report structure. Generate the report as a Markdown file in `/mnt/user-data/outputs/`. The report must include:

1. Metadata (target, date, scope, assessor)
2. Executive summary (security posture, key risks, top recommended actions)
3. Findings summary table (severity counts, OWASP distribution)
4. Detailed findings (sorted CRITICAL → LOW)
5. Dependency vulnerability table
6. Remediation roadmap (immediate / short-term / medium-term / ongoing)
7. Methodology note

Ensure the report is self-contained: another engineer should be able to reproduce and verify each finding using only the report.

---

## Key Principles

- **Evidence-based** — every finding must reference specific file(s) and line(s) with a code snippet. Never report a vulnerability without evidence.
- **Verify before reporting** — the automated scanner produces candidates; manually confirm exploitability before including in the report.
- **No false positives in final report** — if uncertain, note it as "Potential" with the caveat and lower the severity.
- **Actionable remediation** — every finding must include a concrete fix with a secure code example, not just "fix this."
- **Scope honesty** — clearly state what was and was not reviewed. A static review cannot find all runtime issues; note this in the methodology section.
