# MD Document Improver

## Overview

The MD Document Improver skill systematically enhances technical markdown documentation through multi-perspective analysis and iterative improvement loops. It evaluates documents from technical accuracy, user experience, and educational effectiveness viewpoints, providing comprehensive quality assessment and actionable enhancement recommendations.

## Quick Start

### Basic Document Improvement
```bash
# Improve a markdown document with default settings
python md-doc-improver/scripts/improve_document.py README.md

# Custom settings
python md-doc-improver/scripts/improve_document.py docs/api.md \
  --max-iterations 3 \
  --threshold 0.85 \
  --output-dir ./reviews
```

### Document Validation
```bash
# Validate document quality
python md-doc-improver/scripts/document_validator.py README.md

# Export validation results
python md-doc-improver/scripts/document_validator.py README.md \
  --export-json validation_results.json \
  --severity error,warning
```

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Multi-Perspective Analysis System

The skill evaluates documents from three complementary perspectives:

#### Technical Reviewer (40% weight)
- **Accuracy**: Code syntax, technical claims, API references
- **Completeness**: Error handling, security considerations, performance
- **Best Practices**: Industry standards, framework conventions
- **Technical Depth**: Appropriate level of technical detail

#### UX Writer (30% weight)
- **Clarity**: Readability, language quality, unambiguous explanations
- **Information Architecture**: Logical flow, organization, navigation
- **User Focus**: Task-oriented content, practical examples
- **Visual Structure**: Formatting, consistency, scannability

#### Educational Designer (30% weight)
- **Learning Progression**: Concept building, simple to complex
- **Example Quality**: Diverse, practical, working examples
- **Knowledge Retention**: Reinforcement, practice opportunities
- **Accessibility**: Beginner-friendly, clear prerequisites

### 2. Purpose-Driven Improvement Framework

#### Document Purpose Analysis
- **Objective Identification**: What should users be able to do?
- **Target Audience Definition**: Who is this documentation for?
- **Success Criteria**: How do we know the documentation is effective?
- **Use Case Mapping**: What specific tasks and scenarios are covered?

#### Improvement Prioritization Matrix

| Priority Level | Impact | Effort | Focus Areas |
|---------------|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Critical** | High | Low | Missing required sections, code errors |
| **High** | High | Medium | Example quality, error coverage |
| **Medium** | Medium | Low | Structure improvements, language clarity |
| **Low** | Low | Any | Minor formatting, cosmetic improvements |

### 3. Iterative Self-Improvement Loop

#### Improvement Cycle Structure
```
Iteration N:
  1. Document Analysis → DocumentAnalysis
  2. Multi-Perspective Review → List[ReviewResult]
  3. Score Calculation → Overall Quality Score
  4. Improvement Planning → ImprovementPlan
  5. Plan Execution → Enhanced Document
  6. Convergence Check → Continue or Exit
```

#### Convergence Criteria
- **Quality Threshold**: Overall score ≥ 0.85 (default)
- **Diminishing Returns**: Improvement < 0.05 between iterations
- **Maximum Iterations**: 5 iterations (configurable)
- **User Satisfaction**: Manual acceptance at any point

## Usage Patterns

### Pattern 1: New Document Enhancement
**When to use**: Creating or significantly revising technical documentation

**Workflow**:
1. **Initial Assessment**: `document_validator.py` for baseline quality
2. **Improvement Loop**: `improve_document.py` for systematic enhancement
3. **Final Validation**: `document_validator.py` for quality verification
4. **Review Integration**: Incorporate human feedback and recommendations

**Example**:
```bash
# Step 1: Assess current quality
python md-doc-improver/scripts/document_validator.py new_api_docs.md

# Step 2: Run improvement process
python md-doc-improver/scripts/improve_document.py new_api_docs.md \
  --max-iterations 4 \
  --threshold 0.85

# Step 3: Final validation
python md-doc-improver/scripts/document_validator.py new_api_docs.md \
  --export-json final_validation.json
```

### Pattern 2: Quality Audit and Maintenance
**When to use**: Periodic quality checks for existing documentation

**Workflow**:
1. **Batch Validation**: Validate multiple documents
2. **Quality Dashboard**: Aggregate results and identify trends
3. **Targeted Improvements**: Focus on documents below quality thresholds
4. **Continuous Monitoring**: Set up periodic validation schedules

**Example**:
```bash
# Validate all documentation in a directory
for file in docs/*.md; do
  python md-doc-improver/scripts/document_validator.py "$file" \
    --export-json "validation_$(basename "$file" .md).json"
done

# Identify documents needing improvement
grep -l '"overall_score": [0-7]\.' validation_*.json
```

### Pattern 3: Integration with Development Workflow
**When to use**: Automated quality checks in CI/CD pipelines

**Workflow**:
1. **Pre-commit Validation**: Check documentation changes before commits
2. **PR Validation**: Validate documentation in pull requests
3. **Release Validation**: Ensure documentation meets quality standards
4. **Continuous Monitoring**: Track quality metrics over time

**Example** (CI/CD integration):
```yaml
# GitHub Actions example
- name: Validate Documentation Quality
  run: |
    python md-doc-improver/scripts/document_validator.py docs/*.md \
      --severity error,warning \
      --format json \
      --export-json validation_report.json

    # Fail build if quality is too low
    score=$(jq '.overall_score' validation_report.json)
    if (( $(echo "$score < 0.7" | bc -l) )); then
      echo "Documentation quality too low: $score"
      exit 1
    fi
```

## Quality Scoring System

### Overall Score Composition
```
Overall Score = (
  Accuracy × 0.30 +
  Completeness × 0.30 +
  Clarity × 0.25 +
  Usability × 0.15
)
```

### Score Interpretation
- **0.90-1.00**: Excellent - Production-ready, comprehensive documentation
- **0.80-0.89**: Good - High quality with minor improvements needed
- **0.70-0.79**: Fair - Functional but needs significant improvement
- **0.60-0.69**: Poor - Major issues affecting usability
- **0.00-0.59**: Very Poor - Incomplete or incorrect documentation

### Dimension Breakdown

#### Accuracy (30%)
- Code example correctness (40%)
- Technical information accuracy (25%)
- Error handling coverage (25%)
- Security and performance considerations (20%)

#### Completeness (30%)
- Required sections coverage (35%)
- Content depth and explanation quality (30%)
- User journey coverage (20%)
- Edge case and exception handling (15%)

#### Clarity (25%)
- Information architecture and flow (25%)
- Language quality and consistency (25%)
- Visual structure and formatting (25%)
- Navigation and accessibility (25%)

#### Usability (15%)
- Task completion guidance (30%)
- Example quality and variety (25%)
- Troubleshooting support (25%)
- Learning effectiveness (20%)

## Advanced Features

### Custom Quality Thresholds
```bash
# Production documentation (high standards)
python md-doc-improver/scripts/document_validator.py docs/api.md \
  --threshold 0.90

# Internal documentation (moderate standards)
python md-doc-improver/scripts/document_validator.py internal/guide.md \
  --threshold 0.75

# Draft documentation (minimum standards)
python md-doc-improver/scripts/document_validator.py draft/tutorial.md \
  --threshold 0.60
```

### Document Type Customization
The skill automatically adapts its evaluation criteria based on document content:

#### API Documentation Focus
```python
api_weights = {
    'technical': 0.6,    # Higher emphasis on accuracy
    'ux': 0.2,          # Lower emphasis on educational aspects
    'educational': 0.2  # Lower emphasis on learning progression
}
```

#### Tutorial Documentation Focus
```python
tutorial_weights = {
    'technical': 0.2,    # Lower emphasis on deep technical accuracy
    'ux': 0.3,          # Higher emphasis on user experience
    'educational': 0.5  # Highest emphasis on learning effectiveness
}
```

### Export and Integration
```bash
# Export detailed analysis for custom processing
python md-doc-improver/scripts/improve_document.py README.md \
  --export-json improvement_analysis.json

# Integration with external tools
python md-doc-improver/scripts/document_validator.py README.md \
  --format json | jq '.issues[] | select(.severity == "error")'
```
