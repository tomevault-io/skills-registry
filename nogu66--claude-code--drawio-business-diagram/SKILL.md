# Draw.io Business Process Diagram Creator

Generate professional business process diagrams in a consistent corporate design style using the draw.io MCP integration.

## Design Style

**Color Palette:**
- Process boxes: Dark navy `#1B365C`, stroke `#0D1B2A`, white text
- Document/data shapes: Sky blue `#4A90D9`, stroke `#2E6DA4`, white text
- Swim lane background: Light lavender `#D6E4F0`, stroke `#9BB8D3`
- Swim lane header text: Dark navy `#1B365C`, bold
- Arrows: Black `#000000`, orthogonal routing, block end arrows
- Decision diamonds: Sky blue `#4A90D9`, white text

**Shape Mapping:**
- Process / task / activity → Rounded rectangle (dark navy)
- Document / report / invoice / form / notification → Document shape with wave bottom (sky blue)
- Decision / condition → Diamond (sky blue)
- Data / database → Cylinder (sky blue)
- Start / End → Stadium shape (dark navy)

## Workflow

1. Understand the business process: roles, steps, documents, decisions
2. Identify swim lanes (one per role/department)
3. Map each process step to the correct shape using the shape mapping above
4. Generate draw.io XML following the style definitions in [references/style-guide.md](references/style-guide.md)
5. Render using `mcp__drawio__open_drawio_xml` with the generated XML

## Rendering

Always render the final diagram using the draw.io MCP tool:

```
mcp__drawio__open_drawio_xml(content=<generated_xml>)
```

## Layout Guidelines

- Swim lanes: vertical columns, left-to-right (one per role/department)
- Process flow: top-to-bottom within each lane
- Cross-lane connections: horizontal arrows
- Spacing: ~40px between shapes vertically, lanes 180-220px wide
- Align related processes at the same vertical level across lanes
- Text: concise, 2-4 words per line, max 3 lines per shape
- All text centered within shapes, white color, bold
