# Issue Creation Workflow

Create a GitHub Issue with appropriate labels.

## Usage

```text
/issue-create owner/repo
/issue-create owner/repo --from-plan
```

## Arguments

- **Repository** (required): Target repository in `owner/repo` format
- **--from-plan** (optional): Include current plan file content in issue body

ARGUMENTS: Repository name and options passed from skill invocation

## Workflow

1. Parse repository from ARGUMENTS
2. Check if `--from-plan` flag is present
3. Gather issue details from user input
4. If unclear, ask for clarification (title, description, category)
5. Present label options and let user select
6. Fetch issue template from repository based on label (see Template Mapping)
7. Create issue body following template structure and language
8. If `--from-plan`: Append plan content to issue body (see From Plan section)
9. Create issue via `gh issue create`
10. Report created issue URL

## From Plan Option

When `--from-plan` is specified:

1. Read current plan file from `~/.claude/plans/` directory
2. Append plan content to issue body under "## Investigation Results" section
3. This enables seamless handoff to `issue-driven-dev`

**Plan file location**:

```bash
{base_dir}/scripts/get-plan-path.sh
```

Or check system message for active plan file path.

**Issue body structure with --from-plan**:

```markdown
[Template-based content]

## Investigation Results

[Full plan content from plan file]
```

## Label Selection

Fetch available labels from target repository:

```bash
{base_dir}/scripts/get-labels.sh {owner}/{repo}
```

Select appropriate label(s) from the fetched list.

Common labels (may vary by repository):

- `bug` - Something isn't working
- `enhancement` - New feature or improvement
- `documentation` - Documentation changes
- `question` - Questions or investigations
- `security` - Security vulnerability fix
- `dependencies` - Dependency updates
- `meta` - Development process improvements

## Template Mapping

Auto-select template based on primary label:

| Label           | Template file |
| --------------- | ------------- |
| `bug`           | `bug.md`      |
| `enhancement`   | `feature.md`  |
| `documentation` | `feature.md`  |
| `question`      | `idea.md`     |
| (other/none)    | `idea.md`     |

## Fetching Template

Fetch template and detect its language:

```bash
{base_dir}/scripts/get-template.sh {owner} {repo} {template}.md
```

Output includes detected language (LANG: ja/en).
Write issue title and body in the detected language.

## Issue Creation Command

```bash
gh issue create -R {owner}/{repo} \
  --title "Issue title" \
  --body "Issue body following template structure" \
  --label "enhancement"
```

## Language

**Match the template's language**: Write issue title and body in the same
language as the repository's issue template.

- Fetch the template first to determine its language
- If template is in Japanese → Write issue in Japanese
- If template is in English → Write issue in English

## Handoff to issue-driven-dev

After creating an issue with `--from-plan`, suggest:

```text
Issue created. To implement this issue:
/issue-driven-dev {created_issue_url}
```

## Notes

- Keep it simple: This is for quick TODO registration
- Detailed planning happens in `issue-driven-dev` skill
- Fetch and follow repository's issue template structure and language
- `--from-plan` bridges investigation work to formal issue tracking
