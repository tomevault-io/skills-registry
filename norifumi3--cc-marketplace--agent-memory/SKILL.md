# Agent Memory

A persistent memory space for storing knowledge that survives across conversations.

Start by saying "Trigger Agent Memory".

**Location:** `{project_root}/.claude/skills/agent-memory/memories/` (project-local only)

**⚠️ All memory operations are scoped to the current project only.** No fallback locations. Memories are always read from and written to the project-local path.

## Tracking ID

Every memory must be assigned a unique tracking ID.

### ID Format

`AM-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`

- `AM` = Agent Memory prefix
- `YYYYMMDD` = creation date
- `HHMMSS` = 24時間制の時刻

Examples: `AM-20260204-143052`, `AM-20260204-153210`

### Assignment Procedure

#### 統合ヘルパースクリプト（Windows PowerShell）

```powershell
# tracking ID生成のみ
pwsh "$HOME/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/cc-marketplace/plugins/agent-memory/skills/agent-memory/scripts/agent-memory-helper.ps1" -Action generate-id

# ディレクトリ作成のみ
pwsh "$HOME/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/cc-marketplace/plugins/agent-memory/skills/agent-memory/scripts/agent-memory-helper.ps1" -Action ensure-dir -Path ".claude\skills\agent-memory\memories\category-name"

# ディレクトリ作成 + tracking ID生成を1回で（推奨）
pwsh "$HOME/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/cc-marketplace/plugins/agent-memory/skills/agent-memory/scripts/agent-memory-helper.ps1" -Action save-prepare -Path ".claude\skills\agent-memory\memories\category-name"
```

#### 実行例
```
PS> pwsh agent-memory-helper.ps1 -Action save-prepare -Path ".claude\skills\agent-memory\memories\new-category"
Created: .claude\skills\agent-memory\memories\new-category
Assigned: AM-20260206-143052
```

### ⚠️ Mandatory Rule: Tracking ID Notification

**After saving a memory, you MUST notify the user of the tracking ID. No exceptions.**

Notification example:
> ✅ Memory saved: `AM-20260204-143052`
> To reference this in another session, say "Read AM-20260204-143052".

Never skip this notification. Without the ID, the user cannot reference the memory from another session.

## Proactive Usage

Save memories when you discover something worth preserving:
- Research findings that took effort to uncover
- Non-obvious patterns or gotchas in the codebase
- Solutions to tricky problems
- Architectural decisions and their rationale
- In-progress work that may be resumed later
- Task lists created with taskcreate during interruption, so they can be resumed

Check memories when starting related work:
- **MANDATORY at session start**: Complete status verification before any work proposals
- **MANDATORY for "前回の作業"**: Full memory scan including completed/in-progress/pending status
- Before investigating a problem area
- When working on a feature you've touched before
- When resuming work after a conversation break

## Critical Session Start Protocol

When user asks about previous work or status ("前回の作業", "思い出して", "続き", "再開"):

### Phase 1: Complete Memory Scan (MANDATORY)
```powershell
# Get all memory files chronologically
Get-ChildItem '.claude\skills\agent-memory\memories\' -Recurse -File | Sort-Object LastWriteTime -Descending

# Check completion status
rg "status: completed" .claude/skills/agent-memory/memories/ --no-ignore --hidden -A 2 -B 2
rg "status: in-progress" .claude/skills/agent-memory/memories/ --no-ignore --hidden -A 2 -B 2
```

### Phase 2: Status Verification (MANDATORY)
- Read latest tracking IDs to understand current state
- Cross-reference with user statements
- **Never propose completed work as todo**
- Ask for clarification if any discrepancy exists

### Phase 3: Accurate Reporting (MANDATORY)
- Present completed/in-progress/pending classification clearly
- Provide evidence from memory records
- Only propose next logical steps after verification

Organize memories when needed:
- Consolidate scattered memories on the same topic
- Remove outdated or superseded information
- Update status field when work completes, gets blocked, or is abandoned

## Folder Structure

When possible, organize memories into category folders. No predefined structure – create categories that make sense for the content.

Guidelines:
- Use kebab-case for folder and file names
- Consolidate or reorganize as the knowledge base evolves

Example:
```text
memories/
├── file-processing/
│   └── large-file-memory-issue.md
├── dependencies/
│   └── iconv-esm-problem.md
└── project-context/
    └── december-2025-work.md
```

This is just an example. Structure freely based on actual content.

## Frontmatter

All memories must include frontmatter with `tracking_id` and `summary` fields. The summary should be concise enough to determine whether to read the full content.

**Required:**
```yaml
---
tracking_id: AM-20260204-143052
summary: "1-2 line description of what this memory contains"
created: 2026-02-04
---
```

**Optional:**
```yaml
---
tracking_id: AM-20260204-143052
summary: "Worker thread memory leak during large file processing - cause and solution"
created: 2026-02-04
updated: 2026-02-05
status: in-progress  # in-progress | resolved | blocked | abandoned
tags: [performance, worker, memory-leak]
related: [src/core/file/fileProcessor.ts]
related_ids: [AM-20260203-002]
---
```

## Search Workflow

### Search by Tracking ID (cross-session reference)

```bash
MEMORY_DIR=".claude/skills/agent-memory/memories"

# Find file by exact tracking ID
rg "^tracking_id: AM-20260204-143052" "$MEMORY_DIR" \
  --no-ignore --hidden -l 2>/dev/null

# Fuzzy search with partial ID (time omitted)
rg "^tracking_id: AM-20260204-" "$MEMORY_DIR" --no-ignore --hidden -l 2>/dev/null

# List all IDs created today
rg "^tracking_id: AM-$(date +%Y%m%d)" "$MEMORY_DIR" --no-ignore --hidden 2>/dev/null
```

### Summary-first Approach

```bash
MEMORY_DIR=".claude/skills/agent-memory/memories"

# 1. List categories
ls "$MEMORY_DIR" 2>/dev/null

# 2. View all summaries
rg "^summary:" "$MEMORY_DIR" --no-ignore --hidden 2>/dev/null

# 3. Search summaries for keyword
rg "^summary:.*keyword" "$MEMORY_DIR" --no-ignore --hidden -i 2>/dev/null

# 4. Search by tag
rg "^tags:.*keyword" "$MEMORY_DIR" --no-ignore --hidden -i 2>/dev/null

# 5. Search by related tracking IDs
rg "^related_ids:.*AM-20260204-143052" "$MEMORY_DIR" --no-ignore --hidden 2>/dev/null

# 6. Full-text search (when summary search isn't enough)
rg "keyword" "$MEMORY_DIR" --no-ignore --hidden -i 2>/dev/null

# 7. Read specific memory file if relevant
```

**Note:** Memory files are gitignored, so use `--no-ignore` and `--hidden` flags with ripgrep.

## Operations

### Save

1. Determine appropriate category for the content
2. Check if existing category fits, or create new one
3. **Run the tracking ID assignment script to get a unique ID**
4. Write file with required frontmatter (use `date +%Y-%m-%d` for current date)
5. **⚠️ Notify the user of the tracking ID – this step is mandatory**

```bash
MEMORY_DIR=".claude/skills/agent-memory/memories"
mkdir -p "$MEMORY_DIR/category-name/"

# Note: Check if file exists before writing to avoid accidental overwrites
cat > "$MEMORY_DIR/category-name/filename.md" << 'EOF'
---
tracking_id: AM-20260204-143052
summary: "Brief description of this memory"
created: 2026-02-04
---

# Title

Content here...
EOF

# ⚠️ After this, you MUST notify the user of the tracking ID
```

### Recall (cross-session retrieval)

When the user says something like "Read AM-XXXXXXXX-HHMMSS":

1. Search for the file by tracking ID
2. Read the file contents
3. Summarize or present the full content to the user

```bash
MEMORY_DIR=".claude/skills/agent-memory/memories"

# 1. Locate the file
file=$(rg "^tracking_id: AM-20260204-143052" "$MEMORY_DIR" \
  --no-ignore --hidden -l)

# 2. Read it
cat "$file"
```

### Maintain

- **Update**: When information changes, update the content and add `updated` field to frontmatter
- **Delete**: Remove memories that are no longer relevant
```bash
MEMORY_DIR=".claude/skills/agent-memory/memories"
trash "$MEMORY_DIR/category-name/filename.md"

# Remove empty category folders
rmdir "$MEMORY_DIR/category-name/" 2>/dev/null || true
```
- **Consolidate**: Merge related memories when they grow
- **Reorganize**: Move memories to better-fitting categories as the knowledge base evolves

## Guidelines

1. **Write self-contained notes**: Include full context so the reader needs no prior knowledge to understand and act on the content
2. **Keep summaries decisive**: Reading the summary should tell you if you need the details
3. **Stay current**: Update or delete outdated information
4. **Be practical**: Save what's actually useful, not everything
5. **⚠️ Always notify tracking ID**: Never skip the tracking ID notification after saving a memory

## Critical Error Prevention

**Based on Lesson AM-20260216-001**: Session Start Status Check Failure

### Common Failure Patterns to Avoid:
1. **Partial memory check**: Only reading latest plan without checking completion status
2. **Filename negligence**: Ignoring obvious completion indicators in file names
3. **User statement assumption**: Not clarifying ambiguous statements like "ある程度進めていた"
4. **Proposal without verification**: Suggesting work that may already be completed

### Mandatory Verification Rules:
- **Never propose work without complete status verification**
- **Always cross-reference memory records with user statements**
- **When in doubt, ask explicit clarification questions**
- **Use status fields (completed/in-progress/pending) as authoritative source**

### Error Recovery:
If incorrect proposal is made:
1. Acknowledge the oversight immediately
2. Perform complete memory verification
3. Document the failure pattern for future prevention
4. Apply lessons learned to skill improvement

## Content Reference

When writing detailed memories, consider including:
- **Goal**: What we're trying to achieve (purpose, background, constraints)
- **Done**: Completed work
- **Decisions**: What was decided and why (rationale)
- **Evidence**: Test results, commands run, logs captured, code snippets
- **Failed attempts**: What didn't work and why (critical for avoiding repeated mistakes)
- **Open questions**: Unresolved issues, pending decisions
- **Next actions**: Concrete next 1-5 steps
- **Learned**: Patterns to apply in future work (rule candidates)
- **Interruption points**: When pausing ongoing work, document:
  - Current ToDo list with completion status (use checkboxes: `- [ ]` incomplete, `- [x]` complete)
  - What was being worked on when stopped
  - Any blockers or pending decisions

Not all memories need all sections – use what's relevant.
