Help the user categorize and organize their bank transactions.

## First: determine account type

Call `get_company_details` and check `isSme`:
- **Freelance** (`isSme: false`): Use `categorize_transaction` — AI detects the freelance category automatically.
- **SME / GmbH / UG** (`isSme: true`): Use `list_company_categories` to find DATEV categories by code. If the right category isn't provisioned, use `search_skr_by_code` or `suggest_skr_category` to search the full SKR catalog, then `create_company_category` to add it.

## Workflow

1. **Fetch uncategorized transactions**: Call `search_transactions` to find transactions that need attention. Look for unverified or uncategorized entries.

2. **Smart categorization**: For each transaction, suggest a category based on:
   - The transaction description / reference text
   - The counterparty name
   - The amount and pattern (recurring = likely subscription)
   - Similar past transactions

3. **Assign the category**:
   - **Freelance**: Use `categorize_transaction` with the transaction details — it returns the AI-suggested freelance category.
   - **SME**: Use `update_transaction` with `company_category_id` to assign a DATEV category. If the needed category isn't in `list_company_categories`, search the full SKR03/SKR04 catalog with `search_skr_by_code` (by number) or `suggest_skr_category` (by description, uses AI). Then `create_company_category` to add it.

4. **Invoice matching**: When a transaction looks like an incoming payment:
   - Call `list_invoices` to find matching unpaid invoices (by amount or client)
   - Use `link_transaction` to connect the payment to the invoice

5. **Document attachment**: Remind the user to attach receipts for expenses:
   - Use `upload_bulk_attachments` for multiple receipts
   - Use `link_attachment_transaction` to connect receipts to transactions

6. **Verification**: After categorizing, use `change_transaction_verification` to mark transactions as verified.

Present transactions in batches of 10-15 for manageable review. Show: Date, Amount, Description, Suggested Category.
