# Kubernetes Security Skill

Harden Kubernetes clusters and workloads through RBAC, pod security, network isolation, secret management, and supply chain controls.

## Reference Loading Table

| Signal | Reference | Size |
|--------|-----------|------|
| RBAC, Role, RoleBinding, ClusterRole, ServiceAccount, least-privilege, access control, permissions | `references/rbac-patterns.md` | ~60 lines |
| PodSecurity, SecurityContext, runAsNonRoot, readOnlyRootFilesystem, restricted, baseline, image hardening, distroless, Dockerfile | `references/pod-security.md` | ~90 lines |
| NetworkPolicy, default-deny, allow-list, egress, ingress, DNS, lateral movement, namespace isolation | `references/network-policies.md` | ~70 lines |
| cosign, Kyverno, OPA, admission controller, Sealed Secrets, External Secrets, supply chain, misconfiguration, privileged | `references/supply-chain.md` | ~120 lines |

**Load greedily.** If the user's question touches any signal keyword, load the matching reference before responding. Multiple signals matching = load all matching references.

---

## Phase 1: IDENTIFY

Determine which security domain the user is asking about.

| Domain | Reference |
|--------|-----------|
| Access control, permissions, roles | `references/rbac-patterns.md` |
| Pod hardening, container security | `references/pod-security.md` |
| Network isolation, traffic rules | `references/network-policies.md` |
| Image signing, secrets, admission control | `references/supply-chain.md` |

If the question spans multiple domains, load all relevant references. Most production hardening tasks touch at least RBAC + pod security.

**Gate**: Domain identified. Reference(s) loaded. Proceed to Phase 2.

---

## Phase 2: RESPOND

Use loaded reference knowledge to answer with concrete YAML manifests and specific configurations. The references contain complete, copy-paste-ready examples for each security domain.

For general Kubernetes debugging, pair with the `kubernetes-debugging` skill.

**Gate**: Question answered with reference-backed manifests, not generic advice.

---

## Phase 3: VERIFY

Validate the security posture against the misconfiguration table in `references/supply-chain.md`. Flag any of the 8 common misconfigurations if present in the user's manifests.
