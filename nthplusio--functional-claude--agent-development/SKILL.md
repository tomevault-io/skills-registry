# Agent Development

Guide for creating specialized subagents with AGENT.md files.

## Agent Structure

```
agents/
└── agent-name.md       # Flat file (not subdirectory)
```

## AGENT.md Format

```yaml
---
name: my-agent
description: |
  When Claude should delegate to this agent. Include trigger phrases
  and example blocks for reliable invocation.

  <example>
  Context: Describe the situation
  user: "Example request"
  assistant: "I'll use the my-agent agent to handle this."
  <commentary>
  Why this triggers the agent.
  </commentary>
  </example>
tools:
  - Read
  - Grep
  - Glob
model: sonnet
color: cyan
---

System prompt for the agent goes here in markdown.
```

## Frontmatter Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | Yes | Unique identifier (kebab-case) |
| `description` | Yes | When to delegate + trigger phrases |
| `tools` | No | Tools agent can use (inherits if omitted) |
| `disallowedTools` | No | Tools to explicitly deny |
| `model` | No | sonnet, opus, haiku, or inherit |
| `color` | No | Visual identifier (cyan, magenta, green, etc.) |
| `permissionMode` | No | default, plan, dontAsk, bypassPermissions |
| `skills` | No | Skills to preload into context |
| `hooks` | No | Agent-specific hooks |

## Example Blocks (Critical)

`<example>` blocks in descriptions are essential for reliable triggering:

```yaml
description: |
  Database migration reviewer. Use when checking migration safety.

  <example>
  Context: User about to run a migration
  user: "Can you check this migration?"
  assistant: "I'll use the migration-reviewer agent."
  <commentary>
  Migration safety check requested.
  </commentary>
  </example>
```

## Proactive Triggering

Include "use proactively" for automatic delegation:

```yaml
description: Expert test runner. Use proactively after code changes.
```

## Model Selection

| Model | Use Case |
|-------|----------|
| `haiku` | Fast tasks (exploration, validation) |
| `sonnet` | Balanced (most tasks) |
| `opus` | Complex reasoning |
| `inherit` | Use parent's model |

## AI-Assisted Creation

Use the `agent-creator` agent for interactive design:

```
Help me create an agent for [purpose]
```

## Quality Review

After creating an agent, use the `skill-reviewer` agent to check description quality, tool appropriateness, and system prompt clarity.
