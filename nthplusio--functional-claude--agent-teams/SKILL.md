# Agent Teams for Application Development

Agent teams let you coordinate multiple Claude Code sessions working together on complex tasks. One session acts as the **team lead** coordinating work, while **teammates** work independently in their own context windows and communicate directly with each other.

## When to Use Agent Teams

Agent teams are most effective when parallel exploration adds real value:

| Use Case | Why Teams Excel |
|----------|----------------|
| **Research & Discovery** | Multiple teammates investigate different aspects simultaneously |
| **Feature Development** | Teammates each own a separate module without stepping on each other |
| **Code Review & QA** | Reviewers apply different lenses (security, performance, tests) in parallel |
| **Debugging** | Teammates test competing hypotheses and challenge each other's findings |
| **Frontend Design** | Product, design, development, and accessibility perspectives in creative tension |
| **Planning & Roadmapping** | Strategic, dependency, outcomes, and stakeholder perspectives funnel into actionable phase briefs |
| **Productivity Systems** | Sequential persona pipeline discovers, designs, reviews, refines, and compounds workflow improvements |
| **Brainstorming & Ideation** | Structured divergence/convergence with independent brainwriting, user feedback gate, and idea refinement |
| **Cross-Layer Coordination** | Frontend, backend, and test changes each owned by a different teammate |

### Agent Teams vs Subagents

| Aspect | Subagents | Agent Teams |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **Context** | Own window; results return to caller | Own window; fully independent |
| **Communication** | Report back to main agent only | Teammates message each other directly |
| **Coordination** | Main agent manages all work | Shared task list with self-coordination |
| **Best for** | Focused tasks where only the result matters | Complex work requiring discussion and collaboration |
| **Token cost** | Lower (results summarized back) | Higher (each teammate is a separate instance) |

**Rule of thumb:** Use subagents for quick, focused workers. Use agent teams when teammates need to share findings, challenge each other, and coordinate independently.

### When NOT to Use Teams

Teams add ~40 coordination tool calls of overhead per team created (TaskCreate + TaskUpdate + SendMessage). Skip teams and use plan-then-implement when:
- Fewer than 3 genuinely parallel workstreams
- A single agent can hold all necessary context
- The task is primarily sequential
- Total expected work is under ~30 minutes

### Team Sizing Guidelines

| Constraint | Guideline |
|------------|-----------|
| Teams per session | Max 2 (sessions with 7+ teams spent ~50% of turns on coordination) |
| Tasks per team | Cap at 8 (beyond this, TaskUpdate churn dominates) |
| Agents per team | 3-4 preferred (lead + 2-3 specialists) |
| Messages | Batch instructions into one SendMessage per teammate |

## Prerequisites

Agent teams are experimental and must be enabled:

```json
// settings.json
{
  "env": {
    "CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS": "1"
  }
}
```

## Quick Start

Tell Claude to create a team using natural language:

```
Create an agent team with 3 teammates to [describe your task].
Have one teammate focus on [aspect 1], one on [aspect 2], and one on [aspect 3].
```

Claude creates the team, spawns teammates, assigns tasks, and coordinates work based on your prompt.

## Available Skills

| Skill | Purpose | Example Triggers |
|-------|---------|-----------------|
| **team-blueprints** | Pre-designed team configurations for 8 development phases | "research team", "feature team", "review team", "debug team", "design team", "planning team", "productivity team", "brainstorming team" |
| **team-coordination** | Task management, messaging, plan approval, shutdown | "manage tasks", "team communication", "delegate mode" |
| **team-personas** | Reusable behavioral profiles with deep methodology and scoring | "personas", "behavioral profiles", "productivity loop", "auditor persona" |

## Available Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/agent-teams` | Plugin overview and quickstart |
| `/spawn-build` | Spawn a feature development or debugging team (modes: feature, debug) |
| `/spawn-think` | Spawn a research, planning, or review team (modes: research, planning, review) |
| `/spawn-create` | Spawn a design, brainstorming, or productivity team (modes: design, brainstorm, productivity) |

## Team Architecture

An agent team consists of:

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| **Team Lead** | The main Claude Code session that creates the team, spawns teammates, and coordinates |
| **Teammates** | Separate Claude Code instances that each work on assigned tasks |
| **Task List** | Shared list of work items that teammates claim and complete |
| **Mailbox** | Messaging system for direct communication between agents |

Teams and tasks are stored locally:
- Team config: `~/.claude/teams/{team-name}/config.json`
- Task list: `~/.claude/tasks/{team-name}/`

## Best Practices

1. **Give teammates enough context** — They load CLAUDE.md but don't inherit the lead's conversation history. Include task-specific details in spawn prompts.
2. **Size tasks appropriately** — Not too small (coordination overhead), not too large (long without check-ins). Self-contained units with clear deliverables.
3. **Avoid file conflicts** — Break work so each teammate owns different files.
4. **Monitor and steer** — Check progress, redirect approaches, synthesize findings.
5. **Start with research** — If new to teams, start with review/research tasks before parallel implementation.
