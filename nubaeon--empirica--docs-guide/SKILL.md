# Interactive Documentation Guide

## Overview

This skill helps users explore project documentation interactively. It retrieves relevant documentation sections and guides users through understanding them, with follow-up suggestions.

## When to Use

- User asks "how do I...?" or "what is...?"
- User wants to understand a feature, API, or concept
- User is exploring the codebase and needs guidance
- User asks about configuration, installation, or usage

## Workflow

### 1. Understand the Query

First, identify:
- **Topic**: General subject area (auth, api, config, install, etc.)
- **Question**: Specific question if provided
- **Audience**: developer, user, or ai-agent context

### 2. Retrieve Documentation

For Empirica project:
```bash
empirica docs-explain --topic "<topic>" --output json
# or
empirica docs-explain --question "<question>" --output json
```

For external projects (using docpistemic):
```bash
python -m docpistemic.cli explain /path/to/project --topic "<topic>" --output json
```

### 3. Present Results Interactively

After retrieving docs, guide the user:

1. **Summarize** - Brief overview of what was found
2. **Key Points** - Extract the most relevant 2-3 points
3. **Code Examples** - Show relevant code snippets if available
4. **Related Topics** - Suggest follow-up areas to explore
5. **Ask** - Check if they want more detail on any aspect

### 4. Follow-up Guidance

Based on the retrieved `related_topics`, offer to:
- Dive deeper into a specific section
- Show related commands or APIs
- Explain concepts mentioned in the docs
- Find code examples in the actual codebase

## Example Interaction

User: "How do sessions work in Empirica?"

Response pattern:
1. Run: `empirica docs-explain --topic "sessions" --output json`
2. Present: "Sessions in Empirica track AI agent work context..."
3. Key points from docs
4. Relevant CLI commands mentioned
5. "Would you like me to explain session-create, or show how sessions relate to goals?"

## Topic Aliases

Common topics map to multiple keywords:
- **auth** → authentication, login, oauth, jwt, token
- **api** → endpoints, routes, rest, graphql
- **config** → configuration, settings, environment
- **install** → installation, setup, quickstart
- **test** → testing, pytest, coverage
- **session** → sessions, context, bootstrap

## Interactive Patterns

### For "How do I...?" questions
1. Search for the action/verb in question
2. Find relevant command or API
3. Show usage example
4. Offer to show more examples or related commands

### For "What is...?" questions
1. Search for concept definition
2. Explain in context of the project
3. Show where it's used
4. Suggest related concepts

### For troubleshooting
1. Search for error or symptom
2. Find relevant documentation
3. Suggest diagnostic commands
4. Offer to search codebase if docs don't help

## Output Format

When presenting results, use clear structure:

```
## [Topic/Question]

**Summary:** Brief overview of what was found

**Key Points:**
- Point 1 with source reference
- Point 2 with source reference

**Relevant Commands:**
- `command` - description

**See Also:** [related topics]

**Want to explore:** [specific follow-ups]?
```

## Notes

- Always cite source files from the docs
- If docs are sparse, offer to search codebase directly
- Suggest running commands with `--help` for detailed usage
- For complex topics, break into multiple exchanges
