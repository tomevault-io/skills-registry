# Analyze

## Overview

The analysis skill provides two modes for generating PM insights from structured sources:

| Mode | Purpose | Output |
|------|---------|--------|
| `--data` | Python-based analysis of CSV/Excel files (retention, funnel, segmentation) | `outputs/insights/data-analysis-YYYY-MM-DD.md` |
| `--kb` | Knowledge Base gap analysis (pain points, missing articles, AI opportunities) | `outputs/insights/kb-gaps-YYYY-MM-DD.md` |

## When to Use

### --data Mode
- User provides CSV, Excel, or structured data files
- User asks for "analysis", "insights", "metrics", "trends", or "charts"
- Data exists in `inputs/data/` folder
- User wants to understand product performance

### --kb Mode
- Have KB article exports to analyze
- Want to understand what users struggle with most
- Exploring AI assistant opportunities
- Planning documentation improvements

---

## Mode: --data

### Process

**Step 1: Choose Analysis Method**

Your goal is to provide the most accurate analysis. Autonomously select the best method based on the data and the user's query.

1.  **Examine the data source and the user's query.**
2.  **If** the data is simple (e.g., < 500 rows, clear headers) and the query is a straightforward aggregation (counting, sorting, grouping), you may perform the analysis **directly via LLM calculation**.
3.  **Else** (i.e., the analysis requires complex calculations, statistics, visualizations, or the data is large/complex), you **must** generate and execute a **Python script** to ensure accuracy.
4.  **When in doubt, default to using a Python script.**
5.  Announce which method you are choosing and why before proceeding with the analysis.

**Step 2: Execute Analysis**

---
***IF `Direct LLM Calculation` was chosen:***

1.  Read the content of the data file.
2.  Perform the requested calculations directly.
3.  Proceed to **Step 3**, ensuring all findings and claims are based on your direct calculations.

---
***IF `Python Script Execution` was chosen:***

1.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Write and execute a Python script to get basic info.
    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    # Load data, print shape, dtypes, head, describe, isnull, etc.
    ```
2.  **Data Dictionary:** Create a markdown table for the data dictionary. Ask the user to clarify any unknown column meanings before proceeding.
3.  **Analysis Plan:** Propose an analysis plan to the user.
4.  **Execution & Visualization:** Upon approval, write and execute the Python script to perform the analysis and generate any required visualizations (e.g., charts saved to `outputs/insights/`).
5.  Proceed to **Step 3**, ensuring all findings and claims are based on the Python script's output.

---

**Step 3: Generate Output**

Write to `outputs/insights/data-analysis-YYYY-MM-DD.md`. The output must be structured as follows and must include the `analysis_method` field in the YAML frontmatter.

```markdown
---
generated: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
skill: analyze --data
analysis_method: "Direct LLM Calculation" # or "Python Script Execution"
sources:
  - inputs/data/filename.csv (modified: YYYY-MM-DD)
downstream: []

```

---

## Mode: --kb

### Process

**Step 1: Gather Sources**

Read files in:
- `inputs/knowledge_base/` - KB article exports
- `outputs/insights/voc-synthesis-*.md` - VOC insights (if available, for correlation)

**Step 2: Analyze Article Coverage**

For each KB article (or category), note:
- Topic / Category
- Article count
- Last updated date
- Estimated complexity (simple how-to vs. complex troubleshooting)

**Step 3: Identify Gaps**

Look for:
1. **High-volume topics** - Many articles = users struggle here
2. **Outdated articles** - Not updated in 6+ months
3. **Missing topics** - VOC mentions issues with no KB coverage
4. **Complex troubleshooting** - Multi-step processes that could be simplified

**Step 4: Assess AI Opportunities**

For each gap, evaluate:

| Opportunity Type | Criteria | Risk Level |
|------------------|----------|------------|
| Better search/IA | Hard to find articles | Low |
| Guided resolution | Multi-step process | Low-Medium |
| AI-assisted | Can be automated with citations | Medium |
| **DO NOT automate** | Compliance, billing, trust-sensitive | High |

**Step 5: Generate Output**

Write to `outputs/insights/kb-gaps-YYYY-MM-DD.md`:

```markdown
---
generated: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
skill: analyze --kb
sources:
  - inputs/knowledge_base/*.md
  - outputs/insights/voc-synthesis-*.md (if used)
downstream:
  - outputs/roadmap/Qx-YYYY-charters.md

## Common Mistakes

### --data Mode
- **Assuming column meanings:** "user_id probably means..." -> Ask user to confirm
- **Stating implications as facts:** "Users are churning because..." -> Label as hypothesis
- **Using sample data for conclusions:** "Based on 10 rows..." -> Ensure representative data
- **Ignoring missing data:** 50% nulls in key column -> Report this prominently
- **No data dictionary:** Jumping to analysis -> Always document columns first

### --kb Mode
- **Counting wrong:** "Many articles" -> Exact count: "47 articles"
- **Missing VOC correlation:** KB analysis in isolation -> Cross-reference with VOC
- **Underestimating risk:** "AI can handle billing" -> Compliance topics need humans
- **No priorities:** "Everything is a gap" -> Rank by impact
- **Stale analysis:** Using old VOC -> Check VOC synthesis date
