# Documentation Conventions

## Keep docs/index.md Up to Date

When a new markdown doc is added under `docs/**/*.md` or a markdown file is renamed, ensure that @docs/index.md is updated and the document appears in the most appropriate section.

## Docstring Format

Use [Google style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) docstrings for classes and functions. These are parseable by Sphinx.

For interfaces that may be used outside a file, prefer docstrings over comments. Comments should be reserved for code within a function or interfaces local to a file.

## Document New Features

When a new feature is added, update or create documentation in the `docs/` directory that most closely matches the feature. Look at existing docs to find the best fit — if none exists, create a new doc and add it to @docs/index.md.

Documentation changes are **not required** for bug fixes or CI-related changes.
