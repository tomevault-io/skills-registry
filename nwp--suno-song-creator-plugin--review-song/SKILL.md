```bash
/review-song path/to/prompt.md
```

The skill will:
1. Read the file automatically
2. Extract prompt sections and lyrics
3. Launch quality-reviewer sub-agent
4. Present structured feedback

### Mode 2: Review Direct Text

When pasting prompt + lyrics directly:

```bash
/review-song
```

The skill will:
1. Prompt you to paste your structured prompt
2. Prompt you to paste your lyrics
3. Extract genre/mood context
4. Launch quality-reviewer sub-agent
5. Present structured feedback

```

## How It Works

### Internal Process

1. **Extract Content:**
   - If file path provided: Read file, parse YAML frontmatter, extract prompt sections and lyrics
   - If direct text: Prompt user to paste content

2. **Identify Context:**
   - Extract genre from prompt
   - Extract mood from prompt
   - Extract vocal style from prompt

2.5. **Ask Genre-Specific Refinement Questions (NEW):**

Use AskUserQuestion tool to collect evaluation preferences from user.

**Question 1: Specificity Preference**
```
question: "How should I evaluate specificity for this {genre} song?"
header: "Specificity"
multiSelect: false
options:
  - label: "Strict Commercial Standards"
    description: "Avoid ALL brand names, product references, and dated cultural references. Prioritize universal, timeless language suitable for radio/commercial release."

  - label: "Balanced Approach (Recommended)"
    description: "Flag obvious brand names and dated references, but allow some specific details if they serve the song. Consider genre conventions."

  - label: "Authentic/Artistic Priority"
    description: "Allow specific brands, places, and cultural references if they enhance authenticity and storytelling. Prioritize artistic vision over commercial considerations."
```

**Question 2: Contemporary vs. Timeless Balance**
```
question: "What's your priority for contemporary relevance vs. timeless appeal?"
header: "Contemporary"
multiSelect: false
options:
  - label: "Maximum Timeless Appeal"
    description: "Avoid all dated references. Flag anything that might age (tech products, current slang, 2025-specific culture). Prioritize songs that work in any era."

  - label: "Balanced (Recommended)"
    description: "Accept some contemporary references if not too specific. Flag obvious dating risks (product names, specific tech). Allow current but not hyper-specific language."

  - label: "Current/Contemporary Focus"
    description: "Embrace contemporary references for immediate relatability. Accept that song may date. Prioritize connecting with current audience over timelessness."
```

**Question 3: Wordiness Tolerance**
```
question: "How should I evaluate lyrical economy for this {genre} song?"
header: "Wordiness"
multiSelect: false
options:
  - label: "Strict Economy (Pop/Electronic)"
    description: "Flag lines over 8 words. Prioritize compressed, punchy language. Every word must earn its place."

  - label: "Moderate (Recommended for most genres)"
    description: "Flag lines over 10 words as suggestions. Balance economy with expression. Allow some variation."

  - label: "Narrative Freedom (Folk/Country/Indie)"
    description: "Allow 10-12+ word lines. Prioritize storytelling flow over compression. Wordiness acceptable if it serves narrative."
```

**Question 4: Show vs. Tell Balance**
```
question: "What balance of 'showing' vs. 'telling' should I expect?"
header: "Show/Tell"
multiSelect: false
options:
  - label: "Strongly Favor Showing"
    description: "Flag explicit statements. Push for implication over explanation. 80/20 show to tell ratio."

  - label: "Balanced (Recommended)"
    description: "Accept mix of showing and telling. Flag overly explicit or overly abstract. 60/40 show to tell."

  - label: "Allow Direct Statements"
    description: "Explicit emotional statements acceptable. Clarity prioritized over implication. 40/60 show to tell."
```

**Collect user responses and store for parameter construction.**

3. **Sanitize Input:**
   - Remove any mention of "AI-generated", "Claude", "LLM"
   - Frame neutrally: "Evaluate this song material for professional quality"

3.5. **Construct Parameterized Prompt (NEW):**

Append user preferences to the sanitized prompt:

```
## Evaluation Parameters (User-Specified)

**Specificity Standard:** {user_response_from_question_1}
**Contemporary Balance:** {user_response_from_question_2}
**Wordiness Tolerance:** {user_response_from_question_3}
**Show/Tell Balance:** {user_response_from_question_4}

Please adapt your evaluation criteria according to these user preferences. Consult the appropriate genre-specific reference guide:
- Pop: references/pop-evaluation-guide.md
- Indie/Folk: references/indie-folk-evaluation-guide.md
- Cross-reference: references/genre-evaluation-matrix.md
```

4. **Launch Sub-Agent:**
   - Use Task tool to invoke quality-reviewer agent
   - Pass: prompt text, lyrics text, minimal context (genre/mood/vocals), **AND evaluation parameters**
   - Sub-agent has independent context (no shared conversation history)
   - Sub-agent will apply genre-specific criteria based on parameters

5. **Present Results:**
   - Display structured feedback to user
   - Categorize recommendations by severity (CRITICAL/SUGGESTED/OPTIONAL)
   - Provide specific line numbers and actionable suggestions
   - Note which evaluation parameters were applied

### Context Isolation

The quality-reviewer sub-agent:
- Has NO knowledge of conversation history
- Does NOT know content is AI-generated (if it is)
- Receives ONLY the prompt text, lyrics text, and basic context
- Evaluates against professional production standards
- Provides unbiased, independent quality assessment

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Review Saved File

```bash
User: /review-song /Users/nathan/Development/suno/pop-songs-i-love/fixer-upper/prompt.md

Agent: Reading file and extracting content...
Agent: Launching quality-reviewer sub-agent...

[Quality reviewer provides feedback]

Agent: Review complete! Found 2 suggested improvements and 1 optional refinement.
```

### Example 2: Review Direct Text

```bash
User: /review-song

Agent: Please paste your structured prompt (genre, vocal, instrumentation, production, mood):

User: [Pastes prompt text]

Agent: Please paste your lyrics:

User: [Pastes lyrics]

Agent: Extracting context and launching quality-reviewer sub-agent...

[Quality reviewer provides feedback]
```

## Important Notes

**Automatic from Main Workflow:**
When invoked from the main Suno Song Creator workflow (Step 7.5), this skill receives the prompt and lyrics automatically - no user input needed.

**Standalone Usage:**
When invoked independently with `/review-song`, the user must provide either a file path or paste content manually.

**No Bias:**
The quality-reviewer sub-agent has no knowledge of how the content was created. It evaluates all material against the same professional standards.

**Iterative:**
Can be run multiple times on the same material to verify improvements after applying recommendations.

## Implementation Details

**Tool Usage:**
- Uses Task tool to launch quality-reviewer sub-agent
- Uses Read tool when file path provided
- Uses AskUserQuestion for interactive text input when needed

**Processing Steps:**
1. Determine input mode (file path vs. direct text)
2. Extract or collect prompt + lyrics content
3. Parse to identify genre, mood, vocal style
4. Sanitize input (remove "AI", "generated", "Claude", "LLM")
5. Construct neutral review request
6. Launch quality-reviewer via Task tool with subagent_type="quality-reviewer"
7. Receive and display structured feedback

**Context Sanitization Example:**
```
❌ Bad input to sub-agent:
"Review this AI-generated Suno prompt I just created with Claude"

✅ Good input to sub-agent:
"Evaluate this bubblegum pop song prompt and lyrics for professional production quality"
```

## Skill Integration

This skill can be:
- Invoked directly via `/review-song` for standalone reviews
- Called from main Suno Song Creator workflow (Step 7.5)
- Used to review old prompts stored in project directories
- Used to review prompts created by other tools/methods

No matter the source, the quality-reviewer provides objective, professional assessment.
