description: Plan work before coding: do repo research, analyze options/risks, and ask clarifying questions before proposing an implementation plan. Use when the user asks for a plan, design/approach, scope breakdown, or implementation steps. Use when this capability is needed.

# Plan work

## Goal
Produce a plan that is:
- grounded in repo reality (research)
- explicit about decisions and risks (analysis)
- blocked on zero unknowns (Q&A before implementation steps)

## Inputs to ask for (if missing)
- Outcome/acceptance criteria (what "done" means).
- Constraints: time, backwards compatibility, performance, security, data migration.
- Target environment(s): local/stage/prod; any feature flags or rollout requirements.
- Non-goals (what not to do).

## Workflow (research -> analysis -> Q&A -> implementation)
1) Research (current state)
   - Read repo guidance first: `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `docs/` (only if needed).
   - Identify entrypoints and owners (backend/frontend/infra).
   - Find relevant code paths and patterns:
     - `rg` for symbols, endpoints, config keys, error strings
     - `git log -p` / `git blame` for history and intent when uncertain
   - If the plan depends on external behavior (framework/library/tooling), consult official docs, release notes or context7 (and call out versions/assumptions).
   - Capture findings as short bullets with file paths.
2) Analysis (what to change and why)
   - Restate requirements and assumptions.
   - List options (1-3) with tradeoffs; pick one and justify.
   - Identify risks/edge cases and what tests cover them.
   - Collect open questions.
3) Q&A gate (do not skip)
   - If there are open questions, ask them and stop.
   - Do not propose implementation steps until the user answers (or explicitly accepts assumptions).
4) Implementation plan (only after Q&A)
   - Break into small steps in a sensible order.
   - Name likely files/dirs to change.
   - Include the tests to run (unit/integration/build) to validate the change.
   - If the change spans modules, include coordination steps (contract changes, client regen, versioning).

## Deliverable
Use `references/plan-template.md` and fill it in.
