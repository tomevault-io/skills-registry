# Permissions Skill

Manages Claude Code permissions interactively by scanning installed
plugin recommendations, presenting categorized choices, and writing
the selected configuration to `settings.json`.

## Activation

This skill activates when `/aida config permissions` is invoked
through the aida skill routing system.

## Command Routing

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `/aida config permissions` | Interactive permissions setup |
| `/aida config permissions --audit` | Audit current permissions |

## Path Resolution

Scripts are located at `skills/permissions/scripts/` relative to
the plugin root.

- Plugin cache: `~/.claude/plugins/cache/*/*/.claude-plugin/`
- User settings: `~/.claude/settings.json`
- Project settings: `.claude/settings.json`
- Local settings: `.claude/settings.local.json`

## Two-Phase API

### Phase 1: `get_questions(context)`

1. Scans installed plugins for `recommendedPermissions` in
   `aida-config.json`
2. Deduplicates and categorizes discovered rules
3. Reads current permissions from all settings scopes
4. Detects conflicts between current and proposed rules
5. Returns questions for preset selection and per-category
   allow/ask/deny choices

### Phase 2: `execute(context, responses)`

1. Applies the selected preset or custom category choices
2. Builds the final rules dictionary (allow/ask/deny lists)
3. Writes permissions to the chosen settings scope
4. Returns a summary of changes made

### Audit Mode

When `--audit` is passed, the skill skips the interactive flow
and returns a coverage/gap/conflict analysis report.
