# Exploring Codebases

Exploratory code analysis for unfamiliar repositories. This skill is a
**workflow**, not a tool — it orchestrates tree-sitting (structural) and
featuring (semantic) into a progressive disclosure sequence.

## Dependencies

- **tree-sitting** — AST-powered code navigation (structural inventory)
- **featuring** — Feature documentation generator (what/why layer)

```bash
uv venv /home/claude/.venv 2>/dev/null
uv pip install tree-sitter-language-pack --python /home/claude/.venv/bin/python
```

## Workflow

```bash
TREESIT=/mnt/skills/user/tree-sitting/scripts/treesit.py
PYTHON=/home/claude/.venv/bin/python
```

### Phase 1: Structural Orientation

Get oriented — what's here, how big, what languages?

```bash
$PYTHON $TREESIT /path/to/repo --stats
```

Default depth=1 shows root-level files and one level of subdirectories
with file counts, symbol counts, and languages. Takes ~700ms total
(scan + output).

### Phase 2: Drill Into Structure

Follow what looks interesting. Each call auto-scans — no state to manage.

```bash
# Drill into a directory with full detail (signatures, docs, children, imports)
$PYTHON $TREESIT /path/to/repo --path=src/core --detail=full

# Search for patterns across the codebase
$PYTHON $TREESIT /path/to/repo 'find:*Handler*:function'

# Read a specific implementation
$PYTHON $TREESIT /path/to/repo --no-tree 'source:handle_request'
```

**Heuristics for what to drill into first:**
- Directories with high symbol counts relative to file counts (dense logic)
- Entry point patterns: `main`, `cli`, `app`, `server`, `routes`, `handler`
- Files with many imports (integration points)
- The root directory's top-level files (often config + entry points)

### Phase 3: Feature Synthesis (featuring)

Once you understand the structure, generate the "what does it DO?" layer:

```bash
$PYTHON /mnt/skills/user/featuring/scripts/gather.py /path/to/repo \
  --skip tests,.github,node_modules --source-budget 8000
```

Read the gather output, then synthesize `_FEATURES.md` following the featuring
skill's format. This is the LLM step — identify capabilities, group symbols
into features, write user-facing descriptions.

### Phase 4: Targeted Deep Dives

With structural inventory + feature map in hand, read specific implementations
where the feature narrative needs verification or behavior isn't clear:

```bash
$PYTHON $TREESIT /path/to/repo --no-tree 'source:authenticate' 'refs:AuthToken'
```

Multiple queries in one call — each adds ~0ms on top of the scan cost.

## When to Use This vs Other Skills

| Situation | Use |
|-----------|-----|
| "I just cloned this, what is it?" | **exploring-codebases** (this skill) |
| "Where is the retry logic?" | searching-codebases |
| "Find all files matching `class.*Error`" | searching-codebases |
| "Show me the symbols in auth.py" | tree-sitting directly |
| "Document what this codebase does" | featuring directly |

Exploring is the **divergent** skill — you don't know what you're looking
for yet. Searching is the **convergent** skill — you know what you want,
you need to find it.

## Output

The exploration produces understanding, not necessarily files. But the
concrete artifacts, when warranted, are:

- `_FEATURES.md` — top-down feature documentation (via featuring)
- Mental model of codebase structure, entry points, and architecture

## Scaling

For large repos (>100 files), use `--skip` aggressively in Phase 1 to
exclude tests, vendored code, generated files, and docs. Focus the initial
scan on `--path=src` or the primary source directory. Expand scope as needed.

For monorepos, treat each package/service as a separate exploration.
Generate per-subsystem `_FEATURES.md` files linked from a root index.
