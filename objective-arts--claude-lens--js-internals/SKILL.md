# Kyle Simpson (YDKJS) JavaScript Philosophy

Deep JavaScript language mechanics expertise based on Kyle Simpson's "You Don't Know JS" philosophy. Understanding what JavaScript actually does under the hood - closures, scope, this binding, prototypes, coercion, and async patterns at the engine level.

Applying Kyle Simpson's deep JavaScript philosophy when debugging complex runtime behavior, understanding scope chain resolution, diagnosing `this` binding issues, explaining prototype delegation, or when abstraction leaks cause unexpected behavior. Use this when surface-level JavaScript knowledge is insufficient and true language mechanics understanding is required.

**Triggers:**
- Complex closure debugging or memory leak investigation
- Unexpected `this` binding behavior
- Prototype chain confusion or inheritance issues
- Coercion bugs or type conversion surprises
- Async execution order mysteries
- "Why does JavaScript do this?" questions
- Debugging transpiled/bundled code behavior differences

**Anti-triggers:**
- Simple syntax questions (use MDN)
- Framework-specific patterns (use framework docs)
- Build tooling configuration
- CSS/HTML questions

## Philosophy

### Core Principles (YDKJS)

1. **Know the language, not just the patterns** - Understand WHY code works, not just that it works
2. **Embrace JavaScript as it is** - Don't fight the language; understand its design decisions
3. **Abstraction leaks are bugs in understanding** - When abstractions fail, language knowledge saves you
4. **Mental models must match engine behavior** - Your understanding should predict what JavaScript will do

### The Three Pillars

**Scope & Closures**
- Lexical scope is determined at author time, not runtime
- Closures are functions that remember their lexical scope
- The scope chain is a one-way lookup (inner → outer)
- Block scope (let/const) vs function scope (var)

**this & Object Prototypes**
- `this` is determined by call-site, not definition site
- Four rules in order: new > explicit > implicit > default
- Prototype is delegation, not inheritance (objects link to other objects)
- `[[Prototype]]` chain lookup happens on property access

**Types & Coercion**
- JavaScript has types; variables don't have types, values do
- Coercion is not evil; implicit coercion can be readable when understood
- `==` uses coercion, `===` doesn't - know when each is appropriate
- Falsy values: `false`, `0`, `-0`, `0n`, `""`, `null`, `undefined`, `NaN`

## Diagnostic Framework

### Debugging `this` Binding

```javascript
// Ask these questions in order:
// 1. Was the function called with `new`? → this = newly constructed object
// 2. Was it called with call/apply/bind? → this = specified object
// 3. Was it called with a context object? → this = that object
// 4. None of the above? → this = undefined (strict) or globalThis (sloppy)

// Arrow functions: lexical this (inherits from enclosing scope)
```

### Debugging Closures

```javascript
// Closure = function + its lexical environment
// Common gotcha: loop variable capture

// Bug:
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 100); // prints 3, 3, 3
}

// Fix 1: let creates new binding per iteration
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 100); // prints 0, 1, 2
}

// Fix 2: IIFE creates new scope
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  ((j) => setTimeout(() => console.log(j), 100))(i);
}
```

### Debugging Prototype Chain

```javascript
// Object.create(proto) - creates object with [[Prototype]] = proto
// obj.hasOwnProperty(prop) - checks own properties only
// prop in obj - checks entire prototype chain
// Object.getPrototypeOf(obj) - gets [[Prototype]]

// Shadowing: own property hides prototype property
// Delegation: property lookup walks up [[Prototype]] chain
```

### Debugging Coercion

```javascript
// ToString: null→"null", undefined→"undefined", true→"true"
// ToNumber: ""→0, "  "→0, null→0, undefined→NaN, true→1
// ToBoolean: falsy values→false, everything else→true

// Abstract equality (==) coercion rules:
// string == number → ToNumber(string) == number
// boolean == anything → ToNumber(boolean) == anything
// null == undefined → true (special case)
// object == primitive → ToPrimitive(object) == primitive
```

## Deep Dive Patterns

### Scope Resolution

```
Global Scope
  └─ Outer Function Scope
      └─ Inner Function Scope
          └─ Block Scope (let/const)

Lookup: Inner → Outer → Global → ReferenceError
```

### Event Loop Mental Model

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│ Call Stack  │ ←── │ Event Loop  │ ←── │ Task Queue  │
└─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘
                          ↑
                    ┌─────────────┐
                    │ Microtask   │ (Promises, queueMicrotask)
                    │ Queue       │ (drained between tasks)
                    └─────────────┘

Order: Sync code → All microtasks → One macrotask → Repeat
```

### `this` Binding Decision Tree

```
Was `new` used?
├─ Yes → this = new object
└─ No → Was call/apply/bind used?
    ├─ Yes → this = specified object (unless null/undefined in strict)
    └─ No → Is there a context object (obj.fn())?
        ├─ Yes → this = context object
        └─ No → Is it strict mode?
            ├─ Yes → this = undefined
            └─ No → this = globalThis

Arrow function? → Inherits this from enclosing scope (lexical)
```

## Anti-Patterns to Recognize

### Misunderstanding Hoisting

```javascript
// Mental model: declarations move to top, assignments stay
// Reality: functions fully hoisted, var declarations hoisted (value undefined)

console.log(foo); // undefined (var hoisted)
console.log(bar); // ReferenceError (let TDZ)
var foo = 1;
let bar = 2;
```

### Confusing Prototype with Class Inheritance

```javascript
// JavaScript has delegation, not classical inheritance
// Objects delegate to other objects via [[Prototype]]
// Class syntax is syntactic sugar over prototype delegation

// This is NOT copying properties:
class Child extends Parent {}
// This is linking Child.prototype.[[Prototype]] = Parent.prototype
```

### Relying on Implicit Globals

```javascript
// In sloppy mode, undeclared assignment creates global
function leak() {
  oops = "I'm global now"; // No var/let/const = global property
}
// Always use strict mode: "use strict";
```

## Debugging Checklist

When JavaScript behaves unexpectedly:

1. [ ] What is `this` at the call-site? (Not definition site)
2. [ ] Is there a closure capturing a variable? What's its current value?
3. [ ] Is coercion happening? What types are actually involved?
4. [ ] Is the prototype chain being traversed? Check `hasOwnProperty`
5. [ ] Is this sync or async? What's the event loop state?
6. [ ] Am I in strict mode? Behavior differs significantly
7. [ ] Is TDZ (Temporal Dead Zone) involved with let/const?
8. [ ] Could hoisting be affecting execution order?
