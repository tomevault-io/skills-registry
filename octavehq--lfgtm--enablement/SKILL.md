## Usage

```
/octave:enablement [type] [--persona <name>] [--competitor <name>] [--product <name>]
```

## Content Types

```
/octave:enablement                                        # Interactive mode

```

## Instructions

When the user runs `/octave:enablement`:

### Step 1: Determine Content Type

If no type specified, ask:

```
What enablement material do you need?

DAILY REFERENCE
1. Quick Reference Card - One-page cheat sheet for a topic
2. Objection Handling Guide - "They say X, we say Y" from real conversations
3. Discovery Question Bank - Questions organized by persona and stage

COMPETITIVE
4. Competitive Cheat Sheet - Pocket-sized competitive positioning guide

TEAM DEVELOPMENT
5. New Hire Onboarding Kit - Library walkthrough + essentials for new reps
6. Persona Deep-Dive - Everything a rep needs to know about selling to a persona
7. Playbook Quick Reference - Condensed playbook for quick consumption

Your choice:
```

Then ask for focus:
```
What's the focus?

1. Specific persona: [List personas]
2. Specific product: [List products]
3. Specific competitor: [List competitors]
4. Specific playbook: [List playbooks]
5. General / all
```

### Step 2: Gather Intelligence

Enablement materials are unique because they blend library data with conversation evidence:

```
# Get the focus entity
get_entity({ oId: "<entity_oId>" })

# Get related playbook
get_playbook({ oId: "<playbook_oId>", includeValueProps: true })

# Get real objections from conversations
list_findings({
  query: "objections pushback concerns hesitation",
  startDate: "<180 days ago>",
  eventFilters: {
    personas: ["<persona_oId>"]  // if persona-focused
  }
})

# Get positive signals (what's working)
list_findings({
  query: "positive reaction excited interested resonated",
  startDate: "<180 days ago>",
  eventFilters: {
    sentiments: ["POSITIVE"]
  }
})

# Get pain points mentioned
list_findings({
  query: "pain points challenges frustrations problems",
  startDate: "<180 days ago>"
})

# Get proof points
search_knowledge_base({
  query: "<focus area> results metrics",
  entityTypes: ["proof_point", "reference"]
})

# Get competitors for context
list_all_entities({ entityType: "competitor" })

# Get brand voice
list_brand_voices()
```

### Step 3: Generate Content Type

---

#### Type: Quick Reference Card

```
generate_content({
  instructions: "Create a quick reference card for sales reps about [focus area].
    Format: Single-page cheat sheet. Scannable. No fluff.
    Sections: Key stats, elevator pitch, top 3 pain points, top 3 value props,
    proof points, common objections (brief), recommended CTA.
    Keep each item to 1-2 lines max.",

### Step 4: Offer Follow-Up Actions

```
What would you like to do next?

1. Create another enablement piece
2. Re-generate any piece using a saved agent
3. Create a version for a different persona/product
4. Combine into a full enablement package
5. Export as a document
6. Done
```

## Generation Mode Note

This skill uses Octave's `generate_content` and `generate_email` tools by default. Two alternatives:
- **Saved agents**: Check for matching agents with `list_agents` when relevant. See `/octave:explore-agents`.
- **Claude-direct**: Skip `generate_*` calls, gather Octave context, Claude writes directly. Offer when user wants more control.

For the full interactive mode selector, use `/octave:generate`.

## MCP Tools Used

### Library Context
- `list_all_entities` - All entity types for comprehensive coverage
- `get_entity` - Full entity details
- `get_playbook` - Playbook with value props
- `list_value_props` - Value propositions
- `search_knowledge_base` - Proof points, references, messaging

### Conversation Evidence
- `list_findings` - Real objections, pain points, signals from calls/emails
- `list_events` - Deal outcomes for win/loss evidence
- `get_event_detail` - Specific interaction details

### Content Generation
- `generate_content` - All enablement content types
- `list_brand_voices` - Brand voice consistency

## Error Handling

**No Conversation Data:**
> No conversation data available yet.
>
> I'll generate enablement materials from your library.
> As your team logs calls and emails, these materials will get richer
> with real-world evidence.

**No Competitors:**
> No competitors in your library for competitive enablement.
>
> Options:
> 1. Add competitors: `/octave:library create competitor`
> 2. Skip competitive sections
> 3. I'll create a general competitive awareness template

**Empty Library:**
> Your library needs more content for a comprehensive enablement kit.
>
> Start with:
> 1. `/octave:library create product` - Add your product
> 2. `/octave:library create persona` - Add buyer personas
> Then run this skill again.

## Related Skills

- `/octave:train` - Practice with role-play simulations and quizzes using your enablement content
- `/octave:battlecard` - Full competitive intelligence (deeper than cheat sheet)
- `/octave:insights` - Surface field intelligence trends
- `/octave:wins-losses` - Win/loss patterns for objection effectiveness
- `/octave:pmm` - Marketing collateral (different audience than enablement)
- `/octave:research` - Deep research for specific accounts
