## Instructions

When the user runs `/octave:pipeline`:

### Step 1: Understand the Deal Situation

If no mode specified, ask:

```
Tell me about the deal. What's happening?

DEAL CHALLENGES
1. Stalled - Deal has gone quiet or lost momentum
2. Multi-thread - Need to engage more stakeholders
3. Competitive - A competitor has entered or is threatening
4. Executive - Need to get executive buy-in
5. Close - Deal is in final stages, need to close
6. Expand - Existing customer, upsell/cross-sell opportunity

7. Other - Describe the situation

Your choice:
```

Then gather context:
```
A few more details:

1. Account: [company name or domain]
2. Primary contact: [name or email, if known]
3. Deal stage: [Where is it in your pipeline?]
4. How long at this stage: [days/weeks]
5. What happened last: [last interaction or event]
6. Any other context: [budget, timeline, blockers]
```

### Step 2: Research the Deal

```
# Enrich the company
enrich_company({ companyDomain: "<domain>" })

# Qualify the company
qualify_company({ companyDomain: "<domain>" })

# Research the primary contact
enrich_person({
  person: {
    email: "<email>",
    companyDomain: "<domain>"
  }
})

# Qualify the contact
qualify_person({
  person: {
    email: "<email>",
    companyDomain: "<domain>"
  },
  additionalContext: "This is an active deal. Evaluate persona fit and likely buying role."
})

# Check for conversation history
list_events({
  startDate: "<365 days ago>",
  filters: {
    companyDomains: ["<domain>"]
  }
})

# Get findings from past interactions
list_findings({
  query: "objections pain points next steps commitments",
  startDate: "<365 days ago>",
  eventFilters: {
    companyDomains: ["<domain>"]
  }
})

# Match to playbook
search_knowledge_base({
  query: "<company industry> <persona> <deal context>",
  entityTypes: ["playbook"]
})
get_playbook({ oId: "<playbook_oId>", includeValueProps: true })

# Get competitive intel if relevant
search_knowledge_base({
  query: "<competitor name or signals>",
  entityTypes: ["competitor"]
})

# Get proof points for this situation
search_knowledge_base({
  query: "<company industry> <deal stage> results",
  entityTypes: ["proof_point", "reference"]
})
```
