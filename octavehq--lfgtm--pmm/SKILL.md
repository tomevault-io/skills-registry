get_entity({ oId: "<persona_oId>" })

get_entity({ oId: "<reference_oId>" })

# Search for relevant proof points
search_knowledge_base({ query: "<topic>", entityTypes: ["proof_point"] })

search_knowledge_base({ query: "<topic>", entityTypes: ["use_case"] })

# Search for messaging
search_knowledge_base({ query: "<persona> pain points value" })
```

### Step 4: Generate Content

Use `generate_content` with structured instructions:

```
generate_content({
  instructions: "<detailed content brief>",
  person: { ... },  // if persona-targeted
  company: { ... }, // if account-specific
  customContext: "<library context gathered>"
})
```

Present the generated content with clear sections:

```

2. [Voice 2 name] - [description]
3. No specific voice (neutral professional)
```

Apply selected voice guidelines to all generated content.

## Generation Mode Note

This skill uses Octave's `generate_content` and `generate_email` tools by default. Two alternatives:
- **Saved agents**: Check for matching agents with `list_agents` when relevant. See `/octave:explore-agents`.
- **Claude-direct**: Skip `generate_*` calls, gather Octave context, Claude writes directly. Offer when user wants more control.

For the full interactive mode selector, use `/octave:generate`.

## MCP Tools Used

### Library Context
- `list_brand_voices` - Get available brand voices
- `list_all_entities` - List products, personas, etc.
- `get_entity` - Get full entity details
- `search_knowledge_base` - Find relevant messaging, proof points

### Content Generation
- `generate_content` - Primary content generation tool
- `generate_email` - For email-style content within collateral

## Content Type Quick Reference

| Type | Key Inputs | Primary Library Sources |
|------|------------|------------------------|
| One-Pager | Product, persona, use case | Product, persona pain points, proof points |
| Case Study | Reference customer | Reference (metrics, quotes), use case |
| Landing Page | Product/campaign, persona, CTA | Product, persona, value props |
| Blog Post | Topic, angle, persona | Use cases, proof points, messaging |
| Datasheet | Product | Product (features, specs, capabilities) |
| FAQ | Product/topic | Common objections, use cases |
| Sales Deck | Product, persona, playbook | Playbook (narrative, value props), product |

## Error Handling

**Missing Product:**
> No products found in your library.
>
> To create effective collateral, I need product information.
> Run /octave:library create product to add your product first.

**Missing Brand Voice:**
> No brand voice defined. I'll use a neutral professional tone.
>
> For consistent messaging, consider creating a brand voice:
> This is done in the Octave web app under Settings > Brand Voices.
