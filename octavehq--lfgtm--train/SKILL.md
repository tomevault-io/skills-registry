# /octave:train - Sales Training Ground

Practice and learn your GTM playbook through interactive role-play simulations and knowledge quizzes — all grounded in your real library data. Role-play against buyer personas with realistic objections, or quiz yourself on value props, competitive positioning, and discovery techniques.

## Usage

```
/octave:train [mode] [--persona <name>] [--competitor <name>] [--difficulty easy|medium|hard]
```

## Modes

```
/octave:train                                          # Interactive - pick a mode
/octave:train roleplay                                 # Simulate a buyer conversation
/octave:train roleplay --persona "CTO"                 # Role-play with a specific persona
/octave:train roleplay --scenario discovery            # Practice discovery calls
/octave:train quiz                                     # Test your GTM knowledge
/octave:train quiz --topic objections                  # Quiz on objection handling
/octave:train quiz --competitor "Acme"                 # Competitive knowledge check
```

## Instructions

When the user runs `/octave:train`:

### Step 1: Choose Mode

If no mode specified, ask:

```
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [{
    question: "What do you want to practice?",
    header: "Train mode",
    options: [
      { label: "Role-Play", description: "Simulate a sales conversation — I'll play the buyer and give you feedback" },
      { label: "Quiz", description: "Test your knowledge of personas, objections, value props, and competitive positioning" },
      { label: "Guided Learning", description: "Walk me through a topic from your playbook — teach me like I'm a new hire" }
    ],
    multiSelect: false
  }]
})
```

---

### Mode: Role-Play

Simulate realistic buyer conversations using persona data from the library.

#### Step RP-1: Setup the Scenario

Ask for scenario parameters (use `AskUserQuestion` for structured choices):

```
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [
    {
      question: "What scenario do you want to practice?",
      header: "Scenario",
      options: [
        { label: "Discovery call", description: "First conversation — qualify the opportunity and uncover pain" },
        { label: "Objection handling", description: "Practice responding to tough objections mid-deal" },
        { label: "Demo pitch", description: "Present your product's value to a skeptical buyer" },
        { label: "Competitive displacement", description: "Sell against a competitor the buyer currently uses" }
      ],
      multiSelect: false
    },
    {
      question: "How tough should I be?",
      header: "Difficulty",
      options: [
        { label: "Friendly", description: "Interested buyer, open to learning — good for building confidence" },
        { label: "Skeptical (Recommended)", description: "Realistic buyer who pushes back and needs convincing" },
        { label: "Hostile", description: "Tough buyer — time-pressed, has objections, hard to impress" }
      ],
      multiSelect: false
    }
  ]
})
```

If no persona specified, present available personas:
```
# Get personas from library
list_all_entities({ entityType: "persona" })
```

Ask:
```
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [{
    question: "Which buyer persona should I play?",
    header: "Persona",
    options: [
      { label: "[Persona 1 name]", description: "[Title] — [key concern]" },
      { label: "[Persona 2 name]", description: "[Title] — [key concern]" },
      { label: "[Persona 3 name]", description: "[Title] — [key concern]" }
    ],
    multiSelect: false
  }]
})
```

#### Step RP-2: Load Persona Intelligence

```
# Get full persona details
get_entity({ oId: "<persona_oId>" })

# Get matching playbook with value props
search_knowledge_base({ query: "<persona name> <scenario>", entityTypes: ["playbook"] })
get_playbook({ oId: "<playbook_oId>", includeValueProps: true })

# Get real objections from conversations (to make role-play realistic)
list_findings({
  query: "objections pushback concerns",
  startDate: "<180 days ago>",
  eventFilters: {
    personas: ["<persona_oId>"]
  }
})

# Get product details
list_all_entities({ entityType: "product" })
get_entity({ oId: "<product_oId>" })

# Get competitor details (for competitive scenarios)
get_entity({ oId: "<competitor_oId>" })  // if competitive scenario

# Get proof points (to evaluate if rep uses them)
search_knowledge_base({ query: "<persona> results metrics", entityTypes: ["proof_point", "reference"] })
```

#### Step RP-3: Set the Scene

Present the scenario context, then begin:

```
ROLE-PLAY: [Scenario] with [Persona Name]
==========================================

THE SCENE
---------
You're on a [scenario type] with [Persona Name], [Title] at [fictional company].

About the buyer:
- Role: [Title and responsibilities]
- Company: [Brief fictional company description relevant to your ICP]
- Situation: [Scenario-specific context]
- Mood: [Based on difficulty level]

About their company:
- Industry: [From persona's typical segment]
- Size: [Typical company size for this persona]
- Current challenge: [Key pain point from persona data]

[If competitive scenario:]
- Currently using: [Competitor name]
- Their satisfaction level: [Mixed/frustrated/somewhat happy]

RULES
-----
- I'll respond as the buyer would — using real objections from your conversation data
- The conversation will last 8-12 exchanges
- I'll end the conversation naturally when it reaches a conclusion
- After the role-play, I'll give you a detailed scorecard

---

The call starts now. [Persona Name] says:

"[Opening line based on scenario and difficulty]"
```

**How to play the buyer:**

Use the loaded persona data to respond realistically:
- Reference real pain points from the persona entity
- Raise real objections from conversation findings data
- React based on difficulty level:
  - **Friendly**: Engaged, asks questions, shares information willingly
  - **Skeptical**: Needs proof, challenges claims, asks "why should I care?"
  - **Hostile**: Short answers, pushes on price, questions ROI, brings up competitors
- Respond naturally to what the user says — don't just cycle through objections
- If the user makes a strong point, acknowledge it (even skeptical buyers respond to good selling)
- If the user fumbles, the buyer gets more distant/disengaged

**End the conversation after 8-12 exchanges** with a natural conclusion:
- Friendly: "This sounds interesting, let's set up a follow-up"
- Skeptical: "I need to think about it" or "Send me some materials"
- Hostile: "I don't think this is for us" (unless the user sold well)

#### Step RP-4: Scorecard

After the role-play ends, provide detailed feedback:

```

list_all_entities({ entityType: "competitor" })
search_knowledge_base({ query: "value propositions proof points" })
list_all_entities({ entityType: "use_case" })
```

#### Step Q-3: Run the Quiz

**Rapid Fire Format (10 questions):**

Ask each question one at a time. After the user answers, score immediately, then move on.

Question types per topic:

**Personas:**
- "What are the top 3 pain points for [Persona]?"
- "What's the primary KPI that [Persona] is measured on?"
- "Which value prop resonates most with [Persona]?"
- "What's the best discovery question to open with for [Persona]?"
- "What proof point would you use with [Persona]?"

**Objections:**
- "A prospect says '[Real objection from data]'. How do you respond?"
- "What's the biggest pricing objection you'll face, and what's the counter?"
- "A [Persona] says 'We're happy with what we have.' What do you say?"
- "How do you handle 'It's too expensive' without discounting?"
- "What reframe do you use when they say '[Feature] is missing'?"

**Competitive:**
- "What are our top 3 differentiators vs [Competitor]?"
- "A prospect says '[Competitor] is cheaper.' How do you respond?"
- "What trap question exposes [Competitor]'s weakness in [area]?"
- "When should you NOT try to displace [Competitor]?"
- "What proof point works best in a head-to-head against [Competitor]?"

**Full GTM:**
- Mix of all the above, rotating through topics

Present each question as:
```
QUESTION [N]/10
===============

[Question text]

Your answer:

## MCP Tools Used

### Library Context
- `list_all_entities` - List personas, products, competitors, use cases
- `get_entity` - Full entity details (persona pain points, competitor weaknesses, etc.)
- `get_playbook` - Playbook with value props, discovery questions, objection handling
- `list_value_props` - Value propositions by persona
- `search_knowledge_base` - Proof points, references, messaging

### Conversation Evidence
- `list_findings` - Real objections, pain points, and signals from calls/emails
- `list_events` - Deal outcomes (win/loss evidence for coaching)
- `get_event_detail` - Specific interaction details for training examples

### Content Generation
- `generate_content` - Generate scenario descriptions, coaching feedback

## Error Handling

**No Personas in Library:**
> No personas found in your library.
>
> Role-play and quizzes work best with persona data.
> Add personas first: `/octave:library create persona`
>
> I can still run a general sales quiz using your product info.

**No Conversation Data:**
> No conversation data available yet.
>
> I'll use your library data for role-play and quizzes.
> As your team logs calls and emails, training will get richer
> with real-world objections and patterns.

**No Competitors:**
> No competitors in your library.
>
> Competitive quizzes and displacement role-plays need competitor data.
> Add competitors: `/octave:library create competitor`
>
> I can still quiz you on personas, value props, and general objection handling.

**Sparse Library:**
> Your library has limited data for a full training session.
>
> Start with:
> 1. `/octave:library create product` - Add your product
> 2. `/octave:library create persona` - Add buyer personas
> 3. `/octave:library create competitor` - Add competitors
>
> Even with just a product and one persona, I can run basic training.
