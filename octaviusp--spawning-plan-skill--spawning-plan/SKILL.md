description: Spawning Plan. Use when user wants to spawn agents, create a team, or coordinate multiple agents. Automatically gathers context, asks team topology questions, outputs clean TEAM PLAN markdown, and gets user approval. 3 steps: context gathering → questions → present plan. **CRITICAL**: MUST NOT SPAWN AGENTS SKIPPING THIS SKILL, USE ALWAYS. Use when this capability is needed.

# Spawning Plan

Design the optimal agent team for the task. Performant, precise, minimal.
Docs: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-teams.md

**Task:** `$ARGUMENTS`

## Step 1: Context Gathering (Silent — no user interaction)

**A) Read environment:**
- `CLAUDE.md` — workflow rules, conventions, constraints
- Project manifests — `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, etc.
- Directory structure — `src/`, `app/`, `packages/`, test dirs, monorepo indicators

**B) Inventory existing agents:**
- Scan `~/.claude/agents/*.md` — reuse matching agents instead of creating duplicates

**C) Analyze task complexity:**
- **Work type**: research, implementation, review, debugging, refactoring
- **Scope**: single-layer vs cross-layer
- **Parallelism**: can work split into independent streams?
- **Complexity → team size**: simple (2 agents), medium (3-4), complex cross-cutting (5-6, max 8)

## Step 2: Ask Team Questions (AskUserQuestion Tool)

Ask 3-5 questions based on Step 1 findings. Not all apply every time — pick what matters.

1. **Team Composition** — "For this [work type] on [stack], I'm thinking [N] agents: [role list]. What would you change?"
   Options: Perfect / Add role / Remove role / Different approach

2. **Coordination** — "How should agents work together?"
   Options: Independent (no messaging) / Team (peer messaging) / Hub-spoke (lead coordinates)

3. **Dependencies** — "Work order?"
   Options: All parallel / Sequential (A→B→C) / Mixed

4. **Models** — "Model allocation: opus (research), sonnet (implementation), haiku (scanning). Adjust?"
   Options: As suggested / All opus / All sonnet / Custom

5. **Agent Reuse** *(only if matching agents found in Step 1B)* — "Found existing `[agent-name]` that handles [capability]. Reuse it?"
   Options: Reuse / Create fresh / Both

## Step 3: Output & Approval

Present clean TEAM PLAN:

```
## TEAM PLAN

Task: [description]
Pattern: [independent | team | hub-spoke]
Work Order: [parallel | sequential | mixed]
Agents: [count]

### Teammates

- Teammate 1: [Name] ([Role])
  Description: [1-2 line expertise and specialization]
  Model: [opus|sonnet|haiku]
  Type: [general-purpose | feature-dev:code-X | reuse ~/.claude/agents/X.md]
  Responsible for: [specific deliverable]
  Depends on: [— | Teammate N]

- Teammate 2: [Name] ([Role])
  Description: [1-2 line expertise and specialization]
  Model: [opus|sonnet|haiku]
  Type: [general-purpose | feature-dev:code-X]
  Responsible for: [specific deliverable]
  Depends on: [— | Teammate N]

- ...

### Research (injected into agent prompts)
- [key finding or best practice 1]
- [key finding or best practice 2]
```

### Final Approval (AskUserQuestion Tool)

```
"Launch this team?"
- Deploy & Save — spawn agents and save as reusable skill
- Deploy Once — spawn agents, one-time
- Adjust — change something (iterate plan)
- Cancel — abort
```

**Deploy & Save** → save team as skill at `~/.claude/skills/<team-name>/SKILL.md` for future use via `/<team-name> [task]`. Saved skill skips planning, bakes in agent definitions, uses `$ARGUMENTS` for task input.

**Adjust** → ask what to change → regenerate plan → ask again. Loop until approved.

**Deploy Once** → spawn immediately, no save.

**Cancel** → stop.

### Spawning Execution

Based on chosen pattern:
- **Independent**: parallel Task tool calls, one per agent
- **Team**: TeamCreate → TaskCreate per agent → Task tool with `team_name` → TaskUpdate for dependencies
- **Hub-spoke**: TeamCreate with lead agent (opus) that delegates via SendMessage
