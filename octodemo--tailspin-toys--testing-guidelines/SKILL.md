# Testing Guidelines

## Core Philosophy

### Test Core Functionality, Not Everything

- Focus on critical user paths and essential business logic
- Prioritize tests that catch regressions in key features
- Avoid over-testing trivial functionality or implementation details
- Ask: "If this breaks, will users notice?" - if yes, test it

### Tests Must Pass Before Commit/Merge

- All existing tests must pass before committing changes
- Never skip or disable tests without explicit justification
- Broken tests block merges - fix them, don't ignore them
- Run the full test suite, not just tests for changed code

### Tests Are Production Code

- Apply the same code quality standards to tests as production code
- Use clear, descriptive names that explain what is being tested
- Keep tests maintainable, readable, and well-organized
- Include type hints, proper formatting, and meaningful comments
- Refactor tests when they become brittle or hard to understand

## Running Tests

**Always use the provided shell scripts:**

```bash
# Unit tests (backend)
./scripts/run-server-tests.sh

# E2E tests (frontend)
./scripts/run-e2e-tests.sh
```

These scripts handle environment setup, dependencies, and proper configuration.

## Before Creating New Tests

1. **Check existing coverage** - avoid duplication
2. **Review existing test patterns** - follow established conventions
3. **Identify the right test type** - unit for logic, E2E for user flows

## Test Quality Standards

- **Deterministic** - Same result every run, no flaky tests
- **Independent** - No dependencies between tests
- **Fast** - Optimize for quick feedback loops
- **Focused** - One logical assertion per test
- **Descriptive** - Test names should read like specifications

## Pre-Commit Checklist

1. Run unit tests: `./scripts/run-server-tests.sh`
2. Run E2E tests (if UI changed): `./scripts/run-e2e-tests.sh`
3. Verify new functionality has appropriate test coverage
4. Confirm no tests were broken or skipped
