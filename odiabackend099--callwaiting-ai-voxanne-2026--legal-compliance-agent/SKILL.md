- Use short sentences (15-20 words)
- Define technical terms (e.g., "PHI" = Protected Health Information)
- Use examples (e.g., "call recordings may contain PHI such as...")

### 2. Transparency
- Be specific about data collection ("we collect your email address" vs. "we collect information")
- Explain WHY data is collected (not just what)
- Disclose all third parties (with links to their privacy policies)

### 3. User-Friendly Formatting
- Use headings and subheadings
- Use bullet points for lists
- Highlight key information (bold or colored text)
- Provide table of contents for long documents

### 4. Regular Updates
- Review policies every 6 months
- Update "Last Updated" date whenever changes are made
- Notify users of material changes (email + in-app banner)

### 5. Legal Review
- All generated documents should be reviewed by a qualified attorney
- Especially important for healthcare (HIPAA) and EU markets (GDPR)
