# Ecosystem Mapping Reporter Skill

## Domain Knowledge
- **Source Document**: `LORS_ Lunar Rover Standard proposition.md`
- **Primary Data Sources**:
  - `rovers/` (directory of rover profiles)
  - `landers/` (directory of lander profiles)
  - `SPACE_ENTITIES.MD`
  - `missions/` (directory of mission profiles)
  - `LUNAR_MISSIONS.MD` (Index)
  - `STUDENT_ROVER_TEAMS.MD`
  - `STANDARDS_AND_DOCS.MD`
- **Dynamic Data Sources**:
  - Technical PDFs (Payload User Guides - PUGs) located in `data/` or workspace.
  - HTML/Text data exports in `data/`.

## Instructions
1. **Data Discovery**:
   - Before profiling, scan the workspace (specifically `data/` folder) for any available PDF Payload User Guides (PUGs) or other technical documentation. Use this information to enrich the profiles.

2. **Rover Project Profiling**:
   - Profile 8-10 current lunar rover projects.
   - For each project, identify the developer, mission status, and key objectives.
   - Cross-reference with the `rovers/` directory files. Use `LUNAR_ROVERS.MD` only as a quick index.
   - Cross-reference with `STUDENT_ROVER_TEAMS.MD` and `missions/` (using `LUNAR_MISSIONS.MD` as index) for context.

3. **Delivery Provider Assessment**:
   - Assess 3-5 lunar delivery providers (landers/transport).
   - Analyze their capabilities, payload capacity, and compatibility with rovers.
   - Cross-reference with the `landers/` directory files. Use `LUNAR_LANDERS.MD` only as a quick index.
   - Cross-reference with `SPACE_ENTITIES.MD` and `missions/` (using `LUNAR_MISSIONS.MD` as index).

4. **High-Level System Approach**:
   - Describe the general approach for each profiled project.
   - Identify common trends (e.g., cube rovers, swarm architectures) and divergent strategies.

5. **Report Writing Standards**:
   - **Academic/Scientific Rigor**: Reports should be analytical and evidence-based, using technical terminology appropriately.
   - **Simplicity & Accessibility**: Write clearly and concisely. Avoid unnecessary jargon. Explain complex concepts in straightforward language.
   - **References**: Use standard Markdown footnotes for all citations.
     - **Strict Format**: `[^1]: <Description>, [<Filename>](../<path_to_file>)`
     - **Example**: `[^1]: Astrobotic Griffin PUG, [landers/GRIFFIN.MD](../landers/GRIFFIN.MD)`
   - **Structure**: Use clear headings, bullet points, and tables to enhance readability.
   - **Evidence-Based**: Every conclusion should be supported by data from the primary sources.

6. **Report Structure & Output**:
   - **Target Output File**: `reports/ECOSYSTEM_MAPPING.MD`
   - The output should support the creation of the "Ecosystem Mapping Document" (target length: 8-10 pages).
   - Expected sections: Executive Summary, Rover Project Profiles, Delivery Provider Assessment, Ecosystem Trends.
   - Include a references section listing all sources consulted.
