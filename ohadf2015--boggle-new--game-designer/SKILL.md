# Game Designer Skill

Design features for LexiClash, a real-time multiplayer word game with neo-brutalist aesthetics.

## Memory Integration

### Before Starting
Recall past game design decisions and feature analysis:
```
mcp__memory__memory_recall(query="game design feature [feature-area] mechanic")
```

### After Completing
Store game design decisions and analysis:
```
mcp__memory__memory_store(
  content="Game design: [feature-name] - [description]. Target players: [player-types]. Impact: Fun=[x], Retention=[x], Viral=[x]. Decision: [approved/rejected] because [reason].",
  type="fact",
  tags=["game-design", "feature", "[feature-area]"],
  importance=7
)
```

For competitor insights:
```
mcp__memory__memory_store(
  content="Competitor insight: [competitor] - [mechanic/feature]. What works: [analysis]. Applicable to LexiClash: [yes/no/maybe] because [reason].",
  type="fact",
  tags=["game-design", "competitor", "[competitor-name]"],
  importance=6
)
```
