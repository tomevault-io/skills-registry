# Multi-Agent Workflow

## Overview

This skill enables sophisticated parallel development workflows using multiple Claude instances working concurrently in separate git worktrees. The workflow consists of a manager session (current session), worker agents performing parallel implementations, and observer subagents monitoring progress and collecting results.

## Architecture

### Manager Session (Current Session)
- Orchestrates the entire workflow
- Distributes tasks to multiple worker agents
- Evaluates implementation results
- Selects and merges the best implementation

### Worker Agents (Git Worktrees)
- Execute in isolated git worktrees
- Implement the same task using different approaches
- Work independently and in parallel
- Each worker has its own branch

### Observer Subagent
- Monitors worker progress and status
- Collects implementation results
- Performs initial quality assessment
- Reports consolidated findings to manager

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Multiple implementation approaches should be explored simultaneously
- Complex tasks benefit from parallel A/B testing of different solutions
- You need to compare different algorithms or architectural patterns
- Time-sensitive development requires faster iteration through parallelization
- Exploring trade-offs between different technical approaches

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Task Distribution
The manager session:
- Receives implementation task from user
- Breaks down into parallelizable work units
- Sets up git worktrees for each worker
- Defines evaluation criteria

### 2. Parallel Execution
Worker agents:
- Receive specific implementation approach/variant
- Work in isolated git worktrees
- Implement, test, and commit independently
- Each uses different strategy or optimization

### 3. Monitoring & Collection
Observer subagent:
- Monitors all worker sessions
- Tracks completion status
- Collects implementation artifacts
- Runs preliminary quality checks (tests, lint, etc.)

### 4. Evaluation & Selection
Manager session:
- Reviews all implementations
- Compares based on criteria:
  - Code quality and maintainability
  - Performance metrics
  - Test coverage
  - Complexity and readability
  - Edge case handling
- Selects best implementation
- Merges into manager's target branch

## Usage Instructions

### Step 1: Initialize Multi-Agent Workflow

```
You (Manager): I need to implement [feature/fix] using multi-agent workflow.
Let's explore [N] different approaches:
1. Approach A: [description]
2. Approach B: [description]
3. Approach N: [description]

Evaluation criteria:
- [criterion 1]
- [criterion 2]
- [criterion N]
```

### Step 2: Set Up Worktrees

The manager uses the setup script to create git worktrees:

```bash
./.claude/skills/multi-agent-workflow/scripts/setup-worktrees.sh \
  --base-branch "claude/multi-agent-workflow-$(date +%s)" \
  --num-workers 3 \
  --task-id "feature-implementation"
```

This creates:
- `worktree-1/` with branch `worker-1/feature-implementation`
- `worktree-2/` with branch `worker-2/feature-implementation`
- `worktree-3/` with branch `worker-3/feature-implementation`

### Step 3: Launch Worker Agents

The manager launches worker Claude instances in each worktree using Task tool:

```
Send a single message with multiple Task tool calls:
- Task 1: Worker agent 1 - Implement using approach A
- Task 2: Worker agent 2 - Implement using approach B
- Task 3: Worker agent 3 - Implement using approach C
- Task 4: Observer agent - Monitor all workers and collect results
```

Each worker receives:
- Task description
- Specific implementation approach
- Evaluation criteria
- Worktree path to work in

### Step 4: Observer Monitoring

The observer subagent:
- Periodically checks worker progress
- Collects completed implementations
- Runs automated quality checks
- Compiles comparison report

### Step 5: Evaluation and Selection

Manager receives observer report containing:
- Implementation summaries
- Test results
- Performance metrics
- Code quality analysis

Manager evaluates and selects best implementation:
```bash
./.claude/skills/multi-agent-workflow/scripts/evaluate-results.sh \
  --worktrees "worktree-1 worktree-2 worktree-3" \
  --criteria "performance,maintainability,test-coverage" \
  --output "evaluation-report.md"
```

### Step 6: Accept Best Implementation

Manager merges selected implementation:
```bash
git checkout claude/multi-agent-workflow-[timestamp]
git merge --no-ff worker-2/feature-implementation
git worktree remove worktree-1 worktree-2 worktree-3
```

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Algorithm Optimization
**Task**: Implement data processing pipeline
**Workers**:
- Worker 1: Stream processing approach
- Worker 2: Batch processing approach
- Worker 3: Hybrid approach
**Criteria**: Performance, memory usage, code simplicity

### Scenario 2: UI Component Design
**Task**: Create user authentication form
**Workers**:
- Worker 1: Material UI components
- Worker 2: Custom styled components
- Worker 3: Headless UI with Tailwind
**Criteria**: Accessibility, bundle size, maintainability

### Scenario 3: API Implementation
**Task**: Build REST API endpoint
**Workers**:
- Worker 1: Express with middleware pattern
- Worker 2: Fastify with schema validation
- Worker 3: Next.js API routes
**Criteria**: Performance, type safety, error handling

### Scenario 4: Bug Fix Exploration
**Task**: Fix complex race condition
**Workers**:
- Worker 1: Mutex locks approach
- Worker 2: Event queue approach
- Worker 3: Refactor to eliminate shared state
**Criteria**: Correctness, simplicity, performance impact

## Best Practices

### Task Design
1. **Clear Constraints**: Define exact scope and boundaries for each worker
2. **Distinct Approaches**: Ensure each worker uses meaningfully different strategy
3. **Measurable Criteria**: Set objective, quantifiable evaluation metrics
4. **Realistic Scope**: Size tasks appropriately for parallel completion (30min-2hrs)

### Worker Management
1. **Isolation**: Ensure workers don't interfere with each other
2. **Clear Prompts**: Provide specific implementation guidance to each worker
3. **Resource Limits**: Consider computational resources when setting worker count
4. **Status Updates**: Request periodic progress updates from workers

### Observer Configuration
1. **Monitoring Frequency**: Balance between responsiveness and overhead
2. **Quality Gates**: Define automated checks (tests pass, lint clean, etc.)
3. **Reporting Format**: Structure observer reports for easy comparison
4. **Early Termination**: Allow observer to flag critical failures early

### Evaluation Process
1. **Objective Metrics**: Prioritize quantifiable measurements
2. **Code Review**: Manually review final candidates
3. **Testing**: Run comprehensive test suites on all implementations
4. **Documentation**: Require workers to document their approach
5. **Hybrid Solutions**: Consider combining best aspects of multiple implementations

## Scripts Reference

### setup-worktrees.sh
Creates git worktrees for parallel development.

**Usage**:
```bash
./scripts/setup-worktrees.sh --base-branch <name> --num-workers <n> --task-id <id>
```

### launch-worker.sh
Launches Claude worker instance in specified worktree.

**Usage**:
```bash
./scripts/launch-worker.sh --worktree <path> --task <description> --approach <strategy>
```

### evaluate-results.sh
Evaluates and compares worker implementations.

**Usage**:
```bash
./scripts/evaluate-results.sh --worktrees <paths> --criteria <metrics> --output <file>
```

## Troubleshooting

### Worker Conflicts
If workers modify the same files unexpectedly:
- Review task scope definitions
- Ensure worktrees are properly isolated
- Check that workers are using correct branches

### Observer Failures
If observer can't collect results:
- Verify worker completion status
- Check file paths and permissions
- Review observer monitoring configuration

### Evaluation Ambiguity
If no clear best implementation emerges:
- Refine evaluation criteria
- Consider hybrid approach combining strengths
- Run additional targeted comparisons
- Consult with user on priorities

## Tips

- Start with 2-3 workers for first multi-agent workflow
- Document evaluation criteria before launching workers
- Use observer to catch issues early rather than waiting for completion
- Consider running test suites as part of automated evaluation
- Keep implementation approaches distinct enough to yield meaningful comparison
- Archive all worker implementations for future reference, not just selected one

## Integration with Other Skills

- **parallel-explore**: Use before multi-agent-workflow to identify implementation approaches
- **code-review**: Apply to all worker implementations before final selection
- **testing**: Ensure each worker includes comprehensive test coverage
