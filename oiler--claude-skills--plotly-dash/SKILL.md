Use when user asks to create dashboards, interactive tables, data browsers, Dash apps, or mentions "Dash", "plotly", "DataTable", "dash callbacks", "dcc", or "dash_table". Covers app structure, callbacks, layouts, DataTable with server-side paging/sorting/filtering, database integration (SQLite/Postgres), multi-page apps, and self-hosted deployment with gunicorn/nginx.

# Plotly Dash Expert

Expert guidance for building self-hosted Plotly Dash applications focused on browsing large datasets with interactive tables, callbacks, and database-backed ETL pipelines.

## Important: Scope and Constraints

This skill targets **open-source Dash** deployed self-hosted. The following are **Enterprise-only** and must never be used or recommended:
- `dash-design-kit` (DDK) — Enterprise styling library
- `dash-snapshots` / Snapshot Engine — PDF/link sharing
- `dash-enterprise-auth` — Enterprise authentication
- `EnterpriseDash()` constructor
- Dashboard Engine / Dashboard Toolkit
- Job Queue (Enterprise managed) — use `background=True` callbacks with DiskCache or Celery instead
- Plotly Cloud publishing via dev tools — deploy with gunicorn instead
- Data Science Workspaces

For styling, use open-source alternatives: `dash-bootstrap-components`, `dash-mantine-components`, or custom CSS in the `assets/` folder.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Understand the Request

Identify what the user needs:
- **New app from scratch** — scaffold the full app structure
- **Add a feature** — callbacks, new page, table, filter controls
- **Database integration** — SQLite or Postgres connection, ETL
- **Deployment** — gunicorn, nginx, Docker setup
- **Debug/fix** — callback issues, layout problems, performance

### Step 2: Scaffold or Modify the App

For new apps, consult `references/app-structure.md` for the standard project layout and boilerplate.

For callbacks, consult `references/callbacks-guide.md` for patterns including chained callbacks, State, PreventUpdate, Patch, background callbacks, and clientside callbacks.

For DataTable with server-side operations on large datasets, consult `references/datatable-guide.md` for backend paging, sorting, and filtering patterns.

For database integration and ETL, consult `references/database-etl.md` for SQLite/Postgres connection patterns, query helpers, and data transformation pipelines.

### Step 3: Validate

Before delivering code:
1. Verify all imports use current Dash 3.x/4.x syntax (`from dash import Dash, html, dcc, callback, Input, Output, State`)
2. Confirm no Enterprise-only imports or features are used
3. Check that callbacks have proper error handling (PreventUpdate for missing inputs)
4. For DataTable: ensure backend paging/sorting/filtering when dataset exceeds ~1000 rows
5. For deployment: verify gunicorn command references `app.server` (the Flask instance)

## Key Dash Concepts (Quick Reference)

**Current version**: Dash 3.3.0+ (docs say 3.3.0, PyPI has 4.0.0). Built on Flask.

**Core imports**:
```python
from dash import Dash, html, dcc, dash_table, callback, Input, Output, State, Patch, no_update
from dash.exceptions import PreventUpdate
```

**App initialization**:
```python
app = Dash(__name__)
server = app.server  # Flask instance — needed for gunicorn
```

**Layout**: A list or tree of components. Since Dash 2.17, layout can be a plain list:
```python
app.layout = [
    html.H1("Title"),
    dcc.Dropdown(id="my-dropdown", options=["A", "B", "C"], value="A"),
    html.Div(id="output")
]
```

**Callbacks**: Reactive functions that fire when Input properties change:
```python
@callback(
    Output("output", "children"),
    Input("my-dropdown", "value")
)
def update(value):
    return f"Selected: {value}"
```

**State**: Read a property without triggering the callback:
```python
@callback(
    Output("output", "children"),
    Input("submit-btn", "n_clicks"),
    State("my-input", "value")
)
def on_submit(n_clicks, value):
    if not n_clicks:
        raise PreventUpdate
    return f"Submitted: {value}"
```

**Multi-page apps**: Use `dash.register_page` and `pages/` directory:
```python
# app.py
app = Dash(__name__, use_pages=True)
app.layout = html.Div([dash.page_container])

# pages/home.py
import dash
dash.register_page(__name__, path="/")
layout = html.Div("Home page")
```

## Troubleshooting

### Callback not firing
- Check component `id` matches between layout and callback decorator
- Verify the component exists in the initial layout (or set `suppress_callback_exceptions=True`)
- For dynamic layouts, IDs must be defined before app starts

### DataTable shows no data
- Ensure `data` is a list of dicts: `df.to_dict('records')`
- Ensure `columns` is `[{"name": col, "id": col} for col in df.columns]`

### Gunicorn shows static page with no interactivity
- Serve `app.server`, not `app`: `gunicorn app:server` where `server = app.server`
- Do NOT use `app.run()` in production — that starts the dev server

### Callbacks modify global state
- Never modify variables outside callback scope
- Use `dcc.Store` to share data between callbacks
- For expensive computations, use caching (`flask_caching` or `diskcache`)

### Performance with large datasets
- Use backend paging/sorting/filtering (see `references/datatable-guide.md`)
- Avoid sending full dataframe to browser — paginate server-side
- Use `Patch()` for partial property updates instead of rebuilding entire figures
