## Core Framework Guidelines

### PyTorch

When reviewing or writing PyTorch code, apply these guidelines:

- Use `torch.nn.Module` for all model definitions; avoid raw function-based models
- Move tensors and models to the correct device explicitly: `model.to(device)`, `tensor.to(device)`
- Use `model.train()` and `model.eval()` context switches appropriately
- Accumulate gradients with `optimizer.zero_grad()` at the top of the training loop
- Use `torch.no_grad()` or `@torch.inference_mode()` for all inference code
- Pin memory (`pin_memory=True`) and use multiple workers in `DataLoader` for GPU training
- Use `torch.compile()` (PyTorch 2.x) for production inference speedups
- Prefer `F.cross_entropy` over manual softmax + NLLLoss (numerically stable)

### TensorFlow / Keras

When reviewing or writing TensorFlow code, apply these guidelines:

- Use the Keras functional API or subclassing API; avoid Sequential for complex models
- Prefer `tf.data.Dataset` pipelines over manual batching for scalability
- Use `tf.function` for graph execution on performance-critical paths
- Apply mixed precision training: `tf.keras.mixed_precision.set_global_policy('mixed_float16')`
- Use `tf.saved_model` for portable model export; avoid pickling

### Hugging Face Transformers

When reviewing or writing Hugging Face code, apply these guidelines:

- Always use the tokenizer associated with the model checkpoint
- Set `padding=True` and `truncation=True` when tokenizing batches
- Use `AutoModel`, `AutoTokenizer`, and `AutoConfig` for checkpoint portability
- Apply `model.gradient_checkpointing_enable()` to reduce memory for large models
- Use `Trainer` API for standard fine-tuning; use custom loops only when `Trainer` is insufficient
- Cache models with `TRANSFORMERS_CACHE` environment variable in CI/CD pipelines

### scikit-learn

When reviewing or writing scikit-learn code, apply these guidelines:

- Use `Pipeline` to chain preprocessing and model steps; prevents data leakage
- Use `StratifiedKFold` for classification tasks with class imbalance
- Prefer `GridSearchCV` or `RandomizedSearchCV` for hyperparameter tuning
- Always call `.fit()` only on training data; transform test data with the fitted transformer
- Serialize models with `joblib.dump` / `joblib.load` (faster than pickle for large arrays)

## LLM Integration Patterns

### Prompt Engineering

- Structure prompts with a clear system message, context, and user instruction
- Use few-shot examples in the system prompt for consistent output formatting
- Apply chain-of-thought prompting (`"Think step by step..."`) for complex reasoning tasks
- Set `temperature=0` for deterministic, fact-based outputs; increase for creative tasks
- Manage token budgets explicitly: estimate prompt tokens before sending
- Implement output parsing with structured formats (JSON mode, XML tags)

### RAG Pipelines

```python
# Standard RAG pipeline components
from langchain.embeddings import HuggingFaceEmbeddings
from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS  # or Chroma, Pinecone, Weaviate
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA

# 1. Embed and index documents
embeddings = HuggingFaceEmbeddings(model_name="sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2")
vectorstore = FAISS.from_documents(documents, embeddings)

# 2. Retrieve relevant chunks
retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever(search_kwargs={"k": 4})

# 3. Generate with retrieved context
chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(llm=llm, retriever=retriever)
```

RAG best practices:

- Chunk documents at natural boundaries (paragraphs, sections), not fixed character counts
- Use hybrid retrieval: combine dense embeddings with sparse BM25 for better recall
- Implement semantic caching for repeated queries to reduce latency and cost
- Validate retrieved context relevance before passing to the LLM
- Store metadata alongside embeddings for filtering (date, source, author)

### LangChain / LangGraph

- Use `LCEL` (LangChain Expression Language) for composable chains
- Apply `RunnableParallel` for concurrent retrieval steps
- Use `LangGraph` for stateful multi-agent workflows with cycles
- Implement retry logic with `RunnableRetry` for unreliable external calls
- Trace and evaluate chains with LangSmith in development

## Training Loop Standards

```python
# Standard PyTorch training loop with best practices
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    model.train()
    for batch in train_dataloader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        inputs, labels = batch["input_ids"].to(device), batch["labels"].to(device)
        outputs = model(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
        loss.backward()
        torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(model.parameters(), max_norm=1.0)  # gradient clipping
        optimizer.step()
        scheduler.step()

    # Validation loop
    model.eval()
    with torch.no_grad():
        for batch in val_dataloader:
            # evaluate...
```

Key standards:

- Proper train/validation/test splits: 80/10/10 or stratified for imbalanced datasets
- Gradient clipping (`max_norm=1.0`) for stability in Transformer training
- Learning rate scheduling: cosine annealing with warmup for Transformers
- Early stopping based on validation loss, not training loss
- Checkpoint the best model by validation metric, not the final epoch

## Fine-Tuning Standards

### Full Fine-Tuning

- Reduce learning rate 10-100x compared to training from scratch
- Freeze early layers; fine-tune upper layers and task head first
- Use discriminative learning rates: lower LR for frozen layers, higher for new layers
- Apply label smoothing (`smoothing=0.1`) to reduce overconfidence

### Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)

```python
from peft import LoraConfig, get_peft_model, TaskType

lora_config = LoraConfig(
    task_type=TaskType.CAUSAL_LM,
    r=16,               # LoRA rank
    lora_alpha=32,      # scaling factor
    target_modules=["q_proj", "v_proj"],
    lora_dropout=0.05,
)
model = get_peft_model(base_model, lora_config)
model.print_trainable_parameters()  # verify < 1% parameters trainable
```

PEFT guidelines:

- Use LoRA rank `r=8` to `r=64`; higher rank = more capacity, more memory
- QLoRA (4-bit quantization + LoRA) for fine-tuning 7B+ models on consumer GPUs
- Merge adapter weights before serving to eliminate inference overhead
- Prefer adapter-based methods over full fine-tuning for limited data (< 10K examples)

## MLOps and Experiment Tracking

### MLflow

```python
import mlflow

with mlflow.start_run():
    mlflow.log_params({"learning_rate": lr, "batch_size": bs, "epochs": epochs})
    mlflow.log_metrics({"train_loss": loss, "val_accuracy": acc}, step=epoch)
    mlflow.pytorch.log_model(model, "model")
```

### Weights & Biases

```python
import wandb

wandb.init(project="my-project", config={"lr": 1e-4, "epochs": 10})
wandb.log({"train_loss": loss, "val_f1": f1_score})
wandb.finish()
```

MLOps standards:

- Log every hyperparameter and dataset version before training starts
- Track system metrics (GPU utilization, memory, throughput) alongside model metrics
- Version datasets with DVC or Delta Lake; never overwrite raw data
- Use reproducible seeds: `torch.manual_seed(42)`, `np.random.seed(42)`, `random.seed(42)`
- Register production models in a model registry with stage gates (Staging → Production)

## Model Evaluation Standards

### Metrics by Task Type

| Task                  | Primary Metrics                      | Secondary Metrics         |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Binary Classification | AUC-ROC, F1, Precision/Recall        | Calibration (Brier Score) |
| Multi-class           | Macro F1, Weighted F1, Cohen's Kappa | Confusion Matrix          |
| Regression            | RMSE, MAE, R²                        | Residual Analysis         |
| NLP Generation        | BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore               | Human Evaluation          |
| Ranking/Retrieval     | NDCG@k, MRR, MAP                     | Hit Rate@k                |
| LLM Evaluation        | LLM-as-judge, exact match, pass@k    | Hallucination Rate        |

### Evaluation Best Practices

- Never tune hyperparameters on the test set; use a held-out validation set
- Report confidence intervals (bootstrap or cross-validation) for all metrics
- Disaggregate metrics by subgroup for fairness analysis
- Use statistical significance tests (McNemar, paired t-test) when comparing models
- Establish a simple baseline before reporting model results

## Production ML Systems

### Model Deployment

- Export to ONNX for cross-platform inference: `torch.onnx.export(model, ...)`
- Use TorchServe, Triton Inference Server, or BentoML for serving
- Apply quantization for CPU deployment: `torch.quantization.quantize_dynamic(model, ...)`
- Set up batching with a maximum batch size and timeout for throughput vs latency tradeoffs
- Use model warming (pre-load and dummy inference) to eliminate cold-start latency

### Monitoring and Drift Detection

```python
# Example: data drift detection with Evidently
from evidently.report import Report
from evidently.metric_preset import DataDriftPreset

report = Report(metrics=[DataDriftPreset()])
report.run(reference_data=reference_df, current_data=production_df)
report.save_html("drift_report.html")
```

Monitoring standards:

- Track feature distribution drift (KS test, PSI) on a daily schedule
- Alert on prediction distribution shift (concept drift)
- Log and sample model inputs/outputs for downstream evaluation
- Implement shadow mode (run new model alongside production, compare outputs)
- Define retraining triggers based on drift thresholds, not fixed schedules

## Data Preprocessing Standards

```python
# Proper train/test split to avoid leakage
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42, stratify=y  # stratify for classification
)

# Fit scaler ONLY on training data
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)  # transform only, never fit_transform
```

Standards:

- Separate preprocessing pipeline per data modality (text, image, tabular)
- Validate schema and types before entering the pipeline
- Handle missing values with domain-aware strategies (median, mode, forward-fill)
- Detect and document outliers; do not silently remove them
- Apply augmentation only to training data, never validation or test data

## Iron Laws

1. **ALWAYS fix random seeds and log all hyperparameters before training** — non-reproducible experiments cannot be shared, audited, or debugged; use `torch.manual_seed(42)`, `np.random.seed(42)`, `random.seed(42)` and log via MLflow/W&B.
2. **NEVER fit preprocessing transformers on test data** — fit only on training data, then `.transform()` test; fitting on test causes data leakage and inflated performance estimates.
3. **ALWAYS evaluate with multiple metrics aligned to business goals** — never report accuracy alone on imbalanced datasets; use F1, precision-recall curve, and ROC-AUC at minimum.
4. **NEVER tune hyperparameters on the test set** — use a held-out validation set for tuning; the test set is a one-time final evaluation only.
5. **ALWAYS establish a simple baseline before reporting model results** — a heuristic or random baseline is mandatory; without it, model quality cannot be assessed.

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern                   | Problem                           | Fix                                               |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Ignoring class imbalance       | Model biased to majority class    | Stratified sampling, class weights, SMOTE         |
| No validation set              | Overfitting undetected            | Hold out 10-20% for validation                    |
| Optimizing a single metric     | Missing failure modes             | Multiple metrics (precision, recall, F1, AUC)     |
| No baseline comparison         | Cannot assess model quality       | Establish heuristic baseline before ML            |
| Accuracy on imbalanced data    | Misleading performance estimate   | Use F1, precision-recall curve, ROC-AUC           |
| Data leakage (test in train)   | Inflated performance estimates    | Fit on train only; transform test with fitted obj |
| No error analysis              | Cannot improve strategically      | Analyze failure cases by error type               |
| Training without checkpoints   | Lost progress on failure          | Save best model by validation metric              |
| Mutable global random state    | Non-reproducible experiments      | Fix all seeds; log in experiment metadata         |
| Embedding model in application | Cannot update model independently | Serve model via API (REST, gRPC)                  |
| No latency budget              | Inference too slow for production | Profile and set SLO before deployment             |
