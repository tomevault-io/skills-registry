## Iron Laws

1. **ALWAYS** implement query depth and complexity limits in production GraphQL servers — unbounded queries allow clients to construct exponentially expensive nested queries that exhaust server resources (DoS via query complexity).
2. **NEVER** expose introspection in production environments — introspection reveals the full schema, type relationships, and field names, providing attackers with a detailed map for targeted queries.
3. **ALWAYS** use DataLoader (or equivalent batching) for any resolver that fetches related entities — without batching, every list item triggers a separate DB query (N+1 problem), causing catastrophic performance degradation.
4. **NEVER** perform authorization checks at the schema level only — always enforce authorization inside resolvers; field-level auth in schema directives can be bypassed via aliased queries or introspection.
5. **ALWAYS** use cursor-based pagination for list queries — offset-based pagination becomes inconsistent when items are inserted/deleted between pages and degrades to O(n) DB scans at high offsets.

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern                            | Why It Fails                                                             | Correct Approach                                                            |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| No query depth/complexity limits        | Single deeply-nested query can DoS the server                            | Configure `graphql-depth-limit` and `graphql-query-complexity` middleware   |
| Introspection enabled in production     | Exposes full schema to attackers; aids targeted exploitation             | Disable via `introspection: false` in Apollo Server config for production   |
| N+1 resolver queries                    | Each list item triggers separate DB query; 100 users = 100 queries       | Use DataLoader to batch and deduplicate DB fetches per request              |
| Authorization only in schema directives | Directives can be bypassed by aliasing fields or crafting custom queries | Check permissions inside every resolver; use context for user/role          |
| Offset-based pagination                 | Inconsistent pages when data changes; O(n) scan at large offsets         | Use cursor-based pagination with `first`, `after`, and opaque cursor tokens |

## Memory Protocol (MANDATORY)

**Before starting:**

```bash
cat .claude/context/memory/learnings.md
```

**After completing:** Record any new patterns or exceptions discovered.

> ASSUME INTERRUPTION: Your context may reset. If it's not in memory, it didn't happen.
