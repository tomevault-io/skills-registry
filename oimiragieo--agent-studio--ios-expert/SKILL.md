### swiftui general rules

When reviewing or writing code, apply these guidelines:

- You are an expert in coding with Swift and SwiftUI.
- Always write maintainable and clean code.
- Focus on the latest August, September 2024 version of the documentation and features.
- Descriptions should be short and concise.
- Don't remove any comments.

### swiftui project structure rules

When reviewing or writing code, apply these guidelines:

- Enforce the following SwiftUI project structure:
  - The main folder contains a "Sources" folder with:
    - "App" for main files
    - "Views" divided into "Home" and "Profile" sections with their ViewModels
    - "Shared" for reusable components and modifiers
  - "Models" for data models
  - "ViewModels" for view-specific logic
  - "Services" with:
    - "Network" for networking
    - "Persistence" for data storage
  - "Utilities" for extensions, constants, and helpers
  - The "Resources" folder holds:
    - "Assets" for images and colors
    - "Localization" for localized strings
    - "Fonts" for custom fonts
  - The "Tests" folder includes:
    - "UnitTests" for unit testing
    - "UITests" for UI testing

### swiftui ui design rules

When reviewing or writing code, apply these guidelines:

- Use Built-in Components: Utilize SwiftUI's native UI elements like List, NavigationView, TabView, and SF Symbols for a polished, iOS-consistent look.
- Master Layout Tools: Employ VStack, HStack, ZStack, Spacer, and Padding for responsive designs; use LazyVGrid and LazyHGrid for grids; GeometryReader for dynamic layouts.
- Add Visual Flair: Enhance UIs with shadows, gradients, blurs, custom shapes, and animations using the .animation() modifier for smooth transitions.
- Design for Interaction: Incorporate gestures (swipes, long presses), haptic feedback, clear navigation, and responsive elements to improve user engagement and satisfaction.

## Iron Laws

1. **ALWAYS** use `@MainActor` for UI updates — SwiftUI and UIKit views must be modified on the main thread; background thread UI updates cause runtime crashes or silent visual corruption.
2. **NEVER** use `@State` for data that is shared between views — `@State` is local to the view and does not propagate changes to siblings or parents; use `@ObservedObject`, `@EnvironmentObject`, or `@StateObject` for shared model data.
3. **ALWAYS** implement proper memory management with `[weak self]` in closures that capture `self` — strong self capture in closures that are held by the captured object creates retain cycles and memory leaks.
4. **NEVER** perform network or disk I/O on the main thread — synchronous I/O on the main thread blocks the run loop, causes UI freezes, and triggers watchdog terminations.
5. **ALWAYS** use `const` constructors and mark SwiftUI views as `struct` — class-based SwiftUI views lose automatic diffing optimization; struct views enable efficient identity tracking.

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern                          | Why It Fails                                                                            | Correct Approach                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| UI updates from background threads    | UIKit/SwiftUI are not thread-safe; random crashes, visual corruption, or silent failure | Dispatch to main: `DispatchQueue.main.async` or `@MainActor` annotated functions |
| `@State` for shared model data        | State is private to the view; sibling views don't see changes; inconsistent UI          | Use `@StateObject` + `@ObservableObject` for model; pass via `@ObservedObject`   |
| Strong self capture in async closures | Retain cycles prevent deallocation; memory grows unbounded                              | `[weak self]` in all closures that are held beyond the current scope             |
| Synchronous network calls             | Blocks main thread; triggers ANR/watchdog; UI freezes                                   | Use `async/await` with `URLSession.data(for:)` or Combine; always on background  |
| Class-based SwiftUI views             | Opt out of struct diffing optimization; slower rendering; lifecycle issues              | Define all views as `struct`; only use `class` for `ObservableObject` models     |

## Memory Protocol (MANDATORY)

**Before starting:**

```bash
cat .claude/context/memory/learnings.md
```

**After completing:** Record any new patterns or exceptions discovered.

> ASSUME INTERRUPTION: Your context may reset. If it's not in memory, it didn't happen.
