### nextjs expert

### next js

When reviewing or writing code, apply these guidelines:

- Follow Next.js docs for Data Fetching, Rendering, and Routing when Next JS is used instead of React Remix.

### next js 14 general rules

When reviewing or writing code, apply these guidelines:

- Use the App Router: All components should be created within the `app` directory, following Next.js 14 conventions.
- Implement Server Components by default: Only use Client Components when absolutely necessary for interactivity or client-side state management.
- Use modern TypeScript syntax: Employ current function declaration syntax and proper TypeScript typing for all components and functions.
- Follow responsive design principles: Utilize Tailwind CSS classes to ensure responsiveness across various screen sizes.
- Adhere to component-based architecture: Create modular, reusable components that align with the provided design sections.
- Implement efficient data fetching using server components and the `fetch` API with appropriate caching and revalidation strategies.
- Use Next.js 14's metadata API for SEO optimization.
- Employ Next.js Image component for optimized image loading.
- Ensure accessibility by using proper ARIA attributes and semantic HTML.
- Implement error handling using error boundaries and error.tsx files.
- Use loading.tsx files for managing loading states.
- Utilize route handlers (route.ts) for API routes in the App Router.
- Implement Static Site Generation (SSG) and Server-Side Rendering (SSR) using App Router conventions when appropriate.

### next js 15 async request api rules

When reviewing or writing code, apply these guidelines:

- Always use async versions of runtime APIs:
  typescript
  const cookieStore = await cookies()
  const headersList = await headers()
  const { isEnabled } = await draftMode()
- Handle async params in layouts/pages:
  typescript
  const params = await props.params
  const searchParams = await props.searchParams

## Iron Laws

1. **ALWAYS** use the App Router (`app/` directory) for all new Next.js 13+ routes — the Pages Router is legacy; mixing both creates conflicting rendering contexts and blocks Server Components.
2. **NEVER** add `'use client'` by default — every component is a Server Component unless it needs browser APIs, event listeners, or client state; unnecessary `'use client'` negates streaming and server caching.
3. **ALWAYS** await async Request APIs (`cookies()`, `headers()`, `params`, `searchParams`) in Next.js 15+ — synchronous access throws in strict mode and breaks PPR behavior.
4. **NEVER** omit `error.tsx` and `loading.tsx` at route segments — without them, errors bubble to root and unmount the entire page; segment-level files enable granular error recovery and streaming UI.
5. **ALWAYS** use `next/image` with `fill` and `sizes` for fluid images — hard-coded width/height on fluid images causes layout shift that fails Core Web Vitals (CLS).

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern                                         | Why It Fails                                                               | Correct Approach                                                                           |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Using Pages Router for new routes                    | Cannot use Server Components, streaming, or cacheComponents                | Use App Router (`app/` directory) for all new routes; migrate incrementally                |
| Adding `'use client'` by default                     | Forces client-side rendering; inflates bundle; loses streaming and caching | Keep server-only; add `'use client'` only when browser APIs or event handlers are required |
| Synchronous `cookies()` / `headers()` in Next.js 15+ | Throws in strict mode; breaks PPR; deprecated API                          | Await all Request APIs: `const cookieStore = await cookies()`                              |
| Hard-coded width/height on fluid images              | Layout shifts fail CLS Core Web Vitals                                     | Use `fill` with `sizes` for fluid containers; exact dimensions only for fixed-size images  |
| Missing `error.tsx` at route segments                | Errors bubble to root; entire page unmounts on any error                   | Add `error.tsx` and `loading.tsx` at each segment; use `Suspense` for streaming            |

## Memory Protocol (MANDATORY)

**Before starting:**

```bash
cat .claude/context/memory/learnings.md
```

**After completing:** Record any new patterns or exceptions discovered.

> ASSUME INTERRUPTION: Your context may reset. If it's not in memory, it didn't happen.
