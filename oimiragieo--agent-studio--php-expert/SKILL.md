### laravel best practices rules

When reviewing or writing code, apply these guidelines:

- Use Eloquent ORM instead of raw SQL queries when possible.
- Implement Repository pattern for data access layer.
- Use Laravel's built-in authentication and authorization features.
- Utilize Laravel's caching mechanisms for improved performance.
- Implement job queues for long-running tasks.
- Use Laravel's built-in testing tools (PHPUnit, Dusk) for unit and feature tests.
- Implement API versioning for public APIs.
- Use Laravel's localization features for multi-language support.
- Implement proper CSRF protection and security measures.
- Use Laravel Mix for asset compilation.
- Implement proper database indexing for improved query performance.
- Use Laravel's built-in pagination features.
- Implement proper error logging and monitoring.

### laravel package coding standards

When reviewing or writing code, apply these guidelines:

- File names: Use kebab-case (e.g., my-class-file.php)
- Class and Enum names: Use PascalCase (e.g., MyClass)
- Method names: Use camelCase (e.g., myMethod)
- Variable and Properties names: Use snake_case (e.g., my_variable)
- Constants and Enum Cases names: Use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., MY_CONSTANT)

### laravel package development guidelines

When reviewing or writing code, apply these guidelines:

- Use PHP 8.3+ features where appropriate
- Follow Laravel conventions and best practices
- Utilize the spatie/laravel-package-tools boilerplate as a starting point
- Implement a default Pint configuration for code styling
- Prefer using helpers over facades when possible
- Focus on creating code that provides excellent developer experience (DX), better autocompletion, type safety, and comprehensive docblocks

### laravel package structure

When reviewing or writing code, apply these guidelines:

- Outline the directory structure for the package
- Describe the purpose of each main directory and key files
- Explain how the package will be integrated

## Iron Laws

1. **ALWAYS** use parameterized queries or Eloquent ORM — raw SQL with string interpolation is the primary SQL injection vector in PHP; Eloquent's query builder parameterizes all values automatically.
2. **NEVER** store passwords with `md5()` or `sha1()` — these are fast hashes that GPUs crack in seconds; use `password_hash()` with `PASSWORD_BCRYPT` or `PASSWORD_ARGON2ID` for all password storage.
3. **ALWAYS** declare `strict_types=1` at the top of every PHP file — without strict types, PHP silently coerces mismatched types, hiding bugs that only surface under unexpected inputs.
4. **NEVER** catch generic `\Exception` without re-throwing or specific handling — swallowing all exceptions masks errors and allows corrupt state to propagate silently through the application.
5. **ALWAYS** validate all user input at the controller boundary using Laravel's `$request->validate()` or Form Requests — never trust `$_GET`, `$_POST`, or `$_FILES` directly in business logic.

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern                                       | Why It Fails                                                         | Correct Approach                                                              |
| -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Raw SQL with string interpolation                  | Primary SQL injection vector; user input executed as SQL             | Use Eloquent ORM or PDO parameterized queries for all database access         |
| Passwords stored with md5() or sha1()              | Fast hashes cracked in seconds by GPU rainbow tables                 | Use `password_hash()` with `PASSWORD_BCRYPT` or `PASSWORD_ARGON2ID`           |
| Missing `strict_types=1`                           | PHP silently coerces types; bugs hide until unexpected inputs arrive | Declare `<?php declare(strict_types=1);` at the top of every PHP file         |
| Catching generic `\Exception` silently             | Masks errors; corrupt state propagates; impossible to debug          | Catch specific exceptions; log with context; re-throw or handle explicitly    |
| Directly using `$_GET`/`$_POST` without validation | Enables injection, XSS, and business logic bypass                    | Validate at controller boundary using `$request->validate()` or Form Requests |

## Memory Protocol (MANDATORY)

**Before starting:**

```bash
cat .claude/context/memory/learnings.md
```

**After completing:** Record any new patterns or exceptions discovered.

> ASSUME INTERRUPTION: Your context may reset. If it's not in memory, it didn't happen.
