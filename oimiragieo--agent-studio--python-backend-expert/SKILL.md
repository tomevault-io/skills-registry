<instructions>
### python backend expert

### alembic database migrations

When reviewing or writing code, apply these guidelines:

- Use alembic for database migrations.

### django class based views for htmx

When reviewing or writing code, apply these guidelines:

- Use Django's class-based views for HTMX responses

### django form handling

When reviewing or writing code, apply these guidelines:

- Implement Django forms for form handling
- Use Django's form validation for HTMX requests

### django forms

When reviewing or writing code, apply these guidelines:

- Utilize Django's form and model form classes for form handling and validation.
- Use Django's validation framework to validate form and model data.
- Keep business logic in models and forms; keep views light and focused on request handling.

### django framework rules

When reviewing or writing code, apply these guidelines:

- You always use the latest stable version of Django, and you are familiar with the latest features and best practices.

### django middleware

When reviewing or writing code, apply these guidelines:

- Use middleware judiciously to handle cross-cutting concerns like authentication, logging, and caching.
- Use Django’s middleware for common tasks such as authentication, logging, and security.

### django middleware for request response

When reviewing or writing code, apply these guidelines:

- Utilize Django's middleware for request/response processing

### django models

When reviewing or writing code, apply these guidelines:

- Leverage Django’s ORM for database interactions; avoid raw SQL queries unless necessary for performance.
- Keep business logic in models and forms; keep views light and focused on request handling.

### django orm for database operations

When reviewing or writing code, apply these guidelines:

- Implement Django ORM for database operations

### django rest framework

When reviewing or writing code, apply these guidelines:

- Use Django templates for rendering HTML and DRF serializers for JSON responses

### django 5.x features (2025+)

When reviewing or writing code, apply these guidelines:

- Django 5.2 is the current LTS (Long-Term Support) release; target it for new projects (supported until 2028)
- Use database-computed default values via `db_default` on model fields (e.g., `db_default=Now()`) instead of Python-side defaults where the database should own the value
- Use facet filters in the Django admin (`ModelAdmin.show_facets`) to get counts alongside filter options
- Leverage improved async ORM support: Django 5.x expands `async`-native queryset methods — prefer `await qs.acount()`, `await qs.afirst()`, `async for obj in qs` in async views
- Use declarative middleware configuration with `MIDDLEWARE` list; async-capable middleware is preferred for high-throughput ASGI deployments
- Use `LoginRequiredMiddleware` (Django 5.1+) instead of decorating every view when all views require authentication
- Use `GeneratedField` for database-generated columns (computed from other columns at the DB level)

### fastapi patterns (2025+)

When reviewing or writing code, apply these guidelines:

- Use the `lifespan` context manager (not deprecated `@app.on_event`) for startup/shutdown resource management:

  ```python
  from contextlib import asynccontextmanager
  from fastapi import FastAPI

  @asynccontextmanager
  async def lifespan(app: FastAPI):
      # startup: initialize DB pool, HTTP clients, caches
      app.state.db_pool = await create_pool()
      yield
      # shutdown: close resources
      await app.state.db_pool.close()

  app = FastAPI(lifespan=lifespan)
  ```

- Use Pydantic v2 models for all request/response schemas; Pydantic v2 is the default in FastAPI 0.100+. Use `model_config = ConfigDict(...)` instead of the inner `class Config`
- Use `pydantic-settings` (`BaseSettings`) with `lru_cache` for config management:

  ```python
  from functools import lru_cache
  from pydantic_settings import BaseSettings

  class Settings(BaseSettings):
      database_url: str
      model_config = ConfigDict(env_prefix="APP_")

  @lru_cache
  def get_settings() -> Settings:
      return Settings()
  ```

- Scope dependencies correctly: per-request (DB sessions, auth), router-level (audit logging, namespace caches), application lifespan (Kafka producers, feature flag SDKs, tracing exporters)
- Use `Annotated` type hints with `Depends` for cleaner dependency signatures:

  ```python
  from typing import Annotated
  from fastapi import Depends

  DbSession = Annotated[AsyncSession, Depends(get_db)]
  CurrentUser = Annotated[User, Depends(get_current_user)]
  ```

- Structure projects by domain: `routers/`, `services/`, `repositories/`, `schemas/`, `models/` — avoid flat single-file apps beyond prototypes
- Prefer `async def` path operations for I/O-bound routes; use `def` (sync) only for CPU-bound work that should run in a thread pool
- Use `APIRouter` with `prefix`, `tags`, and `dependencies` to group related routes and apply shared middleware

### sqlalchemy 2.0 async patterns (2025+)

When reviewing or writing code, apply these guidelines:

- Use `create_async_engine` + `async_sessionmaker` (not the deprecated `AsyncSession` factory directly); create one engine per service at application startup
- Use the new `Mapped` + `mapped_column` declarative style (SQLAlchemy 2.0+) instead of the legacy `Column` style:

  ```python
  from sqlalchemy.orm import DeclarativeBase, Mapped, mapped_column
  from sqlalchemy import String

  class Base(DeclarativeBase):
      pass

  class User(Base):
      __tablename__ = "users"
      id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(primary_key=True)
      email: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(String(255), unique=True)
      is_active: Mapped[bool] = mapped_column(default=True)
  ```

- Provide the DB session via FastAPI dependency injection using `async with` session scope:

  ```python
  from sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import AsyncSession, async_sessionmaker

  async_session = async_sessionmaker(engine, expire_on_commit=False)

  async def get_db() -> AsyncGenerator[AsyncSession, None]:
      async with async_session() as session:
          yield session
  ```

- Use `select()` (not the legacy `session.query()`) for all queries in SQLAlchemy 2.0+
- Use `selectinload` / `joinedload` explicitly to avoid implicit lazy-load I/O in async contexts (lazy loading raises `MissingGreenlet` in async)
- For upserts, use `insert().on_conflict_do_update()` (PostgreSQL) or the dialect-specific equivalent rather than separate select + update round trips
- Use connection pool sizing appropriate for async: async drivers (asyncpg, aiomysql) need smaller pools than sync drivers; `pool_size=5, max_overflow=10` is a safe default for moderate load

### python 3.13 / 3.14 features (2025+)

When reviewing or writing code, apply these guidelines:

- **Python 3.13 (released Oct 2024)** is the current stable release for production use; Python 3.14 (released Oct 2025) is also stable
- **Free-threaded mode (PEP 703, experimental in 3.13, maturing in 3.14):** The GIL can be disabled with `python3.13t` (free-threaded build). Avoid assuming GIL protection for shared mutable state in new code targeting 3.13+; use explicit locks or thread-safe data structures. Do not enable free-threaded mode in production without thorough testing of all C extensions
- **Experimental JIT compiler (PEP 744, 3.13+):** Opt-in with `PYTHON_JIT=1`. Provides measurable speedups for tight loops and numeric code. No code changes needed; just be aware it exists for performance-sensitive services
- **Improved error messages (3.13+):** Tracebacks are now syntax-highlighted in color by default. Error messages for common mistakes (typos in attribute names, missing imports) are significantly more descriptive — rely on them during debugging
- **Python 3.14 — Template strings / T-strings (PEP 750):** New `t"..."` string literals that defer interpolation, useful for safe SQL/HTML construction without injection risk. Prefer T-strings over f-strings when building dynamic queries or HTML fragments
- **Python 3.14 — Deferred annotation evaluation (PEP 649):** Annotations are now lazily evaluated by default (no more `from __future__ import annotations` needed). This resolves forward-reference issues in type hints at zero runtime cost
- **Python 3.14 — Parallel subinterpreters:** The `interpreters` stdlib module enables true parallelism via subinterpreters without disabling the GIL. Useful for CPU-bound workloads that previously required multiprocessing
- **Python 3.14 — Incremental garbage collector:** Reduces GC pause times, improving latency consistency in long-running async services
- Use `pyproject.toml` (not `setup.py` / `requirements.txt` alone) for all new projects; use `uv` or `pip` with `pyproject.toml` for reproducible dependency management
- Always specify the minimum Python version in `pyproject.toml` `requires-python` field

## Iron Laws

1. **ALWAYS** use the `lifespan` context manager for FastAPI startup/shutdown resource management — `@app.on_event` is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
2. **NEVER** use `session.query()` in SQLAlchemy 2.0+ — use `select()` with the 2.0-style API; legacy query API will be removed.
3. **ALWAYS** use parameterized queries or the ORM for all database operations — never construct SQL with string interpolation or f-strings (SQL injection vector).
4. **NEVER** perform blocking I/O in async FastAPI routes — use `async def` with awaitable drivers or `run_in_executor` for blocking operations to avoid event loop starvation.
5. **ALWAYS** validate all request data at the boundary using Pydantic v2 models — never pass raw request dicts into business logic layers.

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern                                          | Why It Fails                                            | Correct Approach                                                    |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Using `@app.on_event` for startup/shutdown            | Deprecated in FastAPI; will break on version upgrade    | Use `@asynccontextmanager` with `lifespan` parameter                |
| Using `session.query()` in SQLAlchemy 2.0+            | Legacy query API is deprecated and will be removed      | Use `select()` statements with `session.execute()`                  |
| Building SQL strings with f-strings or `%` formatting | SQL injection vulnerability; critical security flaw     | Use parameterized queries via ORM or `text()` with bound params     |
| Calling blocking I/O directly in `async def` routes   | Blocks the entire event loop; causes cascading latency  | Use awaitable async drivers; `loop.run_in_executor()` for sync code |
| Putting business logic in FastAPI path functions      | Couples routing to logic; makes unit testing impossible | Extract logic to service/repository layer; inject via `Depends()`   |
