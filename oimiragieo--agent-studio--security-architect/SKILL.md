### Step 1: Threat Modeling (STRIDE)

Analyze threats using STRIDE:

| Threat                     | Description                 | Example               |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------- |
| **S**poofing               | Impersonating users/systems | Stolen credentials    |
| **T**ampering              | Modifying data              | SQL injection         |
| **R**epudiation            | Denying actions             | Missing audit logs    |
| **I**nformation Disclosure | Data leaks                  | Exposed secrets       |
| **D**enial of Service      | Blocking access             | Resource exhaustion   |
| **E**levation of Privilege | Gaining unauthorized access | Broken access control |

For AI/agentic systems, extend STRIDE with:

- **Goal Hijacking** (Spoofing + Tampering): Adversarial prompts redirect agent objectives
- **Memory Poisoning** (Tampering + Information Disclosure): Persistent context corruption
- **Tool Misuse** (Elevation of Privilege): Legitimate tools abused beyond intended scope

### Step 2: OWASP Top 10 2025 Analysis

**IMPORTANT**: The OWASP Top 10 was updated in 2025 with two new categories and significant ranking shifts. Use this updated list, not the 2021 version.

| Rank | ID  | Vulnerability                          | Key Change from 2021                 |
| ---- | --- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| 1    | A01 | Broken Access Control                  | Stable at #1; SSRF consolidated here |
| 2    | A02 | Security Misconfiguration              | Up from #5                           |
| 3    | A03 | Software Supply Chain Failures         | NEW — replaces Vulnerable Components |
| 4    | A04 | Cryptographic Failures                 | Down from #2                         |
| 5    | A05 | Injection                              | Down from #3                         |
| 6    | A06 | Insecure Design                        | Down from #4                         |
| 7    | A07 | Authentication Failures                | Stable (renamed)                     |
| 8    | A08 | Software or Data Integrity Failures    | Stable                               |
| 9    | A09 | Security Logging and Alerting Failures | Stable                               |
| 10   | A10 | Mishandling of Exceptional Conditions  | NEW                                  |

Check for each vulnerability:

1. **A01: Broken Access Control** (includes SSRF from 2021)
   - Verify authorization on every endpoint; deny by default
   - Check for IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference) vulnerabilities
   - Validate/sanitize all URLs; use allowlists for outbound requests (absorbed SSRF)
   - Enforce CORS policies; restrict cross-origin requests

2. **A02: Security Misconfiguration** (up from #5 — now #2, affects ~3% of tested apps)
   - Harden defaults; disable unnecessary features, ports, services
   - Remove sample/default credentials and example content
   - Ensure consistent security settings across all environments (dev/staging/prod)
   - Review cloud storage ACLs, IAM policies, and network security groups

3. **A03: Software Supply Chain Failures** (NEW — highest avg exploit/impact scores)
   - Maintain an SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) for all dependencies
   - Enforce lockfiles (`package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `poetry.lock`) and verify integrity
   - Use private registry scoping to prevent dependency confusion attacks
   - Audit `postinstall` scripts; disable or allowlist explicitly
   - Pin dependencies to exact versions and verify hashes/signatures
   - Monitor CVE databases and security advisories (Dependabot, Snyk, Socket.dev)
   - Harden CI/CD pipelines; enforce separation of duty (no single actor: write → deploy)
   - Block exotic transitive dependencies (git URLs, direct tarballs) in production

4. **A04: Cryptographic Failures** (down from #2)
   - Use strong algorithms: AES-256-GCM, SHA-256+, bcrypt/scrypt/Argon2 for passwords
   - Never store plaintext passwords; enforce TLS 1.2+ everywhere
   - Rotate secrets and keys; use envelope encryption for data at rest

5. **A05: Injection** (down from #3)
   - Parameterize all queries (SQL, NoSQL, LDAP, OS commands)
   - Validate and sanitize all inputs; apply output encoding for XSS prevention

6. **A06: Insecure Design** (down from #4)
   - Threat model early in SDLC; use secure design patterns
   - Apply principle of least privilege at design time

7. **A07: Authentication Failures**
   - Implement MFA; prefer phishing-resistant methods (WebAuthn/Passkeys)
   - Use OAuth 2.1 (mandatory PKCE, remove implicit/ROPC grants)
   - Enforce secure session management; invalidate sessions on logout

8. **A08: Software or Data Integrity Failures**
   - Verify dependencies with SRI hashes and cryptographic signatures
   - Protect CI/CD pipelines; require signed commits and artifacts

9. **A09: Security Logging and Alerting Failures**
   - Log all security events (auth failures, access control violations, input validation failures)
   - Protect log integrity; never log secrets or PII
   - Alert on anomalous patterns

10. **A10: Mishandling of Exceptional Conditions** (NEW)
    - Ensure errors fail securely — never "fail open" (default to deny on error)
    - Validate logic for edge cases: timeouts, partial responses, unexpected nulls
    - Return generic error messages to clients; log detailed context server-side
    - Test error handling paths explicitly (chaos/fault injection testing)

### Step 3: OWASP Agentic AI Top 10 (ASI01-ASI10) — For AI/Agent Systems

When the codebase involves AI agents, LLMs, or autonomous systems, perform this additional assessment. Released December 2025 by OWASP GenAI Security Project.

| ASI   | Risk                               | Core Attack Vector                                |
| ----- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| ASI01 | Agent Goal Hijack                  | Prompt injection redirects agent objectives       |
| ASI02 | Tool Misuse                        | Legitimate tools abused beyond intended scope     |
| ASI03 | Identity & Privilege Abuse         | Credential inheritance/delegation without scoping |
| ASI04 | Supply Chain Vulnerabilities       | Malicious tools, MCP servers, agent registries    |
| ASI05 | Unexpected Code Execution          | Agent-generated code bypasses security controls   |
| ASI06 | Memory & Context Poisoning         | Persistent corruption of agent memory/embeddings  |
| ASI07 | Insecure Inter-Agent Communication | Weak agent-to-agent protocol validation           |
| ASI08 | Cascading Failures                 | Error propagation across chained agents           |
| ASI09 | Human-Agent Trust Exploitation     | Agents manipulate users into unsafe approvals     |
| ASI10 | Rogue Agents                       | Agents act outside authorized scope               |

**ASI01 — Agent Goal Hijack**: Attackers manipulate planning logic via prompt injection in user input, RAG documents, emails, or calendar invites.

- Mitigations: Validate all inputs against expected task scope; enforce task boundary checks in routing layer; use system prompts that resist goal redirection; log unexpected task deviations for review.

**ASI02 — Tool Misuse**: Agents use tools beyond intended scope (e.g., file deletion when only file read was authorized).

- Mitigations: Whitelist/blacklist tools per agent role; validate tool parameters before execution; enforce principle of least privilege for tool access; monitor tool usage patterns for anomalies.

**ASI03 — Identity & Privilege Abuse**: Agents inherit or delegate credentials without proper scoping, creating attribution gaps.

- Mitigations: Assign each agent a distinct, scoped identity; never reuse human credentials for agents; audit all credential delegation chains; enforce short-lived tokens for agent actions.

**ASI04 — Supply Chain Vulnerabilities (Agentic)**: Malicious MCP servers, agent cards, plugin registries, or tool packages poison the agent ecosystem.

- Mitigations: Verify integrity of all tool/plugin sources; use registry allowlists; audit MCP server provenance; apply same supply chain controls as A03 to agent tooling.

**ASI05 — Unexpected Code Execution**: Agent-generated or "vibe-coded" code executes without traditional security controls (sandboxing, review).

- Mitigations: Sandbox code execution environments; review agent-generated code before execution in production; apply static analysis to generated code; never execute code from memory/context without validation.

**ASI06 — Memory & Context Poisoning**: Attackers embed malicious instructions in documents, web pages, or RAG corpora that persist in agent memory and influence future actions.

- Mitigations: Sanitize all data written to memory (learnings, vector stores, embeddings); validate memory entries before use; never execute commands sourced from memory without explicit approval; implement memory rotation and auditing (see ADR-102).

**ASI07 — Insecure Inter-Agent Communication**: Agent-to-agent messages lack authentication, integrity checks, or semantic validation, enabling injection attacks between agents.

- Mitigations: Authenticate all agent-to-agent messages; validate message schemas; use signed inter-agent payloads; apply semantic validation (not just structural) to delegated instructions.

**ASI08 — Cascading Failures**: Errors or attacks in one agent propagate uncontrolled through multi-agent pipelines.

- Mitigations: Define error boundaries between agents; implement circuit breakers; require human-in-the-loop checkpoints for high-impact actions; never auto-retry destructive operations on failure.

**ASI09 — Human-Agent Trust Exploitation**: Agents present misleading information to manipulate users into approving unsafe actions.

- Mitigations: Display agent reasoning and provenance transparently; require explicit human confirmation for irreversible actions; detect urgency/fear manipulation patterns; maintain audit trails of all user-agent interactions.

**ASI10 — Rogue Agents**: Agents operate outside authorized scope, take unsanctioned actions, or resist human override.

- Mitigations: Enforce hard authorization boundaries at the infrastructure level (not just prompt level); implement kill-switch mechanisms; log all agent actions with human-reviewable audit trail; test override/shutdown paths regularly.

### Step 4: Supply Chain Security Review

Perform this check for all projects with external dependencies:

```bash
# Check for known vulnerabilities
npm audit --audit-level=high
# or
pnpm audit

# Verify lockfile integrity (ensure lockfile is committed and not bypassed)
# Check that package-lock.json / yarn.lock / pnpm-lock.yaml exists and is current

# Scan for malicious packages (behavioral analysis)
# Tools: Socket.dev, Snyk, Aikido, Safety (Python)
```

**Dependency Confusion Defense**:

- Scope all internal packages under a private namespace (e.g., `@company/package-name`)
- Configure registry resolution order to prefer private registry
- Use `publishConfig` and registry scoping to prevent public registry fallback for private packages
- Block exotic transitive dependencies (git URLs, direct tarball URLs)

**Typosquatting Defense**:

- Audit all `npm install` / `pip install` commands for misspellings
- Use allowlists for permitted packages in automated environments
- Delay new dependency version installs by 24+ hours (`minimumReleaseAge`) to allow malware detection

**CI/CD Pipeline Hardening**:

- Enforce separation of duty: no single actor writes code AND promotes to production
- Sign all build artifacts and verify signatures before deployment
- Pin action versions in GitHub Actions (use commit SHA, not floating tags)
- Restrict pipeline secrets to minimum required scope

### Step 5: Modern API Authentication Review

**OAuth 2.1 (current standard — replaces OAuth 2.0 for new implementations)**:

```
OAuth 2.1 removes insecure grants:
  - Implicit grant (response_type=token) — REMOVED: tokens in URL fragments leak
  - Resource Owner Password Credentials (ROPC) — REMOVED: breaks delegated auth model

OAuth 2.1 mandates:
  - PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) for ALL authorization code flows
  - Exact redirect URI matching (no wildcards)
  - Sender-constraining tokens (DPoP recommended)
```

**DPoP — Demonstrating Proof of Possession (RFC 9449)**:

- Binds access/refresh tokens cryptographically to the client's key pair
- Prevents token replay attacks even if tokens are intercepted
- Implement for all public clients (SPAs, mobile apps) where bearer token theft is a concern

```javascript
// DPoP proof JWT structure (sent in DPoP header with each request)
// Header: { "typ": "dpop+jwt", "alg": "ES256", "jwk": { client_public_key } }
// Payload: { "jti": nonce, "htm": "POST", "htu": "https://api.example.com/token", "iat": timestamp }
// Signed with client private key — server verifies binding to issued token
```

**Passkeys / WebAuthn (FIDO2) — for user-facing authentication**:

- Phishing-resistant: credentials are origin-bound and never transmitted
- Replaces passwords and SMS OTP for high-security contexts
- Major platforms (Windows, macOS, iOS, Android) support cross-device sync as of 2026
- Implementation: use `navigator.credentials.create()` (registration) and `navigator.credentials.get()` (authentication)
- Store only the public key and credential ID server-side (never the private key)

```javascript
// WebAuthn registration (simplified)
const credential = await navigator.credentials.create({
  publicKey: {
    challenge: serverChallenge, // random bytes from server
    rp: { name: 'My App', id: 'myapp.example.com' },
    user: { id: userId, name: userEmail, displayName: userName },
    pubKeyCredParams: [{ alg: -7, type: 'public-key' }], // ES256
    authenticatorSelection: { residentKey: 'preferred', userVerification: 'required' },
  },
});
// Send credential.id and credential.response to server for verification
```

### Step 6: Security Code Review

Look for common issues:

```javascript
// BAD: SQL Injection
const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${userId}`;

// GOOD: Parameterized query
const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1`;
await db.query(query, [userId]);
```

```javascript
// BAD: Hardcoded secrets
const apiKey = 'sk-abc123...';

// GOOD: Environment variables / secret manager
const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY;
```

```javascript
// BAD: shell: true (shell injection vector)
const { exec } = require('child_process');
exec(`git commit -m "${userMessage}"`);

// GOOD: shell: false with array arguments
const { spawn } = require('child_process');
spawn('git', ['commit', '-m', userMessage], { shell: false });
```

```javascript
// BAD: Fail open on error (dangerous for auth/authz)
try {
  const isAuthorized = await checkPermission(user, resource);
  if (isAuthorized) return next();
} catch (err) {
  return next(); // WRONG: allows access on error
}

// GOOD: Fail securely (deny on error — A10:2025)
try {
  const isAuthorized = await checkPermission(user, resource);
  if (!isAuthorized) return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Forbidden' });
  return next();
} catch (err) {
  logger.error('Permission check failed', { err, user, resource });
  return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Forbidden' }); // Default deny
}
```

### Step 7: Authentication/Authorization Review

Verify:

- Strong password requirements OR passkey/WebAuthn (preferred in 2026)
- Secure session management (HTTPOnly, Secure, SameSite=Strict cookies)
- JWT validation (signature, expiry, audience, issuer)
- Role-based access control (RBAC) enforced server-side
- API authentication: OAuth 2.1 + PKCE (not OAuth 2.0 implicit/ROPC)
- DPoP sender-constraining for public clients handling sensitive data
- Phishing-resistant MFA (WebAuthn preferred over SMS OTP)

### Step 8: Generate Security Report

Create findings report:

```markdown
## Security Assessment Report

### Critical Findings

1. SQL injection in /api/users endpoint
   - Risk: Data breach
   - Fix: Use parameterized queries

### High Findings

2. Missing rate limiting on login
   - Risk: Brute force attacks
   - Fix: Implement rate limiting

3. OAuth 2.0 implicit grant in use (deprecated)
   - Risk: Access token exposure in URL fragments / browser history
   - Fix: Migrate to Authorization Code + PKCE (OAuth 2.1)

### Medium Findings

4. No lockfile committed for npm dependencies
   - Risk: Supply chain attack via dependency resolution drift
   - Fix: Commit package-lock.json; add lockfile verification to CI

### Recommendations

- Enable HTTPS everywhere; enforce HSTS
- Implement CSP headers
- Add security logging for auth events
- Migrate to OAuth 2.1 (remove implicit/ROPC grants)
- Implement passkey/WebAuthn for phishing-resistant authentication
- Run `npm audit` / `pnpm audit` in CI with failure on high/critical
```

</execution_process>

<best_practices>

1. **Defense in Depth**: Layer security controls; no single control is sufficient
2. **Least Privilege**: Minimal permissions for users, services, and AI agents
3. **Fail Securely**: Default to deny — especially on errors (A10:2025)
4. **Validate Everything**: Never trust input from any source, including agent memory
5. **Keep Secrets Secret**: Use secret managers; rotate regularly; never commit credentials
6. **Supply Chain Hygiene**: Lock dependencies, verify integrity, monitor for compromise
7. **Human-in-the-Loop for Agents**: Require explicit approval for irreversible agentic actions
8. **Modern Auth Standards**: OAuth 2.1 + PKCE, DPoP, and Passkeys/WebAuthn over legacy flows

</best_practices>
</instructions>

<examples>
<usage_example>
**Security Review Request**:

```
Review the authentication flow in src/auth/ for security issues
```

**Example Response**:

```markdown
## Security Review: src/auth/

### Findings

#### CRITICAL: Weak Password Hashing

- File: src/auth/password.js:23
- Issue: Using MD5 for password hashing
- Fix: Use bcrypt with cost factor >= 12

#### HIGH: No Rate Limiting

- File: src/auth/login.js
- Issue: Login endpoint has no rate limiting
- Fix: Add rate limiting (5 attempts/minute)

#### HIGH: OAuth 2.0 Implicit Grant in Use

- File: src/auth/oauth.js:45
- Issue: Using response_type=token (implicit grant, deprecated in OAuth 2.1)
- Fix: Migrate to Authorization Code flow with PKCE

#### MEDIUM: Session Not Invalidated

- File: src/auth/logout.js
- Issue: Logout doesn't invalidate server-side session
- Fix: Clear session from store on logout

### Recommendations

1. Implement bcrypt for password hashing (cost factor >= 12)
2. Add rate limiting middleware (5 req/min on /login)
3. Migrate OAuth flows to Authorization Code + PKCE (OAuth 2.1)
4. Consider passkeys/WebAuthn for phishing-resistant authentication
5. Use secure session configuration (HTTPOnly, Secure, SameSite=Strict)
```

<usage_example>
**AI Agent Security Review Request**:

```
Review the LLM agent pipeline in src/agents/ for agentic AI security risks
```

**Example Response**:

```markdown
## Agentic AI Security Review: src/agents/

### ASI01 — Agent Goal Hijack (HIGH)

- File: src/agents/email-processor.js
- Issue: User email content passed directly to agent system prompt without sanitization
- Fix: Sanitize email content; enforce task boundary validation in routing layer

### ASI06 — Memory & Context Poisoning (HIGH)

- File: src/agents/memory-store.js:78
- Issue: Web-fetched content written to persistent memory without validation
- Fix: Validate and sanitize all external content before writing to memory; never
  execute commands retrieved from memory without explicit human approval

### ASI02 — Tool Misuse (MEDIUM)

- File: src/agents/tools/file-tool.js
- Issue: Agent has both read and delete file permissions; delete scope too broad
- Fix: Split into read-only and write tools; apply least privilege per agent role

### ASI10 — Rogue Agent Risk (MEDIUM)

- Issue: No kill-switch or hard resource limits on agent execution
- Fix: Implement max-steps limit, timeout, and human override checkpoint for
  operations affecting production data
```

</usage_example>
</examples>

## Iron Laws

1. **NEVER** approve production deployment for code handling auth, PII, or external data without a completed security review
2. **ALWAYS** run both OWASP Top 10 2025 AND ASI01-ASI10 assessments for AI/agentic systems
3. **ALWAYS** fail securely — design all error paths to deny by default, never allow
4. **NEVER** trust any input without validation, including data from internal services
5. **ALWAYS** prioritize findings by severity (CRITICAL > HIGH > MEDIUM > LOW) with specific remediation steps and code examples

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern                                | Why It Fails                                                               | Correct Approach                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Approving code without full security review | Partial reviews miss exploitable paths in auth/PII/external data flows     | Complete all STRIDE + OWASP phases before approving production deployment    |
| Using OWASP 2021 for AI/agentic systems     | AI-specific threats (ASI01-ASI10) are not covered by the standard web list | Always run both OWASP Top 10 2025 and ASI01-ASI10 for any agentic component  |
| Failing open on security errors             | Error paths become exploitable bypass conditions                           | Design every failure mode to deny access by default                          |
| Providing vague remediation guidance        | Developers cannot act without specifics                                    | Provide exact code examples and parameterized fix patterns for every finding |
| Missing severity prioritization             | Critical findings are buried in noise with informational findings          | Triage all findings as CRITICAL > HIGH > MEDIUM > LOW before delivery        |
