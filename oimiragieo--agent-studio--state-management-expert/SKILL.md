- Implement proper dependency injection for stores.

### mobx devtools

When reviewing or writing code, apply these guidelines:

- Utilize MobX DevTools for debugging.

### mobx react lite usage

When reviewing or writing code, apply these guidelines:

- Use MobX-react-lite for optimal performance with functional components.

### mobx reaction usage

When reviewing or writing code, apply these guidelines:

- Use reaction for side-effects based on observable changes.

### mobx store implementation

When reviewing or writing code, apply these guidelines:

- Implement stores for managing application state.
- Utilize computed values for derived state.
- Use actions for modifying observable state.
- Implement proper error handling in asynchronous actions.

### mobx strict mode

  components/
  features/
  store/
  slices/
  hooks.ts
  store.ts
  types/
  utils/

### redux toolkit best practices

When reviewing or writing code, apply these guidelines:

- Use Redux Toolkit for efficient Redux development.
- Implement slice pattern for organizing Redux code.
- Utilize createAsyncThunk for handling async actions.
- Use selectors for accessing state in components.
- Use Redux hooks (useSelector, useDispatch) in components.
- Follow Redux style guide for naming conventions

## Memory Protocol (MANDATORY)

**Before starting:**

```bash
cat .claude/context/memory/learnings.md
```

**After completing:** Record any new patterns or exceptions discovered.

> ASSUME INTERRUPTION: Your context may reset. If it's not in memory, it didn't happen.
