# Omega Claude CLI (Codex entry)

This Codex skill delegates to the canonical skill instructions at:

`./.claude/skills/omega-claude-cli/SKILL.md`

Use that file as the single source of truth for workflow, options, references, and troubleshooting. Keep this file minimal to avoid drift across duplicated docs.

## Quick run

From the project root:

```bash
node .claude/skills/omega-claude-cli/scripts/ask-claude.mjs "USER_PROMPT"
```

Common options: `--model opus|sonnet|haiku`, `--json`, `--sandbox`, `--timeout-ms N`.
