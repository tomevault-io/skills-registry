# Matrix Doctor

Run comprehensive diagnostics on the Matrix plugin and automatically fix issues when possible.

## What It Does

1. **Checks Matrix Directory**: Verifies ~/.claude/matrix/ exists and is writable
2. **Checks Database**: Tests connection, validates schema version
3. **Checks Configuration**: Validates config file, checks for missing sections
4. **Checks Hooks**: Verifies hooks are installed correctly
5. **Checks Code Index**: Confirms repository is indexed
6. **Checks Repo Detection**: Tests fingerprinting works

## Auto-Fix Capabilities

The doctor will automatically attempt to fix:
- Missing Matrix directory (creates it)
- Database connection issues (reinitializes)
- Invalid/missing configuration (resets to defaults)
- Missing code index (triggers reindex)

## Usage

Call the `matrix_doctor` tool with:
- `autoFix: true` (default) - Attempt to fix issues automatically
- `autoFix: false` - Only run diagnostics without fixing

## If Issues Cannot Be Fixed

If the doctor finds issues that cannot be automatically fixed:
1. A GitHub issue template will be generated
2. The user should be directed to open an issue at:
   https://github.com/ojowwalker77/Claude-Matrix/issues/new?template=bug_report.md
3. Include the full diagnostic output in the issue

## Expected Output

The tool returns a `DoctorResult` object containing:
- `healthy`: boolean indicating overall health
- `checks`: array of diagnostic results
- `environment`: OS, Bun version, paths
- `suggestions`: array of recommended actions
- `issueTemplate`: pre-filled GitHub issue template (if issues found)
