# Matrix List & Export

Display or export Matrix memory contents and statistics.

## List (default)

Use `matrix_status` to retrieve information and present it to the user.

- **No arguments**: Show statistics, scope breakdown, recent solutions, top performers
- **"stats"**: Focus on statistics only
- **"failures"**: Focus on recorded failures
- **"warnings"**: Use `matrix_warn` with action "list" to show warnings
- **"solutions"**: Show detailed solutions list

## Export

When the user says "export" or "backup":

1. Use `matrix_status` to get all data
2. Format as JSON
3. Use `Write` to save to the specified path (or default to `matrix-export.json`)
