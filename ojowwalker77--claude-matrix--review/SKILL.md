# Matrix Code Review

Perform comprehensive, context-aware code review using 5-agent architecture with 95% false positive reduction.

> **Tip:** This skill runs in a **forked context** for an unbiased perspective - similar to how a human reviewer would approach the code for the first time.

## Architecture

```
ORCHESTRATOR (parses target, routes, aggregates)
     │
     ├── DETECTION AGENT → security, runtime, breaking, logic flaws, hygiene (nuke)
     ├── IMPACT AGENT → blast radius, transitive graph, test coverage
     ├── TRIAGE AGENT → tier assignment, confidence calibration, noise filter
     ├── REMEDIATION AGENT → context-aware fixes, regression checks
     └── VERIFICATION AGENT → build, test, lint validation
```

## Usage

Parse user arguments from the skill invocation (text after the trigger phrase).

**Expected format:** `<target> [mode]`

- **target**: File path, PR number, or "staged" for staged changes
- **mode** (optional): `default` | `lazy` (default: from config or `default`)

## Modes

### Default Mode (Comprehensive)
Full 5-agent review pipeline with maximum index utilization:
- Detection: Security vulns, runtime issues, breaking changes, **hygiene (nuke scan)**
- Impact: Transitive blast radius (2-3 levels), service boundaries, test coverage
- Triage: Tier classification, >80% signal ratio target
- Remediation: Context-aware fixes matching codebase patterns
- Verification: Run build, test, lint commands automatically

### Lazy Mode (Quick)
Detection agent only:
- Direct code inspection
- Critical issues only (Tier 1)
- ~2-3 comments, no blast radius

## Review Pipeline

Follow the 5-agent orchestration detailed in `references/review-phases.md`:

1. **Orchestrator** - Parse target, dispatch agents, aggregate results
2. **Detection Agent** - Find security, runtime, breaking, logic issues
3. **Impact Agent** - Calculate transitive blast radius, test coverage
4. **Triage Agent** - Classify tiers, calibrate confidence, filter noise
5. **Remediation Agent** - Generate fixes, check regression risk
6. **Verification Agent** - Run build, test, lint; report results

**Early exit:** If Detection finds nothing critical, skip Impact/Triage depth.

## Examples

```
/matrix:review src/utils/auth.ts          # Default mode (comprehensive)
/matrix:review staged                     # Review staged changes
/matrix:review staged lazy                # Quick review of staged changes
/matrix:review 123                        # Review PR #123
/matrix:review 123 lazy                   # Quick review of PR #123
```
