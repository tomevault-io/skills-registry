# LiveKit Voice Agent Prompt Builder

Create production-ready prompts for LiveKit voice agents that work seamlessly with text-to-speech systems.

## Quick Start

For most use cases, follow this simple workflow:

1. **Choose a template** from `assets/templates/` that matches your use case
2. **Customize** the template with your specific information
3. **Validate** using `scripts/validate_prompt.py`
4. **Test** with your LiveKit agent
5. **Refine** based on real conversations

## Workflow

### Step 1: Determine Your Agent Type

Select the template that best matches your needs:

**General Purpose:**

- **Basic Assistant** (`basic-assistant.txt`) - Simple conversational agent
  - Use for: General chat, demos, minimal functionality
  - Complexity: Low
  - Tools: Optional

- **Tool-Enabled Agent** (`tool-enabled-agent.txt`) - Agent with function calling
  - Use for: Weather, search, data lookup, single-domain assistants
  - Complexity: Medium
  - Tools: 1-5 tools

- **Customer Service** (`customer-service.txt`) - Support agent with escalation
  - Use for: Help desks, support lines, troubleshooting
  - Complexity: Medium
  - Tools: Lookup, search, escalation

- **Specialist Agent** (`specialist-agent.txt`) - Task-specific agent (reservations, orders, etc.)
  - Use for: Booking systems, order taking, appointments
  - Complexity: Medium-High
  - Tools: Action tools (create, update)

- **Multi-Agent Coordinator** (`multi-agent-coordinator.txt`) - Routes to other agents
  - Use for: Main entry point in multi-agent systems
  - Complexity: Medium
  - Tools: Transfer/handoff tools

**Industry-Specific:**

- **Front Desk Receptionist** (`front-desk-receptionist.txt`) - Professional call routing
  - Use for: Office reception, call centers, front desk operations
  - Complexity: Low-Medium
  - Tools: Transfer, routing, message taking

- **Debt Collection** (`debt-collection-agent.txt`) - Compliant recovery agent
  - Use for: Debt recovery, collections, payment arrangements
  - Complexity: High
  - Tools: Payment processing, sentiment analysis
  - Note: Includes FDCPA/TCPA/CFPB compliance requirements

### Step 2: Customize Your Template

Open your selected template and fill in the placeholders:

**Example - Customizing `basic-assistant.txt`:**

Template:
```
You are [NAME], a friendly voice assistant. You are [TRAIT_1] and [TRAIT_2], with [TRAIT_3].
```

Customized:
```
You are Casey, a friendly voice assistant. You are helpful and patient, with a sense of humor.
```

**Key customization areas:**
- Identity (name, role, personality)
- Domain context (business info, hours, policies)
- Tool descriptions (when and how to use each tool)
- Workflow steps (information collection sequence)
- Boundaries (what agent can't do)

### Step 3: Apply Voice Optimization

Ensure your prompt includes these critical voice optimization rules:

**Required elements:**

```
Keep your responses brief - 1-3 sentences. Respond in plain text only - no emojis, asterisks, markdown, or special formatting. Ask one question at a time.
```

**For agents that mention numbers, prices, or contact info:**

```
Spell out numbers ("fifteen" not "15"). Spell phone numbers digit by digit ("5-5-5, 1-2-3-4"). For URLs, omit "https://" and say "dot" for periods.
```

**For agents with tools:**

```
If a tool call fails, explain the issue simply and suggest a fallback. Summarize tool results in conversational language - don't recite technical IDs or raw data.
```

### Step 4: Validate Your Prompt

Run the validation script to check for common issues:

```bash
python scripts/validate_prompt.py your_prompt.txt
```

The validator checks for:
- Missing identity statement
- Lack of voice optimization rules
- TTS antipatterns (emojis, markdown, special characters)
- Excessive length (>500 words)
- Missing tool error handling
- Number formatting guidance

**Fix any errors** before deploying your prompt.

### Step 5: Test with LiveKit

Deploy your prompt in a LiveKit agent and test with real conversations:

**Test scenarios:**
1. **Happy path** - User provides information smoothly
2. **Interruptions** - User changes topic or interrupts
3. **Tool failures** - Simulate tool errors
4. **Edge cases** - Ambiguous requests, out-of-scope questions
5. **Voice quality** - Listen to TTS output for formatting issues

### Step 6: Refine

Based on testing, refine your prompt:

**Common refinements:**
- Add specific guidance for observed failure modes
- Adjust tone or personality descriptors
- Add examples for complex tool usage
- Tighten response length constraints if agent is too verbose
- Add boundaries for out-of-scope requests

## Key Concepts

### Voice-First Design

Voice agents differ from text chatbots:

**Critical differences:**
- No visual formatting (users can't see bold, lists, etc.)
- Limited user patience (long responses cause frustration)
- TTS limitations (special characters cause problems)
- No "scroll back" (users can't review previous responses)

**Implications for prompts:**
- Always specify plain text only
- Enforce brevity (1-3 sentences typical)
- Spell out numbers and abbreviations
- Ask one question at a time
- Avoid complex structures (lists, tables)

### The Three Essential Sections

Every voice agent prompt should have:

1. **Identity** - "You are [name/role]. You are [personality]."
2. **Voice Rules** - Plain text, brief responses, number formatting
3. **Core Functionality** - What the agent does, tools it uses, workflows it follows

Additional sections (domain context, guardrails, handoffs) add as needed.

### Template vs. Custom Prompts

**Use templates when:**
- Starting a new agent
- Following common patterns (support, booking, etc.)
- Want quick setup with best practices

**Write custom when:**
- Unique use case not covered by templates
- Very specialized domain
- Complex multi-step workflows

Even with custom prompts, reference the templates for voice optimization patterns.

## Progressive Disclosure: When to Load References

Load reference documentation based on your specific needs:

**For all users:**
- Start with templates and this SKILL.md

**Load prompt-components.md when:**
- Building complex prompts from scratch
- Need detailed guidance on specific sections
- Want to understand the "why" behind best practices
- Customizing beyond simple template fill-in

**Load voice-optimization.md when:**
- Encountering TTS formatting issues
- Agent responses sound awkward or unnatural
- Need deep understanding of voice-specific constraints
- Working with multiple TTS providers
- Debugging number, URL, or email pronunciation

**Load tool-integration.md when:**
- Integrating function calling/tools
- Building multi-agent systems with handoffs
- Need patterns for error handling or parameter collection
- Tools aren't being used correctly
- Working with RAG or external data sources

**Load examples.md when:**
- Want to see complete, real-world prompts
- Need inspiration for similar use cases
- Comparing complexity levels
- Learning from production patterns

**Load industry-best-practices.md when:**
- Building agents for regulated industries (healthcare, banking, debt collection)
- Need compliance guidance (HIPAA, FDCPA, TCPA, etc.)
- Working on industry-specific use cases (front desk, customer service, sales)
- Require specialized tone and approach patterns
- Need security or privacy considerations

**Load iterative-improvement.md when:**
- Improving existing prompts based on feedback
- Analyzing test results and conversation data
- Conducting A/B tests on prompt variations
- Establishing metrics and measurement frameworks
- Need systematic approach to prompt refinement
- Want to preserve prompt structure while making improvements

**Strategy:** Start minimal (templates + SKILL.md). Load references only when you hit specific challenges or need deeper guidance.

## Multi-Agent Systems

For systems with multiple agents, design each agent separately:

**Pattern:**

1. **Coordinator/Greeter** - Uses `multi-agent-coordinator.txt`
   - Simple routing logic
   - Minimal conversation
   - Quick transfers

2. **Specialist Agents** - Use `specialist-agent.txt`
   - Each handles one specific task
   - Collects required information
   - Takes action or transfers to next agent

**Key considerations:**
- Each agent should have a single, clear responsibility
- Define handoff criteria explicitly
- Decide what context to pass between agents (full chat history vs structured data)
- Test agent transitions for smoothness

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Simple Conversational Agent

**Template:** `basic-assistant.txt`

**Use for:** Chat, demos, general assistance

**Prompt structure:**
- Identity + personality
- Voice optimization rules
- Optional: specific topics or capabilities

**Example use cases:**
- Demo voice assistant
- Companion chatbot
- General information assistant

### Pattern 2: Information Retrieval Agent

**Template:** `tool-enabled-agent.txt`

**Use for:** Looking up data, answering questions from external sources

**Prompt structure:**
- Identity + domain
- Voice optimization
- Tool descriptions (when to use each tool)
- Result summarization guidance

**Example use cases:**
- Weather agent
- Product lookup
- Knowledge base search
- RAG-enabled assistants

### Pattern 3: Action-Taking Agent

**Template:** `specialist-agent.txt`

**Use for:** Booking, ordering, scheduling, transactions

**Prompt structure:**
- Identity + role
- Voice optimization
- Information collection sequence
- Confirmation before action
- Tool usage for state changes

**Example use cases:**
- Reservation agent
- Order taking
- Appointment scheduling
- Registration

### Pattern 4: Support Agent with Escalation

**Template:** `customer-service.txt`

**Use for:** Help desk, customer support, troubleshooting

**Prompt structure:**
- Identity + tone (empathetic, patient)
- Voice optimization
- Capabilities and tools
- Clear escalation criteria
- Error handling and fallbacks

**Example use cases:**
- Customer support
- Technical troubleshooting
- Account assistance
- Order status lookup

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Agent uses markdown or special formatting

**Symptoms:** TTS says "asterisk asterisk hello" or skips characters

**Solution:** Ensure prompt includes:
```
Respond in plain text only - no emojis, asterisks, markdown, or special formatting.
```

**Prevention:** Run validation script

### Issue: Responses too long

**Symptoms:** Users interrupt frequently, seem impatient

**Solution:** Add stricter constraints:
```
Keep responses very brief - 1-2 sentences maximum. Ask one question at a time.
```

**Prevention:** Test with real users early

### Issue: Numbers sound awkward

**Symptoms:** "Dollar sign forty-nine point nine nine" or unclear prices/phone numbers

**Solution:** Add number formatting rules:
```
Spell out numbers ("forty-nine ninety-nine" for prices). Spell phone numbers digit by digit ("5-5-5, 1-2-3-4").
```

### Issue: Agent doesn't use tools correctly

**Symptoms:** Tools called at wrong time, missing parameters, no error handling

**Solution:**
1. Add explicit tool usage instructions in prompt
2. Specify when to use each tool
3. Define parameter collection flow
4. Add error handling guidance

**Check:** Load `tool-integration.md` for detailed patterns

### Issue: Agent goes off-topic or out-of-scope

**Symptoms:** Agent tries to handle requests beyond capabilities

**Solution:** Add boundaries and guardrails:
```
You can only help with [specific domain]. For questions about [out-of-scope topics], direct users to [alternative resource].
```

### Issue: Multi-agent transfers feel awkward

**Symptoms:** Abrupt handoffs, lost context, repeated questions

**Solution:**
1. Add transition messages before transfer
2. Define what context passes between agents
3. Ensure previous agent collects minimum required info

**Check:** See multi-agent examples in `examples.md`

## Advanced Topics

### Emotional Expression

For agents that should convey emotion, use descriptive language:

**Good:**
```
When users share good news, respond warmly and enthusiastically. When they express frustration, respond with empathy and patience.
```

**Avoid:** Trying to use emojis, asterisks, or formatting to convey emotion.

**Trust TTS:** Modern TTS systems convey emotion through intonation based on word choice.

### Multiple TTS Providers

Different TTS providers have different characteristics:

- **OpenAI TTS** - Natural, handles most punctuation well
- **Cartesia Sonic** - Fast, low-latency, clear pronunciation
- **Deepgram** - Strong with accents and dialects
- **ElevenLabs** - Highly expressive, personality-driven

**Universal best practices work across all providers:**
1. Plain text only
2. Brief responses
3. Spell out numbers
4. Avoid special characters

Test your specific provider to identify any quirks.

### Handling Sensitive Contexts

For healthcare, finance, or other regulated industries:

**Add explicit constraints:**
```
Never:
- Share customer information without verification
- Provide medical/legal/financial advice
- Process transactions without explicit confirmation
```

**Be security-conscious:**
```
For security, you'll need to verify identity before providing account information.
```

**Escalate appropriately:**
```
For [sensitive issue], immediately transfer to [appropriate specialist].
```

See healthcare and banking examples in `examples.md`.

## Example: Complete Workflow

**Scenario:** Build a pizza ordering agent

**Step 1:** Choose template
- Task-specific with order taking → `specialist-agent.txt`

**Step 2:** Customize
```
You are Marco, an order specialist at Mario's Pizza. You are friendly, efficient, and helpful.

Keep responses very brief - 1-2 sentences. Plain text only, no formatting. Ask one question at a time.

Our menu:
- Margherita: twelve dollars
- Pepperoni: fourteen dollars
- Veggie Supreme: fifteen dollars

Collect in order:
1. Pizza selection - "What pizza would you like?"
2. Size - "What size: small, medium, or large?"
3. Any modifications - "Any special requests or modifications?"
4. Name - "Name for the order?"
5. Phone - "Phone number?"

Confirm: "Let me confirm: [size] [pizza] for [name] at [phone]. Total is [price]. Is that correct?"

Use create_order(pizza, size, modifications, name, phone) after confirmation.

Spell out prices: "fourteen dollars" not "dollar sign fourteen".
Spell phone numbers: "5-5-5, 1-2-3-4".
```

**Step 3:** Validate
```bash
python scripts/validate_prompt.py pizza_prompt.txt
```

**Step 4:** Deploy and test with LiveKit

**Step 5:** Refine based on feedback
- If users often ask about delivery time → Add delivery info to domain context
- If tool fails occasionally → Add error handling for out-of-stock items
- If users interrupt with questions → Add guidance for handling interruptions

## Iterative Improvement

Voice agent prompts improve through continuous refinement based on real-world usage:

### Quick Improvement Workflow

1. **Collect feedback** - Gather test results, user feedback, conversation metrics
2. **Identify patterns** - Look for common issues across multiple conversations
3. **Make targeted changes** - Modify specific sections while preserving structure
4. **Test changes** - Validate improvements with test scenarios
5. **Measure impact** - Compare before/after metrics
6. **Iterate** - Repeat the cycle

### Key Principles

- **Structure preservation** - Make minimal, targeted changes to address specific issues
- **Data-driven** - Use evidence from tests and conversations, not guesses
- **Version control** - Track changes and document reasons
- **A/B testing** - When possible, run old and new versions in parallel
- **Regression testing** - Ensure changes don't break existing functionality
