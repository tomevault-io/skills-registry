# Skill Reviewer

## Purpose

The Skill Reviewer provides comprehensive quality assurance and improvement recommendations for Claude Code skills. It evaluates skills against official Anthropic guidelines, identifies clarity issues, detects missing edge cases, and suggests structural improvements. Use this skill to validate skill quality, identify gaps, and ensure skills meet professional standards before distribution.

## When to Use

- **Evaluating New Skills**: Review skills before adding to project or distributing
- **Improving Existing Skills**: Identify gaps and enhancement opportunities
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensure skills meet Anthropic guidelines
- **Documentation Audit**: Check for clarity, completeness, and accessibility
- **Structure Validation**: Verify proper organization and naming conventions
- **Edge Case Testing**: Identify scenarios the skill doesn't handle
- **Pre-Release Review**: Final validation before skill distribution
- **Team Standards**: Ensure consistency across skill libraries

## Capabilities

- **Metadata Validation**: Check YAML frontmatter, name conventions, description completeness
- **Documentation Audit**: Evaluate clarity, completeness, and user accessibility
- **Structure Assessment**: Verify directory organization, file hierarchy, and naming patterns
- **Functionality Coverage**: Identify missing capabilities and edge cases
- **Instruction Quality**: Analyze step-by-step guides, examples, and usage patterns
- **Guideline Compliance**: Verify adherence to Anthropic skill standards
- **Cross-Reference Validation**: Check links to related skills and documentation
- **Risk Identification**: Spot potential issues, confusion points, and improvement areas
- **Score Generation**: Provide overall skill quality score (0-100) with grade (A-F)
- **Improvement Roadmap**: Generate prioritized recommendations for enhancements

### Minimum Distribution Standards

- ✅ Score ≥ 80 (Grade B or higher)
- ✅ All Priority 1 recommendations addressed
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Tested examples and workflows
- ✅ Clear scope and limitations

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Score Below 80

**Solution**:

1. Address all Priority 1 recommendations first
2. Add missing sections (troubleshooting, edge cases)
3. Improve documentation clarity
4. Get peer review for feedback
5. Iterate and re-review

### Issue: Unclear Recommendations

**Solution**:

1. Request specific examples
2. Ask for comparison with high-scoring skill
3. Discuss recommendations with team
