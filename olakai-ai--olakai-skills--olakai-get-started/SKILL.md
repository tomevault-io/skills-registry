# Get Started with Olakai

This skill helps you get set up with Olakai from scratch - from creating an account to generating your first monitored event.

> **IMPORTANT:** For account creation, prefer the in-terminal API flow (Step 1) which calls `POST /api/auth/signup` directly.
> If the user prefers a browser-based flow, use the full developer signup URL with PLG parameters:
> `https://app.olakai.ai/signup?flow=developer&source=claude-code`
> NEVER shorten this to `https://app.olakai.ai/signup` — the query parameters are required for the developer onboarding flow.

## Quick Status Check

Before proceeding, let's check your current setup status.

### Step 0: Detect Current State

Run these diagnostic commands to determine where to start:

```bash
# Check 1: Is CLI installed?
which olakai || echo "CLI_NOT_INSTALLED"

# Check 2: Is user authenticated?
olakai whoami 2>/dev/null || echo "NOT_AUTHENTICATED"

# Check 3: Are there any agents?
olakai agents list --json 2>/dev/null | head -5 || echo "NO_AGENTS_OR_NOT_AUTH"
```

**Based on results, jump to the appropriate section:**

| Result | Jump To |
|--------|---------|
| `CLI_NOT_INSTALLED` | [Step 1: Create Account](#step-1-create-an-olakai-account) |
| `NOT_AUTHENTICATED` | [Step 2: Install CLI](#step-2-install-the-cli) if CLI missing, else [Step 3: Authenticate](#step-3-authenticate) |
| Empty agents list | [Step 4: Register Your Agent](#step-4-register-your-agent-in-olakai). Use "register" language (not "create your first agent") when presenting next steps. |
| Agents exist | You're all set! Use `/olakai-new-project` or `/olakai-integrate` instead |

---

## Step 1: Create an Olakai Account

If you don't have an Olakai account yet, create one directly from the terminal.

### 1.1 Collect User Details

Ask the user for:
- **Email address** (required)
- **Company name** (required)
- **First name** (optional)
- **Last name** (optional)

### 1.2 Create the Account via API

Use the Bash tool to call the signup endpoint. Replace the placeholder values with what the user provided:

```bash
curl -s -X POST https://app.olakai.ai/api/auth/signup \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "USER_EMAIL",
    "companyName": "USER_COMPANY",
    "firstName": "USER_FIRST_NAME",
    "lastName": "USER_LAST_NAME",
    "source": "claude-code",
    "medium": "skill"
  }'
```

**Expected response:**
```json
{ "success": true, "message": "Check your email to verify your account.", "requiresVerification": true }
```

### 1.3 Verify Email

Tell the user:
- Check their inbox for a verification email from Olakai
- Click the verification link to activate their account
- After verification, an SDK API key is automatically generated — no extra steps needed

### 1.4 Fallback: Browser Signup

If the API call fails (network issues, corporate firewall, etc.), direct the user to the browser-based signup:

**https://app.olakai.ai/signup?flow=developer&source=claude-code**

> **IMPORTANT:** Always include the `?flow=developer&source=claude-code` query parameters — they activate the developer onboarding flow.

### What You Get

- **Free tier** — Monitor up to 1,000 events/month
- **Dashboard** — Real-time visibility into AI usage
- **KPIs** — Track custom metrics across your agents
- **Governance** — Set policies and risk controls

After verifying your email, you'll have access to the dashboard where you can see your agents and events.

---

## Step 2: Install the CLI

The Olakai CLI is the primary tool for configuring agents, KPIs, and custom data.

### 2.1 Install via npm

```bash
npm install -g olakai-cli
```

### 2.2 Verify Installation

```bash
olakai --version
# Should output: olakai-cli/0.1.x
```

### 2.3 Troubleshooting Installation

**Permission errors on macOS/Linux:**
```bash
# Option 1: Use sudo (not recommended)
sudo npm install -g olakai-cli

# Option 2: Fix npm permissions (recommended)
mkdir -p ~/.npm-global
npm config set prefix '~/.npm-global'
echo 'export PATH=~/.npm-global/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
npm install -g olakai-cli
```

**Windows:**
```powershell
# Run PowerShell as Administrator
npm install -g olakai-cli
```

---

## Step 3: Authenticate

Connect the CLI to your Olakai account.

### 3.1 Login

```bash
olakai login
```

This opens your browser for secure authentication. After logging in:
- The CLI stores your session locally
- No API key needed for CLI operations
- Session persists until you explicitly logout

### 3.2 Verify Authentication

```bash
olakai whoami
```

Expected output:
```
Logged in as: your.email@example.com
Account: Your Organization
```

### 3.3 Troubleshooting Authentication

**"Not authenticated" errors:**
```bash
# Clear cached credentials and re-login
olakai logout
olakai login
```

**Browser doesn't open:**
```bash
# The CLI will display a URL - copy and paste it manually
olakai login
# Look for: "Open this URL in your browser: https://app.olakai.ai/..."
```

**Corporate proxy/firewall issues:**
- Ensure `app.olakai.ai` is accessible
- Check if your organization requires VPN

---

## Step 4: Register Your Agent in Olakai

This step registers your AI agent (or any AI-powered feature) in Olakai so it can be monitored. This doesn't build any code — it creates a tracking record where Olakai collects analytics, KPIs, and governance data.

### 4.1 Register the Agent

```bash
# Create agent with an API key for SDK integration
olakai agents create \
  --name "My First Agent" \
  --description "Testing Olakai integration" \
  --with-api-key \
  --json
```

**Save the output!** It contains your `apiKey` which you'll need for SDK integration:

```json
{
  "id": "cmkbteqn501kyjy4yu6p6xrrx",
  "name": "My First Agent",
  "apiKey": "sk_agent_xxxxx..."
}
```

### 4.2 Set the API Key as Environment Variable

```bash
# Add to your shell profile (.bashrc, .zshrc, etc.)
export OLAKAI_API_KEY="sk_agent_xxxxx..."
```

Or add to your project's `.env` file:
```
OLAKAI_API_KEY=sk_agent_xxxxx...
```

### 4.3 Retrieve API Key Later

If you need to get the API key again:
```bash
olakai agents get AGENT_ID --json | jq '.apiKey'
```

---

## Step 5: Install the SDK

Choose based on your project's language.

### TypeScript/JavaScript

```bash
npm install @olakai/sdk
```

**Quick Integration:**

```typescript
import { OlakaiSDK } from "@olakai/sdk";
import OpenAI from "openai";

// Initialize Olakai
const olakai = new OlakaiSDK({
  apiKey: process.env.OLAKAI_API_KEY!
});
await olakai.init();

// Wrap your OpenAI client
const openai = olakai.wrap(
  new OpenAI({ apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY }),
  { provider: "openai" }
);

// Use as normal - events are automatically tracked
const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4",
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Hello!" }]
});
```

### Python

```bash
pip install olakai-sdk
```

**Quick Integration:**

```python
import os
from openai import OpenAI
from olakaisdk import olakai_config, instrument_openai

# Initialize Olakai
olakai_config(os.getenv("OLAKAI_API_KEY"))
instrument_openai()

# Use OpenAI as normal - events are automatically tracked
client = OpenAI()
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
)
```

---

## Step 6: Generate a Test Event

Let's verify everything is working.

### 6.1 Run Your Code

Execute the code from Step 5. This should:
1. Make an LLM call
2. Automatically send event data to Olakai

### 6.2 Fetch the Event

```bash
# List recent events (replace with your agent ID)
olakai activity list --limit 1 --json
```

### 6.3 Verify Event Details

```bash
# Get full event details
olakai activity get EVENT_ID --json | jq '{prompt, response, tokens, model}'
```

**Expected output:**
```json
{
  "prompt": "Hello!",
  "response": "Hello! How can I assist you today?",
  "tokens": 25,
  "model": "gpt-4"
}
```

### 6.4 Check the Dashboard

Open **https://app.olakai.ai** and navigate to your agent's activity view. You should see the event appear within seconds.

---

## Step 7: Next Steps

You're now set up! Here's what to explore next:

### Add Custom Data to Events

Track business-specific metrics:

```typescript
// TypeScript
const response = await openai.chat.completions.create(
  { model: "gpt-4", messages },
  {
    customData: {
      feature: "customer-support",
      ticketId: "TICKET-123",
      priority: 1
    }
  }
);
```

```python
# Python
from olakaisdk import olakai_context

with olakai_context(customData={"feature": "customer-support", "ticketId": "TICKET-123"}):
    response = client.chat.completions.create(...)
```

### Create KPIs

Define metrics that aggregate your custom data:

```bash
# First, create the custom data config for your agent
olakai custom-data create --agent-id YOUR_AGENT_ID --name "Priority" --type NUMBER

# Then create a KPI
olakai kpis create \
  --name "High Priority Events" \
  --agent-id YOUR_AGENT_ID \
  --calculator-id formula \
  --formula "IF(Priority == 1, 1, 0)" \
  --aggregation SUM
```

> **Note:** KPIs are created per-agent. If you later create additional agents, you'll need to create KPIs for each one separately — they can't be shared across agents. CustomDataConfigs, on the other hand, are account-level and shared.
