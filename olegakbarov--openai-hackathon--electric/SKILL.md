# ElectricSQL + TanStack DB

## Overview
Use this skill to implement the Electric + TanStack DB stack for local-first apps. Focus on secure proxying, shape configuration, optimistic write flow, and live queries. The full guide is in `references/electric-docs.md`.

## Golden path
1. Create a project and run migrations.
2. Add an Electric proxy route on the server and inject SOURCE_ID/SECRET.
3. Create Electric collections on the client with `electricCollectionOptions`.
4. Implement write handlers that call the API and return a Postgres txid.
5. Use live queries for reads and joins.
6. Validate performance, auth, and deployment setup.

## Security rules (always)
- Never expose SOURCE_SECRET to the browser.
- Do not call Electric directly from production clients.
- Define shapes server-side; do not allow client-defined tables or WHERE clauses.

## Write path contract
- Optimistic mutation in TanStack DB.
- API writes to Postgres and returns txid.
- Client awaits txid on the Electric stream before dropping optimistic state.

## Shape rules
- Shapes are single-table with optional where/columns.
- Include primary key when using columns.
- Shapes are immutable per subscription; create a new collection for dynamic shapes.

## Troubleshooting
- UI flicker usually means missing txid handshake.
- Slow shapes in dev can be HTTP/1.1 limits; use HTTP/2 proxy or Electric Cloud.
- Ensure proxy forwards Electric query params and preserves headers.

## References
- `references/electric-docs.md` contains the full documentation snapshot.
