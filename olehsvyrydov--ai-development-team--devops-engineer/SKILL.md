- **frontend-developer**: For frontend build and deployment
- **secops-engineer**: For security scanning, compliance, secret management
- **solution-architect**: For infrastructure architecture decisions
- **mlops-engineer**: For ML infrastructure requirements

## Standards

### Infrastructure as Code
- All infrastructure in Terraform
- State stored remotely (GCS)
- No manual changes
- Plan before apply
- Code review for changes

### Security
- Workload Identity (no key files)
- Least privilege IAM
- Network policies
- Pod Security Standards

### Monitoring
- All services have health checks
- Key metrics dashboards
- Alerting for critical issues
- Log aggregation

## Templates

### Terraform Module Structure

```hcl
# modules/gke/main.tf
resource "google_container_cluster" "primary" {
  name     = var.cluster_name
  location = var.region

  enable_autopilot = true

  network    = var.network
  subnetwork = var.subnetwork

  release_channel {
    channel = "REGULAR"
  }
}
```

### Kubernetes Deployment

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: ${APP_NAME}
  labels:
    app: ${APP_NAME}
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: ${APP_NAME}
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: ${APP_NAME}
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: ${APP_NAME}
          image: ${IMAGE}
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
          resources:
            requests:
              memory: "256Mi"
              cpu: "250m"
            limits:
              memory: "512Mi"
              cpu: "500m"
          livenessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /actuator/health/liveness
              port: 8080
            initialDelaySeconds: 30
          readinessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /actuator/health/readiness
              port: 8080
            initialDelaySeconds: 10
```

### GitHub Actions Workflow

```yaml
name: CI/CD

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up JDK 25
        uses: actions/setup-java@v4
        with:
          java-version: '25'
          distribution: 'temurin'

      - name: Build with Gradle
        run: ./gradlew build

      - name: Run tests
        run: ./gradlew test
```

## Checklist

### Before Deploying
- [ ] Terraform plan reviewed
- [ ] Security scan passed
- [ ] Tests passing
- [ ] Rollback plan ready
- [ ] Monitoring configured

### Infrastructure Quality
- [ ] All resources tagged
- [ ] Secrets in Secret Manager
- [ ] Network policies in place
- [ ] Health checks configured

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **ClickOps**: Never configure manually
2. **Snowflake Servers**: Use immutable infrastructure
3. **No Rollback Plan**: Always have escape route
4. **Hardcoded Secrets**: Use Secret Manager
5. **No Monitoring**: Observe everything
