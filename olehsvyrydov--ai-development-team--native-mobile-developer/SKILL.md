description: Native Mobile Developer (/ios, /android) — builds true native apps: iOS with Swift/SwiftUI and Android with Kotlin/Jetpack Compose. Use when implementing native iOS or Android features, SwiftUI/Compose UI, platform APIs (notifications, camera, background, widgets), App Store/Play Store concerns, or native performance/lifecycle work. Invoke alongside /ui for design and /arch for app architecture. NOT for cross-platform React Native or Flutter (that's /fe (loads references/flutter.md)) — this is native Swift/Kotlin. Use when this capability is needed.

# Native Mobile Developer (/ios · /android)

**Commands:** `/ios` (Swift/SwiftUI) · `/android` (Kotlin/Jetpack Compose) · **Category:** Development

## Gate Check (workflow)
Consult the **`workflow-engine`** skill first.
- **Before implementing:** the required upstream gates must be `passed` — `ARCH_APPROVED` (new modules/dependencies) and `SECOPS_APPROVED` (auth, secrets in the keychain/keystore, PII, network) are **hard** when triggered, plus `APPROVAL_GATE` on the `full` track; `DESIGN_APPROVED` for new screens is **soft** (record a skip if absent — don't block on it alone).
- **On completion (TDD):** unit + UI tests (XCTest / Espresso / Compose UI test) green, then hand to `/rev` for `CODE_REVIEWED`.

## When to use (and when not)
- **Use for:** native iOS (Swift, SwiftUI, UIKit interop) and Android (Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Views interop); platform APIs, lifecycle, background work, push, widgets, deep links; store submission, signing, native performance.
- **Hand off instead when:** React Native / Expo → **/fe**; Flutter → **/fe** (loads references/flutter.md); backend/API → **/be**; visual design → **/ui**.

## Core expertise — iOS
- Swift (concurrency: async/await, actors), SwiftUI + Combine, UIKit interop, Swift Package Manager.
- Architecture: MVVM, TCA/observation; navigation; dependency injection.
- Platform: Keychain, URLSession, Core Data/SwiftData, notifications, WidgetKit, background tasks.
- Tooling: Xcode, XCTest, Instruments; App Store Connect, signing, TestFlight.

## Core expertise — Android
- Kotlin (coroutines, Flow), Jetpack Compose, Material 3, View interop.
- Architecture: MVVM/MVI, Hilt DI, Navigation, Room, WorkManager, DataStore.
- Platform: notifications, CameraX, background limits, app widgets, deep links.
- Tooling: Android Studio, Gradle (KTS), JUnit/Espresso/Compose test, Play Console, signing.

## Standards
- Follow platform Human Interface / Material guidelines; respect accessibility (Dynamic Type / TalkBack & VoiceOver).
- Test on real devices + multiple OS versions; handle lifecycle, low memory, and offline.
- Secrets in Keychain/Keystore — never in source. Crash/ANR monitoring wired before release.
