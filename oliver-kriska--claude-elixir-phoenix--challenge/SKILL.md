# Challenge Mode Reviews

Rigorous, critical review patterns inspired by Boris Cherny's "Grill me" approach. Push beyond first solutions to ensure quality.

## Iron Laws - Never Violate These

1. **No approval without verification** - Don't approve until all concerns addressed
2. **Assume bugs exist** - Look for edge cases, race conditions, missing handlers
3. **Question everything** - Even "obvious" code can hide issues
4. **Demand proof** - Ask for tests, show state transitions, verify behavior

## Adversarial Lenses (Apply to ALL Modes)

1. **"What Would Break This?"** — Production failure modes under load, during deploys, with unexpected data
2. **"Assumption Stress Test"** — List every assumption; which are most fragile?
3. **"Contradictions Finder"** — Find contradictions between tests/implementation, docs/behavior, or within the changeset

## Challenge Modes

### Ecto Challenge (`/phx:challenge ecto`)

Grill the developer on database changes:

**Migration Safety**

- Will this migration lock the table in production?
- What happens to existing records without the new field?
- Is the migration reversible?
- Are there any unsafe operations (column removal, type change)?

**Query Performance**

- Have you introduced any N+1 queries?
- Are there missing indexes for new WHERE clauses?
- Will this query scale with data growth?

**Schema Integrity**

- Are all constraints enforced at database level?
- What happens during rolling deployment (old code, new schema)?
- Are foreign key cascades correct?

**Backward Compatibility**

- Will old code work during deployment?
- Are there any breaking changes to the context API?

### LiveView Challenge (`/phx:challenge liveview`)

Prove the LiveView handles all cases:

**Event Coverage**

- List every `handle_event` clause and expected socket state
- What happens if socket assigns are missing when event fires?
- Are there race conditions between user events and server pushes?

**PubSub Handling**

- List every `handle_info` clause and when it's triggered
- Do all PubSub subscriptions have corresponding handlers?
- What happens if a message arrives before mount completes?

**State Transitions**

- Show the event → handler → state transition table
- Are all error states handled gracefully?
- What's the recovery path from each error state?

**Memory & Performance**

- Are large lists using streams?
- Is transient data using temporary_assigns?
- What's the memory footprint per connected user?

### PR Challenge (`/phx:challenge pr`)

Senior engineer review checklist:

**Must Pass**

- [ ] No direct Repo calls in controllers/LiveViews
- [ ] All Ecto queries use explicit preloads
- [ ] Changesets validate all user input
- [ ] No atoms created from params
- [ ] Error cases handled (not just happy path)
- [ ] Tests cover new functionality

**Performance**

- [ ] No queries in Enum.map loops
- [ ] LiveView streams for lists > 100 items
- [ ] Indexes exist for WHERE clause columns

**OTP**

- [ ] GenServers have supervision
- [ ] Timeouts set for GenServer.call
- [ ] No unbounded process spawning

**Security**

- [ ] No SQL injection via raw queries
- [ ] No path traversal in file handling
- [ ] Authorization checks present

## Prior Findings Deduplication (MANDATORY)

CRITICAL: Prevents re-discovering identical issues across consecutive runs.

1. **Search** `.claude/plans/*/reviews/` and `.claude/reviews/` for prior findings
2. **Read ALL** prior findings before analyzing code
3. **Check each finding** against priors:
   - Fixed → **SKIP** | Still present → **PERSISTENT** (one line) | New → **NEW** (full analysis) | Reintroduced → **REGRESSION**
4. **Present**: NEW first (full), then PERSISTENT (one-line), then REGRESSION

## Example Challenge Output

```markdown
## Challenge: Ecto — Orders Migration

### FINDING 1: Table lock risk (HIGH)
AddColumn on `orders` (2.1M rows) will lock table during deploy.
**Proof needed**: Run `SELECT count(*) FROM orders` — if >1M, use
`ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN ... DEFAULT NULL` (no lock).

### FINDING 2: Missing index (MEDIUM)
New `WHERE status = ?` query on line 45 has no index.
**Action**: Add `create index(:orders, [:status])` to migration.

### Status: BLOCKED — 2 unresolved findings
```

## Usage

Run `/phx:challenge [mode]` to initiate a rigorous review. The reviewer will not approve until all concerns are addressed with evidence.

Example workflow:

1. Run `/phx:challenge ecto` after migration changes
2. Answer each question with code references or test results
3. Address all concerns before proceeding to PR
