# Intervals Time Entry Automation

Fill time entries in Intervals Online from Obsidian daily notes using MCP chrome-devtools, with GitHub activity and Outlook calendar correlation.

## Prerequisites

1. Chrome/Chromium running with `--remote-debugging-port=9222`
2. Intervals page open: `https://bhi.intervalsonline.com/time/multiple/`
3. chrome-devtools MCP server configured

## Cache Location

**IMPORTANT**: Cached files are stored in the PROJECT, not the plugin:

```
<project-root>/.claude/intervals-cache/
├── project-mappings.md         # Project→workType mappings
├── github-mappings.md          # Repo→project mappings
├── outlook-mappings.md         # Calendar→project mappings
└── fetch-github-activity.sh    # GitHub activity fetcher script
```

These files persist between sessions. If they don't exist, create them from the plugin's `references/` and `scripts/` directories.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Read Notes

Read the daily note for the requested date. Default location: `Daily Notes/YYYY-MM-DD.md`

Look for:
- Time entries with project/work descriptions
- Links to GitHub PRs or repos (e.g., `https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123`)
- Mentions of PR numbers (e.g., "PR #123", "reviewed PR 456")

### Phase 1.5: GitHub Activity Correlation (REQUIRED)

**ALWAYS run this phase** to fetch GitHub activity and enhance time entry descriptions.

#### Step 1: Ensure Script Is Up-to-Date

The script has a version number on line 2 (e.g., `# Version: 2`). Check and update if needed:

1. Read the plugin script: `~/.claude/skills/intervals-time-entry/scripts/fetch-github-activity.sh`
2. Extract the version number from line 2
3. If `.claude/intervals-cache/fetch-github-activity.sh` exists, extract its version number
4. If the cached script doesn't exist OR the plugin version is higher, copy the plugin script to `.claude/intervals-cache/fetch-github-activity.sh`

This ensures users always have the latest script with bug fixes and new features.

#### Step 2: Fetch Activity

**Run this command** (replace YYYY-MM-DD with the target date):
```bash
bash .claude/intervals-cache/fetch-github-activity.sh YYYY-MM-DD
```

This returns JSON with:
- PRs authored (created or updated)
- PRs reviewed
- Events with timestamps (commits, reviews, comments)

**IMPORTANT**: The script output already includes PR titles and body snippets in `prs_authored`, `prs_active`, and `prs_reviewed`. Do NOT make separate `gh pr view` calls — use the data already returned by the script.

#### Step 3: Correlate with Notes

Using the JSON output from Step 2:
1. **Match PRs to time entries**: If notes mention a PR or repo, link it to that entry
2. **Infer repo→project mappings**: When a PR clearly matches a time entry's project, add to `.claude/intervals-cache/github-mappings.md`
3. **Extract PR links from notes**: Look for GitHub URLs and extract repo/PR info

#### Step 4: Enhance Descriptions

**ALWAYS improve descriptions** when GitHub data provides more context. The goal is to make time entries self-documenting and meaningful for future reference.

**Before/After Examples:**

| Notes say | GitHub shows | Final description |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| "font awesome icon PR" | PR #574: "Add FontAwesome Pro icons to design system" | Add FontAwesome Pro icons to design system (PR #574) |
| "review and merge PRs" | Reviewed PR #580, #581, #583 | Code review: notification preferences (#580), cart validation (#581), search filters (#583) |
| "text-transform work" | PR #579: "Add text-transform utilities to typography tokens" | Add text-transform utilities to typography design tokens (PR #579) |
| "bug fixes" | PR #602: "Fix race condition in checkout flow" | Fix race condition in checkout flow (PR #602) |
| "API work" | Commits: "Add pagination to /users endpoint", "Handle empty results" | Add pagination to /users endpoint with empty result handling |

**Rules:**
- Use the PR title as the primary description when available (it's usually well-written)
- Use the PR description/body for additional context when the title alone is too brief or generic
- Add PR number in parentheses at the end: `(PR #123)`
- For reviews, briefly describe each PR reviewed (2-5 words each)
- For commits without PRs, summarize the commit messages
- Keep to 1-2 sentences max, but make them specific and meaningful
- Never use generic descriptions like "development work" when GitHub has specifics

#### Step 5: Suggest Adjustments

Compare GitHub activity to notes and flag potential issues:

**Missing time entries**: If GitHub shows significant activity (multiple commits, PRs) for a repo but notes have no corresponding entry, suggest adding one.

**Time discrepancies**: Use commit timestamps to estimate minimum time spent:
- Calculate span from first to last commit on a repo
- Account for gaps >2h as breaks
- If notes show significantly less time than commits suggest, flag for review

Example output:
```
⚠️ GitHub shows commits on technomic-api from 9:15am to 3:30pm (~4-5h with breaks)
   but notes only show 2h for Technomic dev work. Consider adjusting.

💡 Found PR #456 "Fix payment edge case" for Technomic - using for description.

📝 No time entry found for 3 PR reviews on ewg-frontend. Suggest adding:
   - EWG: 0.5-1h Architecture/Technical Design (PR reviews #12, #13, #14)
```

### Phase 1.7: Outlook Calendar Correlation (REQUIRED)

**ALWAYS run this phase** to visually read the Outlook calendar and cross-reference with notes and GitHub activity.

**Prerequisite**: User must be logged into Outlook Web in the browser (same Chrome instance with `--remote-debugging-port=9222`).

#### Step 1: Find or Open Outlook Web Tab

**IMPORTANT**: Never navigate away from the user's current tab. Always find an existing Outlook tab or create a new one.

1. Call `list_pages` to see all open browser tabs
2. Look for a tab with URL containing `outlook.office.com` or `outlook.live.com`
3. If found: call `select_page` with that page's ID
4. If NOT found: call `new_page` with the day view URL (see Step 2)

#### Step 2: Navigate, Verify, and Extract Calendar Data

**Navigate** to the target date's day view:

```
https://outlook.office.com/calendar/view/day/YYYY/M/D
```

Note: month and day are **not zero-padded** (e.g., `2026/2/16` not `2026/02/16`).

- If the tab is already on Outlook but wrong date: call `navigate_page` with the day view URL
- If a new tab was created in Step 1: it will already be on the correct URL

**Verify the date** — immediately after navigation, call `take_screenshot` and confirm the calendar is showing the correct date. The date header is visible at the top of the day view.

- If the screenshot shows the **wrong date**: wait 3 seconds, then call `navigate_page` again with the same URL. Take another screenshot to verify.
- If still wrong after retry: try the alternative URL format with zero-padded month/day (e.g., `2026/02/04` instead of `2026/2/4`). Take a screenshot to verify.
- **Only proceed once the correct date is confirmed** in the screenshot.

**Extract calendar data** visually from the verified screenshot:

- **Meeting subjects** — the text on each calendar block
- **Start and end times** — from the time labels on the left axis and block positions
- **Duration** — calculated from start/end times
- **Declined events** — shown with strikethrough text or dimmed/crossed-out appearance
- **All-day events** — shown in the top banner area (above the hourly grid)
- **Attendee names** — visible if shown in the calendar block
- **Location** — if visible in the calendar block

If the calendar is zoomed out and events are hard to read, note which events need clarification and proceed with what's visible.

**CRITICAL**: Use `take_screenshot` for visual reading — do NOT use `take_snapshot`, DOM inspection, or click-based navigation for calendar data extraction. The entire point of this phase is visual analysis without brittle DOM dependencies. If the screenshot is unclear, take another screenshot — never fall back to DOM snapshots or clicking calendar elements.

#### Step 3: Correlate with Notes and GitHub

Using the visually extracted calendar data, cross-reference with notes and GitHub data:

1. **Match meetings to time entries**: If notes mention a meeting that appears in the calendar, link them
2. **Infer project from attendees**: Use `people-context.md` to determine which project a meeting belongs to
3. **Infer project from subject**: Match calendar subjects against `project-mappings.md` terms
4. **Learn calendar mappings**: When a calendar event clearly maps to a project, add to `.claude/intervals-cache/outlook-mappings.md`

#### Step 4: Detect Missing Entries

Compare calendar events against notes and flag gaps:

**Missing time entries**: If the calendar shows a meeting but notes have no corresponding entry, suggest adding one.

```
📅 Calendar shows "Technomic-EXSQ Weekly Touchbase" (11:00-12:00, 1h)
   — but no matching time entry in notes.
   Suggest: Ignite Application Development & Support | Meeting: Client Meeting - US | 1h
```

**Declined events**: Skip events with strikethrough/dimmed appearance (user declined). **All-day events**: Ignore for time entries (they're reminders, not meetings).

#### Step 5: Validate Durations

Compare calendar durations against note durations and flag discrepancies:

```
⚠️ Notes say "standup 30min" but calendar shows "Technomic Scrum" was 15min (9:00-9:15).
   Suggest adjusting to 0.25h.

⚠️ Notes say "client meeting 1h" but calendar shows "Technomic-EXSQ Weekly Touchbase"
   was 1.5h (11:00-12:30). Suggest adjusting to 1.5h.

✅ Notes say "EWG sync 1h" and calendar confirms "Weekly EX2 <> EWG Sync" was 1h (2:00-3:00).
```

**Rules for duration validation:**
- **Notes duration is the source of truth** — if notes say 1.5h and calendar says 1h, trust the notes (it means more time was spent than scheduled)
- If a time entry links to a meeting note (e.g., `[[2026-02-19 Meeting Name]]`), check the meeting note for a recording duration — the time entry cannot be less than that duration
- If notes duration is more than calendar, the meeting may have included prep/follow-up — keep notes as-is
- All-day events are reminders, not meetings — ignore for duration
- Events the user declined (strikethrough) should be excluded entirely

#### Step 6: Enhance Descriptions

**Improve meeting descriptions** when calendar data provides more context:

| Notes say | Calendar shows | Final description |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| "meeting" | "Technomic-EXSQ Weekly Touchbase" | Weekly touchbase with Technomic |
| "EWG sync" | "Weekly EX2 <> EWG Sync" | EWG weekly sync |
| "standup" | "Technomic Scrum" | Technomic daily scrum |
| "1:1" | "1:1 with Chris" | 1:1 with Chris |
| "client call" | "Drees Design Review" | Drees design review |

**Rules:**
- Use calendar subject as primary description when it's more specific than notes
- Add attendee names visible in the calendar block (especially client names from `people-context.md`)
- For recurring meetings, note any distinguishing details from this specific instance
- Combine with GitHub context when applicable (e.g., meeting + PR demo)

#### Step 7: Time Gap Analysis

Use calendar events + GitHub commits to build a picture of the full workday:

```
9:00-9:15   Technomic Scrum (calendar) → standup
9:15-11:00  [gap: GitHub shows 5 commits on technomic-api] → dev work
11:00-12:00 Technomic-EXSQ Touchbase (calendar) → client meeting
12:00-1:00  [no activity] → likely lunch
1:00-3:00   [gap: GitHub shows 3 commits on ewg-frontend] → dev work
3:00-3:30   Weekly EX2 <> EWG Sync (calendar) → client meeting
3:30-4:00   1:1 with Chris (calendar) → 1:1
4:00-5:00   [gap: GitHub shows 2 PR reviews] → code review
```

This gap analysis helps:
- Validate that notes account for the full workday
- Identify development blocks between meetings
- Suggest time allocations for unaccounted gaps

### Phase 2: Load Mappings

1. **Read project cache**: `.claude/intervals-cache/project-mappings.md` (in the project root)
2. **Read GitHub mappings cache**: `.claude/intervals-cache/github-mappings.md` (learned repo→project associations)
3. **Read Outlook mappings cache**: `.claude/intervals-cache/outlook-mappings.md` (learned calendar→project associations)
4. **Read plugin references** for defaults: `references/worktype-mappings.md`, `references/people-context.md`

If the project cache doesn't exist, create it by copying from `references/project-mappings.md`.
If the GitHub mappings cache doesn't exist, create it from `references/github-mappings.md`.

Output format: `Project | Module (if applicable) | Work Type | Hours | Description`

**Module handling**: Some projects have a Module dropdown (e.g., Optimizely CMS Decoupling). Check `project-mappings.md` for listed modules. When building entries:
- If the work matches a specific module, include `module: "Module Name"` in the entry
- If no specific module applies, **omit the module field** — the fill script will automatically select "No Module"
- The script detects the Module dropdown at runtime; projects without it are unaffected

### Phase 3: Validate Against Cache

Check the project cache for work types:
- If all projects have cached work types → skip browser inspection
- If any project is NOT cached → inspect browser to discover its work types

### Phase 4: Browser Automation

#### Step 1: Find or Create Intervals Tab

**IMPORTANT**: Never navigate away from the user's current tab. Always find an existing Intervals tab or create a new one.

1. Call `list_pages` to see all open browser tabs
2. Look for a tab with URL containing `intervalsonline.com`
3. If found: call `select_page` with that page's ID
4. If NOT found: call `new_page` with URL `https://bhi.intervalsonline.com/time/multiple/`
5. Only call `navigate_page` if the selected tab is on Intervals but wrong URL (e.g., different week)

#### Step 2: Run Scripts

Use MCP chrome-devtools with these scripts from `scripts/`:

1. **Basic inspection** (`scripts/inspect-basics.js`): Get dates and day index
2. **Discover work types** (`scripts/discover-worktypes.js`): For uncached projects only
3. **Fill entries** (`scripts/fill-entries.js`): Fill all validated entries

**IMPORTANT**: All scripts use arrow function format for MCP compatibility:
```javascript
// ✅ Correct
async () => { ... }

// ❌ Wrong - causes syntax errors
(async function() { ... })();
```

### Phase 5: UPDATE THE CACHE (Critical!)

**After discovering new work types, ALWAYS update the project cache file.**

If you discovered work types for a new project (e.g., "Drees Maintenance and Support"):

1. Read the current cache: `.claude/intervals-cache/project-mappings.md`
2. Add the new project section:

```markdown
### Drees Maintenance and Support (20240034)
- Development - US
- Meeting: Client Meeting - US
- QA/Testing - US
```

3. Write the updated file back

**Example update workflow:**
```
1. Read .claude/intervals-cache/project-mappings.md
2. Append new section under "## Cached Work Types by Project"
3. Write updated content to .claude/intervals-cache/project-mappings.md
```

This ensures future runs skip inspection for this project, saving time and tokens.

### Phase 5.5: Update GitHub Mappings Cache

When you discover a new repo→project association (from PR links in notes or inferred from context):

1. Read the current cache: `.claude/intervals-cache/github-mappings.md`
2. Add the mapping to the table:

```markdown
| owner/repo-name | Intervals Project Name |
```

3. Write the updated file back

This helps future correlation work more accurately by remembering which repos belong to which projects.

### Phase 5.6: Update Outlook Mappings Cache

When you discover a new calendar event→project association (from subject matching, attendee inference, or user confirmation):

1. Read the current cache: `.claude/intervals-cache/outlook-mappings.md`
2. Add the mapping to the appropriate table:

For subject→project mappings:
```markdown
| Calendar Subject Pattern | Intervals Project | Work Type |
|--------------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Technomic-EXSQ Weekly Touchbase | Ignite Application Development & Support | Meeting: Client Meeting - US |
```

For recurring meeting mappings:
```markdown
| Meeting Name | Intervals Project | Work Type |
|-------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Technomic Scrum | Ignite Application Development & Support | Meeting: Internal Stand Up - US |
```

3. Write the updated file back

This helps future runs instantly map recurring meetings to the correct project and work type.

### Phase 6: Verify

Take screenshot to confirm entries are correct.

### Phase 7: Write Time Entry Table to Daily Note

After verification, write the finalized entries back to the Obsidian daily note as a permanent record.

#### Step 1: Resolve Vault Path

Read `$OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH` from the environment. The daily note is at:
```
$OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH/Daily Notes/YYYY-MM-DD.md
```

#### Step 2: Read the Daily Note

Read the daily note file to find the insertion point.

#### Step 3: Insert or Replace the Intervals Section

Look for an existing `### Intervals` section:
- **If found**: Replace the entire section (from `### Intervals` to the next `###` or `---` or end of file) with the updated table
- **If not found**: Insert the section using this priority:
  1. Before `### Coding Sessions` if it exists
  2. After `### Open todos` (before the next `###` or `---`)
  3. After `### Done today` if `### Open todos` doesn't exist
  4. At the end of the note if none of the above exist

#### Step 4: Write the Table

Format as a markdown table with a horizontal rule before it:

```markdown
------
### Intervals
| Project | Hours | Description |
|---------|------:|-------------|
| Ignite Application Development & Support | 2 | Weekly touchbase with Technomic |
| EWG Feature Enhancement Addendum | 3.5 | Add pagination endpoint (PR #574) |
| **Total** | **5.5** | |
```

- Use the same ENTRIES data that was sent to `fill-entries.js`
- Right-align the Hours column
- Add a bold **Total** row summing all hours
- The `------` separator goes before `### Intervals` to visually separate it from the section above

### Phase 8: Insert into SQLite Database

After writing the daily note table, insert the same entries into an SQLite database for cross-day querying.

#### Database Location

```
$OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH/.claude/time-entries.db
```

#### Schema

Created on first use via `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS intervals_time_entries (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  date TEXT NOT NULL,          -- YYYY-MM-DD
  project TEXT NOT NULL,
  work_type TEXT NOT NULL,
  hours REAL NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  created_at TEXT DEFAULT (datetime('now'))
);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_intervals_entries_unique
  ON intervals_time_entries(date, project, work_type, description);
```

#### Insert Entries

Use `INSERT OR REPLACE` to make re-runs idempotent:

```sql
INSERT OR REPLACE INTO intervals_time_entries (date, project, work_type, hours, description)
VALUES ('2026-02-04', 'Ignite Application Development & Support', 'Meeting: Client Meeting - US', 2, 'Weekly touchbase with Technomic');
```

Run via Bash:
```bash
sqlite3 "$OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH/.claude/time-entries.db" <<'SQL'
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS intervals_time_entries (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  date TEXT NOT NULL,
  project TEXT NOT NULL,
  work_type TEXT NOT NULL,
  hours REAL NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  created_at TEXT DEFAULT (datetime('now'))
);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_intervals_entries_unique
  ON intervals_time_entries(date, project, work_type, description);
INSERT OR REPLACE INTO intervals_time_entries (date, project, work_type, hours, description)
VALUES ('YYYY-MM-DD', 'Project Name', 'Work Type', 2.0, 'Description here');
SQL
```

Repeat the `INSERT OR REPLACE` for each entry in the ENTRIES array.

## Quick Reference

### Day Index Mapping

| Day | Index |
|-----|-------|
| Sunday | 0 |
| Monday | 1 |
| Tuesday | 2 |
| Wednesday | 3 |
| Thursday | 4 |
| Friday | 5 |
| Saturday | 6 |

### Common Fallbacks

| Project | Missing Work Type | Use Instead |
|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| Meeting | Internal Working Session | Team/Company Meeting |
| EWG Feature Enhancement Addendum | Analysis - US | Development - US |

## Customization

### Plugin References (read-only defaults)
The `references/` files in this plugin contain default mappings. Fork this repo to customize for your organization.

### Project Cache (read-write, auto-updated)
The cache at `.claude/intervals-cache/project-mappings.md` in your project:
- Gets created automatically from plugin defaults on first run
- Gets UPDATED automatically when new projects are discovered
- Persists between sessions
- Is project-specific (each project can have its own cache)

### GitHub Mappings Cache (read-write, auto-learned)
The cache at `.claude/intervals-cache/github-mappings.md`:
- Gets created on first use from plugin template
- Gets UPDATED when Claude discovers repo→project associations from:
  - PR links in your notes (e.g., `https://github.com/acme/widget/pull/123`)
  - Contextual inference (PR activity matching time entry project names)
- Used to correlate future GitHub activity to correct Intervals projects

### Outlook Mappings Cache (read-write, auto-learned)
The cache at `.claude/intervals-cache/outlook-mappings.md`:
- Gets created on first use from plugin template
- Gets UPDATED when Claude discovers calendar→project associations from:
  - Meeting subjects matching project names
  - Attendees matching known people in `people-context.md`
  - User confirmations during the workflow
- Used to instantly map recurring meetings to correct projects and work types
- Stores both subject-based and recurring meeting patterns

## First-Time Setup

On first use in a new project, Claude will:
1. Check if `.claude/intervals-cache/project-mappings.md` exists
2. If not, create it from the plugin's `references/project-mappings.md` template
3. Check if `.claude/intervals-cache/github-mappings.md` exists
4. If not, create it from the plugin's `references/github-mappings.md` template
5. Check if `.claude/intervals-cache/outlook-mappings.md` exists
6. If not, create it from the plugin's `references/outlook-mappings.md` template
7. Check if `.claude/intervals-cache/fetch-github-activity.sh` exists and compare version
8. If missing or outdated, copy from the plugin's `scripts/fetch-github-activity.sh`
9. Use and update these local caches going forward

## Efficiency

This skill is optimized for minimal browser interaction:
- **Cached mappings** eliminate redundant inspection
- **Auto-updating cache** means you only inspect each project ONCE ever
- **Single script execution** fills all entries
- **GitHub correlation** runs once via `gh` CLI, no browser needed
- **Outlook calendar** uses a single browser screenshot — no API tokens or scripts needed
- **Learned repo mappings** improve correlation accuracy over time
- **Learned calendar mappings** improve meeting→project accuracy over time
- **Cross-source validation** catches discrepancies between notes, calendar, and GitHub
