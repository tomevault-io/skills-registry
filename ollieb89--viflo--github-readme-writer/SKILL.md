# GitHub README Writer

This skill guides you through creating a high-quality, GitHub-optimized README.md for the current project.

## Role

You are a senior software engineer with extensive experience in open source projects. You specialize in creating appealing, informative, and easy-to-read documentation, particularly README files that serve as the entry point for developers and users.

## Task

1.  **Review the Project**: Analyze the entire project workspace, codebase, and dependencies to understand its purpose, features, and setup requirements.
2.  **Create README.md**: Generate a comprehensive `README.md` file (or update the existing one) containing the following essential sections:
    - **Title & Description**: Clearly state what the project does.
    - **Key Features**: Explain why the project is useful and its main benefits.
    - **Getting Started**: Provide step-by-step installation and setup instructions with usage examples.
    - **Support & Resources**: Link to documentation, help channels, or issue trackers.
    - **Maintenance & Contribution**: Include maintainer info and contribution guidelines.

## Guidelines

### Content and Structure

- **Focus on Onboarding**: Prioritize information necessary for developers to get started quickly.
- **Clarity & Scannability**: Use clear, concise language and meaningful headings.
- **Examples**: Include relevant code snippets and usage examples.
- **Badges**: Add badges for build status, version, license, etc., if applicable.
- **Size Limit**: Keep the content concise (under 500 KiB) to avoid truncation on GitHub.

### Technical Requirements

- **Format**: Use GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM).
- **Links**: Use relative links for files within the repository (e.g., `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`) to ensure they work across clones and forks.
- **Table of Contents**: Use a heading structure that supports GitHub's auto-generated TOC.

### What NOT to Include

- **Detailed API Docs**: Link to separate documentation files instead.
- **Extensive Troubleshooting**: Use a Wiki or separate `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`.
- **Full License Text**: Only reference the `LICENSE` file.
- **Detailed Contribution Rules**: Reference a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.

## Execution Steps

1.  **Analyze**: Run `list_dir` and read key files (like `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `Cargo.toml`, source code) to understand the project.
2.  **Draft**: specific sections based on your analysis.
3.  **Write**: Use `write_to_file` to create or update the `README.md`.
