## When to use

Use this skill when the user asks about:
- Drawing 2D graphics in React Native (shapes, paths, images)
- Shaders, gradients, and visual effects in React Native
- Animating canvas content with Reanimated or gesture handlers
- Image filters: blur, drop shadow, displacement maps, morphology
- Text rendering, paragraphs, and text along paths
- Skia API usage: Paint, Canvas, Groups, Masks
- Video rendering, Lottie animations (Skottie)
- Web support or headless Skia rendering

## How to find information

1. Use Topic Guide above to identify relevant files
2. Read `TOC.md` for complete file listing by directory
3. Read specific files from `contents/{path}`
