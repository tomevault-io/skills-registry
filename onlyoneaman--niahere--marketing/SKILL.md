# Marketing

Routes to the right marketing sub-skill based on your request.

## Before Starting

**Check for product marketing context first:**
If `.agents/product-marketing-context.md` exists (or `.claude/product-marketing-context.md` in older setups), read it before asking questions. Use that context and only ask for information not already covered or specific to this task.

## Mode Selection

| Need | File |
|------|------|
| Pricing, packaging, monetization, pricing tiers | [pricing-strategy.md](pricing-strategy.md) |
| Competitor comparison pages, vs pages, alternative pages | [competitor-alternatives.md](competitor-alternatives.md) |
| Social media content (LinkedIn, Twitter, TikTok, etc.) | [social-content.md](social-content.md) |
| Product launch, feature announcement, go-to-market | [launch-strategy.md](launch-strategy.md) |
| Churn reduction, cancel flows, dunning, retention | See churn section below |

## Churn Prevention

Churn has its own sub-modes. First read [churn-prevention.md](churn-prevention.md), which routes to:
- [churn-cancel-flows.md](churn-cancel-flows.md) — exit surveys, save offers, UI patterns
- [churn-prediction.md](churn-prediction.md) — risk signals, health scores
- [churn-dunning.md](churn-dunning.md) — payment recovery, retry logic
