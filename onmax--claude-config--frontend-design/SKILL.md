This skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

## Before You Code

**Understand the context**:
- Purpose: What problem does this solve? Who uses it?
- Tone: Pick a clear direction (see Personality below)
- Constraints: Framework, performance, accessibility requirements
- Differentiation: What's the ONE thing someone will remember?

**Commit to a direction**. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

NEVER use generic AI-generated aesthetics:
- Overused fonts: Inter, Roboto, Arial, Space Grotesk
- Cliched colors: purple gradients on white
- Predictable layouts and patterns
- Cookie-cutter design lacking context-specific character

Every design should be DIFFERENT. Vary themes, fonts, aesthetics. Don't converge on common choices across generations.

## Design System Foundations

### Typography
- **Type scale**: 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 24, 30, 36, 48, 60, 72px (hand-crafted, not ratios)
- **Body**: 16-17px, line-height 1.5-1.6
- **Headers**: line-height 1.0-1.3, tighter letter-spacing
- **Weights**: 400-500 body, 600-700 emphasis. Never under 400
- **Line length**: 45-75 characters optimal
- Choose fonts with 4-5 weights. Serif=elegant, rounded=playful, neutral=relies on other elements

### Color
- Use HSL for human-readable color manipulation
- Build complete palette: 8-10 greys, 5-10 shades per primary/accent
- Increase saturation as lightness moves from 50%
- Avoid true grey (0% saturation) and pure black (#000000)
- WCAG contrast: 4.5:1 normal text, 3:1 large
- Gradients: max 30 degree hue shift between colors

### Spacing
- **Scale**: 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128px
- Start with TOO MUCH white space, remove until happy
- More space around groups than within them
- Desktop margins: 160-180px. Mobile margins: 20-24px

### Shadows & Depth
- Light comes from above (lighter top edge, shadow below)
- Soft shadows: blur 30-60px, opacity 5-10%, Y offset 20-40px
- 5-level elevation system: sm (buttons) to 2xl (modals)
- Two-part shadows for realism: large soft + small tight
- Interactive: increase on lift/drag, decrease on press

### Components
- Button hierarchy: CTA > Primary > Secondary > Tertiary
- Button height 40-60px, horizontal padding 32px
- Minimum tap target: 44x44px
- Form inputs: match width to expected input length
- Cards: only info needed to make a decision
- Nav: max 5-7 visible items, de-emphasize inactive

## Personality Spectrum

| Trait | Playful | Neutral | Formal |
|-------|---------|---------|--------|
| Colors | Saturated | Balanced | Muted |
| Typography | Rounded Sans | Clean Sans | Serif |
| Corners | 20px+ radius | 8-12px | 0-4px |
| Icons | Rounded | Mixed | Sharp |
| Language | Friendly | Clear | Professional |
| Imagery | Illustrations | Either | Real photos |

**Stay consistent** - don't mix personality traits (e.g., playful illustrations + Serif fonts).

## Finishing Touches

- **Accent borders**: top of cards, active nav items, side of alerts
- **Backgrounds**: section color changes, subtle gradients (<30 degree hue diff), geometric decorations
- **Supercharge defaults**: icons for bullets, oversized quotation marks, custom link underlines
- **Fewer borders**: try shadows, background colors, or spacing first

## Motion & Animation

- Focus on high-impact moments: page load with staggered reveals > scattered micro-interactions
- Animation duration: <1000ms
- Ease-in-out for natural feel
- Interactive feedback: hover states, press states, loading indicators

## Visual Hierarchy

- **Not all elements are equal** - deliberately de-emphasize secondary content
- **Three-level color hierarchy**: dark (primary), grey (secondary), light grey (tertiary)
- **Emphasize by de-emphasizing** - soften competing elements instead of making primary louder
- **Labels**: often unnecessary. "12 left in stock" not "In stock: 12"
- **Icons feel heavy** - reduce contrast to balance with text

## Implementation Notes

Match complexity to vision:
- **Maximalist**: elaborate code, extensive animations, layered effects
- **Minimalist**: restraint, precision, careful attention to spacing and subtle details

NEVER use generic AI-generated aesthetics. Interpret creatively. Make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context.

## Loading Files

**Consider loading these reference files based on your task:**

- [ ] [typography.md](references/typography.md) - if working with fonts, scales, or text hierarchy
- [ ] [color.md](references/color.md) - if designing color palettes or checking contrast
- [ ] [spacing.md](references/spacing.md) - if defining layout grids or margins
- [ ] [shadows-depth.md](references/shadows-depth.md) - if adding elevation or depth effects
- [ ] [components.md](references/components.md) - if building buttons, forms, cards, or nav

**DO NOT load all files at once.** Load only what's relevant to your current task.
