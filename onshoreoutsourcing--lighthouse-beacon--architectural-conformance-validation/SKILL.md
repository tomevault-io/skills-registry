# Architectural Conformance Validation

Validates that features, waves, and implementation code conform to established architectural patterns, ADR decisions, and technical standards.

## Quick Start

**Validate feature plan:**
```
"Validate architectural conformance for feature-5.1-global-services-foundation.md against Architecture.md and ADRs"
```

**Check wave design:**
```
"Check wave-5.1.1 conforms to singleton pattern from ADR-018"
```

**Verify implementation:**
```
"Verify src/services/ conforms to architecture documented in ADRs"
```

## Core Workflow

### Step 1: Load Architecture Context

Read architectural standards and decisions:

1. **Architecture Document**: `Docs/architecture/_main/05-Architecture.md`
   - Extract: Component structure, design patterns, tech stack, data flow, API standards

2. **ADR Directory**: `Docs/architecture/decisions/`
   - Read `README.md` for ADR index
   - Identify relevant ADRs for the feature/component being validated
   - Read `references/adr-compliance-checklist.md` for validation criteria

3. **Previous Features**: `Docs/implementation/_main/feature-*.md`
   - Identify established patterns from implemented features
   - Note consistency expectations

### Step 2: Analyze Target Artifact

Determine what's being validated:

**For Feature Plans** (`Docs/implementation/_main/feature-*.md`):
- Extract proposed architecture approach
- Identify technology choices
- Note design patterns mentioned
- Find integration points

**For Wave Plans** (`Docs/implementation/iterations/wave-*.md`):
- Extract implementation approach
- Identify specific patterns to be used
- Note technical decisions

**For Source Code** (`src/`, `tests/`):
- Analyze actual implementation
- Identify patterns used
- Check naming conventions
- Verify structure matches architecture

### Step 3: Run Conformance Checks

Execute validation checks from `references/validation-checklist.md`:

#### Pattern Conformance
✅ **Design Patterns**: Singleton, Factory, Dependency Injection, Observer, etc.
- Does implementation follow documented pattern?
- Are pattern variations justified?
- Is pattern application consistent?

✅ **Architectural Patterns**: MVC, Layered, Microservices, Event-Driven, etc.
- Does component fit into defined architecture?
- Are layer boundaries respected?
- Is separation of concerns maintained?

#### ADR Compliance
✅ **Technology Decisions**:
- Uses approved frameworks/libraries from ADRs?
- Follows technology constraints?
- Justifies any deviations?

✅ **Security/Compliance Decisions**:
- Implements security patterns from ADRs?
- Follows authentication/authorization standards?
- Meets compliance requirements (HIPAA, PCI DSS)?

✅ **Algorithm/Approach Decisions**:
- Uses documented algorithms?
- Follows performance optimization decisions?
- Implements error handling as specified?

#### Structural Conformance
✅ **Component Structure**:
- Matches architecture diagram?
- Naming conventions followed?
- Directory structure consistent?

✅ **API Contracts**:
- REST/GraphQL standards followed?
- Error response format consistent?
- Versioning strategy followed?

✅ **Data Flow**:
- Follows documented data flow?
- Uses established data models?
- Respects data boundaries?

### Step 4: Identify Violations and Gaps

For each check, categorize findings:

**CRITICAL (🔴)**: Must fix before implementation
- Violates security ADR
- Breaks established API contract
- Incompatible with architecture

**WARNING (🟡)**: Should fix, may cause issues
- Pattern variation without justification
- Missing error handling pattern
- Inconsistent naming

**INFO (🔵)**: Nice to have, best practice
- Could use more common pattern
- Documentation enhancement opportunity
- Optimization possibility

### Step 5: Generate Conformance Report

Create validation report in `Docs/reports/architecture/conformance-{artifact}-{date}.md`:

```markdown
# Architectural Conformance Report

**Artifact**: [Feature/Wave/Code path]
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Overall Score**: XX/100

## Executive Summary
[1-2 sentence summary of conformance status]

## Conformance Score Breakdown
- Design Patterns: XX/100
- ADR Compliance: XX/100
- Structural Standards: XX/100
- Technology Stack: XX/100

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
### Issue 1: [Description]
- **Location**: [File:line or section]
- **Violation**: [What standard violated]
- **ADR Reference**: [ADR-XXX]
- **Impact**: [Why this matters]
- **Remediation**: [How to fix]

## Warnings (Should Fix)
[Similar format]

## Information (Consider)
[Similar format]

## Positive Findings
- ✅ [What conforms well]
- ✅ [What conforms well]

## Recommendations
1. [Action item 1]
2. [Action item 2]
```

Use `scripts/calculate_conformance_score.py` to compute overall score.

## Key Concepts

**Architectural Conformance**: Degree to which implementation aligns with documented architecture

**Design Pattern**: Reusable solution to common problem (Singleton, Factory, Observer, etc.)

**ADR (Architectural Decision Record)**: Document capturing significant architectural decision with context, options considered, decision made, and consequences

**Technology Stack**: Approved frameworks, libraries, languages, and tools

**Conformance Score**: 0-100 metric calculated as:
- Critical violations: -20 points each
- Warnings: -5 points each
- Info items: -1 point each
- Base: 100 points
- Minimum: 0 points

## Available Resources

### Scripts
- **scripts/calculate_conformance_score.py** — Calculates conformance score from violation counts
  ```bash
  python scripts/calculate_conformance_score.py --critical 2 --warnings 5 --info 3
  # Output: Conformance Score: 65/100
  ```

- **scripts/extract_adr_requirements.py** — Extracts checkable requirements from ADRs
  ```bash
  python scripts/extract_adr_requirements.py --adr Docs/architecture/decisions/ADR-018-singleton-pattern.md
  # Output: JSON list of requirements to check
  ```

## Validation Phases

### Phase 1: Feature Design Validation
**When**: During `/design-features` (Step 4 - Document ADRs)
**Focus**: Proposed architecture approach
**Output**: Design conformance report
**Gate**: Medium threshold (70+ score to proceed)

### Phase 2: Wave Design Validation
**When**: During `/design-waves` (before implementation)
**Focus**: Implementation plan details
**Output**: Implementation approach conformance
**Gate**: High threshold (80+ score to implement)

### Phase 3: Post-Implementation Validation
**When**: During `/implement-waves` (Step 5 - Architecture Review)
**Focus**: Actual code implementation
**Output**: Code conformance report with file:line references
**Gate**: Critical threshold (90+ score for production)

## Common Violation Patterns

**Anti-Pattern 1: Technology Creep**
- Issue: Introducing new library not in approved stack
- Check: Compare imports/dependencies against tech stack ADR
- Fix: Use approved alternative or create ADR for new tech

**Anti-Pattern 2: Pattern Misapplication**
- Issue: Using Singleton when Factory would be appropriate
- Check: Verify pattern choice aligns with use case
- Fix: Refactor to correct pattern or justify deviation

**Anti-Pattern 3: Implicit Decisions**
- Issue: Making architectural choice without documenting
- Check: Look for new patterns/approaches without ADR
- Fix: Create ADR documenting decision and rationale

**Anti-Pattern 4: Architecture Drift**
- Issue: Small deviations accumulating over time
- Check: Compare against original architecture diagram
- Fix: Refactor to align or update architecture doc

```

**`/design-waves` integration**:
```markdown
## Step 2.5: Validate Wave Design Conformance

Before finalizing wave plan:
- Validate wave approach conforms to feature architecture
- Check ADR compliance for implementation details
- Ensure score ≥80 before creating Azure DevOps work items
```

**`/implement-waves` integration**:
```markdown
## Step 5: Final Architecture Review

- **system-architect**: Run conformance validation
  - Validate src/ against Docs/architecture/_main/05-Architecture.md
  - Check ADR compliance in implementation
  - Generate conformance report
  - Block merge if score <90
```

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Conformance score calculated accurately
- ✅ All violations categorized by severity
- ✅ Each violation references specific ADR or architecture doc
- ✅ Remediation steps provided for each violation
- ✅ Report generated in standard format
- ✅ Decision made (PROCEED/REVISE/BLOCK) based on score and phase

## Tips for High Conformance

1. **Review ADRs early** - Check relevant ADRs before design
2. **Ask "why" for deviations** - Justify any architectural changes
3. **Document new patterns** - Create ADR for novel approaches
4. **Stay consistent** - Follow established patterns from previous features
5. **Validate iteratively** - Check at design, pre-implementation, and post-implementation
6. **Update architecture docs** - Keep Architecture.md current as patterns evolve
