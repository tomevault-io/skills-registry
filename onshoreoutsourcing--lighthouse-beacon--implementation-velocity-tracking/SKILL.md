# Implementation Velocity Tracking

Tracks actual implementation velocity and provides predictive estimates for remaining work based on historical data.

## Quick Start

**Record wave completion metrics:**
```
"Record metrics for wave-5.1.1: 28 actual hours, 24 estimated, 3 defects, 92% coverage"
```

**Estimate remaining work:**
```
"Estimate completion time for remaining waves in Feature 5 using historical velocity"
```

**Analyze quality trends:**
```
"Analyze defect density and test coverage trends for last 30 days"
```

## Core Workflow

### Step 1: Record Wave Completion Metrics

After each wave completes, record actual metrics:

**Timing Metrics**:
- Estimated hours (from wave plan)
- Actual hours worked
- Start date
- Completion date
- Duration (calendar days)

**Quality Metrics**:
- Defects found (during development)
- Defects found (post-release)
- Test coverage percentage
- Code review cycle time
- Rework percentage

**Deliverables**:
- User stories completed
- User stories deferred
- Acceptance criteria met
- Technical debt created

### Step 2: Calculate Velocity Metrics

**Wave Velocity**:
```
Wave Velocity = Actual Hours / Estimated Hours
```

**Examples**:
- 1.0 = Perfect estimate
- 0.8 = Finished early (20% faster than estimated)
- 1.25 = Took longer (25% over estimate)

**Rolling Average Velocity** (last N waves):
```
Team Velocity = Average(Wave Velocities)
```

**Velocity Trend**:
- Improving: Velocity decreasing toward 1.0
- Stable: Velocity consistent
- Worsening: Velocity increasing (taking longer than estimated)

### Step 3: Track Quality Metrics

**Defect Density**:
```
Defect Density = Defects Found / KLOC (thousands of lines of code)
```
Or simpler:
```
Defects per Wave = Average defects across waves
```

**Test Coverage Trend**:
- Track coverage percentage over time
- Identify waves with low coverage
- Set coverage targets (e.g., >90%)

**Rework Percentage**:
```
Rework % = (Rework Hours / Total Hours) × 100
```

### Step 4: Generate Predictive Estimates

**Estimate Remaining Work**:
```
Adjusted Estimate = Base Estimate × Team Velocity
```

**Example**:
- Remaining waves: 5 waves
- Estimated hours: 120 hours total
- Team velocity: 1.12
- Adjusted estimate: 120 × 1.12 = 134 hours

**Calendar Estimate** (with team size):
```
Calendar Days = Adjusted Hours / (Team Size × Hours per Day)
```

**Example**:
- Adjusted hours: 134
- Team size: 2 developers
- Hours per day: 8
- Calendar days: 134 / (2 × 8) = 8.4 days

**Confidence Level**:
- High: Based on 15+ completed waves
- Medium: Based on 5-14 completed waves
- Low: Based on <5 completed waves

### Step 5: Analyze Trends and Generate Reports

Create report in `Docs/reports/velocity/metrics-{date}.md`:

```markdown

## Key Concepts

**Velocity**: Ratio of actual hours to estimated hours (1.0 = perfect estimate)

**Team Velocity**: Rolling average velocity across recent waves

**Defect Density**: Number of defects per wave or per KLOC

**Test Coverage**: Percentage of code covered by tests

**Rework**: Time spent fixing issues in already-completed code

**Adjusted Estimate**: Base estimate multiplied by team velocity

**Confidence Level**: Reliability of prediction based on historical data quantity

**Velocity Trend**: Direction velocity is moving (improving/stable/worsening)

## Tracking Phases

### Phase 1: Initial Calibration (First 3-5 Waves)
**When**: Starting new project or team
**Focus**: Establish baseline velocity
**Output**: Initial velocity estimate
**Note**: Low confidence, wide variance expected

### Phase 2: Velocity Stabilization (Waves 6-15)
**When**: Team finding rhythm
**Focus**: Track velocity convergence
**Output**: Medium confidence estimates
**Note**: Velocity should stabilize around consistent value

### Phase 3: Mature Velocity Tracking (Wave 15+)
**When**: Established team and process
**Focus**: Fine-tuning and quality optimization
**Output**: High confidence estimates
**Note**: Focus shifts from velocity to quality metrics

### Phase 4: Continuous Improvement
**When**: Ongoing
**Focus**: Process optimization
**Output**: Trend analysis and recommendations
**Note**: Use data to drive process improvements

## Common Velocity Patterns

**Pattern 1: Early Optimism** (First 3 waves)
```
Velocity starts low (0.6-0.8), then increases to 1.2-1.5
Cause: Initial estimates too optimistic
Solution: Calibrate estimates upward
```

**Pattern 2: Learning Curve** (Waves 1-10)
```
Velocity high initially (1.5+), gradually decreases to 1.0-1.1
Cause: Team learning codebase and process
Solution: Normal, velocity will stabilize
```

**Pattern 3: Technical Debt Impact**
```
Velocity gradually increasing (1.0 → 1.3 → 1.5)
Cause: Accumulated technical debt slowing development
Solution: Dedicate waves to refactoring
```

**Pattern 4: Scope Creep**
```
Velocity consistently high (1.3-1.5)
Cause: Scope creeping beyond estimates
Solution: Better scope control in wave planning
```

**Pattern 5: Quality Issues**
```
Velocity low (0.8-0.9) but defect density high
Cause: Rushing to meet deadlines, creating defects
Solution: Allow realistic timelines, improve quality
```

## Tips for Accurate Velocity Tracking

1. **Record immediately** - Record metrics right after wave completion
2. **Be honest** - Accurate data is more valuable than optimistic data
3. **Track consistently** - Use same metrics for all waves
4. **Sufficient history** - Need 5+ waves for reliable predictions
5. **Adjust for context** - Account for team changes, complexity variations
6. **Review trends** - Look for patterns, not individual waves
7. **Use for learning** - Velocity is a tool for improvement, not judgment
