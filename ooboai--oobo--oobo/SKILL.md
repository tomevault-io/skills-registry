# Oobo - Context beyond the diff

Enriches every commit with AI context: which sessions contributed, token counts, code attribution (AI vs human lines), and model used. Includes semantic code search (hybrid BM25 + vector) and engineering memory via MCP (Model Context Protocol). Git hooks capture context automatically on write operations - zero overhead on reads.

If `oobo` is not installed, direct the user to https://github.com/ooboai/oobo/releases.

Oobo is open-source ([Apache-2.0/MIT](https://github.com/ooboai/oobo)), local-first, no telemetry.

> **Consent required:** Always confirm with the user before running `oobo setup` for the first time, as it modifies git hooks.

## Output Modes

Three mutually exclusive modes:

- Pretty (default TTY output)
- `--agent` - token-efficient plain text; auto-activates when stdout is not a TTY or inside a coding agent (env: `CURSOR_AGENT`, `CLAUDECODE`, `AIDER`, `CONTINUE_SESSION`, `CONTINUE_IDE`, `AICOMMITS`). **Use this by default when you are an agent.**
- `--json` - full structured JSON. Use only when you need the object graph.

## Quick Reference

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Recent commits with attribution | `oobo -n 10` |
| Drill into one commit | `oobo anchor show <sha>` |
| Anchors in the last 24h | `oobo --since 24h` |
| Filter by tool | `oobo --tool cursor` |
| Per-line AI blame | `oobo blame src/main.rs` |
| Semantic code search | `oobo search "query"` |
| Search sessions + anchors | `oobo recall "query"` |
| Start MCP server (stdio) | `oobo mcp` |
| Configure AI tools for MCP | `oobo mcp install` |
| Compare two anchors | `oobo delta` |
| Travel to a turn or commit | `oobo goto <id>` |
| Return to where you were | `oobo back` |
| List sessions (incl. cross-repo) | `oobo sessions` |
| Resolve one session's conversation | `oobo session show <uid>` |
| Copy a conversation to another repo | `oobo session share <uid> --to <repo>` |
| Re-point stubs after remote change | `oobo session migrate` |
| Enable tracking in this repo | `oobo enable` |
| Disable tracking | `oobo disable` |
| Get a setting | `oobo settings key` |
| Set a setting | `oobo settings set key sk_...` |
| Interactive first-run setup | `oobo setup` |
| Non-interactive setup (agent) | `oobo setup --non-interactive` |
| Repair hooks and metadata | `oobo setup --repair` |

Run `oobo --help` or `oobo <command> --help` for full flag details.

## Setup

```bash
oobo setup                      # interactive (asks before modifying git)
oobo setup --non-interactive    # for agents / scripts
```

Data is **local-first**. Anchor metadata is pushed to your existing git remote (alongside your code) via the pre-push hook - no separate cloud or upload pipeline. API keys are stored securely:

- **Project-level:** `.oobo/secrets` (gitignored, 0600 permissions) - set with `oobo settings project set key <key>`
- **Global:** `~/.oobo/config` - set with `oobo settings set key <key>`
- **Env override:** `OOBO_SECRET_KEY` or `OOBO_API_KEY` for CI/scripts

Keys are only needed for remote recall/delta/ask/get_context. Resolution order: env var > project secrets > global config.

Capture is real-time: git hooks (post-commit, pre-push, post-merge, post-rewrite) fire automatically and write anchors to the orphan branch. No background scanning or indexing needed.

## Key Behaviors

- Commit SHA prefix matching for `oobo anchor show` (unambiguous prefixes only)
- Token counts marked `is_estimated: true` are heuristic estimates; `false` means native counts from the tool
- `oobo update` self-updates and runs migrations automatically
- Data lives on git orphan branches (`oobo/anchors/v1`, `oobo/anchors/v2`) - git-native, no external database
- `oobo blame` is a strict superset of `git blame` - every flag is forwarded; machine-output formats (`--porcelain`, `--line-porcelain`, `--incremental`) bypass the AI overlay automatically. `--json` includes per-line `provenance` (session, turn, trigger, prompt) when attribution-v2 data exists.
- Sessions can span repos: a session in project X that edits project Y is recorded in both - Y holds a pointer stub, the conversation lives once in its home store. `oobo sessions` shows the pointer and whether the conversation is readable from here.
- `oobo goto` is strictly repo-local - it never touches another repo's worktree, even when the turn's session edited multiple repos.

## MCP (Model Context Protocol)

Oobo exposes engineering memory to AI agents via MCP. One command configures your tools:

```bash
oobo mcp install              # auto-detect Cursor/Claude/Copilot and configure
oobo mcp install cursor       # configure a specific tool
oobo mcp install --hosted     # cloud-only mode (no local binary needed by the tool)
oobo mcp install --remove     # uninstall MCP configuration
```

### Tools exposed

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `search` | Semantic code search (local, via sonar) |
| `find_related` | Find code related to a query across the indexed codebase |
| `recall` | Search engineering memory (sessions, decisions, patterns) |
| `get_context` | Token-budgeted, file-scoped context from engineering history |
| `ask` | Natural language questions against the team's engineering memory |

**Agent best practice:** Call `get_context` at the start of any non-trivial task with the files you plan to modify. It returns plain-text guidance (not raw JSON) with relevant history, past decisions, and known pitfalls for those files.

The local server (`oobo mcp`) runs as a stdio child process managed by the AI tool. Cloud tools (`recall`, `get_context`, `ask`) require an API key (`oobo settings project set key <key>`).

## Legacy commands

0.1.x commands (`scan`, `projects`, `stats`, `card`, `share`, `sync`, `auth`, `ignore`, etc.) are no longer recognized. Users on those versions should upgrade.
