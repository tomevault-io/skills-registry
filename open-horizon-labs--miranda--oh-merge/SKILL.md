# oh-merge

Like drummer, but for GitHub issue PRs (from oh-task) instead of ba task PRs (from mouse). Holistically review pending PRs, then squash-merge them as a cohesive batch.

## Invocation

`/oh-merge`

## Flow

1. Read dive context (if available) for project background:
   ```bash
   cat .wm/dive_context.md 2>/dev/null || echo "No dive context"
   ```

2. Find all PRs with `oh-merge` label:
   ```bash
   gh pr list --label oh-merge --json number,title,headRefName,baseRefName,additions,deletions
   ```
   **Only PRs with the `oh-merge` label are eligible for merge.**

   **IMPORTANT:** PRs with merge conflicts ARE eligible. The skill rebases and resolves conflicts in step 6. Do NOT skip PRs because of conflict status - that's exactly what this skill handles.

3. **Build dependency graph and identify stacks:**
   - Create adjacency list: `baseRefName → [PRs targeting it]`
   - Find root PRs: those where `baseRefName = main` (or master)
   - Identify stacks: chains where child PRs target parent PR branches
   - **Detect cycles**: If a branch eventually targets itself, report error and skip
   - Example graph:
     ```
     main ← PR #42 (issue/123) ← PR #43 (issue/456)
     main ← PR #44 (issue/789)  [separate stack]
     ```

4. **Select stack to process:**
   - If multiple independent stacks exist, pick first by lowest root PR number (FIFO by age)
   - If multiple PRs target the same base branch, order by PR number (lowest first)
   - Report other stacks as "queued for next run"
   - Process only one stack per invocation to keep merges atomic
   - **Orphaned children**: If a child PR targets a branch that doesn't exist (parent merged externally), update its base to main and treat as a root

5. **Batch review** - evaluate all PRs in the selected stack together:
   - Collect combined diff of all PRs against main
   - Run `sg review` on the combined changes
   - Evaluate:
     - Do changes conflict logically? (same code modified differently)
     - Is there duplicate work? (two PRs solving same problem)
     - Do changes compose well? (feature A + feature B = coherent whole)
     - Any cross-cutting concerns? (shared dependencies, API changes)
   - If concerns found:
     - Report issues
     - Ask human whether to proceed or address first

6. **Merge stack in dependency order** (root first, then children):

   For each PR in the stack, starting from the root:

   a. **Verify CI is passing:**
      ```bash
      gh pr checks <pr-number> --fail-on-error
      ```
      If CI is failing, stop and report error.

   b. **Rebase onto its target branch:**
      ```bash
      git fetch origin
      gh pr checkout <pr-number>
      git rebase origin/<base-branch>  # main for root, parent branch for children
      ```

   c. **Resolve any rebase conflicts** (this is expected and normal):
      - Conflicts WILL occur when main has moved since the PR was created
      - Use standard git conflict resolution to fix each conflicting file
      - This is the core value of oh-merge - handling what GitHub can't auto-merge
      - Only fail if conflicts are truly unresolvable (contradictory changes)

   d. Push rebased branch:
      ```bash
      git push --force-with-lease
      ```

   e. Squash merge:
      ```bash
      gh pr merge <pr-number> --squash
      ```

   f. **For child PRs in the stack** (after parent merged):
      - Update base branch to main:
        ```bash
        gh pr edit <child-pr-number> --base main
        ```
      - Rebase child onto main:
        ```bash
        gh pr checkout <child-pr-number>
        git rebase origin/main
        git push --force-with-lease
        ```
      - Now child PR targets main and is rebased, continue to merge it (step a-e)

   g. **On merge failure** - If any PR in the stack fails to merge:
      - Stop processing the stack
      - Report which PRs were merged successfully and which failed
      - Signal error: already-merged PRs stay merged, failed PR remains open
      - Next oh-merge run will see the failed PR as a new root (its parent is now in main)

   **Note:** Unlike drummer, no `ba finish` step is needed. GitHub automatically closes
   linked issues when the PR merges (via "Closes #N" in the PR body).

## Stacked PRs

When PRs target other PR branches (not main), oh-merge detects the stack and processes it:

**Detection:**
```bash
gh pr list --label oh-merge --json number,title,headRefName,baseRefName
```
- PRs with `baseRefName = main` are roots
- PRs with `baseRefName = issue/<number>` are children targeting that parent
- Ignore merge conflict status - we handle conflicts during rebase

**Graph building:**
```
adjacency[baseRefName] = [list of PRs targeting it]

Example:
  adjacency["main"] = [PR #42, PR #44]
  adjacency["issue/123"] = [PR #43]

Stack 1: main ← #42 (issue/123) ← #43 (issue/456)
Stack 2: main ← #44 (issue/789)
```

**Merge sequence** (for Stack 1):
1. Merge #42 to main
2. Update #43: `gh pr edit 43 --base main`
3. Rebase #43 onto main: `git rebase origin/main && git push --force-with-lease`
4. Merge #43 to main

**After processing:**
```
Before:  PR #43 → issue/123 → main
         PR #42 → main
         PR #44 → main (separate stack)

After:   PR #42 merged to main (issue #123 auto-closed)
         PR #43 rebased onto main, merged to main (issue #456 auto-closed)
         PR #44 remains for next oh-merge run
```

## Batch Review Criteria

The holistic review checks what individual PR reviews can't:

- **Logical conflicts**: PR A assumes X, PR B assumes not-X
- **Duplication**: Both PRs add similar functionality
- **Integration issues**: Combined changes break something neither breaks alone
- **Ordering dependencies**: PR B depends on PR A being merged first (auto-detected for stacked PRs)
- **Scope creep**: Batch as a whole does more than originally intended

## Prerequisites

- PRs must have the `oh-merge` label (human approval gate)
- PRs must have CI passing
- PRs should have "Closes #N" in body for auto-close (created by oh-task)
- Batch review must pass (or human override)

**Note:** The `oh-merge` label must be created in the repo. This is opt-in per repo.

## Exit Conditions

- **Success**: Selected stack fully merged
- **Partial success**: Some PRs in stack merged, then failure
- **Needs attention**: Batch review raised concerns - waiting for human decision
- **Error**: Unrecoverable failure (code conflicts, CI failing, cycle detected)
- **No work**: No PRs with `oh-merge` label found

## Completion Signaling (MANDATORY)

**CRITICAL: You MUST signal completion when done.** Call the `signal_completion` tool as your FINAL action.

**Signal based on outcome:**
| Outcome | Call |
|---------|------|
| Stack merged | `signal_completion(status: "success", message: "Merged N PRs")` |
| No PRs to merge | `signal_completion(status: "success", message: "No PRs with oh-merge label")` |
| Partial success | `signal_completion(status: "error", error: "Merged N PRs, failed on PR #X: <reason>")` |
| Unrecoverable failure | `signal_completion(status: "error", error: "<reason>")` |

**If you do not signal, the orchestrator will not know you are done and the session becomes orphaned.**

**Fallback:** If the `signal_completion` tool is not available, output your completion status as your final message in the format: `COMPLETION: status=<status> message=<message>` or `COMPLETION: status=<status> error=<reason>`.
