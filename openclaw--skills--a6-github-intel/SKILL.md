# 🔍 GitHub Intelligence

Analyze any GitHub repository in AI-friendly format. Convert repos to markdown, generate architecture diagrams, understand structure and patterns.

## Features

- **Analyze repo structure** — file tree, README, language breakdown, recent activity
- **Generate architecture diagrams** — Mermaid flowcharts from codebase structure
- **Convert repo to markdown** — entire repository as a single AI-readable document
- **Inspect language breakdown** — percentage by language with file counts
- **Track recent activity** — latest commits, contributors, release history
- **GitHub URL tricks** — hidden features, API shortcuts, search operators
- **Control analysis depth** — configurable directory traversal depth
- **Limit file count** — cap files for large repos
- **Read-only guarantee** — never executes code from repositories
- **Public API access** — no token needed (optional token for higher rate limits)

## Requirements

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | ❌ | Optional — increases rate limit from 60 to 5000 req/hr. Get from [GitHub Settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens) |

## Quick Start

```bash
PY=~/.openclaw/workspace/.venv/bin/python3

# Analyze a repository
$PY skills/github-intel/scripts/repo_analyzer.py https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code

# Convert repo to single markdown
$PY skills/github-intel/scripts/repo_to_markdown.py https://github.com/openai/openai-python

# Deep analysis
$PY skills/github-intel/scripts/repo_analyzer.py https://github.com/user/repo --depth 3
```

## Commands

### Repo Analyzer
```bash
# Basic analysis
$PY scripts/repo_analyzer.py https://github.com/owner/repo

# Deep directory traversal
$PY scripts/repo_analyzer.py https://github.com/owner/repo --depth 3

# With authentication for higher rate limits
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxx $PY scripts/repo_analyzer.py https://github.com/owner/repo
```

### Repo to Markdown
```bash
# Convert full repo
$PY scripts/repo_to_markdown.py https://github.com/owner/repo

# Limit files for large repos
$PY scripts/repo_to_markdown.py https://github.com/owner/repo --max-files 50

# Output to file
$PY scripts/repo_to_markdown.py https://github.com/owner/repo > repo.md
```

## ⚠️ Security

**This tool is READ-ONLY. It NEVER:**
- Executes code from repositories
- Runs scripts, makefiles, or build commands
- Evaluates any content from repos
