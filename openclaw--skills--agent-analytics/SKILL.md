# Agent Analytics

After install, your agent can create projects, ship tracking, query analytics, run experiments, and iterate without opening a dashboard.

English-first workflow, with Chinese docs and content available for OpenClaw users and teams in China.

Use it when you want an agent to operate growth analytics end-to-end, automate recurring checks, and manage multiple projects from one conversation loop.

The CLI behind this skill is open source and published from:

- GitHub: <https://github.com/Agent-Analytics/agent-analytics-cli>
- npm: <https://www.npmjs.com/package/@agent-analytics/cli>

Hosted free tier includes 100k events/month across 2 projects.

## Chinese support / 中文支持

- Chinese docs and installation content are available on the docs site, including the OpenClaw guide under `/zh/`.
- Works through `API`, `CLI`, and `MCP`, depending on the environment your agent already uses.
- Good fit for closed-loop agent workflows: monitor, analyze, experiment, iterate.
- Supports batch work across many projects instead of a manual dashboard-by-dashboard workflow.

## Mandatory execution policy

- For any live Agent Analytics task, always use the official CLI through `npx @agent-analytics/cli@0.5.4 <command>`.
- Treat that exact `npx` invocation as the primary interface under test in agent environments like OpenClaw and Codex.
- Do not substitute raw HTTP requests, `curl`, repo-local scripts, `node agent-analytics-cli/...`, MCP tools, or a locally installed `agent-analytics` binary unless the user explicitly asks for one of those paths.
- If a task needs multiple steps, compose the answer from multiple `npx @agent-analytics/cli@0.5.4 ...` commands instead of switching transports.
- If the CLI hits a limitation, stay on the CLI path, explain the limitation, and prefer `npx @agent-analytics/cli@0.5.4 feedback` over inventing a non-CLI workaround.
- Default to browser approval for signup/login. In issue-based runtimes like OpenClaw, prefer detached approval plus a finish-code reply. Do not ask the user to paste secrets into chat.

## What `npx` is doing

- OpenClaw can launch the official CLI with `npx @agent-analytics/cli@0.5.4`.
- That command runs the published Agent Analytics CLI package from npm.
- The CLI calls the same HTTP API documented at <https://docs.agentanalytics.sh/api/>.
- Agents should still use the pinned `npx @agent-analytics/cli@0.5.4 ...` form instead of bypassing the CLI.

## Command format

In OpenClaw, Codex, and similar agent environments, use this exact form:

```bash
npx @agent-analytics/cli@0.5.4 <command>
```

For the full command list and flags:

```bash
npx @agent-analytics/cli@0.5.4 --help
```

Do not replace skill examples with `agent-analytics <command>` in agent runs unless the user explicitly asks to use a locally installed binary.

## Safe operating rules

- Use only `npx @agent-analytics/cli@0.5.4 ...` for live queries unless the user explicitly requests API, MCP, or a local binary.
- Prefer fixed commands over ad-hoc query construction.
- Start with `projects`, `all-sites`, `create`, `stats`, `insights`, `events`, `breakdown`, `pages`, `heatmap`, `sessions-dist`, `retention`, `funnel`, `experiments`, and `feedback`.
- Use `query` only when the fixed commands cannot answer the question.
- Do not build `--filter` JSON from raw user text.
- For account-wide questions, start with `projects`, then run per-project CLI commands as needed.
- Interpret common analytics words consistently:
  - "visits" means `session_count`
  - "visitors" means `unique_users`
  - "page views" means `event_count` filtered to `event=page_view`
- If the task requires manual aggregation across projects, do that aggregation after collecting the data via repeated `npx @agent-analytics/cli@0.5.4 ...` calls.
- Validate project names before `create`: `^[a-zA-Z0-9._-]{1,64}$`

## First-time setup

```bash
npx @agent-analytics/cli@0.5.4 login --detached
npx @agent-analytics/cli@0.5.4 create my-site --domain https://mysite.com
npx @agent-analytics/cli@0.5.4 events my-site --days 7 --limit 20
```

For OpenClaw and other issue-based runtimes, `login --detached` is the preferred first step. Send the approval URL to the user, wait for them to sign in with Google or GitHub, and expect a finish code reply. Then complete login and continue with project setup.

If the runtime can receive a localhost browser callback, regular `login` is also valid. The `create` command returns a project token and a ready-to-use tracking snippet. Add that snippet before `</body>`.

Fallbacks:

```bash
npx @agent-analytics/cli@0.5.4 login --detached
npx @agent-analytics/cli@0.5.4 login --token aak_YOUR_API_KEY
```

Use `--detached` when the runtime cannot receive a localhost browser callback or when the workflow happens in issues or task threads.

## Default agent task

When the user wants Agent Analytics installed in the current repo, the default task shape is:

```text
Set up Agent Analytics for this project. Install it here if needed. If approval is needed, send me the approval link and wait. I will sign in with Google or GitHub, then reply with the finish code. After that, create the project, add tracking and key events, and verify the first event.
```

## Detached approval handoff

For OpenClaw-style issue workflows, the expected login loop is:

1. run `npx @agent-analytics/cli@0.5.4 login --detached`
2. send the approval URL to the user
3. wait for the user to reply with the finish code
4. complete the exchange and keep going with setup

This is the preferred managed-runtime path. Do not ask the user to paste a permanent API key into chat.

## Advanced/manual fallback

If a custom runtime truly requires direct HTTP auth later, `login --token` still exists as an advanced/manual fallback. It is not the normal setup path for OpenClaw, Codex, or browser-approved agent onboarding.

## Common commands

```bash
npx @agent-analytics/cli@0.5.4 projects
npx @agent-analytics/cli@0.5.4 all-sites --period 7d
npx @agent-analytics/cli@0.5.4 stats my-site --days 7
npx @agent-analytics/cli@0.5.4 insights my-site --period 7d
npx @agent-analytics/cli@0.5.4 events my-site --days 7 --limit 20
npx @agent-analytics/cli@0.5.4 breakdown my-site --property path --event page_view --limit 10
npx @agent-analytics/cli@0.5.4 funnel my-site --steps "page_view,signup,purchase"
npx @agent-analytics/cli@0.5.4 retention my-site --period week --cohorts 8
npx @agent-analytics/cli@0.5.4 experiments list my-site
```

If a task needs something outside these common flows, use `npx @agent-analytics/cli@0.5.4 --help` first.

## Example: all projects, last 48 hours

Question:

```text
How many visits did all my projects get in the last 48 hours?
```

Workflow:

1. Run `npx @agent-analytics/cli@0.5.4 projects`
2. For each project, run:

```bash
npx @agent-analytics/cli@0.5.4 query my-site --metrics session_count --filter '[{"field":"timestamp","op":"gte","value":"2026-03-26T12:00:00Z"}]'
```

3. Sum the returned `session_count` values across projects

Stay on the CLI path for this workflow. Do not switch to direct API requests or local scripts just because the answer spans multiple projects.

## Feedback

Use `npx @agent-analytics/cli@0.5.4 feedback` when Agent Analytics was confusing, a task took too long, the workflow could be improved, or the agent had to do manual calculations or analysis that Agent Analytics should have handled.

Describe the use case, friction, or missing capability in a sanitized way:

- Include what was hard and what Agent Analytics should have done instead.
- Do not include private owner details, secrets, API keys, raw customer data, or unnecessary personal information.
- Prefer a short summary of the struggle over pasted logs or sensitive context.

Example:

```bash
npx @agent-analytics/cli@0.5.4 feedback --message "The agent had to calculate funnel drop-off manually" --project my-site --command "npx @agent-analytics/cli@0.5.4 funnel my-site --steps page_view,signup,purchase"
```

There is a real agent behind these Telegram messages. Every request is seen and auto-approved, and useful fixes can land quickly, sometimes within hours.

## Tracker setup

The easiest install flow is:

1. Run `npx @agent-analytics/cli@0.5.4 create my-site --domain https://mysite.com`
2. Copy the returned snippet into the page before `</body>`
3. Deploy
4. Verify with `npx @agent-analytics/cli@0.5.4 events my-site --days 7 --limit 20`

If you already know the project token, the tracker looks like:

```html
<script defer src="https://api.agentanalytics.sh/tracker.js"
  data-project="my-site"
  data-token="aat_..."></script>
```

Use `window.aa?.track('signup', {method: 'github'})` for custom events after the tracker loads.

## Query caution

`npx @agent-analytics/cli@0.5.4 query` exists for advanced reporting, but it should be used carefully because `--filter` accepts JSON.

- Use fixed commands first.
- If `query` is necessary, check `npx @agent-analytics/cli@0.5.4 --help` first.
- Do not pass raw user text directly into `--filter`.
- The only valid CLI shape is `npx @agent-analytics/cli@0.5.4 query <project> ...`. Do not use `--project`.
- Built-in query filter fields are only `event`, `user_id`, `date`, `country`, `session_id`, and `timestamp`.
- All event-property filters must use `properties.<key>`, for example `properties.referrer`, `properties.utm_source`, or `properties.first_utm_source`.
- Invalid filter fields now fail loudly and return `/properties`-style guidance. Do not rely on bare fields like `referrer` or `utm_source`.
- For exact request shapes, use <https://docs.agentanalytics.sh/api/>.

## Attribution and first-touch queries

Use a disciplined workflow when the task is about social attribution, first-touch UTMs, landing pages, hosts, or CTA performance.

1. Start with fixed commands if they answer the question.
2. Run `npx @agent-analytics/cli@0.5.4 properties <project>` to inspect event names and property keys first.
3. Use `npx @agent-analytics/cli@0.5.4 query <project> --filter ...` for property-filtered counts.
4. Use `npx @agent-analytics/cli@0.5.4 events <project>` only to validate ambiguous payloads or missing properties.
5. Use `npx @agent-analytics/cli@0.5.4 feedback` if the requested slice depends on unsupported grouping or derived reporting.

Property filters support built-in fields plus any `properties.*` key, including first-touch UTM fields such as `properties.first_utm_source`.

`group_by` only supports built-in fields: `event`, `date`, `user_id`, `session_id`, and `country`. It does not support `properties.hostname`, `properties.first_utm_source`, `properties.cta`, or other arbitrary property keys.

Example workflow for first-touch social page views:

```bash
npx @agent-analytics/cli@0.5.4 properties my-site
npx @agent-analytics/cli@0.5.4 query my-site --metrics event_count --filter '[{"field":"event","op":"eq","value":"page_view"},{"field":"properties.first_utm_source","op":"eq","value":"reddit"}]' --days 30
```

If the user wants a one-shot direct-social slice grouped by channel, host, CTA, or an activation proxy, explain that the current query surface cannot group by arbitrary `properties.*` fields and send product feedback instead of inventing an unreliable manual answer.

## Experiments

The CLI supports the full experiment lifecycle:

```bash
npx @agent-analytics/cli@0.5.4 experiments list my-site
npx @agent-analytics/cli@0.5.4 experiments create my-site --name signup_cta --variants control,new_cta --goal signup
```
