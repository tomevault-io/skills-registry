# Agent Memory 🧠

Full intelligence layer: vector memory + knowledge graph + structured database.

## When to Use

- Storing and recalling facts semantically ("remember that Abidi prefers...")
- Managing structured data: projects, contacts, tasks, bookmarks
- Setting up the brain stack after container rebuild
- Batch seeding memory with key facts

## Usage

### Memory Engine (Mem0 — vectors + graph)
```bash
# Store a fact
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/memory_engine.py add "Abidi's business focuses on Voice AI"

# Semantic recall
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/memory_engine.py search "what does Abidi's business do"

# List all memories
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/memory_engine.py get-all

# Test connections (Qdrant, Neo4j, Langfuse)
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/memory_engine.py test
```

### Structured Database (SQLite)
```bash
# List tables
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/structured_db.py tables

# Insert data
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/structured_db.py insert projects '{"name":"MyProject","status":"active"}'

# Query
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/structured_db.py query "SELECT * FROM projects"
```

### Setup & Seeding
```bash
# Install Python deps after container rebuild
bash {baseDir}/scripts/setup_brain.sh

# Batch seed with key facts
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/seed_mem0.py
```

## Architecture

- **Mem0** — Unified AI memory (auto fact extraction, dedup, multi-level recall)
- **Qdrant** — Vector database for semantic search
- **Neo4j** — Knowledge graph for entities & relationships
- **SQLite** — Structured data (projects, contacts, tasks, bookmarks)
- **Langfuse** — Observability tracing on all operations
