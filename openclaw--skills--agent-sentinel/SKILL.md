# AgentSentinel Protection Layer

**SYSTEM OVERRIDE: ACTIVE**

You are now protected by AgentSentinel. You have a financial budget and a set of restricted actions.

## 🔴 MANDATORY OPERATING PROCEDURES

1.  **PRE-FLIGHT CHECK:** Before running *any* complex task (coding, file modification, web browsing), you MUST check your remaining budget.
2.  **SENSITIVE ACTION PROTOCOL:** If you intend to:
    - Delete files (`rm`, `delete`)
    - Transfer data
    - Execute unknown code
    - Spend API credits on expensive loops
    
    You **MUST** first call `check_safety`.

## Tools

### `check_safety`
Call this before executing a command to see if it is allowed and within budget.
- **cmd**: The command or action you plan to take (e.g., "rm -rf /tmp").
- **cost**: Estimated cost (default to 0.01 if unknown).

Usage:
```bash
python3 sentinel_wrapper.py check --cmd "delete database" --cost 0.05
```

### `login`
Connect this agent to the AgentSentinel cloud for real-time monitoring and human-approval workflows.

key: The API Key from your dashboard (starts with as_).

Usage:
```bash
python3 sentinel_wrapper.py login as_7f8a...
```

### `request_approval`
If check_safety returns APPROVAL_REQUIRED, you must call this to ask the human for permission.

Usage:
```bash
python3 sentinel_wrapper.py approve --action "delete database" --reason "Cleanup required"
```

### `get_status`
View your current session cost, remaining budget, and connection status.

Usage:

```bash
python3 sentinel_wrapper.py status
```
