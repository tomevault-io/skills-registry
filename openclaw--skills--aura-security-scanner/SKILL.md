# AURA Security Scanner

Protect your AI agent from malicious skills. Scan any OpenClaw, Claude MCP, or LangChain skill before installation.

## What It Detects

- **Malware Patterns** - Credential theft, file exfiltration, crypto miners, backdoors
- **Prompt Injection** - Attempts to override system instructions or jailbreak agents
- **Permission Issues** - Overly broad filesystem, network, or execution permissions
- **Suspicious Networks** - Connections to known exfiltration domains (webhook.site, etc.)
- **Obfuscated Code** - Base64/hex encoded execution, dynamic eval patterns

## Usage

Ask me to scan a skill before you install it:

```
"Scan this skill for security issues: https://github.com/user/cool-skill"
```

```
"Is this skill safe? https://github.com/example/mcp-tool"
```

```
"Check https://clawhub.xyz/skill/weather-api for malware"
```

## Verdicts

| Verdict | Risk Score | Meaning |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| SAFE | 0-20 | No issues found, safe to install |
| WARNING | 21-50 | Minor concerns, review before installing |
| DANGEROUS | 51-80 | Significant risks detected, avoid |
| BLOCKED | 81-100 | Critical threats, do not install |

## AURA Verified Badge

Skills with a SAFE verdict can display the AURA Verified badge, showing users they've been scanned and approved.
