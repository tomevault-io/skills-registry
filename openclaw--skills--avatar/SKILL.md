# Avatar Skill

Interactive AI avatar interface for OpenClaw with real-time lip-synced video and text-to-speech.

## Features

- **Voice Responses**: Speaks conversational summaries using ElevenLabs TTS
- **Visual Avatar**: Realistic lip-synced video via Simli
- **Detail Panel**: Shows formatted markdown alongside spoken responses
- **Multi-language**: Supports multiple languages for speech and TTS
- **Slack/Email**: Forward responses to Slack DMs or email (when configured)
- **Stream Deck**: Optional hardware control with Elgato Stream Deck

## Setup

1. Get API keys:
   - [Simli](https://simli.com) - Avatar rendering
   - [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io) - Text-to-speech

2. Set environment variables:
   ```bash
   export SIMLI_API_KEY=your-key
   export ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your-key
   ```

3. Start the avatar:
   ```bash
   openclaw-avatar
   ```

4. Open http://localhost:5173

## Response Format

When responding to avatar queries, use this format:

```
<spoken>
A short conversational summary (1-3 sentences). NO markdown, NO formatting. Plain speech only.
</spoken>
<detail>
Full detailed response with markdown formatting (bullet points, headers, bold, etc).
</detail>
```

### Guidelines

1. **spoken**: Brief, natural, conversational. This is read aloud.
2. **detail**: Comprehensive information with proper markdown.
3. Always include both sections.

## Example

User: "What meetings do I have today?"

```
<spoken>
You have three meetings today. Your first one is a team standup at 9 AM, then a product review at 2 PM, and finally a 1-on-1 with Sarah at 4 PM.
</spoken>
<detail>
