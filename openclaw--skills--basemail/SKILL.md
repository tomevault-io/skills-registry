# 📬 BaseMail - Onchain Email for AI Agents on Base

> Your agent gets a real email address, linked to its onchain identity. No human needed.

**TL;DR:** Own a Basename (`yourname.base.eth`)? Get `yourname@basemail.ai` instantly. Sign with your Base wallet, send emails autonomously.

## Why BaseMail?

- **Built on Base Chain** — Email identity tied to your onchain wallet on Base (Coinbase's L2)
- **Basename integration** — `.base.eth` holders get matching `@basemail.ai` addresses automatically
- **SIWE authentication** — Sign-In with Ethereum, no passwords or CAPTCHA needed
- **Autonomous for AI agents** — Register for services, submit forms, receive confirmations without human help
- **Verifiable identity** — Your email is cryptographically linked to your Base wallet address

BaseMail gives AI agents verifiable email identities on **Base Chain**:
- ✨ **Basename holders** → `yourname.base.eth` → `yourname@basemail.ai`
- 🔗 **Any Base wallet** → `0xwallet@basemail.ai`

### How it works

```
Base Wallet → SIWE Signature → BaseMail Registration → yourname@basemail.ai
     ↑                                                        ↓
Basename (.base.eth)                              Send & receive email autonomously
```

## 🔐 Wallet Setup (Choose One)

### Option A: Environment Variable (Recommended ✅)

If you already have a wallet, just set the env var — **no private key stored to file**:

```bash
export BASEMAIL_PRIVATE_KEY="0x..."
node scripts/register.js
```

> ✅ Safest method: private key exists only in memory.

---

### Option B: Specify Wallet Path

Point to your existing private key file:

```bash
node scripts/register.js --wallet /path/to/your/private-key
```

> ✅ Uses your existing wallet, no copying.

---

### Option C: Managed Mode (Beginners)

Let the skill generate and manage a wallet for you:

```bash
node scripts/setup.js --managed
node scripts/register.js
```

> ✅ **Always encrypted** — Private key protected with AES-256-GCM
> - You'll set a password during setup (min 8 chars, must include letter + number)
> - Password required each time you use the wallet
> - Mnemonic displayed once for manual backup (never saved to file)
> - Password input is masked (hidden) in terminal

---

## ⚠️ Security Guidelines

1. **Never** commit private keys to git
2. **Never** share private keys or mnemonics publicly
3. **Never** add `~/.basemail/` to version control
4. Private key files should be chmod `600` (owner read/write only)
5. Prefer environment variables (Option A) over file storage
6. `--wallet` paths are validated: must be under `$HOME`, no traversal, max 1KB file size
7. Private key format is validated (`0x` + 64 hex chars) before use
8. Password input is masked in terminal (characters hidden)
9. This skill only signs SIWE authentication messages — it **never sends funds or on-chain transactions**

### Recommended .gitignore

```gitignore
# BaseMail - NEVER commit!
.basemail/
**/private-key.enc
```

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1️⃣ Register

```bash
# Using environment variable
export BASEMAIL_PRIVATE_KEY="0x..."
node scripts/register.js

# Or with Basename
node scripts/register.js --basename yourname.base.eth
```

### 2️⃣ Send Email

```bash
node scripts/send.js "friend@basemail.ai" "Hello!" "Nice to meet you 🦞"
```

### 3️⃣ Check Inbox

```bash
node scripts/inbox.js              # List emails
node scripts/inbox.js <email_id>   # Read specific email
```

## 📍 File Locations

```
~/.basemail/
├── private-key.enc   # Encrypted private key (AES-256-GCM, chmod 600)
├── wallet.json       # Wallet info (public address only)
├── token.json        # Auth token (chmod 600)

```

## 🎨 Get a Basename-Linked Email

Want `yourname@basemail.ai` instead of `0x...@basemail.ai`?

1. Register a **Basename** (`.base.eth`) at https://www.base.org/names
2. Link it: `node scripts/register.js --basename yourname.base.eth`

Your Basename is your onchain identity on Base — and BaseMail turns it into a working email address.
