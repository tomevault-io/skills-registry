# BlogBurst - AI Marketing Agent That Learns & Improves

## CRITICAL INSTRUCTION — YOU MUST FOLLOW THIS:

### Step 1: Check API Key
Before doing ANYTHING, run: `echo $BLOGBURST_API_KEY`

**If the output is empty or the variable is not set**, do NOT proceed with API calls. Instead, guide the user through setup:

1. Say: "Welcome to BlogBurst! 🚀 Let me help you get set up. It only takes 30 seconds."
2. Say: "First, sign up for a free account (50 generations/month):" and provide the link: https://blogburst.ai
3. Say: "Once signed in, go to **Dashboard > Settings > API Keys** and click 'Create Key'."
4. Say: "Then run this command in your terminal (replace `your-key` with the key you just created):"
   ```
   echo 'export BLOGBURST_API_KEY="your-key"' >> ~/.zshrc && source ~/.zshrc
   ```
5. Say: "After that, restart OpenClaw or run `source ~/.zshrc`, then try `/blogburst` again!"
6. If the user says they've done it, verify by running: `curl -s "https://api.blogburst.ai/api/v1/usage" -H "X-API-Key: $BLOGBURST_API_KEY"`
7. If successful, say: "All set! Try: /blogburst generate a post about [topic]"

### Step 2: Make API Calls
When `$BLOGBURST_API_KEY` is set, you MUST use the `exec` tool to run `curl` commands against the BlogBurst API. Do NOT use web_search or any other tool as a substitute. The API returns real user-specific data (their posts, their analytics, their auto-pilot status). Web search cannot provide this.

**How to execute:** Use `exec` with `curl -s "https://api.blogburst.ai/api/v1/<endpoint>" -H "X-API-Key: $BLOGBURST_API_KEY"` for GET requests, and add `-X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '<json>'` for POST requests.

## API 1: Agent Chat (Recommended — does everything)

Chat with your self-improving AI marketing agent. It generates content, checks analytics, manages auto-pilot, scans trends, analyzes competitors, manages e-commerce products, and continuously learns from your feedback and performance data. The agent has tools and executes actions automatically — the more you use it, the smarter it gets.

**Endpoint**: `POST /assistant/agent-chat-v2`

**Request**:
```json
{
  "messages": [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Generate a Twitter post about my product"}
  ],
  "language": "en"
}
```

Multi-turn conversation — send the full message history each time:
```json
{
  "messages": [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Generate a Twitter post about my product"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here's your Twitter post..."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Now make one for LinkedIn too"}
  ],
  "language": "en"
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "reply": "I've generated a Twitter post for you. Ready to copy and post!",
  "data_referenced": ["marketing_strategy", "analytics_7d"],
  "agent_name": "Nova",
  "actions_taken": [
    {
      "tool": "generate_content",
      "result": {
        "success": true,
        "data": {
          "platform": "twitter",
          "content": "Week 3 building BlogBurst. 15 followers, 40 posts published. Best post got 5 likes on Bluesky. Small numbers, real progress.\n\nThe AI agent now picks topics based on what actually performed well last week. No more guessing.",
          "image_urls": ["https://..."],
          "copy_only": true
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**What users can say** (the agent understands natural language):
- "Generate a post for Twitter/Bluesky/LinkedIn/all platforms"
- "What's trending in my space?"
- "How are my posts doing this week?"
- "Turn on auto-pilot" / "Pause auto-pilot"
- "What did you post today?"

**Get feedback summary**: `GET /feedback/content/summary`

**How it works**: The AI uses your feedback history to reorder content types (liked styles first, disliked last) and adjusts tone/format in future auto-pilot runs. Combined with performance analytics, this creates a continuous improvement loop — every post teaches the AI what works for your audience.

**When to use**: After viewing agent-generated content, when user wants to rate it or train the AI.
