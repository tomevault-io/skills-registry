# Bloom Taste Finder

**Discover your builder taste—straight from your conversations.**

## ⚠️ Permissions & Capabilities

This skill requires the following permissions:

**📖 Read Conversations** - Analyzes your last ~120 messages to understand your interests and supporter type. Raw conversation text stays local; only analysis results are used.

**🌐 External Network** - Connects to Bloom Protocol API to:
- Generate your shareable dashboard URL
- Store your identity card (personality type, taste spectrums, categories)
- Enable future features (skill recommendations, creator tipping)

**Your Control**: Your conversation is analyzed locally. You decide whether to share your identity card publicly via the dashboard link.

Are you a Visionary who jumps on new tools early? An Explorer trying everything? A Cultivator building communities? An Optimizer fine-tuning workflows? Or an Innovator pushing boundaries?

Find out in seconds with Bloom Taste Finder.

## 🎯 What You Get

Your personalized Bloom Identity Card reveals:

- **🎴 Your Supporter Type** – Visionary, Explorer, Cultivator, Optimizer, or Innovator
- **💬 Custom Tagline** – A one-liner that captures your vibe ("First to try new AI tools")
- **📊 4 Taste Spectrums** – Learning, Decision, Novelty, Risk — see where you fall on each spectrum
- **🏷️ Top Categories** – AI Tools, Productivity, Consumer Apps—where you spend your energy
- **🎯 Tool Recommendations** – The top 5 tools matched to your profile
- **🌱 Self-Growing Agent** – Your recommendations evolve as you interact (see below)
- **🔗 Shareable Card** – Show off your supporter identity

## ⚡️ How It Works

Simple: just type `/bloom` in your chat.

We analyze your USER.md and last ~120 messages to understand:
- **What excites you** (AI agents? productivity hacks? creative tools?)
- **How you engage** (deep dives vs. quick experiments)
- **Your taste profile** (4 spectrums: try-first or study-first? gut or analytical? early adopter or proven-first? all-in or measured?)

**No complex setup. No wallet signatures. No auth flows.**
Just pure conversation intelligence.

## ✅ New User Quick Start (ClawHub)

1) **Chat a little first** (at least 3 messages) so Bloom has context.
2) Type **`/bloom`**.
3) You'll get your **Identity Card + tool recommendations + dashboard link**.
4) If you're brand new, Bloom will ask **4 quick questions** and generate your card immediately.

## 🚀 Usage

```
/bloom
```

That's it. Or use natural language:
```
"discover my supporter type"
"what's my bloom identity"
"create my supporter card"
```

Works with as few as 3 messages—but richer history = deeper insights.

## 🌱 Self-Growing Recommendations

Your agent doesn't just recommend once — it **learns and improves** over time.

### How It Works

1. **USER.md Integration** — If you have a `~/.config/claude/USER.md`, Bloom reads your declared role, tech stack, and interests as the primary identity signal. No USER.md? No problem — the system gracefully falls back to conversation-only analysis.

2. **Feedback Loop** — As you interact with recommendations (click, save, or dismiss), Bloom adjusts future suggestions. Categories you engage with get boosted; dismissed skills get filtered out.

3. **Discovery Sync** — New skills you discover through Bloom are synced back to a local `bloom-discoveries.md` file, building a growing context of your preferences.

4. **TTL Refresh** — Recommendations refresh every 7 days, incorporating your latest interactions and newly published skills from ClawHub, Claude Code, and GitHub.

### Why We Don't Auto-Install

Bloom **recommends skills but never installs them automatically**. You always decide what to install. This is a deliberate safety choice:

- **Your control** — Recommendations help you discover; installation is your decision
- **Supply chain safety** — Auto-installing unvetted code is a security risk
- **Trust-first** — We'd rather earn your trust through great recommendations than take shortcuts

> Your agent grows by discovering more skills — not by installing them behind your back.

## 🌟 Why Bloom Taste Finder?

**For Indie Devs & AI Builders:**
Building something new? Bloom Taste Finder helps you **find your first 100 supporters** by matching you with tools and people who fit your vibe.

**For Vibe Coders:**
Stop guessing what tools to try next. Get personalized recommendations based on how you actually work, not generic listicles. **Discover skills you'll actually use** instead of scrolling endless lists.

**For Consumer AI Enthusiasts:**
**Find AI tools that match your vibe**. Search by supporter type (Visionary, Explorer, etc.) to connect with others who work like you. Rally early adopters for bold launches. Engage optimizers for feedback loops.

## 📋 Requirements

- **Minimum 3 messages** in your conversation (more is better)
- **Node.js 18+** (usually pre-installed)
- **Bloom Identity Skill** installed

```

## 🔧 Installation

### Quick Install (via ClawHub)
```bash
clawhub install bloom-taste-finder
```

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
cd ~/.openclaw/workspace
git clone https://github.com/unicornbloom/bloom-identity-skill.git
cd bloom-identity-skill

## 🛠 Advanced Usage

### Run from session file (full conversation context)

echo "Your conversation here" | \

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**"Insufficient conversation data"**
→ Need at least 3 messages. Keep chatting about tools you're interested in!

**"Command not found"**
→ Verify `bloom-identity-skill` is in `~/.openclaw/workspace/` and run `npm install`

**No tool recommendations**
→ Tool recommendations depend on API availability. Your identity card still works!
