## Agent Implementation Notes

**Script location:** `{skill_folder}/books` (wrapper to `scripts/books`)

**When user asks about books:**
1. Run `./books search "title or author"` to find work ID
2. Run `./books info <work_id>` for full details
3. Run `./books author <author_id>` for author info and bibliography

**Search tips:**
- Use `author:name` to search specifically by author
- Use `title:name` to search specifically by title
- Use `subject:topic` to search by genre/subject

**Don't use for:** E-books, audiobooks, purchasing, or reading the actual content.
