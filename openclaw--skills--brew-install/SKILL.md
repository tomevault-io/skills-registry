# Brew Install

Install missing binaries via dnf, the Fedora/Bazzite package manager. Despite the name, this skill wraps `dnf` on Bazzite rather than Homebrew.

## Commands

```bash
# Install a package
brew-install <package>

# Search for a package
brew-install search <query>
```

## Install

No installation needed. `dnf` is the default package manager on Fedora/Bazzite and is always present.
