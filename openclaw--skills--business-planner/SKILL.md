### 2. Infrastructure Diagram Generation

Visualize infrastructure architecture for tech startups.

**Generated Items:**
- **Architecture Diagram** (text-based ASCII art, Mermaid)
- **Hardware Spec Comparison** (Mac Mini, Raspberry Pi, Linux server, Cloud)
- **Cost Breakdown** (COGS, overhead, BEP)
- **Network Topology** (VPN, firewall, port config)
- **Security Checklist** (FileVault, SSH, API key isolation)

**Example Cases:**
- Mupeng Box (Mac Mini M4 Pro-based AI agent hardware)
- On-premise vs Cloud vs Hybrid comparison
- Product Lineup (Lite/Pro/Enterprise)

**Output Format:**
- Markdown (GitHub/Notion compatible)
- Mermaid diagrams (graph, flowchart, sequence)
- ASCII tables

---

### 3. Pitch Deck Generation (Investor IR)

Generate pitch decks for investors/accelerators in 10-15 slide structure.

**Slide Structure:**
```
1. Cover (Company name, one-liner)
2. Problem (Hook + field voices)
3. Solution (Product/service core)
4. Market Size (TAM/SAM/SOM, CAGR)
5. Product (Screenshots/demo/diagrams)
6. Business Model (Pricing, unit economics)
7. Traction (PMF signals, revenue, users)
8. Competitive Advantage (Moat, differentiation)
9. Team (Founders, key personnel)
10. Financials (3-year projections, break-even)
11. Roadmap (Milestones)
12. Ask (Funding needed, use, equity)
```

**Storytelling Principles:**
- **Hook → Resolve doubt → Product/visuals → Market/numbers**
- Don't use same visual twice
- Emphasize "expansion" (network effects) — not just tech refinement
- Number-focused (before/after, %, revenue, users)

**Output Format:**
- Markdown (section-separated by slide)
- Includes Google Slides/PowerPoint conversion guide

---

### 4. Iterative Revision Support

Version control, feedback incorporation, diff comparison with previous versions.

**Version Control:**
- `projects/gov-support/doyak-v1.html` → `v2.html` → ... → `v12.html`
- `git diff`-style change tracking
- Major changes summary (`CHANGELOG.md`)

**Feedback Incorporation:**
- Reviewer comments → revision direction suggestions
- Investor questions → add supplementary sections
- A/B testing (compare two versions)

---

## 🧠 Learned Lessons (v1~v12 Experience)

Insights from iterating Doyak Package business plan from v1 to v12:

### Storytelling

1. **Follow Hook → Resolve doubt → Product/visuals → Market/numbers order**
   - ❌ Bad: "Our tech uses AI..." (tech first)
   - ✅ Good: "Why do 72% abandon AI within 3 months?" (hook) → Present 3 barriers → Our solution

2. **Never use same visual twice**
   - Reviewers penalize "already seen this visual"
   - Prepare new visuals for each section

3. **"Expansion" is key — don't just talk about tech refinement**
   - ❌ "We'll train AI models more accurately"
   - ✅ "Customer A's skills → Customer B purchases → Network effects increase value"

### Framework

4. **Mupengism = Apple Analogy**
   - OpenClaw = Internet (base infrastructure, open-source)
   - LLM (Claude/GPT) = Semiconductors (compute engine)
   - Mupengism = Apple (OS + App Store + proprietary ecosystem)
   - **Message**: Share the foundation, build proprietary ecosystem on top

5. **Hardware is our infrastructure, not for sale**
   - ❌ "Sell racks to customers"
   - ✅ "Our racks = Skill Store central server, secure margins with own infrastructure instead of AWS"

### Numbers

6. **Before/After numbers mandatory**
   - Quote writing: 2 hours → 15 minutes
   - VC cold emails to 300 places: 1 week → 2 hours
   - SNS management: 3 hours/day → fully automated
   - Context explanation time: 90% reduction after 3 months

7. **Cite authoritative sources**
   - McKinsey 2025 AI Survey: "72% enterprise AI adoption, 72% abandonment within 3 months"
   - Gartner: "By 2028, agentic AI will support 15% of decisions"
   - MarketsandMarkets: "AI agent market $7.84B in 2025 → $52.6B in 2030 (CAGR 46%)"
