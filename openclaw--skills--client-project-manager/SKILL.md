# Client Project Manager

A complete freelance business management system. Track clients, projects, deadlines, deliverables, invoices, and communications from a single skill.

## How to Use

```
/client-project-manager add client "Acme Corp" --contact "jane@acme.com" --rate "$100/hr"
/client-project-manager add project "Website Redesign" --client "Acme Corp" --deadline "2026-03-15" --budget "$5000"
/client-project-manager status
/client-project-manager update "Website Redesign" --progress 60 --note "Homepage mockup approved"
/client-project-manager invoice "Acme Corp" --project "Website Redesign"
/client-project-manager weekly-update "Acme Corp"
/client-project-manager dashboard
```

## Data Storage

All data is stored in `./freelance-data/` as JSON files:

```
freelance-data/
  clients.json        # Client CRM data
  projects.json       # Active and completed projects
  time-log.json       # Time tracking entries
  invoices/           # Generated invoices
  updates/            # Client update emails
```

If the directory doesn't exist, create it on first use. If files exist, read them first and preserve all existing data.

## Data Integrity Rules

1. **Never overwrite** — always read existing data first, modify, then write back
2. **Always backup** — before any write operation, check data exists and is valid JSON
3. **UUID generation** — use timestamp-based IDs: `client-[timestamp]`, `project-[timestamp]`
4. **Date format** — always use ISO 8601: `YYYY-MM-DD`
5. **Currency** — store as numbers, display with `$` formatting
