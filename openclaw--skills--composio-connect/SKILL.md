# Check if composio MCP server is registered in mcporter

```bash
mcporter list
```

If composio does not appear you should add it with this command:

```bash
mcporter config add composio --url $COMPOSIO_MCP_URL
```

## Discovering Tools

Before attempting to call any composio MCP tool, you must perform a targeted search to identify the correct tool name and required parameters.

```bash
mcporter list composio --all-parameters | grep -niE -B 14 '^\s*function\s+SPOTIFY_.*(VOLUME|PLAYBACK)|^\s*function\s+.*(VOLUME|PLAYBACK).*SPOTIFY_'
```

## Executing Tools

Once you know the tool name from search, call it:

```bash
mcporter call 'composio.SPOTIFY_SET_PLAYBACK_VOLUME(volume_percent:"90")'
```

```bash
mcporter call 'composio.TODOIST_CREATE_TASK(content: "Pay electricity bill", due_string: "tomorrow at 4pm")'
```

```bash
mcporter call 'composio.GMAIL_CREATE_DRAFT(to: "name@example.com", subject: "Quick question", body: "Hey — ...")'
```
