# Context Checkpoint Skill

**Purpose:** Save conversation state before context compression kills it.

## The Problem

Context compression is unpredictable. One moment you're mid-conversation, the next you wake up with amnesia. Important decisions, open threads, and working context — gone.

## The Solution

Proactive checkpointing. Save state regularly so when compression hits, you have something to reload.

## Usage

### Manual Checkpoint
When you're in a conversation and want to preserve state:
```bash
# Save current state
./skills/context-checkpoint/checkpoint.sh "Brief description of what we're doing"
```

### Heartbeat Integration
Add to HEARTBEAT.md:
```markdown
### Context Checkpoint
- If conversation has important open threads, run checkpoint
- Check memory/checkpoints/ for stale checkpoints (>24h old, can clean up)
```

### On Session Start
Read the latest checkpoint:
```bash
cat memory/checkpoints/latest.md
```

## What Gets Saved

The checkpoint creates a markdown file with:
- Timestamp
- Description (what you were doing)
- Open threads / active tasks
- Key decisions made
- Important context to remember

## File Structure

```
memory/checkpoints/
├── latest.md           # Symlink to most recent
├── 2025-01-30_1530.md  # Timestamped checkpoints
├── 2025-01-30_1745.md
└── ...
```

## Security Considerations

- **Risk:** Low. Only writes to local workspace.
- **No credentials:** Doesn't touch external services.
- **No exec:** Just file operations.
- **Blast radius:** Worst case, fills up disk with checkpoints. Mitigated by cleanup routine.

## Recommended

Yes. Every agent should have a way to preserve context across compression events. This isn't fancy — it's just disciplined note-taking automated.
