# Daily News Skill

This skill allows the agent to fetch the daily top news headlines from multiple sources (Baidu, Google Trends, etc.) by running a Python script.

## Instructions

To get the daily news summary:
1. Execute the Python script located at `{baseDir}/daily_news.py`.
   Use the following command:
   ```bash
   python "{baseDir}/daily_news.py"
   ```
2. The script will output the news in the format requested by the user.
3. Return the script's output directly as the final answer.

## Setup

Ensure you have the required Python packages installed:
```bash
pip install -r "{baseDir}/requirements.txt"
```
