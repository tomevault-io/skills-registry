# Exchange Rate

Real-time currency exchange rate and conversion using QVeris tools.

## What This Skill Does

Exchange Rate provides:

1. **Rate lookup** – Current exchange rate between two currencies (e.g. USD/EUR, CNY/JPY).
2. **Amount conversion** – Convert an amount from one currency to another at current rates.

Supported via QVeris: forex and common fiat pairs; optional historical date for rate/conversion when the tool supports it.

## Key Advantages

- Uses only QVeris API: search for tools by capability, then execute; no hardcoded provider list.
- Fallback across providers (e.g. Alpha Vantage, Twelve Data) when one fails or is unavailable.
- Same credential as other skills: `QVERIS_API_KEY` only.
- Read-only, no side effects; suitable for travel, trade, and reporting.

## Core Workflow

1. Parse user intent: **rate** (from_currency, to_currency) or **convert** (from_currency, to_currency, amount).
2. Search QVeris for tools: e.g. "currency exchange rate real-time", "currency conversion".
3. Rank results by success_rate, latency, and parameter fit (rate vs conversion).
4. Build request parameters: for rate use `from_currency`/`to_currency` or `symbol` (e.g. `EUR/USD`); for conversion add `amount`.
5. Execute chosen tool with 5s timeout; on failure try next candidate.
6. Return formatted rate and/or converted amount (markdown or JSON).

## Command Surface

Primary script: `scripts/exchange_rate.mjs`

- Get rate only:
  - `node scripts/exchange_rate.mjs rate --from USD --to EUR`
  - `node scripts/exchange_rate.mjs rate --from CNY --to USD`
- Convert amount:
  - `node scripts/exchange_rate.mjs convert --from USD --to JPY --amount 1000`
  - `node scripts/exchange_rate.mjs convert --from EUR --to GBP --amount 500`

Optional: `--date YYYY-MM-DD` for historical rate/conversion when the tool supports it; `--format json` for machine-readable output.

## Safety and Disclosure

- Uses only `QVERIS_API_KEY`; no other secrets.
- Calls only QVeris over HTTPS; no package install or arbitrary commands.
- Output is for reference only; not financial or contractual advice.
