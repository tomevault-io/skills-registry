# GitHub Extract

Extract content from a GitHub url.

Use this skill when the user types `/gh-extract` or asks to extract/download/summarize a GitHub url.

## What it does
- Accepts an GitHub url, could be repo/tree/blob.
- Convert the url to github raw url.
- Extract file content from the raw url or save to a temp path.

## Requirements

- `uv`
- `wget`

## Usage

```bash
# print file content to stdout
uv run --script ${baseDir}/gh_extract.py <url>

# save file to a temp path, with a proper filename
uv run --script ${baseDir}/gh_extract.py <url> --save
```

## Notes
- only works for public repo.
- url can be repo/tree/blob
- for repo/tree, will try to get `README.md` or `SKILL.md` or `README.txt`
