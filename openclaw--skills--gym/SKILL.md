## Data Storage

Store workout logs and measurements in ~/gym/:
- workouts — Session logs (date, exercises, sets, reps, weight)
- prs — Personal records by exercise  
- measurements — Body measurements, weight trends

## Core Rules

- Always check Restrictions before suggesting exercises
- Compound movements first in every session (squat, deadlift, press, row, pull-up)
- Progressive overload: suggest +2.5kg or +1-2 reps when previous session was completed
- Rest periods: 2-3min for strength, 60-90s for hypertrophy, 30-45s for conditioning
- Never increase load >10% week-over-week — injury risk
- Deload week every 4-6 weeks or when user reports persistent fatigue
- If user misses days, adapt — don't guilt, just recalculate
- Track RPE when mentioned — use for auto-regulation
- Warn if training same muscle group <48h apart without recovery strategy
