## 🎯 What Does This Skill Do?

**Home Music** combines Spotify + Airfoil into magical music scenes. One command – and the right playlist plays on the right speakers at the perfect volume.

**Imagine:**
- You wake up → `home-music morning` → Gentle tunes in the bathroom
- Friends arrive → `home-music party` → All speakers blasting rock
- Time to relax → `home-music chill` → Lounge vibes everywhere
- Done for the day → `home-music off` → Silence. Peace. Serenity.

```

---

## 🎨 Custom Playlists & Scenes

### Changing Playlists

Open `home-music.sh` and find the playlist configuration:

```bash
# === PLAYLIST CONFIGURATION ===
PLAYLIST_MORNING="spotify:playlist:19n65kQ5NEKgkvSAla5IF6"
PLAYLIST_PARTY="spotify:playlist:37i9dQZF1DXaXB8fQg7xif"
PLAYLIST_CHILL="spotify:playlist:37i9dQZF1DWTwnEm1IYyoj"
```

**How to find Playlist URIs:**
1. Right-click on a playlist in Spotify
2. "Share" → "Copy Spotify URI"
3. Or copy the URL and extract the `/playlist/` part

### Adding a New Scene

Add a new case in the `main` block:

```bash
# In home-music.sh after the "scene_chill" function:

scene_workout() {
    echo "💪 Starting Workout scene..."
    airfoil_set_source_spotify
    airfoil_connect "Sonos Move"
    sleep 0.5
    airfoil_volume "Sonos Move" 0.8
    "$SPOTIFY_CMD" play "spotify:playlist:YOUR_WORKOUT_PLAYLIST"
    "$SPOTIFY_CMD" volume 100
    echo "✅ Workout: Sonos Move @ 80%, Pump it up!"
}

# And in the case block:
    workout)
        scene_workout
        ;;
```

### Available Speakers

```bash
ALL_SPEAKERS=("Computer" "Andy's M5 Macbook" "Sonos Move" "Living Room TV")
```

You can add any AirPlay speaker – they just need to be visible in Airfoil.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### ❌ "Speaker won't connect"

**Check 1:** Is Airfoil running?
```bash
pgrep -x Airfoil || echo "Airfoil is not running!"
```

**Check 2:** Is the speaker on the network?
- Open the Airfoil app
- Check if the speaker appears in the list
- Try connecting manually

**Check 3:** Is the name exactly correct?
- Speaker names are case-sensitive!
- Open Airfoil and copy the exact name

---

### ❌ "No sound"

**Check 1:** Is Spotify playing?
```bash
~/clawd/skills/spotify-applescript/spotify.sh status
```

**Check 2:** Is the Airfoil source correct?
- Open Airfoil
- Check if "Spotify" is selected as the audio source
- If not: Click "Source" → Select Spotify

**Check 3:** Speaker volume?
```bash
# Manually check volume
osascript -e 'tell application "Airfoil" to get volume of (first speaker whose name is "Sonos Move")'
```

---

### ❌ "Spotify won't start"

**Is Spotify open?**
```bash
pgrep -x Spotify || open -a Spotify
```

**Is spotify-applescript installed?**
```bash
ls ~/clawd/skills/spotify-applescript/spotify.sh
```

---

### ❌ "Permission denied"

```bash
chmod +x ~/clawd/skills/home-music/home-music.sh
```

---

## 🔊 Direct Airfoil Commands

If you want to control Airfoil manually:

```bash
# Connect a speaker
osascript -e 'tell application "Airfoil" to connect to (first speaker whose name is "Sonos Move")'

# Set speaker volume (0.0 - 1.0)
osascript -e 'tell application "Airfoil" to set (volume of (first speaker whose name is "Sonos Move")) to 0.5'

# Disconnect a speaker
osascript -e 'tell application "Airfoil" to disconnect from (first speaker whose name is "Sonos Move")'

# List connected speakers
osascript -e 'tell application "Airfoil" to get name of every speaker whose connected is true'

# Set audio source
osascript -e 'tell application "Airfoil"
    set theSource to (first application source whose name contains "Spotify")
    set current audio source to theSource
end tell'
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Set aliases** for even faster access:
   ```bash
   alias mm="home-music morning"
   alias mp="home-music party"
   alias mc="home-music chill"
   alias mo="home-music off"
   ```

2. **Use with Clawdbot:**
   > "Hey, start party mode"
   > "Put on some chill music"
   > "Stop the music"

3. **Combine scenes:** Create a `dinner` scene with a jazz playlist at 25% – perfect for guests!
