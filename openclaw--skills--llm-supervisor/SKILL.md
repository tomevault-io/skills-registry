# LLM Supervisor 🔮

Handles rate limits and model fallbacks gracefully.

## Behavior

### On Rate Limit / Overload Errors

When I encounter rate limits or overload errors from cloud providers (Anthropic, OpenAI):

1. **Tell the user immediately** — Don't silently fail or retry endlessly
2. **Offer local fallback** — Ask if they want to switch to Ollama
3. **Wait for confirmation** — Never auto-switch for code generation tasks

### Confirmation Required

Before using local models for code generation, ask:
> "Cloud is rate-limited. Switch to local Ollama (`qwen2.5:7b`)? Reply 'yes' to confirm."

For simple queries (chat, summaries), can switch without confirmation if user previously approved.

## Commands

### `/llm status`
Report current state:
- Which provider is active (cloud/local)
- Ollama availability and models
- Recent rate limit events

### `/llm switch local`
Manually switch to Ollama for the session.

### `/llm switch cloud`
Switch back to cloud provider.

## Using Ollama

```bash
# Check available models
ollama list

# Run a query
ollama run qwen2.5:7b "your prompt here"

# For longer prompts, use stdin
echo "your prompt" | ollama run qwen2.5:7b
```

## Installed Models

Check with `ollama list`. Configured default: `qwen2.5:7b`

## State Tracking

Track in memory during session:
- `currentProvider`: "cloud" | "local"  
- `lastRateLimitAt`: timestamp or null
- `localConfirmedForCode`: boolean

Reset to cloud at session start.
