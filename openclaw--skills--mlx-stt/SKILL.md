# MLX STT

Speech-To-Text/ASR/Transcribe with MLX (Apple Silicon) and opensource models (default GLM-ASR-Nano-2512) locally.

Free and Accurate. No api key required. No server required.

## Requirements

- `mlx`: macOS with Apple Silicon
- `brew`: used to install deps if not available

## Installation

```bash
bash ${baseDir}/install.sh
```
This script will use `brew` to install these cli tools if not available:
- `ffmpeg`: convert audio format when needed
- `uv`: install python package and run python script
- `mlx_audio`: do the real job

## Usage

To transcribe an audio file, run this script:

```bash
bash  ${baseDir}/mlx-stt.sh <audio_file_path>
```

- First run could be a little slow, since it will need to download model.
- The transcript result will be printed to stdout.
