# Model Audit 📊

**Audit your LLM stack against current pricing and alternatives.**

Fetches live pricing from OpenRouter, analyzes your configured models, and recommends potential savings or upgrades by category.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Full audit with recommendations
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/model_audit.py

# JSON output
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/model_audit.py --json

# Audit specific models
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/model_audit.py --models "anthropic/claude-opus-4-6,openai/gpt-4o"

# Show top models by category
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/model_audit.py --top

# Compare two models
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/model_audit.py --compare "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4" "openai/gpt-4o"
```

## What It Does
