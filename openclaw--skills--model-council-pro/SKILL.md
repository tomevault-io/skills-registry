# Model Council 🏛️

**Get consensus from multiple AI models on any question.**

Send your query to 3+ different LLMs simultaneously via OpenRouter. A judge model evaluates all responses and produces a winner, reasoning, and synthesized best answer.

## When to Use

- **Important decisions** — Don't trust one model's opinion
- **Code review** — Get multiple perspectives on architecture choices
- **Research verification** — Cross-check facts across models
- **Creative work** — Compare writing styles and pick the best
- **Debugging** — When one model is stuck, others might see the issue

## How It Works
