description: Build Next.js 15 apps with App Router, server components, caching, auth, and production patterns. Use when this capability is needed.

## Setup

On first use, read `setup.md` for project integration.

## When to Use

User needs Next.js expertise — routing, data fetching, caching, authentication, or deployment. Agent handles App Router patterns, server/client boundaries, and production optimization.

## Architecture

Project patterns stored in `~/nextjs/`. See `memory-template.md` for setup.

```
~/nextjs/
├── memory.md          # Project conventions, patterns
└── projects/          # Per-project learnings
```

## Quick Reference

| Topic | File |
|-------|------|
| Setup | `setup.md` |
| Memory template | `memory-template.md` |
| Routing (parallel, intercepting) | `routing.md` |
| Data fetching & streaming | `data-fetching.md` |
| Caching & revalidation | `caching.md` |
| Authentication | `auth.md` |
| Deployment | `deployment.md` |

## Core Rules

### 1. Server Components by Default
Everything is Server Component in App Router. Add `'use client'` only for useState, useEffect, event handlers, or browser APIs. Server Components can't be imported into Client — pass as children.

### 2. Fetch Data on Server
Fetch in Server Components, not useEffect. Use `Promise.all` for parallel requests. See `data-fetching.md` for patterns.

### 3. Cache Intentionally
`fetch` is cached by default — use `cache: 'no-store'` for dynamic data. Set `revalidate` for ISR. See `caching.md` for strategies.

### 4. Server Actions for Mutations
Use `'use server'` functions for form submissions and data mutations. Progressive enhancement — works without JS. See `data-fetching.md`.

### 5. Environment Security
`NEXT_PUBLIC_` exposes to client bundle. Server Components access all env vars. Use `.env.local` for secrets.

### 6. Streaming for Large Data
Use `<Suspense>` boundaries to stream content progressively. Wrap slow components individually. See `data-fetching.md`.

### 7. Auth at Middleware Level
Protect routes in middleware, not in pages. Middleware runs on Edge — lightweight auth checks only. See `auth.md`.

## Server vs Client

| Server Component | Client Component |
|------------------|------------------|
| Default in App Router | Requires `'use client'` |
| Can be async | Cannot be async |
| Access backend, env vars | Access hooks, browser APIs |
| Zero JS shipped | JS shipped to browser |

**Decision:** Start Server. Add `'use client'` only for: useState, useEffect, onClick, browser APIs.

## Common Traps

| Trap | Fix |
|------|-----|
| `router.push` in Server | Use `redirect()` |
| `<Link>` prefetches all | `prefetch={false}` |
| `next/image` no size | Add `width`/`height` or `fill` |
| Metadata in Client | Move to Server or `generateMetadata` |
| useEffect for data | Fetch in Server Component |
| Import Server→Client | Pass as children/props |
| Middleware DB call | Call API route instead |
| Missing `await params` (v15) | Params are async in Next.js 15 |

## Next.js 15 Changes

- `params` and `searchParams` are now `Promise` — must await
- `fetch` not cached by default — opt-in with `cache: 'force-cache'`
- Use React 19 hooks: `useActionState`, `useFormStatus`
