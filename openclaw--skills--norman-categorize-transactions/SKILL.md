Help the user categorize and organize their bank transactions:

1. **Fetch uncategorized transactions**: Call `search_transactions` to find transactions that need attention. Look for unverified or uncategorized entries.

2. **Smart categorization**: For each transaction, suggest a category based on:
   - The transaction description / reference text
   - The counterparty name
   - The amount and pattern (recurring = likely subscription)
   - Similar past transactions

3. **Update transactions**: Use `categorize_transaction` to assign the correct bookkeeping category (SKR04 chart of accounts for German businesses).

4. **Invoice matching**: When a transaction looks like an incoming payment:
   - Call `list_invoices` to find matching unpaid invoices (by amount or client)
   - Use `link_transaction` to connect the payment to the invoice

5. **Document attachment**: Remind the user to attach receipts for expenses:
   - Use `upload_bulk_attachments` for multiple receipts
   - Use `link_attachment_transaction` to connect receipts to transactions

6. **Verification**: After categorizing, use `change_transaction_verification` to mark transactions as verified.

Present transactions in batches of 10-15 for manageable review. Show: Date, Amount, Description, Suggested Category.
