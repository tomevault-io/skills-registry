# On-Page SEO Auditor

**Get a scored, prioritized SEO fix list for any page in minutes** — covering title tags, meta descriptions, heading structure, keyword placement, internal links, images, and content quality signals that directly influence organic rankings and SERP click-through rates.

**How to start**: `Audit the on-page SEO of [URL]` or `Check SEO issues on this page targeting [keyword]: [URL]`

**System role**: Optimization layer skill. It turns weak pages, structures, and technical issues into prioritized repair work.

## When This Must Trigger

Use this when the conversation involves any of these situations — even if the user does not use SEO terminology:

Use this whenever the task needs a diagnosis or repair plan that should feed directly into remediation work, not just a one-time opinion.

- Auditing pages before or after publishing
- Identifying why a page isn't ranking well
- Optimizing existing content for better performance
- Creating pre-publish SEO checklists
- Comparing your on-page SEO to competitors
- Systematic site-wide SEO improvements
- Training team members on SEO best practices

## SEO Audit Coverage

This skill covers the full spectrum of on-page search engine optimization signals — from keyword placement in title tags, H1 headings, and image alt text, to content quality indicators like topical depth, E-E-A-T signals, and word count benchmarks.

It also evaluates page-level architecture: internal link count and anchor relevance, canonical tags, URL structure, mobile-friendliness, and meta description CTR potential. Every finding maps to a scored, prioritized fix list so you can focus on the changes most likely to recover lost rankings or unlock new organic traffic.

## What This Skill Does

1. **Title Tag Analysis**: Evaluates title optimization and CTR potential
2. **Meta Description Review**: Checks description quality and length
3. **Header Structure Audit**: Analyzes H1-H6 hierarchy
4. **Content Quality Assessment**: Reviews content depth and optimization
5. **Keyword Usage Analysis**: Checks keyword placement and density
6. **Internal Link Review**: Evaluates internal linking structure
7. **Image Optimization Check**: Audits alt text and file optimization
8. **Technical On-Page Review**: Checks URL, canonical, and mobile factors

## Quick Start

Start with one of these prompts. Finish with a short handoff summary using the repository format in [Skill Contract](https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/seo-geo-claude-skills/blob/main/references/skill-contract.md).

### Audit a Single Page

```
Audit the on-page SEO of [URL]
```

```
Check SEO issues on this page targeting [keyword]: [URL/content]
```

### Compare Against Competitors

```
Compare on-page SEO of [your URL] vs [competitor URL] for [keyword]
```

### Audit Content Before Publishing

```
Pre-publish SEO audit for this content targeting [keyword]: [content]
```

## Skill Contract

**Expected output**: a scored diagnosis, prioritized repair plan, and a short handoff summary ready for `memory/audits/`.

- **Reads**: the current page or site state, symptoms, prior audits, and current priorities from [CLAUDE.md](https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/seo-geo-claude-skills/blob/main/CLAUDE.md) and the shared [State Model](https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/seo-geo-claude-skills/blob/main/references/state-model.md) when available.
- **Writes**: a user-facing audit or optimization plan plus a reusable summary that can be stored under `memory/audits/`.
- **Promotes**: blocking defects, repeated weaknesses, and fix priorities to `memory/open-loops.md` and `memory/decisions.md`.
- **Next handoff**: use the `Next Best Skill` below when the repair path is clear.

## Data Sources

> See [CONNECTORS.md](https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/seo-geo-claude-skills/blob/main/CONNECTORS.md) for tool category placeholders.

**With ~~SEO tool + ~~web crawler connected:**
Claude can automatically pull page HTML via ~~web crawler, fetch keyword search volume and difficulty from ~~SEO tool, retrieve click-through rate data from ~~search console, and download competitor pages for comparison. This enables fully automated audits with live data.

**With manual data only:**
Ask the user to provide:
1. Page URL or complete HTML content
2. Target primary and secondary keywords
3. Competitor page URLs for comparison (optional)

Proceed with the full audit using provided data. Note in the output which findings are from automated crawl vs. manual review.

## Validation Checkpoints

### Input Validation
- [ ] Target keyword(s) clearly specified by user
- [ ] Page content accessible (either via URL or provided HTML)
- [ ] If competitor comparison requested, competitor URL provided

### Output Validation
- [ ] Every recommendation cites specific data points (not generic advice)
- [ ] Scores based on measurable criteria, not subjective opinion
- [ ] All suggested changes include specific locations (title tag, H2 #3, paragraph 5, etc.)
- [ ] Source of each data point clearly stated (~~SEO tool data, user-provided, ~~web crawler, or manual review)

## Example

> **Reference**: See [references/audit-example.md](https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/seo-geo-claude-skills/blob/main/optimize/on-page-seo-auditor/references/audit-example.md) for a full worked example (noise-cancelling headphones audit) and page-type checklists (blog post, product page, landing page).

## Tips for Success

1. **Prioritize issues by impact** - Fix critical issues first
2. **Compare to competitors** - See what's working for top rankings
3. **Balance optimization and readability** - Don't over-optimize
4. **Audit regularly** - Content degrades over time
5. **Test changes** - Track ranking changes after updates

> **Scoring details**: For the complete weight distribution, scoring scale, issue resolution playbook, and industry benchmarks, see [references/scoring-rubric.md](https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/seo-geo-claude-skills/blob/main/optimize/on-page-seo-auditor/references/scoring-rubric.md).


### Save Results

After delivering audit or optimization findings to the user, ask:

> "Save these results for future sessions?"

If yes, write a dated summary to `memory/audits/on-page-seo-auditor/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md` containing:
- One-line verdict or headline finding
- Top 3-5 actionable items
- Open loops or blockers
- Source data references

If any veto-level issue was found (CORE-EEAT T04, C01, R10 or CITE T03, T05, T09), also append a one-liner to `memory/hot-cache.md` without asking.
