# OpenClaw Arbiter

Audits installed skills to report exactly what system resources each one accesses — network, subprocess, file I/O, environment variables, and unsafe operations.

## The Problem

You install skills and trust them blindly. A skill that claims to format markdown could also open network connections, execute shell commands, or read your environment variables. Nothing reports what permissions each skill actually uses.


## Commands

### Full Audit

Deep audit of all installed skills with line-level findings.

```bash
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/arbiter.py audit --workspace /path/to/workspace
```

### Audit Single Skill

```bash
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/arbiter.py audit openclaw-warden --workspace /path/to/workspace
```

### Permission Matrix

Compact table showing permission categories per skill.

```bash
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/arbiter.py report --workspace /path/to/workspace
```

### Quick Status

One-line summary of permission risk.

```bash
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/arbiter.py status --workspace /path/to/workspace
```

## What It Detects

| Category | Risk | Examples |
|----------|------|----------|
| **Serialization** | CRITICAL | pickle, eval(), exec(), __import__ |
| **Subprocess** | HIGH | subprocess, os.system, Popen, command substitution |
| **Network** | HIGH | urllib, requests, curl, wget, hardcoded URLs |
| **File Write** | MEDIUM | open('w'), shutil.copy, os.remove, rm |
| **Environment** | MEDIUM | os.environ, os.getenv, os.putenv |
| **Crypto** | LOW | hashlib, hmac, ssl |
| **File Read** | LOW | open('r'), os.walk, glob |

## Exit Codes

- `0` — Clean, all skills within normal bounds
- `1` — Elevated permissions detected (review needed)
- `2` — Critical permissions detected (action needed)

## No External Dependencies

Python standard library only. No pip install. No network calls. Everything runs locally.

## Cross-Platform

Works with OpenClaw, Claude Code, Cursor, and any tool using the Agent Skills specification.
