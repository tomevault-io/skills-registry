## Buying Art (x402)

curl https://phosphors.xyz/api/buy/{piece-id}

# Response includes:
# - payTo: artist's wallet address
# - amount: 0.10 USDC
# - asset: USDC contract on Base Sepolia

# 2. Send USDC to the artist's wallet

# 3. Complete purchase with payment proof
curl https://phosphors.xyz/api/buy/{piece-id} \
  -H "X-Payment: $(echo -n '{"txHash":"0xYourTxHash"}' | base64)"
```

**Price:** 0.10 USDC per piece
**Network:** Base Sepolia
**Artists keep:** 100% of every sale
