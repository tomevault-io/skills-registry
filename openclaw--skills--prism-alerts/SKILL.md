## Alert Filters

Configure which alerts you receive:

  "maxMarketCap": 100000,    // Maximum MC to alert
  "minHolders": 10,          // Minimum holder count
  "bondingProgress": 20,     // Alert when > 20% bonded
  "volumeSpike": 200,        // Alert on 200%+ volume increase
  "enableGraduations": true, // Alert on graduations
  "enableNewLaunches": true  // Alert on new tokens
}
```

## Integration

### Telegram Bot
```javascript
import { Telegraf } from 'telegraf';
import { PrismClient } from './prism';

const bot = new Telegraf(process.env.BOT_TOKEN);
const prism = new PrismClient();

// Poll every 30 seconds
setInterval(async () => {
  const bonding = await prism.pumpfunBonding();
  const newTokens = filterNewTokens(bonding);
  
  for (const token of newTokens) {
    await bot.telegram.sendMessage(CHANNEL_ID, formatAlert(token));
  }
}, 30000);
```

### Discord Bot
```javascript
import { Client } from 'discord.js';

client.on('ready', () => {
  pollPumpfun(client);
});
```

## Environment Variables

```bash
PRISM_URL=https://strykr-prism.up.railway.app
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=xxx
TELEGRAM_CHANNEL_ID=xxx
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=xxx
DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID=xxx
```

## Polling Best Practices

1. **Rate Limiting**: Poll max once per 30 seconds
2. **Deduplication**: Track sent alerts in SQLite/Redis
3. **Batching**: Group multiple alerts into one message
4. **Cooldowns**: Don't spam same token within 5 minutes
