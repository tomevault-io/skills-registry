# Progressive Memory

Token-efficient memory system for AI agents. Scan an index first, fetch details on demand. Based on progressive disclosure principles from claude-mem.

## The Problem

Traditional memory dumps everything into context:
- Load 3500 tokens of history
- 94% is irrelevant to current task
- Wastes attention budget, causes context rot

## The Solution

**Progressive disclosure:** Show what exists first, let the agent decide what to fetch.

```
Before: 3500 tokens loaded → 200 relevant (6%)
After:  100 token index → fetch 200 needed (100%)
```

## Memory Format

### Daily Files (`memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`)

```markdown
# 2026-02-01 (AgentName)

## Index (~70 tokens to scan)
| # | Type | Summary | ~Tok |
|---|------|---------|------|
| 1 | 🔴 | Auth bug - use browser not CLI | 80 |
| 2 | 🟢 | Deployed SEO fixes to 5 pages | 120 |
| 3 | 🟤 | Decided to split content by account | 60 |

---

### #1 | 🔴 Auth Bug | ~80 tokens
**Context:** Publishing via CLI
**Issue:** "Unauthorized" even with fresh tokens
**Workaround:** Use browser import instead
**Status:** Unresolved
```

### Long-Term Memory (`MEMORY.md`)

```markdown
## 📋 Index (~100 tokens)
| ID | Type | Category | Summary | ~Tok |
|----|------|----------|---------|------|
| R1 | 🚨 | Rules | Twitter posting protocol | 150 |
| G1 | 🔴 | Gotcha | CLI auth broken | 60 |
| D1 | 🟤 | Decision | Content split by account | 60 |

---

### R1 | Twitter Posting Protocol | ~150 tokens
- POST ALL tweets in ONE session
- NEVER post hook without full thread
- VERIFY everything before reporting done
```

## Observation Types

| Icon | Type | When to Use |
|------|------|-------------|
| 🚨 | rule | Critical rule, must follow |
| 🔴 | gotcha | Pitfall, don't repeat this |
| 🟡 | fix | Bug fix, workaround |
| 🔵 | how | Technical explanation |
| 🟢 | change | What changed, deployed |
| 🟣 | discovery | Learning, insight |
| 🟠 | why | Design rationale |
| 🟤 | decision | Architecture decision |
| ⚖️ | tradeoff | Deliberate compromise |

## Token Estimation

| Content Type | Tokens |
|--------------|--------|
| Simple fact | ~30-50 |
| Short explanation | ~80-150 |
| Detailed context | ~200-400 |
| Full summary | ~500-1000 |

## How It Works

1. **Session starts** → Agent scans index tables (~100-200 tokens)
2. **Agent sees types** → Prioritizes 🔴 gotchas over 🟢 changes
3. **Agent sees costs** → Decides if 400-token entry is worth it
4. **Fetch on demand** → Only load what's relevant to current task

## Benefits

- **Token savings:** ~65,000 tokens/day with 20 memory checks
- **Faster scanning:** Icons enable visual pattern recognition
- **Precise references:** IDs like #1, G3, D5 for exact lookup
- **Cost awareness:** Token counts for ROI decisions

## Integration

Works with any markdown-based memory system. No database required.

For Clawdbot users:
1. Update `AGENTS.md` with format instructions
2. Restructure `MEMORY.md` with index
3. Use format in daily `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` files
