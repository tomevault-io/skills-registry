# Recreation.gov Availability Checker

Check campsite availability for federal campgrounds on recreation.gov.

## Quick Start

```bash
cd /Users/doop/moltbot/skills/recgov-availability

# Check availability (campground ID from URL or ridb-search)
python3 scripts/check.py -c 233965 --start 2026-07-10 --nights 2

# Multiple campgrounds
python3 scripts/check.py -c 233965 233900 --start 2026-07-10 --nights 2

# Filter to tent sites, JSON output
python3 scripts/check.py -c 233965 --start 2026-07-10 --nights 2 --type tent --json
```

## Finding Campground IDs

From URL: `recreation.gov/camping/campgrounds/233965` → ID is `233965`

Or use ridb-search:
```bash
python3 ../ridb-search/scripts/search.py -l "Newport, OR" --camping-only
```
