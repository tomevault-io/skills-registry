description: Enforce release discipline for AI agents and developers. Prevents version spam, forces quality checks before publishing, and maintains a 24-hour cooldown between releases. Use when the user wants to publish, release, deploy, or bump versions. Triggers on "release", "publish", "deploy", "version bump", "npm publish", "릴리즈", "배포", "버전". Use when this capability is needed.

# 🛑 Release Discipline

Stop version spam. Ship quality, not quantity.

**Core principle: "Only finished work counts."**

## When This Activates

Intercept any release/publish/deploy action and run the pre-release checklist.

## Pre-Release Checklist (ALL must pass)

Before ANY version bump or publish, enforce these checks:

### Gate 1: Cooldown Check
```
❓ When was the last release?
→ If < 24 hours ago: 🛑 BLOCKED — "Cool down. Last release was {X}h ago. Wait until 24h."
→ If ≥ 24 hours: ✅ PASS
```

### Gate 2: User Feedback Check
```
❓ Has anyone used the previous version?
→ Check: GitHub issues, npm downloads, ClawHub installs, user messages
→ If no feedback exists: ⚠️ WARNING — "No one has used v{X} yet. Why release v{X+1}?"
→ If feedback exists: ✅ PASS — Summarize feedback
```

### Gate 3: Documentation Check
```
❓ Is documentation updated?
→ Check for: README.md, CHANGELOG, English docs
→ Missing README: 🛑 BLOCKED
→ Missing English: ⚠️ WARNING — "Global users can't read this"
→ All present: ✅ PASS
```

### Gate 4: Quality Check
```
❓ Does this release have substance?
→ Ask: "What's the ONE thing this release does better than the last?"
→ If answer is vague ("minor fixes", "improvements"): ⚠️ WARNING — "Be specific. What changed?"
→ If answer is clear: ✅ PASS
```

### Gate 5: Kill Criteria Check
```
❓ What kills this project?
→ If no kill criteria defined: ⚠️ WARNING — "Define when to stop: 'If X doesn't happen in Y weeks, shut it down.'"
→ If defined: ✅ PASS — Remind user of their kill criteria
```

### Gate 6: Self-Contradiction Check
```
❓ Does this action match your stated principles?
→ Read SOUL.md (or equivalent principles file)
→ Look for contradictions:
  - "Ship one thing at a time" + releasing 3 things = 🛑
  - "Quality over quantity" + 5 releases in 3 days = 🛑
  - "Finish before starting new" + new project while old unfinished = ⚠️
→ If contradiction found: 🛑 BLOCKED — Quote the principle and show the contradiction
→ If consistent: ✅ PASS
```

## Scoring

```
🛑 BLOCKED (any) → Cannot release. Fix the issue first.
⚠️ WARNING only → Can release, but agent must voice concern clearly.
✅ ALL PASS → Release approved. Proceed.
```

## Release Log

After every release (approved or blocked), log to `memory/release-log.md`:

```markdown
## {date} — v{version}
- Status: ✅ APPROVED / 🛑 BLOCKED / ⚠️ WARNED
- Gates: [1:✅ 2:⚠️ 3:✅ 4:✅ 5:✅ 6:✅]
- Reason: {why released or why blocked}
- User feedback on previous: {summary or "none"}
- Time since last release: {hours}
```

## Weekly Review

Every 7 days, review the release log:
- Total releases this week
- Block rate (healthy: 20-40% blocked = you're actually checking)
- 0% blocked = checklist is rubber-stamping, tighten criteria
- Pattern analysis: recurring issues

## Anti-Patterns This Skill Prevents

1. **Version Spam** — 17 versions in 3 days
2. **Spray Without Prune** — Making lots of things, finishing none
3. **Documentation Debt** — Shipping code without docs
4. **Echo Chamber** — Releasing without user feedback
5. **Principle Violation** — Breaking your own rules
6. **Premature Optimization** — Polishing what nobody uses

## Philosophy

> "The urge to ship is not the same as readiness to ship."
> "Fear of irrelevance is not a reason to publish."
> "One great release beats ten mediocre ones."

This skill is a **brake, not an accelerator**. It exists because the hardest part of building isn't making things — it's knowing when to stop making and start finishing.
