# Scrask Bot

## Overview

This skill activates when the user sends a screenshot via **Telegram**.
It uses vision AI to extract actionable information from the image, then:

- **High confidence (≥ 0.75):** Saves immediately and replies with a brief confirmation.
- **Low confidence (< 0.75):** Shows a structured preview in Telegram and asks for confirmation before saving.

**Provider behaviour (auto mode, default):**

| Step | What happens |
|---|---|
| 1 | Gemini 2.0 Flash parses the screenshot (fast, cheap) |
| 2 | If any item confidence < 0.60, Claude Opus reruns the parse |
| 3 | Whichever provider scores higher average confidence wins |
| 4 | Output includes `provider`, `fallback_triggered`, and confidence delta |

Set `vision_provider` to `"claude"` or `"gemini"` to lock a specific provider.

**Output destinations (AI-decided by content type):**

| Detected type | Destination |
|---|---|
| Event (has date+time, venue, or invite link) | Google Calendar |
| Reminder (deadline, due date, personal action) | Google Tasks (with due date) |
| Task (no date, pure action item) | Google Tasks (no due date) |

## Trigger Conditions

Activate when:
1. The user sends a message in Telegram that contains an **image attachment**
2. The image appears to be a **screenshot** — not a photo of a person, place, or physical object
3. No other skill has already claimed the image

Do not activate for:
- Photos of people, places, food, scenery
- Screenshots of code, errors, or UI bugs (leave for other skills)
- Images the user explicitly asks to edit, describe, or analyze for another purpose

---

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Acknowledge Immediately

Reply in Telegram right away so the user knows the skill is working:

> "📸 Got it — analyzing your screenshot..."

Do not make the user wait silently.

---

### Step 2: Run the Parser

```bash
python3 ~/.openclaw/skills/scrask-bot/scripts/scrask_bot.py \
  --image-path "<path-to-temp-image>" \
  --provider "$CONFIG_VISION_PROVIDER" \
  --timezone "$CONFIG_TIMEZONE" \
  --google-credentials "$GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS"

The script auto-resolves the API key from ANTHROPIC_API_KEY or GEMINI_API_KEY
depending on the provider — no need to pass it explicitly.
```

The script returns a JSON object with:
- `success` — whether parsing worked
- `no_actionable_content` — true if nothing found
- `results[]` — one entry per detected item, each with `confidence`, `type`, `destination`, `needs_confirmation`, `action_taken`
- `telegram_reply` — the pre-formatted message to send back to the user

---

### Step 3: Handle the Output

**If `no_actionable_content` is true:**
Reply: "🤷 I couldn't find any event, reminder, or task info in that screenshot. Could you describe what you'd like to add?"

**If `success` is true:**
Send the `telegram_reply` value directly back to the user in Telegram. The script has already:
- Saved high-confidence items silently
- Formatted confirmation prompts for low-confidence items

Do not rephrase or reformat the `telegram_reply` — send it as-is.

---

### Step 4: Handle Confirmation Responses

If the script returned items with `needs_confirmation: true`, wait for the user's reply.

**"yes" or "save" or "add":**
Re-run the script for that specific item with confirmed=true, or use the `calendar_create` / `tasks_create` tools directly with the extracted fields.

**"edit":**
Ask what to change, update the relevant field, then save.

**"skip" or "no":**
Reply: "Got it, skipped ✓"

---

### Step 5: Confirm Saves

For items saved silently (high confidence), the `telegram_reply` from the script already contains the confirmation message. Examples of what the user will see:

- `📅 Added to Calendar: **Team Standup** — 2026-03-01 at 09:00`
- `🔔 Added to Tasks: **Pay electricity bill** (due 2026-02-28)`
- `✅ Added to Tasks: **Review PR for Arjun**`

## Edge Cases

| Scenario | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Screenshot is in Hindi, Tamil, or another language | Extract and translate silently; save title in English |
| Recurring event ("every Monday") | Set RRULE on the calendar event; mention it in the reply |
| Date has already passed | Flag in the reply: "⚠️ This date has already passed (Feb 10). Save anyway?" |
| Multiple items in one screenshot | Process each independently; confirm per item if needed |
| Screenshot of someone's calendar | Detect `already_in_calendar_hint`; reply: "Looks like this event is already in your calendar 🗓️" |
| Google API auth failure | Reply with the specific error and suggest re-checking GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS |
| Zoom/Meet link found | Add to Calendar as both location and description |
