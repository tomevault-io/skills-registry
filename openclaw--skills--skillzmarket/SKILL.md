# Skillz Market

Search and call monetized AI skills with automatic cryptocurrency payments via x402.

## Quick Start

List all available skills:
```bash
npx tsx {baseDir}/skillz-cli.ts list
```

Search for skills:
```bash
npx tsx {baseDir}/skillz-cli.ts search "echo"
```

Get skill details:
```bash
npx tsx {baseDir}/skillz-cli.ts info "echo-service"
```

Call a skill (requires SKILLZ_PRIVATE_KEY):
```bash
npx tsx {baseDir}/skillz-cli.ts call "echo-service" '{"message":"hello"}'
```

## Commands

- `list [--verified]` - List all available skills (optionally filter by verified only)
- `search <query>` - Search for skills by keyword
- `info <slug>` - Get skill details by slug
- `call <slug> <json>` - Call a skill with automatic x402 payment
- `direct <url> <json>` - Call any x402-enabled endpoint directly

## Configuration

Your wallet private key is required for x402 payments. Set it in OpenClaw config (`~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`):

```json
{
  "skills": {
    "entries": {
      "skillzmarket": {
        "apiKey": "0xYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note**: OpenClaw uses `apiKey` as the standard config field for skill credentials. This maps to the `SKILLZ_PRIVATE_KEY` environment variable that the skill uses internally.

Alternatively, set the environment variable directly:
```bash
export SKILLZ_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
```

## Environment Variables

- `SKILLZ_PRIVATE_KEY` - Wallet private key for x402 payments
- `SKILLZ_API_URL` - API endpoint (default: https://api.skillz.market)
