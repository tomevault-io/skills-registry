# 📡 Telecom Agent Skill v1.2

**Give your MoltBot / OpenClaw agent the power of a Telecom Operator.**

This skill connects your agent to the **Telecom Operator Console**, allowing it to manage campaigns, handle approvals, and operate on the public telephone network safely.

## ✨ Capabilities

### 🚀 Campaign Queue (Bulk Calling) *New*
*   **Mass Dialing**: Upload a list of 10,000+ numbers. The system handles rate-limiting.
*   **ChatOps**: "Bot, create a campaign for the 'Friday Leads' list."
*   **Monitoring**: Agent can poll status with `--json` for precise progress tracking.

### 🗣️ Voice & Speech
*   **Make Calls**: Dial any global number.
*   **Speak**: Dynamic "Text-to-Speech" intro messages.
*   **Listen**: Records audio automatically for quality assurance.

### 📱 Field Operations (Telegram)
*   **Remote Admin**: Monitor system status from a Telegram Bot.
*   **Approvals**: Approve/Deny high-risk actions via mobile buttons.

### 🧠 Operational Memory
*   **Transcripts**: Agent can read full call transcripts (`telecom agent memory`).
*   **Persistence**: All logs saved to the secure Operator Console.
