# Todoist Skill — Natural Language Task Management

Manage your Todoist tasks conversationally. No need to remember CLI syntax — just talk naturally about your tasks.

## Natural Language Examples

This skill understands conversational requests:

**List tasks:**
- "What tasks do I have today?"
- "Show me my Todoist list for this week"
- "What do I have overdue?"
- "Show priority 1 tasks"

**Add tasks:**
- "Add 'buy milk' to my todo list"
- "Create a task to call the dentist tomorrow"
- "I need to review the Q4 report by Friday"
- "Add 'weekly standup' due every Monday"

**Complete tasks:**
- "Complete my task about the dentist"
- "Mark the milk task as done"
- "I finished the report"

**Manage projects:**
- "What projects do I have in Todoist?"
- "Show tasks from my Work project"

## Prerequisites

- `TODOIST_API_KEY` environment variable must be set with your Todoist API token
- Get your token at: https://todoist.com/app/settings/integrations/developer

## Technical Usage

If you prefer CLI commands or need to script operations, use the Python script directly:

```bash
# List today's tasks
python3 todoist/scripts/todoist.py list --filter "today"

# Add a task
python3 todoist/scripts/todoist.py add "Buy milk" --due "tomorrow" --priority 2

# Complete a task by ID
python3 todoist/scripts/todoist.py complete "TASK_ID"

# List all projects
python3 todoist/scripts/todoist.py projects
```

## Filter Syntax

When filtering tasks (via natural language or CLI):

- `today` — tasks due today
- `overdue` — overdue tasks
- `tomorrow` — tasks due tomorrow
- `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `p4` — priority filters
- `7 days` — tasks due in next 7 days
- `@label` — tasks with specific label
- `#project` — tasks in project
- Combine with `&` (and) and `|` (or): `today & p1`

## Priority Levels

- `1` — Urgent (red)
- `2` — High (orange)
- `3` — Medium (blue)
- `4` — Low (white/gray, default)

## Features

- ✅ Natural language task management
- ✅ Timezone-aware "today" filtering
- ✅ Smart filtering (excludes completed tasks)
- ✅ Recurring task support
- ✅ Full Todoist API v1 coverage

## Response Format

The script outputs JSON for programmatic use. See `references/api.md` for full API documentation.

## Notes

- The skill automatically filters out completed tasks
- "Today" uses your local timezone (set `TZ` environment variable if needed)
- Natural language dates ("tomorrow", "next Friday") use Todoist's built-in parsing
