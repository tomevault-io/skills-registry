# Token Panel Ultimate

**One dashboard for every token you spend.** Anthropic, Gemini, OpenAI, Manus—tracked, stored, and queryable before the bill arrives.

## Why This Exists

You've checked your Anthropic console, squinted at the OpenAI dashboard, opened a Gemini tab, and still weren't sure where last Tuesday's $14 went. Token Panel Ultimate puts all four providers in one place so the answer is always one query away.

## What It Does

- **Multi-Provider Tracking** — Anthropic, Gemini, OpenAI, and Manus in a single SQLite database
- **Budget Alerts** — Set monthly limits per provider. Get warned before you overspend, not after
- **REST API** — Query usage programmatically on port 8765. Plug it into your own scripts or dashboards
- **Transcript Parsing** — Automatically extracts token counts from OpenClaw session transcripts
- **Zero Dependencies** — SQLite storage. No Postgres, no Redis, no cloud account required
- **Runs as a Daemon** — Systemd service keeps it alive in the background

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 api.py
```

## Architecture

```
OpenClaw Plugin → Budget Collector API → SQLite DB
                        ↓
                Transcripts / Anthropic API / Manus Tracker
```
