# Walkie-Talkie Mode

This skill automates the voice-to-voice loop on WhatsApp using local transcription and local TTS.

## Workflow

1. **Incoming Audio**: When a user sends an audio/ogg/opus file:
   - Use `tools/transcribe_voice.sh` to get the text.
   - Process the text as a normal user prompt.

2. **Outgoing Response**:
   - Instead of a text reply, generate speech using `bin/sherpa-onnx-tts`.
   - Send the resulting `.ogg` file back to the user as a voice note.

## Triggers

- User sends an audio message.
- User says "activa modo walkie-talkie" or "hablemos por voz".

## Constraints

- Use local tools only (ffmpeg, whisper-cpp, sherpa-onnx-tts).
- Maintain a fast response time (RTF < 0.5).
- Always reply with BOTH text (for clarity) and audio.

## Manual Execution (Internal)

To respond with voice manually:
```bash
bin/sherpa-onnx-tts /tmp/reply.ogg "Tu mensaje aquí"
```
Then send `/tmp/reply.ogg` via `message` tool with `filePath`.
