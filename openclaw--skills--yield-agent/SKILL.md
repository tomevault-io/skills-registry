# YieldAgent by Yield.xyz

Access the complete on-chain yield landscape through Yield.xyz's unified API. Discover 2600+ yields across staking, lending, vaults, restaking, and liquidity pools. Build transactions and manage positions across 80+ networks.

## CRITICAL: Never Modify Transactions From The API

> **DO NOT MODIFY `unsignedTransaction` returned by the API UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.**
>
> Do not change, reformat, or "fix" any part of it — not addresses, amounts, fees, encoding, or any other field, on any chain.
>
> **If the amount is wrong:** Request a NEW action from the API with the correct amount.
> **If gas is insufficient:** Ask the user to add funds, then request a NEW action.
> **If anything looks wrong:** STOP. Always request a new action with corrected arguments. Never attempt to "fix" an existing transaction.
>
> Modifying `unsignedTransaction` WILL RESULT IN PERMANENT LOSS OF FUNDS.

## Key Rules

> **The API is self-documenting.** Every yield describes its own requirements through the `YieldDto`. Before taking any action, always fetch the yield and inspect it. The `mechanics` field tells you everything: what arguments are needed (`mechanics.arguments.enter`, `.exit`), entry limits (`mechanics.entryLimits`), and what tokens are accepted (`inputTokens[]`). Never assume — always check the yield first.

1. **Always fetch the yield before calling an action.** Call `GET /v1/yields/{yieldId}` and read `mechanics.arguments.enter` (or `.exit`) to discover the exact fields required. Each yield is different — the schema is the contract. Do not guess or hardcode arguments.

   Each field in the schema (`ArgumentFieldDto`) tells you:
   - `name`: the field name (e.g., `amount`, `validatorAddress`, `inputToken`)
   - `type`: the value type (`string`, `number`, `address`, `enum`, `boolean`)
   - `required`: whether it must be provided
   - `options`: static choices for enum fields (e.g., `["individual", "batched"]`)
   - `optionsRef`: a dynamic API endpoint to fetch choices (e.g., `/api/v1/validators?integrationId=...`) — if present, call it to get the valid options (validators, providers, etc.)
   - `minimum` / `maximum`: value constraints
   - `isArray`: whether the field expects an array

   If a field has `optionsRef`, you must call that endpoint to get the valid values. This is how validators, providers, and other dynamic options are discovered.

2. **For manage actions, always fetch balances first.** Call `POST /v1/yields/{yieldId}/balances` and read `pendingActions[]` on each balance. Each pending action tells you its `type`, `passthrough`, and optional `arguments` schema. Only call manage with values from this response.

3. **Amounts are human-readable.** `"100"` means 100 USDC. `"1"` means 1 ETH. `"0.5"` means 0.5 SOL. Do NOT convert to wei or raw integers — the API handles decimals internally.

4. **Set `inputToken` to what the user wants to deposit** — but only if `inputToken` appears in the yield's `mechanics.arguments.enter` schema. The API handles the full flow (swaps, wrapping, routing) to get the user into the position.

5. **ALWAYS submit the transaction hash after broadcasting — no exceptions.** For every transaction: sign, broadcast, then submit the hash via `PUT /v1/transactions/{txId}/submit-hash` with `{ "hash": "0x..." }`. Balances will not appear until the hash is submitted. This is the most common mistake — do not skip this step.

6. **Execute transactions in exact order.** If an action has multiple transactions, they are ordered by `stepIndex`. Wait for `CONFIRMED` before proceeding to the next. Never skip or reorder.

7. **Consult `{baseDir}/references/openapi.yaml` for types.** All enums, DTOs, and schemas are defined there. Do not hardcode values.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Discover yields on a network
./scripts/find-yields.sh base USDC

# Inspect a yield's schema before entering
./scripts/get-yield-info.sh base-usdc-aave-v3-lending

# Enter a position (amounts are human-readable)
./scripts/enter-position.sh base-usdc-aave-v3-lending 0xYOUR_ADDRESS '{"amount":"100"}'

# Check balances and pending actions
./scripts/check-portfolio.sh base-usdc-aave-v3-lending 0xYOUR_ADDRESS
```

## Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `find-yields.sh` | Discover yields by network/token |
| `get-yield-info.sh` | Inspect yield schema, limits, token details |
| `list-validators.sh` | List validators for staking yields |
| `enter-position.sh` | Enter a yield position |
| `exit-position.sh` | Exit a yield position |
| `manage-position.sh` | Claim, restake, redelegate, etc. |
| `check-portfolio.sh` | Check balances and pending actions |

## Common Patterns

### Enter a Position
1. Discover yields: `find-yields.sh base USDC`
2. Inspect the yield: `get-yield-info.sh <yieldId>` — read `mechanics.arguments.enter`
3. Enter: `enter-position.sh <yieldId> <address> '{"amount":"100"}'`
4. For each transaction: wallet signs → broadcast → **submit hash** → wait for CONFIRMED

### Manage a Position
1. Check balances: `check-portfolio.sh <yieldId> <address>`
2. Read `pendingActions[]` — each has `{ type, passthrough, arguments? }`
3. Manage: `manage-position.sh <yieldId> <address> <action> <passthrough>`

### Full Lifecycle
1. Discover → 2. Enter → 3. Check balances → 4. Claim rewards → 5. Exit

## Transaction Flow

After any action (enter/exit/manage), the response contains `transactions[]`. For EACH transaction:

1. Pass `unsignedTransaction` to wallet skill for signing and broadcasting
2. **Submit the hash** — `PUT /v1/transactions/{txId}/submit-hash` with `{ "hash": "0x..." }`
3. Poll `GET /v1/transactions/{txId}` until `CONFIRMED` or `FAILED`
4. Proceed to next transaction

Every transaction must follow this flow. Example with 3 transactions:
```
TX1: sign → broadcast → submit-hash → poll until CONFIRMED
TX2: sign → broadcast → submit-hash → poll until CONFIRMED
TX3: sign → broadcast → submit-hash → poll until CONFIRMED
```

`unsignedTransaction` format varies by chain. See `{baseDir}/references/chain-formats.md` for details.

## API Endpoints

All endpoints documented in `{baseDir}/references/openapi.yaml`. Quick reference:

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/v1/yields` | List yields (with filters) |
| GET | `/v1/yields/{yieldId}` | Get yield metadata (schema, limits, tokens) |
| GET | `/v1/yields/{yieldId}/validators` | List validators |
| POST | `/v1/actions/enter` | Enter a position |
| POST | `/v1/actions/exit` | Exit a position |
| POST | `/v1/actions/manage` | Manage a position |
| POST | `/v1/yields/{yieldId}/balances` | Get balances for a yield |
| POST | `/v1/yields/balances` | Aggregate balances across yields/networks |
| PUT | `/v1/transactions/{txId}/submit-hash` | Submit tx hash after broadcasting |
| GET | `/v1/transactions/{txId}` | Get transaction status |
| GET | `/v1/networks` | List all supported networks |
| GET | `/v1/providers` | List all providers |

## Error Handling

The API returns structured errors with `message`, `error`, and `statusCode`. Read the `message`. Error shapes are in `{baseDir}/references/openapi.yaml`. Respect `retry-after` on 429s.
