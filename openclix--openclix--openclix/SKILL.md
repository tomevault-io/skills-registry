description: Design, create, and iterate OpenClix campaign configurations from product goals and app events, producing schema-valid openclix-config.json with delivery mode setup. TRIGGER when the user asks to "create campaigns", "design notifications", "configure engagement messages", "set up onboarding/re-engagement/streak flows", or refine trigger logic, suppression rules, or message content — even if they just describe a retention goal without mentioning campaigns. DO NOT trigger for campaign performance analysis or optimization from metrics — that belongs to openclix-update-campaigns. Use when this capability is needed.

# OpenClix Campaign Design

Turn campaign goals into schema-valid OpenClix config JSON with minimal ambiguity.
Keep outputs auditable and compatible with the OpenClix runtime contract.
When the user asks for implementation, install the final config JSON into app resources and wire runtime initialization code.

## Workflow

Follow these phases in order.

1. Collect campaign context.
2. Build or refresh an app profile artifact.
3. Design campaign set.
4. Generate or update OpenClix config.
5. Validate artifact outputs.
6. Inspect existing OpenClix integration and choose delivery mode.
7. Execute selected delivery path and hand off.

Repository hygiene rule:

- Before writing outputs under `.openclix/**`, ensure `.openclix/` is listed in `.gitignore` (add it if missing).

## 1) Collect Campaign Context

Gather only missing facts needed for design decisions:

- app name and platform(s)
- primary retention goals (onboarding, habit, re-engagement, milestone, feature discovery)
- event taxonomy: event names + available property keys
- current campaign config path (if existing)
- existing app resource/file management convention for JSON assets
- startup location where OpenClix is currently initialized (or should be initialized)
- exact runtime bundled-config load path and filename currently referenced in code (case-sensitive)
- user-owned HTTP server/deployment target for hosted config (if remote serving is expected)
- global constraints: quiet hours, frequency cap expectations, locale/timezone assumptions

If the user already provided enough detail, do not re-ask resolved points.

## 2) Build Or Refresh App Profile Artifact

Before authoring campaigns:

- Read `references/json-schemas.md`.
- Read `references/schemas/app-profile.schema.json`.
- Create or update `.openclix/campaigns/app-profile.json`.
- Capture goals, event taxonomy, personalization variables, existing campaigns, and constraints.
- Present the JSON and confirm accuracy before proceeding.

## 3) Design Campaign Set

Before drafting campaigns:

- Read `references/openclix-campaign-playbook.md`.

Design 3-5 campaigns unless the user requests a different count.
Spread campaigns across lifecycle stages or explicit user priorities.

OpenClix modeling rule:

- One campaign delivers one message.
- Model multi-step journeys as multiple related campaign IDs (for example `onboarding-step-1`, `onboarding-step-2`, `onboarding-step-3`).

Trigger selection rule:

- Use `event` for behavior-driven messaging.
- Use `scheduled` for one-time date/time delivery.
- Use `recurring` for repeated cadence.

Suppression and cancellation rule:

- Use `delay_seconds` + `cancel_event` for pending enrollment cancellation when behavior can invalidate intent.
- Use global `settings.do_not_disturb` and `settings.frequency_cap` when needed.

Content rule:

- Use only known personalization keys with `{{key}}` syntax.
- Keep schema-safe limits: title <= 120, body <= 500.
- Prefer concise UX copy (title <= 45, body <= 140) unless user needs longer copy.

Feature coverage rule (mandatory when adding a new campaign):

- Run a feature pass against `references/schemas/openclix.schema.json` and explicitly evaluate each configurable lever:
  - global: `settings.frequency_cap`, `settings.do_not_disturb`
  - campaign: `frequency_cap`
  - event trigger: `delay_seconds`, `cancel_event`
  - recurring trigger: `start_at`, `end_at`, `rule.interval`, `weekly_rule.days_of_week`, `time_of_day`
  - message content: `image_url`, `landing_url`, personalization placeholders
- Apply every lever that is relevant to the campaign goal; if a lever is not used, state why in handoff assumptions.

## 4) Generate Or Update OpenClix Config

Before writing config:

- Read `references/schemas/openclix.schema.json`.

Write updates in this order:

1. Update the user-specified config path if provided.
2. Otherwise write `.openclix/campaigns/openclix-config.json`.

Remote delivery note:

- The same generated config JSON can be uploaded to a web server and served over HTTPS for remote access.
- Use the same schema-valid JSON artifact for both local resource delivery and remote endpoint delivery.
- Public schema reference for external validators: `https://openclix.ai/schemas/openclix.schema.json`.

Guarantee these invariants:

- `"$schema"` is exactly `https://openclix.ai/schemas/openclix.schema.json`.
- `schema_version` is exactly `openclix/config/v1`.
- `config_version` is explicit and traceable.
- Campaign IDs are kebab-case.
- Campaign `type` is `campaign`.
- Campaign `status` is `running` or `paused`.
- Trigger-specific required fields are present.
- Optional but available fields are intentionally evaluated (not ignored by default), especially frequency caps and suppression controls.
- No unknown fields are introduced.

When editing existing config, keep diffs minimal and preserve unrelated campaigns.

## 5) Validate Artifact Outputs

Validation is mandatory. Fix all failures before proceeding to delivery.

### Config Validation

Primary path (inside the openclix repo):

- `./scripts/validate_config.sh <config-file>`

This runs JSON syntax, ajv-cli schema validation (`--spec=draft2020`), and structural spot-checks in one pass. All checks must pass.

Fallback path (outside the repo or when the script is unavailable):

1. `jq . <config-file>` — verify JSON syntax.
2. Validate against the canonical schema with `ajv`:
   - If you are inside the `openclix` repo (schema checked out locally):
     `npx --yes -p ajv-cli@5.0.0 -p ajv-formats@3.0.1 ajv validate --spec=draft2020 -c ajv-formats -s ./references/schemas/openclix.schema.json -d <config-file>`
   - If you are outside the repo (no local schema), use the published canonical schema URL:
     `npx --yes -p ajv-cli@5.0.0 -p ajv-formats@3.0.1 ajv validate --spec=draft2020 -c ajv-formats -s https://openclix.ai/schemas/openclix.schema.json -d <config-file>`
3. Manually verify: `$schema` is `https://openclix.ai/schemas/openclix.schema.json`, `schema_version` is `openclix/config/v1`, campaign keys are kebab-case, every campaign has `type: "campaign"`, and each `trigger.type` value has its matching sub-object key.

### App Profile Validation

Validate app profile artifacts against either the local or published schema:

- Local (inside the `openclix` repo): `references/schemas/app-profile.schema.json`
- Published: `https://openclix.ai/schemas/app-profile.schema.json`
- Command (choose one based on availability):
  - Local schema: `npx --yes -p ajv-cli@5.0.0 -p ajv-formats@3.0.1 ajv validate --spec=draft2020 -c ajv-formats -s ./references/schemas/app-profile.schema.json -d <app-profile-file>`
  - Published schema: `npx --yes -p ajv-cli@5.0.0 -p ajv-formats@3.0.1 ajv validate --spec=draft2020 -c ajv-formats -s https://openclix.ai/schemas/app-profile.schema.json -d <app-profile-file>`

### Handoff Report

Report at handoff:

- output file paths
- campaign IDs and intent
- config validation result: pass or fail (with details)
- app profile validation result: pass or fail (with details)
- key assumptions
- unresolved gaps requiring user input

## 6) Inspect Existing OpenClix Integration And Choose Delivery Mode

After generating config JSON, inspect existing OpenClix integration code before delivery decisions.

Inspection checklist:

- Locate `OpenClix.initialize(...)` call sites and current `OpenClixConfig.endpoint` usage.
- Locate any existing `OpenClixCampaignManager.replaceConfig(...)` usage.
- Confirm project resource conventions used by current startup wiring.
- If OpenClix client integration is missing, run `openclix-init` first and use its detected platform/startup/resource conventions.

Decision gate (mandatory unless user already specified mode):

- Ask the user which delivery mode to use:
  1. Bundle config in the app package.
  2. Upload to the user's existing HTTP server and serve over HTTPS.
- Do not assume delivery mode when the user has not chosen one.

## 7) Execute Selected Delivery Path And Hand Off

### A) Bundle In-App (Local Resource Delivery)

When the user chooses bundle mode:

1. Use platform/startup/resource information discovered from existing code and `openclix-init` outputs.
2. Resolve the runtime bundle target path in this order:
   - Use the exact existing load path already referenced in code.
   - If no load path exists yet, use a fallback default:
     - React Native / Expo: `assets/openclix/openclix-config.json`
     - Flutter: `assets/openclix/openclix-config.json` (and register it in `pubspec.yaml`)
     - iOS: `<app-target>/OpenClix/openclix-config.json` (add to Copy Bundle Resources)
     - Android: `app/src/main/assets/openclix/openclix-config.json`
3. Copy `.openclix/campaigns/openclix-config.json` to that resolved runtime path.
4. Keep filename as lowercase `openclix-config.json` unless the project already has a different runtime filename and loader reference.
5. Set `OpenClixConfig.endpoint` to the same bundled path identifier used by the runtime loader.
6. Update startup code to load JSON from that exact bundled path, parse `Config`, then call `OpenClixCampaignManager.replaceConfig(...)` after initialization.
7. Run platform build/analysis checks after wiring.
8. Perform a parity check: copied file path, loader path reference, and `OpenClixConfig.endpoint` identifier must all match.

### B) Hosted HTTP Delivery (User-Owned Server)

When the user chooses HTTP mode:

1. Confirm user-owned hosting target and deploy access method (for example Vercel, Netlify, S3/CloudFront, object storage + CDN, or custom backend API).
2. Upload/deploy `.openclix/campaigns/openclix-config.json` to that environment.
3. Verify the deployed config is reachable at a stable HTTPS URL.
4. Set `OpenClixConfig.endpoint` to the deployed HTTPS URL.
5. Keep local bundled fallback only if the user explicitly requests dual-path operation.
6. Run platform build/analysis checks after wiring.

Critical runtime note:

- `OpenClix.initialize(...)` auto-fetches config only for HTTP(S) endpoints.
- For in-app resource JSON, always load and apply config explicitly via `OpenClixCampaignManager.replaceConfig(...)` after initialization.
- For hosted delivery, always use HTTPS and verify the URL is accessible.

Completion requirements for implementation tasks:

- selected delivery mode reported
- source config path and applied runtime config path/URL reported
- for bundle mode: case-sensitive filename and path parity check result reported
- `OpenClixConfig.endpoint` value/location updated and reported
- resource file path reported for bundle mode
- modified startup/init file paths reported
- confirmation that local resource config is applied at runtime
- for hosted mode, deployed HTTPS config URL and upload method summary reported

## Design Guardrails

- Do not invent event names that conflict with provided taxonomy.
- Prefer explicit condition rules (`field: "name"` and `field: "property"`) over vague matching.
- Default to `connector: "and"`; use `or` only with explicit rationale.
- Include `weekly_rule.days_of_week` whenever recurrence type is `weekly`.
- Use global quiet-hour controls before introducing ad-hoc per-campaign windows.
- After config generation, inspect existing OpenClix wiring and ask the user to choose bundle vs hosted delivery if not already specified.
- Reuse project facts discovered by `openclix-init` when selecting resource path and startup patch points.
- For bundle delivery, never guess a new directory when code already points to a concrete path.
- Use lowercase `openclix-config.json` unless an existing runtime loader already requires another exact filename.
- Do not rely on non-HTTP endpoints being auto-loaded by `OpenClix.initialize(...)`.
- For local JSON delivery, always set `OpenClixConfig.endpoint` to the chosen bundled path and wire explicit resource load + `OpenClixCampaignManager.replaceConfig(...)`.
- For remote JSON delivery, set `OpenClixConfig.endpoint` to HTTPS URL and keep the payload schema-compatible with `openclix/config/v1`.
- When asked, provide environment-specific upload guidance rather than generic hosting advice.
- Keep integration edits minimal and aligned with existing project structure.
