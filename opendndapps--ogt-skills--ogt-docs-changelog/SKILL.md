---

## Adding Entries

### Manual Addition

```bash
# Open changelog
vim CHANGELOG.md

# Add entry under [Unreleased] in appropriate category
```

### From Completed Task

When a task moves to `done/`:

```bash
# 1. Read the task summary
cat docs/todo/done/{task}/task.md | head -20

# 2. Determine category (Added/Changed/Fixed/etc.)

# 3. Add to CHANGELOG.md under [Unreleased]
```

### From Conventional Commits

Parse conventional commits to generate entries:

```bash
# Get commits since last tag
git log $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)..HEAD --oneline

# Parse by type
# feat: -> Added
# fix: -> Fixed
# refactor: -> Changed
# docs: -> (usually skip or Added)
```

---

## Release Workflow

### Step 1: Review Unreleased

```bash
# View current unreleased changes
sed -n '/## \[Unreleased\]/,/## \[/p' CHANGELOG.md | head -n -1
```

### Step 2: Determine Version

Based on changes:

- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes present → `X.0.0`
- **MINOR**: New features, no breaking → `x.X.0`
- **PATCH**: Only fixes → `x.x.X`

### Step 3: Create Release Section

```markdown
## [Unreleased]

## [2.1.0] - 2026-02-06

### Added

- Steam OAuth authentication support (#123)
- Global fuzzy search (#124)

### Fixed

- Null response handling in legacy API (#125)
```

### Step 4: Update Links

```markdown
[Unreleased]: https://github.com/org/repo/compare/v2.1.0...HEAD
[2.1.0]: https://github.com/org/repo/compare/v2.0.0...v2.1.0
[2.0.0]: https://github.com/org/repo/releases/tag/v2.0.0
```

### Step 5: Commit and Tag

```bash
# Commit changelog update
git add CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "chore(release): v2.1.0"

# Create tag
git tag -a v2.1.0 -m "Release v2.1.0"

# Push
git push origin main --tags
```

---

## Automated Generation

### From Conventional Commits

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# generate-changelog.sh

LAST_TAG=$(git describe --tags --abbrev=0 2>/dev/null || echo "")

if [ -z "$LAST_TAG" ]; then
  COMMITS=$(git log --oneline)
else
  COMMITS=$(git log ${LAST_TAG}..HEAD --oneline)
fi

echo "## [Unreleased]"
echo ""

# Added (feat commits)
ADDED=$(echo "$COMMITS" | grep "^[a-f0-9]* feat" | sed 's/^[a-f0-9]* feat[^:]*: /- /')
if [ -n "$ADDED" ]; then
  echo "### Added"
  echo "$ADDED"
  echo ""
fi

# Fixed (fix commits)
FIXED=$(echo "$COMMITS" | grep "^[a-f0-9]* fix" | sed 's/^[a-f0-9]* fix[^:]*: /- /')
if [ -n "$FIXED" ]; then
  echo "### Fixed"
  echo "$FIXED"
  echo ""
fi

# Changed (refactor commits)
CHANGED=$(echo "$COMMITS" | grep "^[a-f0-9]* refactor" | sed 's/^[a-f0-9]* refactor[^:]*: /- /')
if [ -n "$CHANGED" ]; then
  echo "### Changed"
  echo "$CHANGED"
  echo ""
fi
```

### From Done Tasks

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# changelog-from-tasks.sh

echo "## Changes from completed tasks"
echo ""

for task_dir in docs/todo/done/*/; do
  task_name=$(basename "$task_dir")

  # Read summary from task.md
  summary=$(sed -n '/## Summary/,/##/p' "$task_dir/task.md" | head -n -1 | tail -n +2)

  # Determine category from task name or content
  if echo "$task_name" | grep -qi "fix\|bug"; then
    category="Fixed"
  elif echo "$task_name" | grep -qi "add\|new\|create"; then
    category="Added"
  else
    category="Changed"
  fi

  echo "### $category"
  echo "- $summary (task: $task_name)"
  echo ""
done
```

## Best Practices

### Do

- Write for users, not developers
- Use past tense ("Added" not "Add")
- Include issue/PR numbers
- Highlight breaking changes clearly
- Keep entries concise but informative
- Update changelog with every PR
- Group related changes

### Don't

- Include internal implementation details
- Use technical jargon users won't understand
- Forget to update links at bottom
- Let [Unreleased] get too long (release often)
- Mix user-facing and internal changes
- Skip security updates

      - name: Check changelog updated
        run: |
          if git diff --name-only origin/main | grep -q "CHANGELOG.md"; then
            echo "Changelog updated"
          else
            echo "WARNING: CHANGELOG.md not updated"
            echo "Please add an entry under [Unreleased]"
            # Optionally fail: exit 1
          fi
```

### Auto-Release Notes

          NOTES=$(sed -n "/## \[${VERSION}\]/,/## \[/p" CHANGELOG.md | head -n -1)
          echo "notes<<EOF" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
          echo "$NOTES" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
          echo "EOF" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

      - name: Create Release
