├── .version
├── .scheduled_for      # Optional: scheduled date
└── .thread             # Signal: this is a thread
```

#### content.md (Single Tweet)

# Thread: Building ORC v2

## Tweet 1/5

We just shipped ORC v2.0!

Here's the story of how we built it...

A thread.

## Tweet 2/5

First, we tackled authentication.

Steam OAuth was the most requested feature. We built it on top of our existing Google/Discord flow.

The key insight: abstract the provider layer early.

## Tweet 3/5

Next: search.

Users wanted instant, fuzzy search. We evaluated:

- Fuse.js (heavy)
- Lunr (no fuzzy)
- MiniSearch (perfect)

MiniSearch is 6KB and blazing fast.

## Tweet 4/5

Card variants took the longest.

8 entity types × 4 variants = 32 components.

We used composition patterns to share logic. CardBase handles the common stuff.

## Tweet 5/5

Try it out: https://example.com

We'd love your feedback. What should we build next?

# How We Built Instant Fuzzy Search

## Summary

A deep dive into implementing sub-16ms fuzzy search for 10,000+ items.

## Content

### The Problem

Our users needed to search across creatures, items, spells, and more. The old approach used `String.includes()` - fine for small datasets, but slow and inflexible at scale.

### Requirements

1. Instant results (<16ms for 10k items)
2. Fuzzy matching ("fir" matches "Fireball")
3. Relevance ranking
4. TypeScript support

### Choosing a Library

We evaluated three options:

| Library    | Size | Fuzzy | Speed |
| ---------- | ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Fuse.js    | 25KB | Yes   | Slow  |
| Lunr       | 20KB | No    | Fast  |
| MiniSearch | 6KB  | Yes   | Fast  |

MiniSearch won: small, fast, and battle-tested (used by VitePress).

### Implementation

```typescript
import MiniSearch from "minisearch";

const searchIndex = new MiniSearch({
  fields: ["name", "description", "type"],
  storeFields: ["name", "slug", "type"],
  searchOptions: {
    fuzzy: 0.2,
    prefix: true,
  },
});

searchIndex.addAll(creatures);

const results = searchIndex.search("fir");
// Returns: Fireball, Fire Elemental, Fire Giant...
```
````

### Performance

Benchmarks on 10,000 items:

- Index build: 45ms (one-time)
- Search: 2-8ms
- Memory: ~2MB

### Conclusion

MiniSearch delivered exactly what we needed. The key was choosing the right tool for the job.
