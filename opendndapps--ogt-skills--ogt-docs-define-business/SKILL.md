# Definition: Pricing Model

## Overview

{Product} uses a freemium pricing model with usage-based scaling.
Free tier provides core functionality with limits. Paid tiers unlock
higher limits and premium features. Enterprise tier offers custom limits
and dedicated support.

## Philosophy

- **Value-first**: Free tier must be genuinely useful, not crippled
- **Clear upgrade path**: Users know exactly what they get by upgrading
- **No surprise charges**: Limits are soft (warnings) before hard (blocks)
- **Fair for all sizes**: Pricing scales with value received

## Pricing Strategy

| Strategy Element | Approach                            |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Model            | Freemium + Usage-based              |
| Anchor           | Pro tier ($X/mo) is the anchor      |
| Free tier goal   | Conversion to Pro within 30 days    |
| Enterprise goal  | Predictable revenue, long contracts |

## Key Decisions

1. **Why freemium?** Lower barrier to entry, viral growth potential
2. **Why usage-based?** Aligns cost with value, fair scaling
3. **Why not per-seat?** Product value is per-project, not per-person

## Success Metrics

- Free → Pro conversion rate: Target X%
- Pro → Enterprise conversion rate: Target Y%
- Monthly churn rate: Target < Z%

# Usage Limits

## Limit Philosophy

- Limits exist to ensure fair usage and system stability
- Soft limits warn users before blocking
- Hard limits block with clear upgrade path
- Limits should feel generous for the tier's target user

## Limit Types

### Soft Limits

User is warned but not blocked. Exceeding triggers:

- In-app notification
- Email warning
- Usage dashboard highlight

### Hard Limits

User is blocked from the action. Exceeding shows:

- Clear error message
- Current usage vs limit
- Upgrade CTA

# Definition: User Types

## Overview

{Product} has distinct user types based on subscription tier and role
within teams. User type determines feature access, limits, and permissions.

## User Type Hierarchy

## User Type Matrix

| ----------------- | ---------- | ------ | ------------------ | ---------- |
| Free User         | Free       | Owner  | Projects (limited) | No         |
| Pro User          | Pro        | Owner  | Projects           | No         |
| Team Admin        | Team       | Admin  | Projects, Members  | Yes        |
| Team Member       | Team       | Editor | Projects           | No         |
| Team Viewer       | Team       | Viewer | Nothing            | No         |
| Enterprise Admin  | Enterprise | Admin  | Everything         | Yes        |
| Enterprise Member | Enterprise | Editor | Projects           | No         |
| Enterprise Viewer | Enterprise | Viewer | Nothing            | No         |

## Key Concepts

### Owner vs Admin vs Member

- **Owner**: Created/purchased the account, billing contact
- **Admin**: Can manage users and settings, may not be owner
- **Member**: Can use features, cannot manage

### Viewer Role

Read-only access for stakeholders who need visibility but not edit access.

# Definition: Revenue Model

## Overview

{Product} generates revenue through a combination of subscription fees
and usage-based charges. Primary revenue comes from Pro and Team
subscriptions with high-value Enterprise contracts providing stability.

## Revenue Philosophy

- **Sustainable**: Revenue must cover costs with margin for growth
- **Aligned**: Revenue grows when customers get more value
- **Predictable**: Subscription base provides predictable MRR
- **Scalable**: Usage-based components scale with customer success

## Revenue Mix Target

| Stream               | % of Revenue | Rationale                |
| -------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------ |
| Pro subscriptions    | 40%          | Volume, predictable      |
| Team subscriptions   | 35%          | Higher ARPU, lower churn |
| Enterprise contracts | 20%          | High value, annual       |
| Usage overage        | 5%           | Aligned with value       |

## Key Metrics

- MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue)
- ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue)
- ARPU (Average Revenue Per User)
- Net Revenue Retention
- Gross Margin

## Related Definitions

# Unit Economics

## Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

### Definition

Total cost to acquire a new paying customer.

### Calculation
```

CAC = (Marketing Spend + Sales Spend) / New Customers Acquired

```

### Targets by Tier
| Tier | Target CAC | Acceptable Range |
|------|------------|------------------|
| Pro | $X | $X-Y |
| Team | $Y | $Y-Z |
| Enterprise | $Z | $Z-W |

### CAC Components
| Component | % of CAC |
|-----------|----------|
| Paid ads | 40% |
| Content marketing | 25% |
| Sales team | 20% |
| Events/conferences | 10% |
| Other | 5% |

---

## Lifetime Value (LTV)

### Definition
Total revenue expected from a customer over their lifetime.

### Calculation
```

LTV = ARPU × Gross Margin × (1 / Churn Rate)

```

### Targets by Tier
| Tier | Target LTV | Calculation |
|------|------------|-------------|
| Pro | $X | $A × B% × (1/C%) |
| Team | $Y | $D × E% × (1/F%) |
| Enterprise | $Z | $G × H% × (1/I%) |

---

## LTV:CAC Ratio

### Target
LTV:CAC > 3:1 (healthy SaaS benchmark)

### Current by Tier
| Tier | LTV | CAC | Ratio | Status |
|------|-----|-----|-------|--------|
| Pro | $X | $Y | X:1 | ✅/⚠️/❌ |
| Team | $X | $Y | X:1 | ✅/⚠️/❌ |
| Enterprise | $X | $Y | X:1 | ✅/⚠️/❌ |

---

## Payback Period

### Definition
Months to recover CAC from a customer.

### Calculation
```

Payback Period = CAC / (ARPU × Gross Margin)

```

### Target
< 12 months for Pro
< 18 months for Team
< 24 months for Enterprise

---

## Gross Margin

### Definition
Revenue minus cost of goods sold (COGS).

### Calculation
```

Gross Margin = (Revenue - COGS) / Revenue × 100

```

### Target
> 80% (typical for SaaS)

### COGS Components
| Component | % of Revenue |
|-----------|--------------|
| Infrastructure | X% |
| Support | Y% |
| Payment processing | Z% |
| Total COGS | X+Y+Z% |
```
