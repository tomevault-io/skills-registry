# OGT Docs - Define Feature

Complete guide for creating feature definition documents with phased delivery.

## Overview

Feature definitions specify WHAT a feature does, WHO it's for, and HOW it will be delivered in phases. Each feature is a folder containing the main definition, MVP scope, phase documents, and completion criteria.

        N[nice_to_have.md<br/>Future ideas]
        O[out_of_scope.md<br/>Explicit exclusions]
    end

## Core Files

### feature.md

The primary feature definition document.

#### Example: global_search/feature.md

```markdown
# Feature: Global Search

## Overview

A universal search interface accessible via Ctrl+K that searches across all
content types (creatures, items, abilities, campaigns, etc.) with fuzzy matching,
instant results, and keyboard navigation.

## Problem Statement

Users currently navigate through multiple menus to find content. There's no way
to quickly search across all content types from anywhere in the application.

## Target Users

- **Primary**: Power users who know what they're looking for
- **Secondary**: New users exploring available content
- **Tertiary**: GMs preparing sessions who need quick access

## User Value

- Find any content in <2 seconds
- Stay in flow without menu navigation
- Discover related content through search

## Success Metrics

| Metric               | Target        | Measurement  |
| -------------------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| Time to find content | <2 seconds    | User testing |
| Search usage         | >50% of users | Analytics    |
| Search success rate  | >80%          | Analytics    |
| User satisfaction    | >4/5          | Survey       |

## Key Capabilities

1. **Universal Access**: Ctrl+K from anywhere opens search
2. **Fuzzy Matching**: "fir" matches "Fireball", "Fire Elemental"
3. **Instant Results**: Results appear as user types
4. **Keyboard Navigation**: Arrow keys, Enter to select
5. **Result Preview**: Hover/focus shows preview
6. **Recent Searches**: Quick access to recent queries
7. **Type Filtering**: Filter by content type

## User Experience

### Happy Path

1. User presses Ctrl+K
2. Search modal appears with cursor in input
3. User types query
4. Results appear instantly, ranked by relevance
5. User navigates with arrow keys
6. User presses Enter to go to selected result
7. Search modal closes, user is at selected content

### Edge Cases

- No results: Show "No results" with suggestions
- Many results: Show top 10 with "See all X results"
- Slow connection: Show loading state, then results
- Error: Show error message with retry option

## Technical Considerations

- Search index must be built at app boot
- Index must update when content changes
- Search must be <16ms for instant feel
- Consider debounce for API if server-side

## Dependencies

- MiniSearch library (or similar)
- Keyboard shortcut system
- Content type registry

## Related Features

- [Content Browsing](../content_browsing/)
- [Quick Actions](../quick_actions/)

## Related Definitions

### mvp.md

Defines MVP scope, which phases are included, and definition of done.

#### Example: global_search/mvp.md

````markdown
# MVP: Global Search

## MVP Philosophy

The MVP must deliver core value to users while being achievable in a reasonable
timeframe. It's better to ship a focused, working feature than a broad, buggy one.

## Phase Inclusion

| Phase    | Included in MVP | Rationale                 |
| -------- | --------------- | ------------------------- |
| Phase 0  | ✅ Yes          | Core functionality        |
| Phase 1  | ✅ Yes          | Essential UX polish       |
| Phase 2  | ❌ No           | Nice-to-have, post-launch |
| Phase 3+ | ❌ No           | Future enhancement        |

### nice_to_have.md

Future ideas that aren't planned for any phase yet.

#### Example: global_search/nice_to_have.md

```markdown
# Nice to Have: Global Search

Ideas for future enhancement, not currently planned for any phase.

## Ideas

### AI-Powered Search

Natural language queries like "show me fire spells for a level 5 wizard"

**Value**: Powerful for complex queries
**Effort**: High (requires AI integration)
**Priority**: Low (nice to have, not essential)

### Saved Searches

Save frequently used searches with custom names

**Value**: Power user productivity
**Effort**: Medium
**Priority**: Low

### Search Analytics Dashboard

Admin view of what users search for, failed searches

**Value**: Product insights
**Effort**: Medium
**Priority**: Medium (useful for product)

### Voice Search

"Hey app, search for dragons"

**Value**: Accessibility, hands-free
**Effort**: High
**Priority**: Low

### Search in Results

Ctrl+F style search within search results

**Value**: Large result sets
**Effort**: Low
**Priority**: Low

### Fuzzy Command Palette

Search for actions, not just content ("create campaign", "export data")

**Value**: Power users, keyboard-first
**Effort**: High
**Priority**: Medium

## Evaluation Criteria

When considering moving items to a phase:

1. User demand (support requests, feedback)
2. Competitive pressure (competitors have it)
3. Technical feasibility (dependencies ready)
4. Strategic alignment (company priorities)
```

---

### out_of_scope.md

Explicit exclusions to prevent scope creep.

#### Example: global_search/out_of_scope.md

```markdown
# Out of Scope: Global Search

Explicit exclusions from this feature. These will NOT be implemented as part
of Global Search.

## Permanently Out of Scope

### Server-Side Search

**What**: Search queries sent to backend
**Why excluded**:

- Adds latency
- Requires backend work
- Client-side is sufficient for our data size
  **Alternative**: May revisit if data exceeds client-side limits

### Search Within Documents

**What**: Full-text search inside document content
**Why excluded**:

- Significantly more complex
- Different use case (research vs navigation)
- Would require different index structure
  **Alternative**: Separate "Document Search" feature if needed

### Search Across Accounts

**What**: Search other users' public content
**Why excluded**:

- Privacy implications
- Requires backend
- Different product direction
  **Alternative**: Separate "Community Search" feature if ever needed

### Boolean Operators

**What**: AND, OR, NOT query syntax
**Why excluded**:

- Power user feature with low usage
- Complicates UX for most users
- Fuzzy search covers most cases
  **Alternative**: Type filters provide similar functionality

## Temporarily Out of Scope

### Mobile-Optimized Search

**What**: Search UI optimized for mobile
**Why excluded (for now)**:

- Desktop is primary platform currently
- Mobile requires different UX patterns
  **When to reconsider**: Mobile user base >20%

### Real-Time Index Updates

**What**: Index updates as other users create content
**Why excluded (for now)**:

- Single-user focus currently
- Requires websocket infrastructure
  **When to reconsider**: Multi-user collaboration features

## How to Handle Requests

When someone requests an out-of-scope item:

1. Point to this document
2. Explain the rationale
3. If compelling counter-argument, create a proposal
4. Don't implement without explicit scope change approval
```

---

### dependencies.md

Technical dependencies for the feature.

#### Example: global_search/dependencies.md

````markdown
# Dependencies: Global Search

## External Dependencies

### MiniSearch Library

- **What**: Client-side full-text search
- **Version**: ^6.0.0
- **Install**: `npm install minisearch`
- **Size**: ~6KB gzipped
- **License**: MIT
- **Why chosen**: Small, fast, fuzzy matching, used by VitePress

### No Other External Dependencies

Global Search intentionally has minimal external dependencies.

## Internal Dependencies

### Content Services

Search requires access to all content for indexing.

| Service         | Required Method | Purpose                   |
| --------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- |
| CreatureService | `getAll()`      | Index creatures           |
| ItemService     | `getAll()`      | Index items               |
| AbilityService  | `getAll()`      | Index abilities           |
| CampaignService | `getAll()`      | Index campaigns (Phase 2) |

### Router

Navigation after selection requires router access.

| Service | Required Method  | Purpose      |
| ------- | ---------------- | ------------ |
| Router  | `navigate(path)` | Go to result |

### Keyboard Shortcuts

Global shortcut registration.

| Service         | Required Method            | Purpose        |
| --------------- | -------------------------- | -------------- |
| KeyboardService | `register(combo, handler)` | Ctrl+K binding |

## Infrastructure Dependencies

### Local Storage (Phase 2)

Recent searches stored in localStorage.

### No Backend Dependencies

Search is entirely client-side.

## Dependency Verification

Before starting implementation, verify:

```bash
# Check MiniSearch is installed
grep "minisearch" package.json

# Check content services have getAll methods
grep -r "getAll" front/services/*.ts

# Check router is available
grep "useRouter" front/hooks/*.ts
```

### Step 1: Gather Information

Ask clarifying questions:

1. **What problem does this solve?**
2. **Who is the primary user?**
3. **What does success look like?**
4. **What's the simplest version that provides value?**
5. **What should we explicitly NOT do?**
6. **What are the technical constraints?**
7. **What's the timeline expectation?**

### Step 2: Create Feature Folder

```bash
mkdir -p docs/definitions/features/{feature_slug}
```

### Step 3: Write Core Documents

1. `feature.md` - Full feature definition
2. `mvp.md` - MVP scope and Definition of Done
3. `phase_0.md` - Foundation phase
4. `out_of_scope.md` - Explicit exclusions

### Step 4: Add Signals

```bash
echo '{"schema": "1.0", "created": "'$(date -Iseconds)'"}' > .version
touch .draft
```

### Step 5: Request Review

```bash
rm .draft
touch .ready_for_review
```

### Step 6: After Approval

```bash
rm .ready_for_review
touch .approved
touch .approved_by_product
```
