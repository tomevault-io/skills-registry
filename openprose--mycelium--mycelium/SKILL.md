# Mycelium

Structured notes attached to git objects via `refs/notes/mycelium`.

**Before working on a file, check for its note. After meaningful work, leave a note.**

That’s the whole contract. Mycelium is the storage layer. Richer arrival / history workflows can live in skill scripts.

## On arrival

Start every session with:

```bash
mycelium.sh find constraint                 # project principles & rules
mycelium.sh find warning                    # known fragile things
scripts/context-workflow.sh <file>          # recommended arrival workflow (repo checkout)
```

If you only have the runtime file and not this repo checkout, do the same workflow manually:

```bash
mycelium.sh read <file>                     # exact note on current object
mycelium.sh read HEAD                       # current commit note
# plus raw git notes show on parent dirs / root as needed
```

Before leaving:

```bash
mycelium.sh note HEAD -k context -m "What I did and why."
mycelium.sh note <changed-file> -k <kind> -m "What future agents should know."
```

If you made a decision, use `kind decision` and add a `tested-by` edge to the test that validates it. If you found something fragile, use `kind warning`.

## Core commands

Use these as the protocol-ish primitives:

```bash
mycelium.sh note [target] -k <kind> -m <body>   # write
mycelium.sh read [target]                        # read exact note on current object
mycelium.sh follow [target]                      # read + resolve edges
mycelium.sh refs [target]                        # inbound references
mycelium.sh find <kind>                          # search by kind
mycelium.sh kinds                                # vocabulary in use
mycelium.sh list                                 # all annotated objects
mycelium.sh branch [use|merge] [name]            # branch-scoped notes
mycelium.sh doctor                               # graph facts
mycelium.sh dump                                 # everything, greppable
```

## Workflow scripts in this repo

These are recommended workflows, not part of the core CLI:

```bash
scripts/context-workflow.sh <path> [ref]                    # current file + parent dirs + current commit
scripts/path-history.sh <path> [ref]                        # older file notes via git history
scripts/note-history.sh <target>                            # note overwrite history via notes ref
scripts/compost-workflow.sh [path|oid] [--compost|--renew]  # explicit stale/renew workflow
```

Use them when you want richer context, but keep in mind they are recipes built on top of git + mycelium primitives.

Rule of thumb:
- `context-workflow.sh` = default arrival workflow for a path
- `path-history.sh` = explicit historical notes for a file
- `note-history.sh` = overwrite history for one note target
- `compost-workflow.sh` = opt-in stale/renew lifecycle for repos that still want it

If a repo still wants an explicit stale/renew lifecycle, use `scripts/compost-workflow.sh`. The simpler default is to use git-native history first and write a fresh current note when older context still matters.

## Patterns

Three patterns cover most usage.

### Pattern 1: One ref accumulates many notes

A file can collect notes from different agents over time.

```bash
mycelium.sh note src/auth.ts -k summary -m "Handles OAuth2 refresh flow."
mycelium.sh note src/auth.ts -k warning -m "Token refresh has a race condition."
mycelium.sh refs src/auth.ts
```

When you need older notes on that file, use git history rather than a special core lifecycle command:

```bash
scripts/path-history.sh src/auth.ts
```

### Pattern 2: One note connects many refs

A single note can link to multiple objects via edges.

```bash
mycelium.sh note SKILL.md -k decision -t "Packaged as an agent skill" \
  -e "depends-on blob:$(git rev-parse HEAD:README.md)" \
  -m "The skill teaches agents the convention on-demand."

mycelium.sh follow SKILL.md
```

Use this whenever a note’s meaning involves more than one object.

### Pattern 3: Planning graph

Use `depends-on` edges to structure planned work.

```bash
mycelium.sh note src/auth.ts -k context -t "Planned: fix race condition" \
  -m "Need mutex around token refresh. See warning note."

mycelium.sh note src/http.ts -k context -t "Planned: retry after refresh" \
  -m "HTTP client should retry once after auth refresh."

mycelium.sh note HEAD -k context -t "Plan: auth hardening" \
  -e "depends-on blob:$(git rev-parse HEAD:src/auth.ts)" \
  -e "depends-on blob:$(git rev-parse HEAD:src/http.ts)" \
  -m "Two files need coordinated changes."
```

## Check for notes

```bash
mycelium.sh read path/to/file.ts              # exact note on current object
mycelium.sh follow HEAD                       # note + where its edges lead
mycelium.sh refs path/to/file.ts              # all notes pointing at target
mycelium.sh find decision                     # all decisions
mycelium.sh find constraint                   # all constraints
git log --notes=mycelium --oneline -20        # recent commits with notes
```

Or with raw git:

```bash
git notes --ref=mycelium show $(git rev-parse HEAD:path/to/file.ts) 2>/dev/null
git notes --ref=mycelium show HEAD 2>/dev/null
```

## Leave notes

```bash
mycelium.sh note -k context -m "Why I did this."                     # HEAD
mycelium.sh note path/to/file.ts -k summary -m "What this does."     # file
mycelium.sh note src/auth/ -k constraint -m "Must be retryable."     # directory
mycelium.sh note . -k value -m "Project-level principle."            # project
mycelium.sh note -k decision -t "Use YAML" -m "Needs comments."     # decision
```

### Target stability

Every target has different stability.

| Target | Stable? | Use when |
|--------|---------|----------|
| `path/to/file` | ✓ findable by path even if file changes | Note is about the file |
| `$(git rev-parse HEAD:file)` | pinned to this exact blob OID | Note is about this specific version |
| `.` | ✓ project-level, always findable | Note applies to the whole repo |
| `HEAD` | pinned to commit OID (jj: survives via change_id) | Note is about this change |
| `src/dir/` | ✓ findable by path | Note is about the module |

**Default: use paths.** Most notes are about files, not specific versions. The path edge keeps them findable. Use raw OIDs only when you mean “this exact content.”

## Note format

```text
kind decision
title Short label
edge explains commit:abc123...
edge targets-path path:src/auth/retry.ts

Free-form body. Markdown encouraged.
```

**Headers**: `kind` (required), `edge`, `title`, `status`

**Kinds**: `decision` · `context` · `summary` · `warning` · `constraint` · `observation` · `value` · `todo` — or invent your own.

**Edge types**: `explains` · `applies-to` · `depends-on` · `warns-about` · `targets-path` · `targets-treepath` — or invent your own.

**Targets**: `commit:<oid>` · `blob:<oid>` · `tree:<oid>` · `path:<filepath>` · `note:<oid>`

## Note history

There is no special `supersedes` chain in the note body. Overwrite history lives in git itself on the notes ref.

```bash
scripts/note-history.sh path/to/file.ts
```

Or raw git:

```bash
OID=$(git rev-parse HEAD:path/to/file.ts)
FANOUT="${OID:0:2}/${OID:2}"
git log -p refs/notes/mycelium -- "$FANOUT"
```

## Historical notes for a file

If you want older notes on a file path, use git history:

```bash
scripts/path-history.sh src/auth.ts
```

If an older note still matters, write a fresh current note that carries forward the relevant insight.

## Slots

Multiple tools or agents can write notes on the same object without obliteration. Each slot is a named lane backed by its own notes ref.

```bash
mycelium.sh note src/auth.ts --slot skeleton -k observation -m "Structure."
mycelium.sh note src/auth.ts --slot enricher -k summary -m "Context."
mycelium.sh read src/auth.ts --slot skeleton
```

**Rules:**
- `read` / `follow` use the default slot unless `--slot` is given
- `find` / `kinds` / `doctor` / `prime` aggregate all slots
- Reserved names: `main`, `default`

## Setup (once per clone)

```bash
mycelium.sh activate        # notes visible in git log
mycelium.sh sync-init       # notes travel with fetch/push
mycelium.sh repo-id init    # durable repo identity
mycelium.sh zone init       # confidentiality zone
mycelium.sh export f -a internal
mycelium.sh export --all --audience internal      # batch export all notes
mycelium.sh export --all --kind decision -a public # batch export by kind
mycelium.sh import remote --as lib
mycelium.sh list-imports                          # show imported repos
```

## jj+git colocated repos

If `.jj/` is detected, mycelium adapts automatically — no flags needed. Commit notes get a `targets-change` edge (stable across jj rewrites). `read` falls back to change_id lookup when the commit OID changes. Prefer notes on files over commits — blob OIDs survive rewrites, commit OIDs don’t.

When jj rewrites commits (amend, rebase, squash), notes on old OIDs become orphaned. Use `migrate` to bulk-reattach them:

```bash
mycelium.sh migrate --dry-run
mycelium.sh migrate
mycelium.sh migrate --map mapping.txt
```

Run `mycelium.sh help` for jj-specific guidance.
