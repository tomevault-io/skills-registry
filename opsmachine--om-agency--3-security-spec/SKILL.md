# Phase 3: TDD Specification

## What this phase does
Write a failing test that proves the top vulnerability exists. This is the red phase — do not touch the application code.

## Instructions

1. **Read** `SECURITY_PLAN.md`. Pick the top `Pending` (not `DONE`) item from the ranked backlog.

2. **Write a test** that reproduces the vulnerability.
   - Create a new test file (e.g. `tests/security/exploit_repro.test.ts`)
   - The test should FAIL right now — it's proving the vulnerability exists
   - **Do NOT fix the code.** That's Phase 4.

3. **Run the test.** Confirm it fails for the right reason (the vulnerability, not a syntax error).

4. **Stop.** Report the test file path and what it proves.

The next step is Phase 4: `/4-security-fix`
