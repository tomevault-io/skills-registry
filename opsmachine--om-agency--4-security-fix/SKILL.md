# Phase 4: Implementation & Verification

## What this phase does
Fix the vulnerability. Make the failing test pass. Mark the item done.

## Instructions

1. **Read** the failing test from Phase 3.

2. **Fix** the application code to address the vulnerability.
   - Run the test after each change
   - Iterate until it passes
   - Verify no other tests regressed

3. **Mark done.** Update `SECURITY_PLAN.md` — set this item's status to `DONE`.

> **End-of-skill check:** See `shared/primitive-updates.md`. Signals: architectural constraints, code that must not be refactored.

4. **Stop.** Report what was fixed.

If there are more `Pending` items in the backlog, loop back to Phase 3: `/3-security-spec`
Otherwise, the security audit is complete.
