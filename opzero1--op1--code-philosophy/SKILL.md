# The 5 Laws of Elegant Defense

**Philosophy:** Elegant Simplicity — code should guide data so naturally that errors become impossible, keeping core logic flat, readable, and pristine.

---

## Law 1: Early Exit (Guard Clauses)

**Concept:** Indentation is the enemy of simplicity. Deep nesting hides bugs.

**Rule:** Handle missing required inputs, explicitly optional or undefined values, and errors at the very top of functions. Prefer `undefined` over `null` for absence unless an existing API or schema already uses `null`. Do not invent empty-input branches unless the contract explicitly allows empty input.

**Practice:**
```typescript
// ✅ GOOD: Guard clause
if (!valid) return
doWork()

// ❌ BAD: Nested
if (valid) {
  doWork()
}
```

---

## Law 2: Make Illegal States Unrepresentable (Parse, Don't Validate)

**Concept:** Don't check data repeatedly; structure it so it can't be wrong.

**Rule:** Parse inputs at the boundary. Once data enters internal logic, it must be in trusted, typed state.

**Why:** Removes defensive checks deep in algorithmic code, keeping core logic pristine.

```typescript
// ✅ GOOD: Parse at boundary, trusted internally
const user = parseUser(rawInput) // throws if invalid
processUser(user) // user is guaranteed valid

// ❌ BAD: Validate everywhere
function processUser(data: unknown) {
  if (!data.name) throw new Error(...)
  if (!data.email) throw new Error(...)
  // repeated everywhere
}
```

---

## Law 3: Atomic Predictability

**Concept:** A function must never surprise the caller.

**Rule:** Functions should be "Pure" where possible. Same Input = Same Output. No hidden mutations.

**Defense:** Avoid `void` functions that mutate global state. Return new data structures instead.

```typescript
// ✅ GOOD: Pure, predictable
function addItem(list: Item[], item: Item): Item[] {
  return [...list, item]
}

// ❌ BAD: Mutates, surprises caller
function addItem(list: Item[], item: Item): void {
  list.push(item) // mutates input!
}
```

---

## Law 4: Fail Fast, Fail Loud

**Concept:** Silent failures cause complexity later.

**Rule:** If required state is missing or the contract is violated, halt immediately with a descriptive error. Do not patch bad data with silent fallbacks.

**Result:** Keeps logic simple by never accounting for "half-broken" states.

**Default:** Prefer fail-fast errors to fallback paths. Add a fallback only when preserving existing behavior or honoring an explicitly optional contract.

```typescript
// ✅ GOOD: Fail immediately
if (!config.apiKey) {
  throw new Error("API key is required. Set OPENCODE_API_KEY environment variable.")
}

// ❌ BAD: Silent failure, undefined behavior
const apiKey = config.apiKey || "" // empty string will cause cryptic errors later
```

---

## Law 5: Intentional Naming

**Concept:** Comments are often a crutch for bad code.

**Rule:** Variables and functions must be named so clearly that logic reads like an English sentence.

**Defense:** `isUserEligible` is better than `check()`. The name itself guarantees the boolean logic.

```typescript
// ✅ GOOD: Self-documenting
const isUserEligibleForDiscount = user.purchaseCount > 5 && user.accountAge > 30

// ❌ BAD: Needs comment to understand
const flag = u.c > 5 && u.a > 30 // check if eligible
```

## Adherence Checklist

Before completing your task, verify:

- [ ] **Guard Clauses:** Are all edge cases handled at the top with early returns?
- [ ] **Parsed State:** Is data parsed into trusted types at the boundary?
- [ ] **Purity:** Are functions predictable and free of hidden mutations?
- [ ] **Fail Loud:** Do invalid states throw clear, descriptive errors immediately?
- [ ] **Readability:** Does the logic read like an English sentence?
