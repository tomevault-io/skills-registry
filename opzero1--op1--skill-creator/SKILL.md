# Skill Creator

This skill provides guidance for creating effective skills.

## About Skills

Skills are modular, self-contained packages that extend agent capabilities by providing specialized knowledge, workflows, and tools. Think of them as "onboarding guides" for specific domains or tasks—they transform a general-purpose agent into a specialized agent equipped with procedural knowledge that no model can fully possess.

### What Skills Provide

1. Specialized workflows - Multi-step procedures for specific domains
2. Tool integrations - Instructions for working with specific file formats or APIs
3. Domain expertise - Company-specific knowledge, schemas, business logic
4. Bundled resources - Scripts, references, and assets for complex and repetitive tasks

## Core Principles

### Concise is Key

The context window is a public good. Skills share the context window with everything else: system prompt, conversation history, other Skills' metadata, and the actual user request.

**Default assumption: The agent is already very smart.** Only add context it doesn't already have. Challenge each piece of information: "Does it really need this explanation?" and "Does this paragraph justify its token cost?"

Prefer concise examples over verbose explanations.

### Set Appropriate Degrees of Freedom

Match the level of specificity to the task's fragility and variability:

**High freedom (text-based instructions)**: Use when multiple approaches are valid, decisions depend on context, or heuristics guide the approach.

**Medium freedom (pseudocode or scripts with parameters)**: Use when a preferred pattern exists, some variation is acceptable, or configuration affects behavior.

**Low freedom (specific scripts, few parameters)**: Use when operations are fragile and error-prone, consistency is critical, or a specific sequence must be followed.

Think of the agent as exploring a path: a narrow bridge with cliffs needs specific guardrails (low freedom), while an open field allows many routes (high freedom).

### Anatomy of a Skill

Every skill consists of a required SKILL.md file and optional bundled resources:

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md (required)
│   ├── YAML frontmatter metadata (required)
│   │   ├── name: (required)
│   │   └── description: (required)
│   └── Markdown instructions (required)
└── Bundled Resources (optional)
    ├── scripts/          - Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.)
    ├── references/       - Documentation loaded into context as needed
    └── assets/           - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts, etc.)
```

#### SKILL.md (required)

Every SKILL.md consists of:

- **Frontmatter** (YAML): Contains `name` and `description` fields. These are the only fields the agent reads to determine when the skill gets used—be clear and comprehensive in describing what the skill is and when it should be used.
- **Body** (Markdown): Instructions and guidance for using the skill. Only loaded AFTER the skill triggers.

#### Bundled Resources (optional)

##### Scripts (`scripts/`)

Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.) for tasks that require deterministic reliability or are repeatedly rewritten.

- **When to include**: When the same code is being rewritten repeatedly or deterministic reliability is needed
- **Example**: `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` for PDF rotation tasks
- **Benefits**: Token efficient, deterministic, may be executed without loading into context

##### References (`references/`)

Documentation and reference material intended to be loaded as needed into context.

- **When to include**: For documentation the agent should reference while working
- **Examples**: `references/finance.md` for financial schemas, `references/api_docs.md` for API specifications
- **Use cases**: Database schemas, API documentation, domain knowledge, company policies
- **Benefits**: Keeps SKILL.md lean, loaded only when needed
- **Best practice**: If files are large (>10k words), include grep search patterns in SKILL.md

##### Assets (`assets/`)

Files not intended to be loaded into context, but used within the output produced.

- **When to include**: When the skill needs files that will be used in the final output
- **Examples**: `assets/logo.png` for brand assets, `assets/template.pptx` for PowerPoint templates
- **Use cases**: Templates, images, icons, boilerplate code, fonts, sample documents

#### What to Not Include

A skill should only contain essential files that directly support its functionality. Do NOT create extraneous documentation:

- README.md
- INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md
- QUICK_REFERENCE.md
- CHANGELOG.md

The skill should only contain information needed for an AI agent to do the job at hand.

### Progressive Disclosure Design Principle

Skills use a three-level loading system to manage context efficiently:

1. **Metadata (name + description)** - Always in context (~100 words)
2. **SKILL.md body** - When skill triggers (<5k words)
3. **Bundled resources** - As needed (unlimited because scripts can be executed without reading)

Keep SKILL.md body to the essentials and under 500 lines. Split content into separate files when approaching this limit.

**Key principle:** When a skill supports multiple variations, frameworks, or options, keep only the core workflow and selection guidance in SKILL.md. Move variant-specific details into separate reference files.

## Skill Creation Process

### Step 1: Understanding with Concrete Examples

To create an effective skill, clearly understand concrete examples of how the skill will be used. Ask:

- "What functionality should the skill support?"
- "Can you give examples of how this skill would be used?"
- "What would a user say that should trigger this skill?"

### Step 2: Planning Reusable Contents

Analyze each example by:

1. Considering how to execute the example from scratch
2. Identifying what scripts, references, and assets would be helpful

Example: When building a `pdf-editor` skill to handle "Help me rotate this PDF," a `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` script would be helpful.

Example: When building a `frontend-webapp-builder` skill, an `assets/hello-world/` template containing boilerplate HTML/React would be helpful.

### Step 3: Initializing the Skill

Create the skill directory structure:

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md
├── scripts/      (if needed)
├── references/   (if needed)
└── assets/       (if needed)
```

### Step 4: Edit the Skill

Remember the skill is being created for another agent to use. Include information that would be beneficial and non-obvious.

#### Frontmatter

Write YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`:

- `name`: The skill name
- `description`: Primary triggering mechanism. Include:
  - What the Skill does
  - Specific triggers/contexts for when to use it
  - All "when to use" information (the body is only loaded after triggering)

Example description for a `docx` skill:
> Comprehensive document creation, editing, and analysis with support for tracked changes, comments, formatting preservation, and text extraction. Use when working with professional documents (.docx files) for: (1) Creating new documents, (2) Modifying or editing content, (3) Working with tracked changes, (4) Adding comments.

#### Body

Write instructions for using the skill and its bundled resources. Use imperative/infinitive form.

### Step 5: Validate and Test

Test the skill on real tasks:

1. Use the skill on real tasks
2. Notice struggles or inefficiencies
3. Identify how SKILL.md or bundled resources should be updated
4. Implement changes and test again

## Progressive Disclosure Patterns

**Pattern 1: High-level guide with references**

```markdown
# PDF Processing

## Quick start
Extract text with pdfplumber:
[code example]

## Advanced features
- **Form filling**: See references/forms.md
- **API reference**: See references/api.md
```

**Pattern 2: Domain-specific organization**

```
bigquery-skill/
├── SKILL.md (overview and navigation)
└── references/
    ├── finance.md (revenue, billing metrics)
    ├── sales.md (opportunities, pipeline)
    └── product.md (API usage, features)
```

When a user asks about sales metrics, only load sales.md.

**Pattern 3: Framework variants**

```
cloud-deploy/
├── SKILL.md (workflow + provider selection)
└── references/
    ├── aws.md (AWS deployment patterns)
    ├── gcp.md (GCP deployment patterns)
    └── azure.md (Azure deployment patterns)
```

When the user chooses AWS, only read aws.md.

## Guidelines

- **Avoid deeply nested references** - Keep references one level deep from SKILL.md
- **Structure longer reference files** - For files longer than 100 lines, include a table of contents
- **Test scripts** - Added scripts must be tested by actually running them
- **Delete unused examples** - Remove example files not needed for the skill
