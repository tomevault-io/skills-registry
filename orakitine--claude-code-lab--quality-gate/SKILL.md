# Purpose

Run comprehensive Quality Gate checks to verify code quality before committing. Uses parallel agent swarm execution for blazing-fast results. Non-destructive analysis only - reports issues without auto-fixing. Includes linting, formatting, type safety, tests, build verification, and security checks.

## Variables

ENABLE_JAVASCRIPT: true           # Enable JavaScript/TypeScript quality checks
ENABLE_PYTHON: true               # Enable Python quality checks
ENABLE_SECURITY_CHECK: true       # Enable security vulnerability scanning
ENABLE_PARALLEL_EXECUTION: true   # Use parallel agent swarm for faster execution
SUPPORTED_PROJECT_TYPES: javascript, typescript, python  # Currently supported project types

## Workflow

1. **Parse User Request**
   - Identify quality check intent
   - User triggers: "run quality gate", "quality check", "check quality before commit", "verify code quality"
   - Example: "run quality gate" → Intent: comprehensive quality checks

2. **Detect Project Type**
   - Check for indicator files: package.json (JS/TS), requirements.txt/pyproject.toml (Python)
   - Determines which cookbook workflow to use
   - Example: package.json found → JavaScript/TypeScript project

3. **Route to Cookbook**
   - Based on detected type and ENABLE flags
   - JavaScript/TypeScript: IF package.json AND ENABLE_JAVASCRIPT → javascript.md
   - Python: IF requirements.txt/pyproject.toml AND ENABLE_PYTHON → python.md
   - Generic: IF no match → Run basic checks available in project
   - Example: TypeScript project + ENABLE_JAVASCRIPT=true → Route to cookbook/javascript.md

4. **Execute Quality Checks**
   - IF: ENABLE_PARALLEL_EXECUTION is true → Launch parallel agent swarm for all checks
   - Run all check phases defined in cookbook (linting, formatting, type checking, tests, build, security)
   - Tool: Task with run_in_background: true for each independent check
   - IMPORTANT: Non-destructive - only report issues, never auto-fix
   - Continue on failure - run all phases even if some fail (get complete picture)
   - Example: Launch 6 parallel agents (Linter, Formatter, TypeChecker, Tester, Builder, Security) → All complete in ~15s vs ~60s sequential

5. **Generate Report**
   - IF parallel execution used → Collect all agent results using TaskOutput
   - Compile results from all phases
   - Include: specific file paths, line numbers when possible, error messages, actionable fix commands, performance comparison
   - Format: Clear sections per phase (✓ passed, ✗ failed), summary at end, execution time
   - Example: "Linting: ✗ 5 errors in src/utils.ts:23 - Run 'npm run lint:fix' | Performance: 75% faster (15s vs 60s)"

## Cookbook

### JavaScript/TypeScript Projects

- IF: The project has a `package.json` file AND `ENABLE_JAVASCRIPT` is true.
- THEN: Read and execute: `.claude/skills/quality-gate/cookbook/javascript.md`
- EXAMPLES:
  - "run quality gate"
  - "quality check"
  - "check quality before commit"
  - "run all checks"

### Python Projects

- IF: The project has `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` AND `ENABLE_PYTHON` is true.
- THEN: Read and execute: `.claude/skills/quality-gate/cookbook/python.md`
- EXAMPLES:
  - "run quality gate"
  - "quality check"
  - "verify code quality"

### Generic Projects

- IF: No specific project type detected.
- THEN: Run basic checks available in the project and report.
- EXAMPLES:
  - "run quality gate"
  - "check what we can"
