# Tutorial Documentation Skill

This skill provides guidelines for creating **tutorial** documentation - learning-oriented content in the Diataxis framework.

## Purpose

Tutorials help users **learn** by guiding them through a series of steps. The user follows along to gain knowledge and skills.

## User Need

> "I want to learn how to use this."

## Characteristics

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Orientation** | Learning |
| **Focus** | Study, not work |
| **Goal** | Help user acquire skills |
| **Tone** | Encouraging, supportive |

## Target Directory

Place tutorials in: `docs/getting-started/`

## Writing Guidelines

### DO

- Focus on learning, not accomplishing a practical task
- Ensure the tutorial works every time the user follows it
- Show concrete steps, not abstract concepts
- Get the user to a meaningful achievement quickly
- Provide only enough explanation to proceed
- Use consistent formatting and structure
- Test the tutorial yourself before publishing

### DON'T

- Assume prior knowledge (explain everything needed)
- Offer choices or alternatives (provide one clear path)
- Explain concepts in depth (link to explanations instead)
- Include troubleshooting (the tutorial should just work)
- Cover edge cases (keep the happy path)

## Examples of Good Tutorials

- "Getting started with [Project]"
- "Your first [Feature]"
- "Building a [Simple Thing] in 10 minutes"
- "Introduction to [Concept] with hands-on exercises"

## Template

Use this template when creating tutorial documentation:

```markdown
# [Tutorial Title]

*Estimated time: [X minutes]*
