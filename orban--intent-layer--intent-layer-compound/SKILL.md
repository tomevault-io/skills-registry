# Compound Learning Skill

> **TL;DR**: Capture and triage learnings at the end of a work session. Runs conversation analysis, surfaces candidates, and integrates with proper scope routing.

---

## When to Use

Run `/intent-layer-compound` after:
- Completing a feature or bug fix
- Finishing any significant work session
- Discovering non-obvious behaviors or gotchas
- When you want to capture learnings before ending the session

---

## Three-Layer Workflow

### Layer 1: AI Conversation Scan

Before prompting for manual capture, analyze the conversation for learning signals.

**Scan for these patterns:**

| Pattern | Example Phrases | Learning Type |
|---------|-----------------|---------------|
| User corrections | "actually...", "no, you should...", "that's wrong" | pitfall |
| Discoveries | "interesting...", "I didn't know...", "turns out..." | insight |
| Better approaches | "a better way is...", "instead, try..." | pattern |
| Unexpected behaviors | "but it returned...", "weird, it..." | pitfall |
| Missing checks | "should have verified...", "forgot to check..." | check |

**For each candidate found:**
1. Extract the relevant conversation snippet
2. Identify the learning type
3. Determine affected directory (if identifiable from context)
4. Present to user for confirmation

**Example output:**
```
Found 3 potential learnings in this conversation:

1. [pitfall] User corrected assumption about API response format
   Context: "Actually, the API returns a list when there are multiple results..."
   Affected: src/api/

2. [insight] Discovery about caching behavior
   Context: "Turns out the cache invalidates on every deploy..."
   Affected: (workflow-level)

3. [check] Missing verification identified
   Context: "Should have verified the schema before migration..."
   Affected: src/db/
```

### Layer 2: Structured Prompts

After AI-surfaced candidates are reviewed, prompt for additional learnings:

**Prompt sequence:**
1. "Were there any corrections you made to my assumptions?"
2. "Did we discover any unexpected behaviors?"
3. "Are there any better approaches we figured out?"
4. "Any checks that would have helped if done earlier?"

For each "yes" response:
- Use the scan prompt from `prompts/scan.md` to extract details
- Capture via the existing `capture_mistake.sh` with pre-filled fields
- Assign appropriate learning type

### Layer 3: Direct Integration

After candidates are confirmed, integrate each one directly using `learn.sh`:

For each confirmed candidate:
```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/learn.sh \
  --project [PROJECT_PATH] \
  --path [AFFECTED_PATH] \
  --type [pitfall|check|pattern|insight] \
  --title "[TITLE]" \
  --detail "[DETAIL]"
```

`learn.sh` handles deduplication automatically — if the learning already exists (≥60% word overlap), it exits with code 2 and reports "duplicate skipped".

**Report outcomes to the user:**
- Exit 0: "✓ Integrated into [AGENTS.md path]"
- Exit 2: "⊘ Duplicate skipped (already documented)"
- Exit 1: "✗ Error: [message]"

**Show summary** of what was integrated and where when all candidates are processed.

## Resources

### Scripts Used

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `learn.sh` | Direct-write learning to AGENTS.md (dedup-gated) |
| `capture_mistake.sh` | Create learning report for pending queue (swarm use) |

### Prompts

| Prompt | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `prompts/scan.md` | Conversation analysis for learning signals |

## Quick Start

```
/intent-layer-compound
```

Or with explicit project path:
```
/intent-layer-compound /path/to/project
```

## Example Session

```
$ /intent-layer-compound

=== Intent Layer Compound Learning ===

[Layer 1: Conversation Scan]
Analyzing conversation for potential learnings...

Found 2 potential learnings:

1. [pitfall] API response format varies
   "Actually, the API can return either a dict or a list..."
   Path: src/api/

   Is this worth documenting? [y/n/edit]: y

2. [insight] Deploy triggers cache invalidation
   "Turns out the cache clears on every deploy..."
   Path: (workflow-level)

   Is this worth documenting? [y/n/edit]: y

[Layer 2: Additional Prompts]
Any other corrections you made to my assumptions? [y/n]: n
Any unexpected behaviors discovered? [y/n]: n
Any better approaches figured out? [y/n]: n

[Layer 3: Direct Integration]
Integrating 2 confirmed learnings...

1. ✓ pitfall added to ## Pitfalls in src/api/AGENTS.md
2. ✓ insight added to ## Context in CLAUDE.md

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Summary
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  Integrated: 2
  Duplicates: 0
  Errors:     0

Compound learning complete!

## Scope Routing

The compound skill routes learnings to the appropriate location:

```
Learning captured
       │
       └─── Is it workflow-level? (insight, cross-cutting)
                    │
          ┌────────┴────────┐
          │                 │
         Yes                No
          │                 │
          ▼                 ▼
    Root CLAUDE.md    Covering AGENTS.md
    (global scope)    (local scope)
```

### Global Scope (Root CLAUDE.md)

Use for:
- Workflow insights (build process, deployment, testing)
- Cross-cutting patterns that apply everywhere
- Project-wide conventions and decisions
- Learnings that don't belong to any specific directory

### Local Scope (Covering AGENTS.md)

Use for:
- Code-specific pitfalls
- API behavior quirks
- Module-specific patterns
- Checks for particular operations

---

## Integration with Hooks

The compound skill works with the existing learning loop hooks:

- **PostToolUseFailure**: Auto-captures failures → pending/
- **Stop hook**: Prompts for learnings if configured
- **/intent-layer-compound**: End-of-session synthesis

Run `/intent-layer-compound` to process any auto-captured learnings alongside manual capture.
