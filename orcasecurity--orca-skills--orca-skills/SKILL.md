# Cloud Cost Optimizer

Answers the question: **"Where are we overspending and what should we fix first?"**

Analyzes all cloud assets via Orca Security MCP data to identify actionable cost reduction opportunities across compute, databases, storage, networking, and serverless resources. Delivers a dual-audience report: executive summary with total savings range, and per-asset action plan with specific IDs, Orca links, console links, CLI commands, and projected monthly savings.

**The key rule: never generalize.** "You have some oversized instances" is useless. "Your `db-prod-us-east-1` RDS instance is a `db.r5.4xlarge` ($1,752/month) and could be `db.r5.2xlarge` ($876/month)" is what this report delivers.

## Usage

```
/orca-cloud-cost-optimizer
```

Or natural language:
- "give me a cost optimization report"
- "where are we wasting money on cloud?"
- "how do we cut our AWS bill?"
- "find unused resources"
- "what can we rightsize?"

---

## Phase 1: Asset Discovery

Use `mcp__orca-security__discovery_search` to enumerate assets. Run these searches **in parallel** to save time.

### Compute
- AWS: EC2 instances
- GCP: Compute Engine VM instances
- Azure: Virtual Machines

### Containers & Orchestration
- AWS: ECS tasks, EKS nodes, Fargate tasks
- GCP: GKE node pools
- Azure: AKS node pools

### Serverless
- AWS: Lambda functions
- GCP: Cloud Functions, Cloud Run services
- Azure: Azure Functions, Container Apps

### Databases
- AWS: RDS instances, Aurora clusters, ElastiCache clusters, DynamoDB tables
- GCP: Cloud SQL, Spanner, Bigtable, Memorystore
- Azure: Azure SQL Managed Instance, Azure Database for PostgreSQL/MySQL, Cosmos DB, Azure Cache for Redis

### Storage
- AWS: S3 buckets, EBS volumes, EFS file systems
- GCP: GCS buckets, Persistent Disks, Filestore
- Azure: Azure Blob Storage containers, Azure Managed Disks, Azure Files shares

### Networking
- AWS: Elastic IPs, NAT Gateways, Classic/Application/Network Load Balancers
- GCP: Cloud NAT, External IPs, Cloud Load Balancing
- Azure: Azure Public IPs, NAT Gateways, Application/Load Balancers

**For each asset, capture:**
- Asset ID and Orca `app_url` (always present in discovery_search results — this is the direct Orca platform deep-link)
- Asset name and type
- Cloud provider, region/zone, and account/project/subscription ID
- Current configuration: instance type or SKU, size class, storage tier, pricing model (on-demand/reserved/spot)
- Associated tags — especially environment (prod/staging/dev), team, and service name
- Creation date when available

If `discovery_search` returns limited fields, use `mcp__orca-security__get_asset_by_id` to fetch full details on assets where you need more configuration data.

---

## Phase 2: Pricing Research

Accurate savings calculations require current pricing. Always attempt live pricing first — baked-in tables become stale.

**Web search approach** (run in parallel per provider):
```
AWS EC2 pricing on-demand [instance-type] [region] site:aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing
GCP compute engine machine types pricing site:cloud.google.com/compute/vm-instance-pricing
Azure virtual machines pricing site:azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/virtual-machines
```

For each resource type present in the environment, fetch:
- Current on-demand price of the existing configuration
- Price of the recommended alternative (one size down, or newer generation)
- 1-year reserved/committed use price for stable workloads
- Spot/Preemptible price for interruptible workloads

**Fallback:** If web search fails or returns inconsistent data, use approximate pricing from training data. When using fallback prices, mark estimates with `~` and note the source date.

---

## Phase 3: Optimization Analysis

For each discovered asset, evaluate all applicable optimization patterns below. An asset may qualify for multiple optimizations — include all of them, and total the savings.

### Pattern 1: Idle and Orphaned Resources
**What to look for:** Unattached EBS/Managed Disk/Persistent Disk volumes; Elastic IPs with no associated instance; load balancers with no registered targets; NAT gateways serving zero or one instance; instances with names suggesting temporary use (test, tmp, scratch, demo) and old creation dates.
**Recommendation:** Delete or terminate. Snapshot storage volumes before deletion as a safety measure.
**Savings:** 100% of current cost. Zero risk for truly idle resources.

### Pattern 2: Rightsizing (Oversized Instances)
**What to look for:** Instances with sizes of xlarge or larger (2xlarge, 4xlarge, 8xlarge, etc.) where the name or tags don't suggest a memory- or compute-intensive workload. Flag especially any development or staging instances running on large types.
**Recommendation:** Move down one size within the same family (e.g., m5.2xlarge → m5.xlarge).
**Savings:** ~50% of compute cost per instance.
**Risk:** Low for dev/staging. Medium for production — flag as needing load testing.

### Pattern 3: Previous Generation → Current Generation
**What to look for:**
- AWS: Instance families m3, m4, c3, c4, r3, r4, t1, t2, i2, d2
- GCP: n1 machine types
- Azure: Av1, Dv1, Dv2, Dv3, Dsv3, Ev3, Esv3 series
**Recommendation:**
- AWS m4 → m6i, c4 → c6i, r4 → r6i, t2 → t3 (same or lower price, better performance)
- GCP n1 → n2 or e2 (10-30% cheaper for same specs)
- Azure Dv3 → Dv4/Dsv4 (up to 15% cheaper)
**Savings:** 10-25% cost reduction with zero performance regression. Often requires only a stop/start.
**Risk:** Low. This is one of the safest optimizations.

### Pattern 4: On-Demand → Reserved / Committed Use
**What to look for:** Production instances (environment tag = prod, or no dev/staging tag) that appear to be long-running (creation date > 30 days ago). Databases are especially good candidates since they almost never stop.
**Recommendation:** Purchase 1-year reserved instance (AWS) or committed use discount (GCP/Azure).
**Savings:** ~40% for 1-year, ~60% for 3-year. Calculate based on actual hourly rate × 730 hours/month.
**Risk:** Low — financial commitment only. If the instance is likely to be needed for a year (especially databases, core production services), this is a no-brainer.
**Note:** Do not recommend 3-year commitments unless the user specifically asks — they reduce flexibility.

### Pattern 5: On-Demand → Spot / Preemptible
**What to look for:** Development, staging, or testing instances (env tags: dev, staging, test, qa). Batch processing workloads. Any non-production database replicas.
**Recommendation:** Convert to AWS Spot Instances, GCP Preemptible/Spot VMs, or Azure Spot VMs.
**Savings:** 60-90% cost reduction.
**Risk:** Medium. Spot instances can be interrupted with 2-minute notice. Only appropriate for fault-tolerant workloads. Always flag this risk prominently.

### Pattern 6: Database Rightsizing
**What to look for:** RDS, Cloud SQL, or Azure SQL instances with types larger than db.t3.medium / db.m5.large that are serving development or staging environments. Also flag production databases that are significantly larger than the application compute instances they serve.
**Recommendation:** Move to a smaller instance class. For dev/staging, consider switching to burstable types (db.t3.medium for RDS).
**Savings:** 40-60% of database cost.
**Risk:** Medium. Requires monitoring after change. Always recommend doing this during a maintenance window.

### Pattern 7: Multi-AZ / High Availability in Non-Production
**What to look for:** RDS or Azure SQL instances with Multi-AZ enabled in non-production environments (env tags: dev, staging, test). Read replicas in dev environments.
**Recommendation:** Disable Multi-AZ for non-production databases.
**Savings:** ~50% of database cost (Multi-AZ doubles the cost).
**Risk:** Low for non-production. **NEVER recommend disabling Multi-AZ for production databases** — state this explicitly.

### Pattern 8: EBS gp2 → gp3 Migration
**What to look for:** Any AWS EBS volumes using the `gp2` volume type. This is a very common finding.
**Recommendation:** Migrate to `gp3`. Same baseline performance (3,000 IOPS, 125 MiB/s throughput included), but 20% cheaper. Can be done live with zero downtime via the `aws ec2 modify-volume` command.
**Savings:** 20% of EBS volume cost. gp2 costs $0.10/GB/month → gp3 costs $0.08/GB/month.
**Risk:** Very low. Zero downtime migration.

### Pattern 9: S3 / Object Storage Tiering
**What to look for:** S3 buckets, GCS buckets, or Azure Blob containers without lifecycle policies (or with no tiering configured). Large volumes of data that aren't frequently accessed (backup buckets, log archives, data lake cold partitions).
**Recommendation:**
- S3: Enable S3 Intelligent-Tiering or add lifecycle policy (Standard → Standard-IA after 30 days → Glacier after 90 days)
- GCS: Enable Autoclass or set Nearline/Coldline for archival data
- Azure: Enable lifecycle management with Cool or Archive tier transitions
**Savings:** 40-90% of storage cost depending on access patterns.
**Risk:** Low. Lifecycle policies don't delete data, they move it to cheaper tiers.
**Note:** If access pattern data isn't available (it won't be from Orca config data alone), recommend Intelligent-Tiering (AWS) or Autoclass (GCP) which auto-optimize without requiring access pattern knowledge.

### Pattern 10: Oversized Networking Resources
**What to look for:** NAT Gateways in regions or VPCs serving very few instances; load balancers with no instances registered; multiple NAT Gateways where one would suffice.
**Recommendation:** Consolidate or remove. For small dev environments, consider using NAT instances instead of managed NAT gateways.
**Savings:** AWS NAT Gateway costs $0.045/hour ($32/month) plus data transfer. LB costs $0.008/LCU-hour.
**Risk:** Low for unused resources. Medium for consolidation — requires routing changes.

## Phase 4: Report Generation

Structure your output **exactly** as follows.

**Critical formatting rules:**
1. The Executive Summary appears **twice**: once at the very top (before all details), and once at the very bottom (as a recap for readers who scroll to the end).
2. Every asset recommendation must include both an **Orca platform link** and a **cloud provider console/portal link** as clickable evidence.
3. Fill in every section with real data. If no opportunities exist in a category, say so explicitly.

---

### How to Generate Asset Links

**Orca platform link:** Use the `app_url` field returned by `discovery_search` for each asset. Format it as: `[View in Orca](<app_url>)`

**Cloud provider console deep-links:**

| Provider | Resource | URL Template |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| AWS | EC2 instance | `https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region={region}#Instances:instanceId={instance-id}` |
| AWS | EBS volume | `https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region={region}#Volumes:volumeId={volume-id}` |
| AWS | RDS instance | `https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/home?region={region}#database:id={db-name}` |
| AWS | S3 bucket | `https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/{bucket-name}` |
| AWS | NAT Gateway | `https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home?region={region}#NatGateways:natGatewayId={ngw-id}` |
| AWS | Elastic IP | `https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region={region}#Addresses:AllocationId={eipalloc-id}` |
| AWS | Load Balancer (v2) | `https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region={region}#LoadBalancers:search={lb-name}` |
| GCP | VM instance | `https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instancesDetail/zones/{zone}/instances/{name}?project={project-id}` |
| GCP | Cloud SQL | `https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances/{name}/overview?project={project-id}` |
| GCP | GCS bucket | `https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/{bucket-name}?project={project-id}` |
| Azure | Virtual Machine | `https://portal.azure.com/#resource/subscriptions/{sub-id}/resourceGroups/{rg}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/{name}/overview` |
| Azure | Managed Disk | `https://portal.azure.com/#resource/subscriptions/{sub-id}/resourceGroups/{rg}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/disks/{name}/overview` |
| Azure | SQL Database | `https://portal.azure.com/#resource/subscriptions/{sub-id}/resourceGroups/{rg}/providers/Microsoft.Sql/servers/{server}/databases/{db}/overview` |

When exact IDs are not available from Orca metadata, use the search-based URL (e.g., `#Instances:search={name}`) and note the asset name.

## 🗺️ Implementation Roadmap

**Phase 1 — This week (zero downtime, immediate savings)**
- EBS gp2 → gp3 migrations (live, zero downtime)
- Delete truly idle resources (unattached volumes, unused IPs)
- Remove dev/staging Multi-AZ database configurations
- Terminate clearly orphaned instances/resources

**Phase 2 — Next 2–4 weeks (requires maintenance windows)**
- Instance generation upgrades (stop/start required)
- Compute rightsizing for non-production environments
- Add storage lifecycle policies to object storage buckets

**Phase 3 — Month 2+ (financial commitments and architecture)**
- Purchase reserved instances / committed use discounts for stable production workloads
- Convert appropriate dev/staging workloads to Spot/Preemptible
- Production rightsizing after performance validation

---

## ⚠️ Caveats

- Cost estimates are based on **configuration data only**, not measured utilization. Rightsizing recommendations assume instances are not CPU/memory constrained — validate before downsizing production systems.
- Reserved instance savings assume **continuous 24/7 operation**.
- Pricing data: [state whether live or fallback, and date]
- Spot/Preemptible instances are only appropriate for **fault-tolerant, stateless workloads** that can handle 2-minute interruption notices.
- This report covers configuration-based optimizations. Usage-pattern analysis (CPU utilization metrics) may reveal additional opportunities not captured here.

## MCP Tools Used

### Primary (always called in parallel)

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `discovery_search` | Enumerate EC2 instances, EBS volumes, S3 buckets, RDS, NAT Gateways, EIPs, Lambda, load balancers, ECS/EKS, ElastiCache |
| `get_asset_by_id` | Fetch full configuration details when discovery_search fields are insufficient |

### Optional

| Tool | When Called |
|------|------------|
| `get_asset_alerts_count_grouped_by_risk_level` | Check alert posture for assets flagged for rightsizing |
| `get_asset_related_alerts_summary` | Verify an asset is truly idle before recommending deletion |
| `get_aws_effective_permissions_policy_on_asset` | Assess IAM complexity before recommending termination |

### Tool Parameter Reference

#### discovery_search
| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `search_phrase` | string | Yes | Natural language query, e.g., "EC2 instances", "EBS volumes", "S3 buckets" |
| `limit` | integer (1-50) | No | Max results (default 5, use 50 for full inventory) |

**Important:** `discovery_search` returns at most 50 results per query. For environments with many assets, results represent a sample. Always note the `total_items` field and include the `app_url` from results to link to the full Orca filtered view.

#### get_asset_by_id
| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `asset_unique_id` | string | Yes | The Orca asset unique ID from discovery_search results |

## Implementation Notes

1. **Parallelize Phase 1 searches** — run all category discovery searches simultaneously. With 9 parallel queries, Phase 1 completes in a single round of MCP calls.
2. **Large result sets** — when discovery_search returns 50 results out of a larger `total_items`, note the limitation and extrapolate savings estimates proportionally.
3. **No utilization data** — Orca provides configuration data, not CPU/memory metrics. Always include the caveat that rightsizing recommendations are configuration-based and require utilization validation before applying to production.
4. **Pricing freshness** — always try live web search for pricing first. Fall back to training data only if web search fails. Mark fallback estimates with `~`.
5. **Risk classification** — never recommend deleting production databases or disabling Multi-AZ for prod RDS. Always check for `prod` / `production` tags or names before making recommendations that could affect availability.
6. **Link quality** — the `app_url` field from discovery_search is always the authoritative Orca platform link. Never construct Orca URLs manually.
