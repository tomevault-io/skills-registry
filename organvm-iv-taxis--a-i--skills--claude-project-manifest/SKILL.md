# Claude Project Manifest

Create structured, annotated documentation of Claude projects that tracks files, conversation threads, and their relationships.

## When to Use

- Documenting project contents and structure
- Creating file inventories with annotations
- Tracking conversation history across sessions
- Building navigable knowledge maps
- Onboarding new collaborators to existing projects

## Core Concepts

### Manifest Structure

A manifest has four primary sections:

1. **Metadata**: Project-level information (ID, version, status)
2. **Files**: Annotated file inventory with provenance
3. **Threads**: Conversation summaries and accomplishments
4. **Relations**: Dependencies and connections between entities

### ID System

| Entity | Format | Example |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Project | `PROJ-{YEAR}-{SEQ}` | `PROJ-2024-001` |
| File | `FILE-{SEQ}` | `FILE-042` |
| Thread | `THR-{SEQ}` | `THR-017` |
| Relation | `REL-{SEQ}` | `REL-123` |

## Quick Start

### Minimal Manifest

```yaml
manifest:
  id: "PROJ-2024-001"
  version: "1.0.0"
  created: "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"

  project:
    name: "My Project"
    description: "Brief description of the project"
    status: active

files:
  - id: "FILE-001"
    path: "src/main.py"
    title: "Main Entry Point"
    summary: "Application entry and initialization"
```

### Full File Entry

```yaml
files:
  - id: "FILE-001"
    path: "src/main.py"
    type: source  # source | config | doc | asset | generated
    thread_id: "THR-001"
    title: "Main Entry Point"
    summary: "One-line description of purpose"
    notes: |
      Extended annotation explaining:
      - Design decisions made
      - Why this approach was chosen
      - Key implementation details
      - Known limitations or TODOs
    tags: [core, initialization]
    depends_on: ["FILE-002", "FILE-003"]
    created: "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
    modified: "2024-01-16T14:20:00Z"
```

### Thread Entry

```yaml
threads:
  - id: "THR-001"
    started: "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
    ended: "2024-01-15T12:45:00Z"
    title: "Initial Project Setup"
    summary: "Created core infrastructure and configuration"
    accomplishments:
      - "Created directory structure"
      - "Implemented Config class with validation"
      - "Added logging infrastructure"
    files_created: ["FILE-001", "FILE-002"]
    files_modified: []
    decisions:
      - "Chose YAML over JSON for config readability"
      - "Used dataclasses instead of Pydantic for simplicity"
    tags: [setup, infrastructure]
```

### Relations

```yaml
relations:
  - id: "REL-001"
    type: depends_on
    source: "FILE-001"
    target: "FILE-002"
    annotation: "Main imports and uses Config class"

  - id: "REL-002"
    type: implements
    source: "FILE-003"
    target: "FILE-004"
    annotation: "Repository implements StorageInterface"
```

Relation types:
- `depends_on`: Source requires target to function
- `extends`: Source builds upon target
- `implements`: Source implements interface defined in target
- `references`: Source refers to target without hard dependency
- `supersedes`: Source replaces target (for versioning)

## Writing Annotations

### File Annotations

Good annotations answer:
- **What**: What does this file do?
- **Why**: Why was this approach chosen?
- **How**: Key implementation details
- **Context**: What prompted its creation?

Example:
```yaml
notes: |
  Implements rate limiting using token bucket algorithm.
  Chose token bucket over sliding window for better burst handling.
  Created during THR-003 when API overload issues emerged.
  TODO: Add Redis backend for distributed rate limiting.
```

### Thread Annotations

Capture:
- **Goal**: What we set out to accomplish
- **Outcome**: What we actually achieved
- **Decisions**: Key choices made and rationale
- **Artifacts**: Files created or modified

## Workflow

### Starting a New Project

1. Create manifest file (`manifest.yaml`)
2. Add project metadata
3. Set initial status to `active`

### During Development

1. Log new threads as conversations happen
2. Add files with annotations when created
3. Record relations as dependencies form
4. Update thread accomplishments

### Project Handoff

1. Review all thread summaries
2. Verify file annotations are current
3. Validate all relations are documented
4. Export to markdown report if needed

## Output Formats

### YAML (Primary)

Best for editing and version control. See `assets/templates/manifest.yaml`.

### JSON (Machine-Readable)

For programmatic access. See `assets/templates/manifest.json`.

### Markdown Report

Human-readable export for documentation. See `assets/templates/manifest-report.md`.
