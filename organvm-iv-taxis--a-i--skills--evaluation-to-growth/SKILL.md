name: evaluation-to-growth
description: Systematic content evaluation framework progressing through Critique → Reinforcement → Risk Analysis → Growth. Use when reviewing writing, arguments, proposals, code documentation, or any content requiring rigorous multi-dimensional assessment. Supports interactive guided mode or autonomous full-report mode, with output as markdown report, structured checklist, or inline revision suggestions. Triggers on requests to evaluate, critique, improve, strengthen, or review content quality. Use when this capability is needed.

# Evaluation to Growth

A systematic framework for transforming content through rigorous evaluation into stronger, more resilient final products.

## Mode Selection

Before beginning, determine execution mode and output format.

### Execution Modes

**Interactive Mode**: Walk through each phase step-by-step, pausing for user input and direction between stages. Best for collaborative refinement or learning the framework.

**Autonomous Mode**: Execute all phases and deliver comprehensive results. Best for efficient batch evaluation or when user wants complete analysis upfront.

### Output Formats

**Markdown Report**: Structured document with sections for each phase, findings, and recommendations. Best for documentation or sharing.

**Structured Checklist**: Itemized findings with status indicators and action items. Best for tracking and implementation.

**Inline Revisions**: Suggestions embedded within or alongside the original content. Best for direct editing workflow.

## The Framework

```
[Evaluation] → [Reinforcement] → [Risk Analysis] → [Growth]
```

### Phase 1: Evaluation

Comprehensive assessment across five dimensions.

#### 1.1 Critique
Identify strengths and weaknesses holistically.

**Prompt**: "Evaluate this content thoroughly. Identify its key strengths and weaknesses. Highlight which parts are effective and which need improvement, providing specific reasons."

**Output structure**:
- Strengths: [list with specific examples]
- Weaknesses: [list with specific examples]
- Priority areas: [ranked improvement opportunities]

#### 1.2 Logic Check
Ensure internal consistency and sound reasoning.

**Prompt**: "Examine the content for logical consistency. Identify contradictions, gaps in reasoning, or unsupported claims, and suggest how to strengthen coherence."

**Output structure**:
- Contradictions found: [list]
- Reasoning gaps: [list]
- Unsupported claims: [list]
- Coherence recommendations: [list]

#### 1.3 Logos Review
Assess rational and factual appeal.

**Prompt**: "Assess the rational and factual appeal of this content. Are the arguments clear, well-supported, and persuasive? Suggest ways to enhance the logical impact."

**Output structure**:
- Argument clarity: [assessment]
- Evidence quality: [assessment]
- Persuasive strength: [assessment]
- Enhancement recommendations: [list]

#### 1.4 Pathos Review
Evaluate emotional resonance.

**Prompt**: "Analyze the emotional tone and resonance of this content. Does it create an emotional connection with its intended audience? Recommend adjustments to increase engagement."

**Output structure**:
- Current emotional tone: [description]
- Audience connection: [assessment]
- Engagement level: [assessment]
- Recommendations: [list]

#### 1.5 Ethos Review
Examine credibility and authority.

**Prompt**: "Evaluate the credibility and authority of this content. Does it reflect expertise and trustworthiness? Suggest ways to reinforce its reliability and professional tone."

**Output structure**:
- Perceived expertise: [assessment]
- Trustworthiness signals: [list present/missing]
- Authority markers: [assessment]
- Credibility recommendations: [list]

---

### Phase 2: Reinforcement

Consolidate and strengthen based on evaluation findings.

#### 2.1 Synthesis
Integrate logic check findings to eliminate contradictions and reinforce coherence.

**Actions**:
- Resolve identified contradictions
- Fill reasoning gaps
- Support unsupported claims or remove them
- Strengthen transitional logic

---

### Phase 3: Risk Analysis

Identify vulnerabilities before they become failures.

#### 3.1 Blind Spots
Reveal overlooked areas or hidden assumptions.

**Prompt**: "Identify any areas in this content that may be overlooked, biased, or based on hidden assumptions. Provide suggestions to address these gaps or risks."

**Output structure**:
- Hidden assumptions: [list]
- Overlooked perspectives: [list]
- Potential biases: [list]
- Mitigation strategies: [list]

#### 3.2 Shatter Points
Pinpoint critical vulnerabilities.

**Prompt**: "Analyze the content for potential vulnerabilities or weak points that could cause failure or serious criticism. Recommend preventive measures or reinforcements."

**Output structure**:
- Critical vulnerabilities: [list with severity]
- Potential attack vectors: [how critics might respond]
- Preventive measures: [list]
- Contingency preparations: [list]

---

### Phase 4: Growth

Transform evaluation into evolution.

#### 4.1 Bloom (Emergent Insights)
Generate new directions from the analysis.

**Prompt**: "From the reviewed content, generate innovative ideas, new directions, or insights that could enhance or expand its impact."

**Output structure**:
- Emergent themes: [patterns noticed across analysis]
- Expansion opportunities: [where content could grow]
- Novel angles: [unexpected directions]
- Cross-domain connections: [links to other areas]

#### 4.2 Evolve (Iterative Refinement)
Produce the strengthened final version.

**Prompt**: "Incorporate all feedback and refinements to create a polished, stronger, and more resilient final version of the content."

**Output structure**:
- Revision summary: [changes made]
- Strength improvements: [before/after]
- Risk mitigations applied: [list]
- Final product: [revised content]

## Execution Templates

### Interactive Mode Script

```
Step 1: "I'll evaluate your content using the Evaluation-to-Growth framework. 
        First, let's assess strengths and weaknesses. [Critique results]
        Would you like to discuss these findings before moving to logic check?"

Step 2: [Wait for response, then proceed to Logic Check]

Step 3: [Continue through each phase with pause points]

Step 4: "We've completed the evaluation phases. Ready to move into Risk Analysis?"

[Continue through all phases with user checkpoints]
```

### Autonomous Mode Script

```
"I'll provide a complete Evaluation-to-Growth analysis of your content.

## Evaluation Phase
[All five dimensions with findings]

## Reinforcement
[Synthesis and coherence improvements]

## Risk Analysis
[Blind spots and shatter points]

## Growth
[Emergent insights and evolved version]

## Summary
[Key findings and recommended next steps]"
```
