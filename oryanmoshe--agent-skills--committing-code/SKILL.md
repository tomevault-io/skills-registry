# Committing Code

## Overview

**Every commit message uses conventional commits with gitmoji.** The format is consistent, scannable, and conveys intent at a glance.

## Format

```
<emoji> <type>: <short description>

<body — what changed and why>

Co-Authored-By: Claude <agent> <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

The short description is imperative mood, lowercase, no period. The body uses bullet points for multiple changes.

## Gitmoji Reference

| Emoji | Type | When to use |
|-------|------|-------------|
| 🎉 | `feat` | Initial commit / first commit in a repo |
| ✨ | `feat` | New feature or capability |
| 🐛 | `fix` | Bug fix |
| ♻️ | `refactor` | Code restructuring without behavior change |
| 📝 | `docs` | Documentation only |
| 🔧 | `chore` | Config, tooling, non-code changes |
| ✅ | `test` | Adding or updating tests |
| 🚀 | `perf` | Performance improvement |
| 🔥 | `chore` | Removing code or files |
| 🏗️ | `refactor` | Architectural change |
| 💄 | `style` | UI/cosmetic change |
| 🔒 | `security` | Security fix |
| ⬆️ | `chore` | Dependency upgrade |
| 🚚 | `refactor` | Moving or renaming files |

## Examples

**Good:**
```
✨ feat: add user authentication with JWT

- Add login/logout endpoints in auth.controller.ts
- Add JWT middleware for protected routes
- Add refresh token rotation
- Add auth integration tests

```

```
🐛 fix: prevent race condition in websocket reconnect

The reconnect logic was firing multiple times when the connection
dropped during a message send, causing duplicate subscriptions.
Added a mutex guard around the reconnect path.

```

```
♻️ refactor: rename getUserById to fetchUser across codebase

Aligns with the fetch* naming convention for async data access.
Updated all call sites, tests, and type definitions.

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

**Bad:**
```
updated stuff          # No type, no emoji, vague
feat: Add Feature      # No emoji, capitalized
✨ feat: add feature.  # Trailing period
🐛✨ fix/feat: stuff   # Multiple types
```

## Rules

1. **One type per commit.** If changes span multiple types, split into multiple commits.
2. **Body explains WHY, not just WHAT.** The diff shows what changed — the message explains the reasoning.
3. **Use bullet points** in the body when listing multiple changes.
4. **Always include Co-Authored-By** when the commit was AI-assisted.
5. **Use HEREDOC** for multi-line messages to preserve formatting:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
   ✨ feat: add new feature

   Body text here.

   Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>
   EOF
   )"
   ```

## Commit Frequency

Commit early and often:
- After each logical unit of work (one feature, one fix, one refactor)
- After adding a new file or skill
- After updating documentation alongside code changes
- **Never** batch unrelated changes into a single commit

## Pre-Commit Checklist

Before committing, verify:
- **README.md** is updated if the change affects user-facing documentation (new features, skills, APIs, installation steps)
- **AGENTS.md** is updated if the change affects project structure, conventions, or available skills
- Documentation changes are part of the same commit as the code they describe — not a separate "docs" commit after the fact
