# Organizing Files

## Overview

**Every file has a home. Find it, move it, never delete it.** This skill enforces a consistent macOS file organization structure across Desktop, Documents, Downloads, and iCloud Drive — optimized for software engineers who also have personal documents, media, and credentials scattered around.

## Principles

1. **No deletions** — move files, never remove them
2. **iCloud Documents = central hub** — organized subfolders, backed up automatically
3. **Desktop = clean workspace** — only actively-used files
4. **Downloads = temporary inbox** — local-only, clear regularly into Documents
5. **Git repos stay local** — `~/dev/` must never be inside iCloud (sync breaks `.git`, `node_modules`)
6. **Sensitive files get isolated** — credentials, recovery codes, identity docs in dedicated folders
7. **Inspect before sorting** — read images, check EXIF/metadata, understand content before categorizing

## Phase 1: Explore

Before moving anything, understand what exists. Launch parallel exploration agents:

| Agent | Target | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 1 | `~/Desktop/` | File types, sizes, screen recordings vs docs |
| 2 | `~/Documents/` | Current structure, migration folders, images |
| 3 | `~/Downloads/` | File type breakdown, duplicates, installers |
| 4 | iCloud Drive root | Loose files, subfolders, empty folders |
| 5 | `~/dev/` | Confirm git repos are local, not in iCloud |

Check iCloud sync status:
- `stat ~/Desktop` and `stat ~/Documents` — check if symlinked to iCloud
- `brctl status` — check iCloud sync daemon
- Look for migration folders (`Desktop - <Mac Name>`, `Documents - <Mac Name>`)

**iCloud path mapping:** When iCloud Desktop & Documents is enabled, `~/Desktop` and `~/Documents` point to iCloud Drive. The iCloud Drive root is at `~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/`. Files at that root are separate from Desktop/Documents — they're loose files in the drive itself.

## Phase 2: Inspect Content

**Don't sort by filename alone.** Inspect actual content. Each exploration agent must visually read images and check metadata:

| File Type | Inspection Method |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Images (.jpg, .png, .heic) | **Read the image file visually** (Claude can see images) to understand what it shows — is it a headshot, org chart, screenshot, meme, stock photo, or personal photo? Then `mdls` for EXIF (camera, GPS, dimensions, date) |
| PDFs | `mdls` for author, page count, title, creation date, security/encryption. Read small PDFs to understand content. |
| Spreadsheets (.xlsx, .csv) | `head -2` for CSV headers, `mdls` for author/dates |
| Code files (.ts, .tsx, .py) | `head -10` to understand purpose |
| Videos (.mov, .mp4) | `mdls` for duration, resolution, codec, creation date |
| Audio (.mp3, .m4a) | `mdls` for title, artist, duration |
| Hidden files (.*) | Check for dotfiles — config files, secrets, system files. Include in exploration. |

**Visual image inspection is critical.** Filenames like `IMG_6284.jpg` or `20991151.jpg` tell you nothing. Reading the image reveals whether it's a wedding invitation, a stock photo for a website, an office selfie, or a screenshot of credentials. Always read images with the Read tool.

**Flag these immediately:**
- Files with GPS coordinates embedded (privacy risk)
- Credential files (AWS keys, recovery codes, passwords)
- Password-protected/encrypted documents
- Identity documents (ID cards, driver's licenses, passports)
- Symlinks pointing to external drives or other locations — don't move these, note them

## Phase 3: Plan the Structure

```

### Desktop — Keep Empty

Move everything off Desktop into the structure above. Desktop is a workspace, not storage.

### Downloads — Clear Into Documents

Everything in Downloads should be sorted into `~/Documents/` subfolders. Downloads is a temporary landing zone.

### iCloud Root — No Loose Files

All loose files at iCloud Drive root move into `~/Documents/` subfolders. Only system symlinks (Desktop, Documents) should remain at root.

## Phase 4: Execute

### Execution Order

1. Create all target directories with `mkdir -p`
2. Move iCloud root loose files → Documents subfolders
3. Move iCloud subfolder contents → Documents subfolders
4. Flatten migration folders (`Desktop - <Mac Name>`, `Documents - <Mac Name>`) → Documents
5. Move Downloads files → Documents subfolders
6. Handle duplicates — keep both, rename with date suffix: `file (2025-12-15).ext`
7. Verify all moves completed

### Duplicate Handling

When the same filename exists in multiple locations:

```bash
# Keep both, rename the duplicate with its modification date
mv "duplicate.pdf" "duplicate (2025-12-15).pdf"
```

Never overwrite. Never delete. Always preserve both copies.

### Sensitive Files

After moving credentials to `Sensitive/`, remind the user:
- AWS keys should live in a password manager, not the filesystem
- Recovery code images should be encrypted or vault-stored
- GPS-tagged photos should be stripped before sharing publicly

## Phase 5: Verify

After all moves:

1. `ls ~/Desktop/` — should be empty or near-empty
2. `ls ~/Downloads/` — should be empty (existing files moved)
3. `find ~/Documents/ -maxdepth 2 -type d | sort` — verify folder tree
4. Check for any files left behind in iCloud root
5. Count files per category — sanity check totals match original counts

## Red Flags — STOP

| Thought | Action |
|---------|--------|
| "I'll sort by extension/filename" | INSPECT CONTENT — read images visually, check metadata, peek at CSVs. A .pdf could be financial or junk. |
| "I'll delete these old installers" | NO DELETIONS — move to Archive/Installers/ |
| "Git repos should be in Documents" | NEVER — ~/dev stays local, outside iCloud |
| "I'll merge these duplicates" | KEEP BOTH — rename with date suffix |
| "Credentials are fine in Documents" | ISOLATE in Sensitive/ folder, warn user |
| "I'll organize Downloads later" | DO IT NOW — Downloads is the biggest mess |
| "Desktop needs some files on it" | EMPTY IT — Desktop is a workspace, not storage |

## Anti-Patterns

**Extension-only sorting:** Moving all `.pdf` to one folder ignores that PDFs span financial docs, identity docs, resumes, and junk. Always inspect content.

**Flat category folders:** Don't dump 50 spreadsheets into one folder. Use subcategories (`Exports/`, `Analytics/`, `HR/`).

**Ignoring iCloud root:** Users forget iCloud Drive root has its own loose files separate from Desktop/Documents. Always check it.

**Skipping metadata:** EXIF data reveals GPS coordinates (privacy risk), camera models (helps identify photo sources), and creation dates (helps determine if files are current or archival).

**Moving git repos to iCloud:** iCloud sync corrupts `.git` directories and creates conflicts with `node_modules`, `__pycache__`, and other generated files. Development repos must stay local.
