# Agent Development for Claude Code Plugins

Agents are autonomous markdown files with YAML frontmatter that handle multi-step tasks independently. Agents are for autonomous work; commands are for user-initiated actions.

## Workflow

1. Define agent purpose and triggering conditions
2. Create `agents/agent-name.md` with frontmatter + system prompt body
3. Include 2-4 `<example>` blocks in description
4. Validate structure (see constraints below)
5. Test triggering with real scenarios
6. If validation fails: check error recovery table, fix, re-validate

## Agent File Template

```markdown
---
name: agent-identifier
description: Use this agent when [triggering conditions]. Examples:

<example>
Context: [Situation]
user: "[Request]"
assistant: "[Response before triggering]"
<commentary>[Why this agent triggers]</commentary>
</example>

model: inherit
color: blue
tools: ["Read", "Write", "Grep"]
---

You are [role] specializing in [domain].

**Your Core Responsibilities:**
1. [Primary task]
2. [Secondary task]

**Process:**
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]

**Output Format:**
[What to return and how]

**Edge Cases:**
- [Case]: [How to handle]
```

## Frontmatter Reference

| Field | Required | Format | Constraints |
|-------|----------|--------|-------------|
| `name` | Yes | `lowercase-hyphens` | 3-50 chars, start/end alphanumeric, no underscores |
| `description` | Yes | Text + `<example>` blocks | 10-5000 chars, must include triggering conditions |
| `model` | Yes | `inherit\|sonnet\|opus\|haiku` | Use `inherit` unless specific need |
| `color` | Yes | `blue\|cyan\|green\|yellow\|magenta\|red` | Distinct per plugin |
| `tools` | No | Array of tool names | Least-privilege principle; default: all tools |
| `hooks` | No | Array of hook configs | See hooks section |
| `disallowedTools` | No | Array with `Task(AgentName)` | Prevents specific agents from running |

**Color conventions:** blue/cyan = analysis/review, green = success, yellow = validation, red = security, magenta = creative.

**Common tool sets:**
- Read-only: `["Read", "Grep", "Glob"]`
- Code generation: `["Read", "Write", "Grep"]`
- Testing: `["Read", "Bash", "Grep"]`

## Description Field

The description must include triggering conditions and 2-4 `<example>` blocks. Each example needs: `Context`, `user` message, `assistant` response, and `<commentary>` explaining why the agent triggers.

Cover different triggering types across examples:
- **Explicit**: user directly requests the agent's function
- **Proactive**: agent triggers after relevant work without explicit request
- **Implicit**: user implies need without stating it directly

See `references/triggering-examples.md` for detailed patterns and templates.

## Hooks

Agent-level hooks scoped to agent lifecycle:

```yaml
hooks:
  - type: PreToolUse    # Validate before agent uses tools
    once: true          # Runs only once per invocation
  - type: PostToolUse   # React to agent tool results
  - type: Stop          # Cleanup when agent completes
```

Hooks inherit agent context. No command/prompt field needed. See `../hook-development/` for full documentation.

## disallowedTools

Prevent specific agents from being invoked:

```yaml
disallowedTools: ["Task(SWEAgent)", "Task(ExperimentalAgent)"]
```

Also configurable in settings.json and via `--disallowedTools` CLI flag.

## System Prompt Guidelines

The markdown body below the frontmatter becomes the agent's system prompt. Write in second person ("You are...", "You will...").

**Required sections:** Role description, Core Responsibilities, Process steps, Output Format.
**Recommended sections:** Quality Standards, Edge Cases.

**Keep prompts under 10,000 characters.** Optimal range: 500-3,000 characters. If longer, extract reference data into separate files.

See `references/system-prompt-design.md` for analysis, generation, validation, and orchestration prompt patterns.

## Agent Organization

```
plugin-name/
└── agents/
    ├── analyzer.md
    ├── reviewer.md
    └── generator.md
```

All `.md` files in `agents/` are auto-discovered. Agents are namespaced automatically: `agent-name` (single plugin) or `plugin:subdir:agent-name` (with subdirectories).

## Best Practices

- Include 2-4 concrete `<example>` blocks with varied phrasings in description
- Use `inherit` for model unless a specific model is required
- Apply least-privilege tool access
- Assign distinct colors per agent within a plugin
- Write specific, structured system prompts with clear process steps
- Define output format explicitly
- Test triggering with real scenarios before shipping

## Error Recovery

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Agent not triggering | Add more `<example>` blocks with varied phrasings; verify keywords match user intent |
| Name validation fails | Ensure 3-50 chars, lowercase + hyphens only, starts/ends alphanumeric |
| System prompt too long | Keep under 10,000 chars; extract reference data into separate files |
| Agent uses wrong tools | Add explicit `tools` array; verify tool names match exactly |
| Agent color not showing | Confirm color is one of: blue, cyan, green, yellow, magenta, red |
| Description too vague | Add triggering conditions and concrete `<example>` blocks with `<commentary>` |
| Agent triggers incorrectly | Make examples more specific; add negative-case commentary |
