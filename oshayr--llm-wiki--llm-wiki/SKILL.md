# Wiki Maintain

Comprehensive wiki maintenance: lint, deduplicate, upgrade, and analyze.

Resolve `.wiki/` from plugin install scope. If not found, say "No wiki found."

## Arguments

- **`/wiki-maintain`** — run full maintenance (all steps below)
- **`/wiki-maintain lint`** — only fix broken links, missing frontmatter, orphans
- **`/wiki-maintain dedup`** — only find and merge near-duplicate pages
- **`/wiki-maintain gaps`** — only analyze knowledge gaps and missing coverage

## Full Maintenance Steps

### 1. Lint

Launch `wiki-auditor` agent to:
- Find `[[wiki-links]]` that point to non-existent pages — list for user
- Fix missing frontmatter fields (add defaults)
- Find orphan pages (no incoming links) — suggest connections
- Remove dead index entries
- Fix stale `updated:` dates on pages that were modified but not date-bumped

### 2. Deduplicate

Find pages with >60% slug token overlap (Jaccard similarity on slug words split by `-`):
- Report pairs for review
- For confirmed duplicates: auto-merge into one page, update all backlinks, add redirect note to absorbed page

### 3. Confidence Upgrade

Pages with 3+ independent sources in frontmatter get upgraded:
- `low` → `medium` (if 2+ sources)
- `medium` → `high` (if 3+ corroborating sources)
- Run `fact-checker` agent on high-confidence pages to verify claims against external sources
- Write the reason in log.md

### 4. Stale Detection (Freshness Tiers)

Pages are evaluated against an intelligent freshness system — not a flat threshold. Each page has a TTL based on its content type:

| Tier | TTL | Examples |
|------|-----|----------|
| `live` | 15 min | stock prices, live scores, server status, deployment state |
| `breaking` | 1-6 hours | breaking news, incident updates, release announcements |
| `current` | 1-3 days | news articles, current events, trending topics |
| `fast` | 1-4 weeks | AI/LLM/MCP, API changes, model benchmarks |
| `moderate` | 1-3 months | software versions, frameworks, libraries, tools |
| `standard` | 6 months | general knowledge, how-to guides (default) |
| `academic` | 1 year | research papers, studies, formal publications |
| `evergreen` | 5 years | history, biographies, foundational concepts, laws, theorems |
| `permanent` | never | personal notes, ideas, memories, journal entries |

Resolution order:
1. Explicit `freshness_tier:` in page frontmatter (user override)
2. Explicit `ttl:` in frontmatter (custom duration like `ttl: 30m` or `ttl: 2d`)
3. Auto-classification from tags, type, and content keywords

For stale pages:
- Add `stale: true` to frontmatter
- Suggest running `/wiki-write --refresh-stale` or `/wiki-read` to refresh

### 5. Concept Auto-Generation

Detect patterns spanning 3+ pages:
- Find groups of pages that share 3+ common `[[wiki-links]]` targets
- For each cluster: suggest a synthesis article that connects the concepts
- If user approves: generate the synthesis page via `wiki-writer` agent

### 6. Regenerate Index

Rebuild `.wiki/index.md` from all pages:
- Group by `type:` field (concept, entity, source, idea, status, etc.)
- Alphabetical within each group
- Include confidence badge and one-line description

### 7. Report

Print summary: broken links fixed, duplicates found, confidence upgrades, stale flags, concepts suggested, index updated.
