name: repo-analyze
description: One-call cold-start orientation for an unfamiliar repo. Returns a structured map — file tree (compact per-folder summary by default, full per-file listing with --tree-mode full), language mix, framework + build-tool detection, top-level deps, entrypoints, README highlights — so you don't burn 60+ Read/Glob/Grep calls re-mining the same facts every fresh session. Stateless, no network, stdlib Python only. Use when this capability is needed.

# repo-analyze

The map, not the contents. One call replaces the cold-start dance — file-tree exploration, finding entrypoints, reading every manifest, scanning README. Session mining showed ~67 grep + ~60 ls ops on a typical fresh-repo session, almost all of it answerable from one structured payload.

Tree output is **compact** by default: one row per directory, showing file counts and per-extension LOC. This stays small even in large repos. Use `--tree-mode full` when you need the individual file list (e.g. to scan for a specific file that isn't an entrypoint).

Lives at `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../bin/repo-analyze`; the plugin auto-adds `bin/` to PATH, so just run `repo-analyze ...`.

## When to reach for this

- User asks **"what is this project / what's the tech stack / give me an overview"** → run `repo-analyze --pretty --tree-mode compact`. One call → languages, frameworks, deps, entrypoints, README highlights.
- User asks **"where do I start"** → run `repo-analyze --pretty --tree-mode compact` and read the `entrypoints` + `readme` sections.
- User asks **"is this a Next.js / FastAPI / Rust project"** → run `repo-analyze --tree-mode compact` and inspect `frameworks[]`. Each entry has a `confidence` field (`high` = manifest-confirmed, `medium` = config file present but not in manifest).
- Cold-starting in any unfamiliar checkout → run this BEFORE the first Read/Glob/Grep.

## After running

Read `nextSteps[]` from the envelope and offer them to the user. Each entry is a short string naming the next recommended action (e.g. "Read src/index.ts — top entrypoint", "skill-plus scan — mine session history for skill candidates", "diff-summary -- summarize staged/unstaged changes or a branch diff"). Surface these as suggested actions at the end of your summary.

## Headline command

```bash
repo-analyze --tree-mode compact  # always pass explicitly; compact = one row/folder (default, but be explicit)
             [--path PATH]
             [--tree-mode full]   # override: every file listed individually
             [--max-tree-files INT]  # default 200 (full mode only)
             [--max-tree-depth INT]  # default 4
             [--no-readme]           # skip README highlights
             [--output PATH]         # offload to disk
             [--shape-depth 1|2|3]   # envelope detail (default 3)
             [--pretty | --json]
             [--version]
```

Always pass `--tree-mode compact` explicitly. Do not omit it — it makes the intent unambiguous and protects against future default changes.

## Output shape (truncated)

```json
{
  "tool": {"name": "repo-analyze", "version": "0.3.0"},
  "path": "/abs/path",
  "git": {"isRepo": true, "branch": "main", "remote": "...", "headCommit": "abc1234"},
  "languages": {"python": {"files": 42, "loc": 12345, "percent": 38.2}, ...},
  "frameworks": [{"name": "Next.js", "evidence": "package.json:next", "confidence": "high"}],
  "buildTools": [{"name": "pnpm", "evidence": "pnpm-lock.yaml"}],
  "deps": {"node": {...}, "python": {...}, "rust": null, "go": null, "ruby": null},
  "entrypoints": [{"path": "src/app/page.tsx", "kind": "next-page"}],
  "tree": {
    "mode": "compact",
    "totalFiles": 1234,
    "maxDepth": 4,
    "folders": [
      {"folder": "./", "depth": 0, "files": 3, "types": {"md": {"files": 2, "loc": 120}, "json": {"files": 1}}},
      {"folder": "src/", "depth": 1, "files": 12, "types": {"ts": {"files": 10, "loc": 3200}, "css": {"files": 2, "loc": 150}}, "totalLoc": 3350}
    ]
  },
  "readme": {"title": "...", "firstParagraph": "...", "headings": [...]},
  "nextSteps": [
    "Read src/app/page.tsx -- top entrypoint",
    "skill-plus scan -- mine session history for skill candidates",
    "diff-summary -- summarize staged/unstaged changes or a branch diff"
  ],
  "agentPlusServices": {"services": {"github-remote": {"status": "ok"}, ...}}
}
```

When `.agent-plus/services.json` exists in the analyzed path or an ancestor, `agentPlusServices` is populated with names + statuses (no IDs, no values). Otherwise it's `null`.

## Offloading large responses

For monorepos or anything over ~50KB of output, use `--output PATH`:

```bash
repo-analyze --tree-mode compact --output /tmp/analyze.json --shape-depth 3
```

The full payload lands on disk. Stdout returns a compact envelope: `payloadPath`, `bytes`, `payloadKeys`, `payloadShape`. `payloadShape` is recursive (depth 3 by default) so you can see `tree.folders.length` and `languages.python.loc` without opening the file.

## Stay in your lane

- **Reading file contents** → use the Read tool. `repo-analyze` is the map; Read is the territory.
- **Running tests / build commands** → that's the harness, not this CLI.
- **Symbol indexing / "where is `myFunction` defined"** → not this tool. (Future `dep-graph` plugin handles imports.)
- **Diff-related analysis ("what changed in this PR")** → not this tool. (Future `diff-summary` plugin handles diffs.)
- **Looking up package metadata from npmjs.org / pypi** → no network calls; this is local-file analysis only.

## Scope

- Pure local-file analysis. No network. No state.
- One call per session is normally enough. If the tree is truncated and you actually need the rest, raise `--max-tree-files` or use Glob for a targeted slice — don't loop on `repo-analyze` itself.
- Framework + build-tool detection is heuristic — `confidence: "high"` means a manifest confirmed it, `"medium"` means a config file was found without the manifest dep. Treat `low` as a hint.
- Detected languages cover ~30 common extensions. Missing language → file ignored from `languages`/LOC, still listed in `tree`.
