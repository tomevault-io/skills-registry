# New ingestion pipeline

## Workflow Entry
**ALWAYS** start with **Find source** (`find-source`) SKILL — discover the right dlt source for the user's data provider

## Core workflow
1. **Create pipeline** (`create-rest-api-pipeline`) — scaffold, write code, configure credentials
2. **Debug pipeline** (`debug-pipeline`) — run it, inspect traces and load packages, fix errors
3. **Validate data** (`validate-data`) — inspect schema and data, fix types and structures, iterate until user is satisfied

## Extend and harden

4. **Deploy to dltHub Platform** — hand off to **dlthub-platform** to deploy and run the pipeline on dltHub; can be done with a working pipeline
5. **Adjust endpoint** (`adjust-endpoint`) — add pagination, remove limits, add hints, mappings, correct schema etc.
6. **Add incremental loading** — set up `dlt.sources.incremental`, merge keys, and lag windows for production efficiency
7. **Add endpoints** (`new-endpoint`) — add more resources to the source
8. **View data** (`view-data`) — show data to the user & query and explore loaded data in Python

## Handover to other toolkits

### Incoming (to rest-api-pipeline)

- From **dlthub-platform** (from `deploy-workspace` when the pipeline needs modification before deploying) — pipeline name and destination are already known; skip `find-source` discovery and go straight to the relevant fix skill (`debug-pipeline`, `adjust-endpoint`, or `new-endpoint`).
- From **quick-start** (after path confirmation in `quick-start`) — the source name is passed as `find-source`'s first argument. `find-source` should treat it as the discovery seed and skip the "what data do you want to extract?" question. The chosen path name (Discover / Inspect / Production / Full CDM) is informational only and does not change `find-source`'s behaviour; downstream toolkit handoffs follow this toolkit's normal `Outgoing` rules.

### Outgoing (from rest-api-pipeline)

When the user's needs go beyond this toolkit, hand over to:

- **data-exploration** — after `validate-data` or `view-data`, when the user wants interactive notebooks, charts, dashboards, or deeper analysis with marimo
- **transformations** — after `validate-data` or `view-data`, when the user wants to model the ingested data into a CDM or run cross-source transformations
- **data-quality** — after `validate-data`, when the user wants ongoing validation, check contracts, or quality guarantees on every pipeline load
- **dlthub-platform** — two entry points:
  - **Early** (after `create-rest-api-pipeline` or `debug-pipeline`): when the user wants to run the pipeline on dltHub right away — a working pipeline is enough to deploy
  - **Later** (after `adjust-endpoint`, incremental loading, `add-endpoints`, or a subsequent `debug-pipeline` run): when the pipeline is refined and the user wants to deploy or schedule it on dltHub
- **filesystem-pipeline** — from (`find-source`) when the user's data source is file-based (S3, GCS, local CSV, SFTP, etc.) rather than a REST API
