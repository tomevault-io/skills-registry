# GitHub Code Search

Search GitHub for real-world code examples and implementation patterns.

@context/blocks/construct/gh-search.md

## When to Use

- Need real-world examples ("how do people implement X?")
- Exploring unfamiliar libraries/frameworks
- Comparing implementation approaches

## Workflow

1. **Generate Queries:** Create 3-5 targeted queries
   - Language filters: `language:typescript`, `language:go`
   - Code patterns: `function use`, `const use =`
   - Config files: `filename:tsconfig.json`

2. **Execute:** Run `aaa gh-search "query"` for each query

3. **Aggregate:** Combine results, deduplicate, ensure diversity

4. **Analyze:** Extract imports, patterns, architectural styles

5. **Report:** Synthesize findings with GitHub URLs

6. **Save:** Write report to `docs/research/github/[timestamp]-topic.md`

## Input: $ARGUMENTS

The search query. Can include GitHub search qualifiers:
- `language:typescript`
- `path:src/`
- `extension:json`

## Output

```markdown
# GitHub Code Search: [Topic]

## Summary

## Examples
### [Approach Name]
