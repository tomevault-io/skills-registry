# Interrogate Code Changes

Ask "why" instead of just reading code. Surfaces assumptions, decisions, and confidence levels.

## Workflow

@context/workflows/interrogate.md

## Input: $ARGUMENTS

Parse arguments to determine:
- **Target:** `unstaged` (default), `staged`, `changes` (staged+unstaged), `commit <hash>`, `pr <number>`, or `range <ref1>..<ref2>`
- **Mode:** `--quick` (minimal output) or `--skeptical` (extra validation)

## Session Modes: Live vs Forensic

This skill operates in two distinct modes depending on the target:

| Mode | Targets | Behavior | Richness |
|------|---------|----------|----------|
| **Live** | `changes`, `staged`, `unstaged` | Direct introspection - answer from current session memory | ★★★ Best |
| **Forensic** | `commit <hash>`, `pr <N>`, `range` | Load session transcript via `aaa session cat` | ★★ Good |
| **Fallback** | Forensic when no cc-session-id | Diff-only analysis (speculative) | ★ Basic |

### Live Mode (Same Session)

When interrogating current changes (`changes`, `staged`, `unstaged`), Claude can answer directly from memory of the current session. This provides the richest answers because:

- **Alternatives tried** are known from the conversation history
- **What was hard** is lived experience, not inference
- **Uncertainty** reflects actual current confidence

**No file lookup needed.** Just answer the three questions directly from memory.

### Forensic Mode (Past Commits)

When interrogating past commits (`commit`, `pr`, `range`), attempt to load the session transcript:

1. Extract cc-session-id from commit: `git log --format="%(trailers:key=cc-session-id,valueonly)" <hash>`
2. If found, load session content: `aaa session cat --commit <hash>`
3. Pass session transcript to analysis for context-rich answers
4. If cc-session-id not found, fall back to diff-only mode

**Forensic mode is second-best to live mode** - it has the conversation context but not the "lived experience" of the current session.

### Fallback Mode (Diff-Only)

When no cc-session-id trailer exists (older commits or external contributions):

- Analyze the diff alone
- Answers are speculative based on code patterns
- Clearly indicate reduced confidence in answers

## Gather Context

Based on target, gather the code diff:

### Target: unstaged (default) [Live Mode]
```bash
git diff
```

### Target: staged [Live Mode]
```bash
git diff --cached
```

### Target: changes [Live Mode]
```bash
git diff HEAD
```

### Target: commit <hash> [Forensic Mode]
```bash
git show <hash>
# Also attempt session retrieval:
aaa session cat --commit <hash>
```

### Target: pr <number> [Forensic Mode]
```bash
gh pr diff <number>
# For each commit in PR, attempt session retrieval
```

### Target: range <ref1>..<ref2> [Forensic Mode]
```bash
git diff <ref1>..<ref2>
# For each commit in range, attempt session retrieval
```

## Execute Interrogation

Apply the three core questions from the workflow to the gathered diff:

1. **What was the hardest decision?**
2. **What alternatives did you reject?**
3. **What are you least confident about?**

**Live mode:** Answer these from direct memory of the current session.

**Forensic mode:** Use loaded session transcript to inform answers. If no session available, derive answers from diff analysis only.

## Mode Behavior

- **Default:** Full explanations with confidence levels and structured tables
- **--quick:** Compact table with brief answers only
- **--skeptical:** Full output plus follow-up probes:
  - "Walk me through the logic step by step"
  - "What edge cases could break this?"
  - "If this code has a bug, where is it most likely?"

## Output

Format output per @context/workflows/interrogate.md#Output-Format based on selected mode.

Include a session context indicator in output:
- `[Live]` - Answers from current session memory
- `[Forensic: <session-id>]` - Answers informed by loaded session transcript
- `[Diff-Only]` - No session context available
