# Run Guide and Fix

Walk through a milestone's GUIDE.md step-by-step using `agent-browser`, fixing bugs and guide inaccuracies along the way.

## Usage

```
/run-guide-and-fix [milestone-name]
```

## Arguments

- `milestone-name` — Optional. Name of the milestone directory under `docs/planning/milestones/`. If omitted, look for milestones with a GUIDE.md or step-by-step.md.

## Agent-Browser Reference

@context/blocks/test/agent-browser.md

## Critical Rules

1. **NEVER use `curl`** — all HTTP/browser interaction goes through `agent-browser`
2. **Always use `--session guide-test`** for session persistence across steps
3. **Refs go stale after any page change** — always re-snapshot after navigation or actions that change the page
4. **Prefer semantic locators** — the guide names UI elements, so use `find role`/`find text`/`find label` before falling back to snapshot @refs
5. **Update GUIDE.md immediately** after each step outcome — don't batch updates
6. **Record working selectors** — after each step passes, embed the exact `agent-browser` command as `<!-- automation: ... -->` in the guide so re-runs skip discovery

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Load Agent-Browser Knowledge

---

"🤖 Loading agent-browser knowledge..."

---

Review agent-browser capabilities from `@context/blocks/test/agent-browser.md`.

Run `agent-browser --help` as a quick refresher if needed.

Selector priority for this workflow:
1. **Semantic locators** (no snapshot needed) — guide already names UI elements:
   - `find role button click --name "Create Company"`
   - `find label "Email" fill "test@test.com"`
   - `find text "Submit" click`
2. **@refs from snapshot** — for complex pages where text/role doesn't match:
   - `agent-browser --session guide-test snapshot -i` then use `@e1`, `@e2`...
3. **CSS selectors** — when DOM structure is known

### Step 2 — Find and Read the Guide

---

"📖 Reading the guide..."

---

After reading, narrate what you found:

---

"Got it — [N] parts covering [themes]."

---

Look for the guide in the milestone folder:

```bash
# Primary
docs/planning/milestones/{milestone-name}/GUIDE.md

# Fallback
docs/planning/milestones/{milestone-name}/step-by-step.md
```

If no guide exists, tell the user to run `/write-guide` first and stop.

Read the full guide. Parse its structure to identify:
- Prerequisites section (setup commands)
- Fresh Start Bootstrap section (reset + start sequence)
- Demo Flow parts (one per story, with numbered steps)
- Verification Checklist items
- **Automation annotations** — Look for `<!-- automation: ... -->` HTML comments after step descriptions. If present, this is a re-run. Collect them into a step-to-command map (keyed by step number). During Step 5, use these cached commands directly instead of discovering selectors from scratch.

### Step 3 — Execute Prerequisites

---

"🏗️ Running prerequisites..."

---

Per command, narrate: "✅ done" or "❌ investigating..." After all pass:

---

"✅ Environment ready."

---

Run the setup commands from the Prerequisites section:

1. Execute bash commands (e.g., `pnpm dev:start`, `prisma db push`, seed scripts)
2. Wait for services to be ready — verify with:
   ```bash
   agent-browser --session guide-test open {app-url}
   agent-browser --session guide-test wait --load networkidle
   ```
3. Run DB reset and seed commands as specified

**On failure:**
- Spawn a Task sub-agent to investigate and fix the issue
- Provide: the failed command, error output, relevant config files
- Document the fix in the Troubleshooting section of GUIDE.md immediately

### Step 4 — Execute Fresh Start Bootstrap

---

"🚀 Fresh start bootstrap..."

---

After completion:

---

"✅ Clean baseline ready."

---

Follow the bootstrap sequence from the guide. Use:
- Bash for CLI commands (reset scripts, docker commands, imports)
- `agent-browser` for any browser verification steps

Verify each bootstrap step succeeds before moving to the next.

### Step 5 — Walk Through Demo Flow

This is the main loop. For each **Part** in the Demo Flow, narrate as you go using these templates:

| Beat | Narrator Template |
|------|-------------------|
| Part start | "🎬 Part [N]: [title]" |
| Step pass | "✅ [N.M] — [what was verified]" |
| Step fail | "❌ [N.M] — expected [X], got [Y]. Investigating..." |
| After fix | "🔧 Fixed: [one-liner]. Re-running..." |
| Part done | "🎬 Part [N] done — [X/Y] first-pass." |
| Progress (every 5 steps or end of Part) | "📊 [X]/[total] steps, [Y] first-pass, [Z] fixes." |

#### 5.1 — Read the Part

Read the current Part from the guide. Identify:
- Step numbers and descriptions
- URLs to navigate to
- UI elements to interact with (button names, field labels)
- Expected outcomes (what should appear)

#### 5.2 — Execute Each Step

**Replay-first:** If an `<!-- automation: ... -->` annotation exists for this step (collected in Step 2), run that cached command first. If it passes, mark the step done — no discovery needed. If it fails (e.g., selector became stale after a code change), fall through to the normal discovery flow below and update the annotation with the new working command after it passes.

For each numbered step, use the **leanest selector approach**:

**Navigation:**
```bash
agent-browser --session guide-test open {url}
agent-browser --session guide-test wait --load networkidle
```

**Interaction (prefer semantic locators):**
```bash
# Buttons — use role + name from guide
agent-browser --session guide-test find role button click --name "Create Company"

# Form fields — use label from guide
agent-browser --session guide-test find label "Company Name" fill "Acme Corp"

# Text links — use text content
agent-browser --session guide-test find text "View handsets" click

# Dropdowns
agent-browser --session guide-test find label "Division" select "Sales"
```

**Fallback to snapshot + @refs:**
```bash
agent-browser --session guide-test snapshot -i
# Identify the right ref from output
agent-browser --session guide-test click @e3
```

**Verification:**
```bash
# Check page state
agent-browser --session guide-test snapshot -i -c

# Check specific text
agent-browser --session guide-test get text @ref
agent-browser --session guide-test find text "Expected Content" is visible

# Check URL changed
agent-browser --session guide-test get url

# Take screenshot for evidence
agent-browser --session guide-test screenshot /tmp/guide-test-step-{N}.png
```

#### 5.3 — Handle Failures

When a step fails:

1. **Screenshot the failure:**
   ```bash
   agent-browser --session guide-test screenshot /tmp/guide-test-failure-{step}.png
   ```

2. **Spawn a Task sub-agent to investigate.** Provide:
   - Step description from the guide
   - Expected vs actual outcome
   - Screenshot path
   - Relevant source file paths (from the milestone's git diff)

3. **Classify and fix:**

   | Failure Type | Action | Guide Update |
   |-------------|--------|-------------|
   | **Code bug** | Sub-agent fixes source code, re-run step | Add to "Bugs Fixed During Validation" table |
   | **Guide inaccuracy** | Update the Demo Flow step in-place | Fix URL, label, or instruction text |
   | **Timing issue** | Add `wait` command before the step | Add to "Agent-Browser Automation Gotchas" |
   | **Missing prerequisite** | Add setup step to Prerequisites | Update Prerequisites section |
   | **Flaky behavior** | Add retry or explicit wait | Note in Troubleshooting |

4. **Re-run the step** after fixing to confirm it passes.

#### 5.4 — Update GUIDE.md Immediately

After each step outcome, update the guide **right now** (don't batch):

- **Step passed** — Check off the corresponding Verification Checklist item: `- [x] Description (validated {date})`
- **Record automation command** — Embed the exact `agent-browser` command(s) that worked as an HTML comment directly after the step in the guide:
  ```markdown
  3.2 Click "Create Company" and fill in the form

  <!-- automation: agent-browser --session guide-test find role button click --name "Create Company" -->
  ```
  Format: `<!-- automation: {exact command} -->` — one comment per step. If a step required multiple commands (navigate + interact + verify), record all of them separated by ` && `. If an annotation already exists, replace it with the new working command.
- **Guide inaccuracy fixed** — Edit the Demo Flow step in-place with correct info
- **Code bug fixed** — Add entry to "Bugs Fixed During Validation" table:
  ```markdown
  | Bug | Fix | Step |
  |-----|-----|------|
  | Description of bug | What was changed | Part N, Step N.M |
  ```
- **Timing issue** — Add to "Agent-Browser Automation Gotchas" section
- **New troubleshooting discovery** — Add problem/solution pair to Troubleshooting

#### 5.5 — Track Progress

Maintain running counts:
- Steps attempted
- Steps passed on first try
- Guide corrections made
- Code bugs fixed
- Steps still failing

### Step 6 — Final Guide Review

---

"📖 Final read-through for consistency..."

---

After all Demo Flow parts are complete:

1. Re-read the full GUIDE.md
2. Verify all incremental updates are consistent (no contradictions)
3. Ensure these sections are current:
   - Verification Checklist — all tested items checked
   - Gap Analysis — updated with findings
   - Troubleshooting — includes all discovered issues
   - Agent-Browser Automation Gotchas — includes all timing/selector notes
4. Fix any formatting issues from incremental edits

### Step 7 — Final Report

---

"🏁 Here's how the guide held up..."

---

Present a narrator-framed summary:

---

"🏁 **[N] steps**, ✅ **[N] first-pass** ([%]%). 🔧 [N] guide fixes, [N] code fixes. [conditional: ❌ [N] still broken / ✅ all clear]. Guide at `[path]` is battle-tested."

---

Then provide the detailed breakdown:

- **Bugs Fixed:** `[file:line] — description` for each
- **Guide Corrections:** `[section] — what changed` for each
- **Remaining Issues:** `[step] — what's still broken and why` for each (if any)

## Sub-Agent Patterns

### Bug Investigation Sub-Agent

Spawn via Task tool when a step fails due to a code bug:

```
Provide to the sub-agent:
- Step description from the guide
- Expected behavior vs actual behavior
- Screenshot path: /tmp/guide-test-failure-{step}.png
- Relevant source files (from git diff)
- Error messages from console: `agent-browser --session guide-test errors`

Sub-agent tasks:
1. Read the source files
2. Find root cause
3. Implement fix
4. Report what was changed
```

### Guide Section Writing Sub-Agent

For large milestones, delegate individual Part sections:

```
Provide to the sub-agent:
- Story excerpts (narrative + acceptance criteria)
- Git diff summary for the story's scope
- Reference guide section to follow (format/style)
- Project setup context (URLs, ports, etc.)
```

## Error Recovery

| Problem | Recovery |
|---------|----------|
| Service won't start | Check `docker ps`, look for port conflicts, try reset script |
| DB issues | Verify postgres running, try `prisma db push`, re-run seed |
| agent-browser session died | `agent-browser --session guide-test close` then re-open URL |
| Element not found | Re-snapshot, check if page loaded, add `wait`, try different selector |
| Context overflow | Delegate remaining Parts to sub-agents via Task tool |
| Flaky async content | Add `wait --load networkidle` or `wait --text "Expected"` before interaction |
