# Gatsby Content Management

Assist with adding and managing content in this Gatsby art portfolio site.

## Adding a New Painting

### Step 1: Verify the Image

1. Confirm image file exists in `content/paintings/images/`
2. Filename is derived from painting title (e.g., "Night Hours" → `night-hours.jpg`)
3. Supported formats: JPG, PNG, WebP
4. Recommended: High resolution (at least 1200px on longest side)

### Step 2: Determine Order Value

Check existing paintings in `content/paintings/paintings.yaml` and find the maximum `order` value. New paintings typically get `order: <max + 1>` unless specific placement is requested.

### Step 3: Add YAML Entry

Add to `content/paintings/paintings.yaml`:

```yaml
- title: Painting Title
  description: >-
    A detailed description of the painting. Can span
    multiple lines using YAML block scalar.
  dimensions:
    width: 40.6
    height: 50.8
    unit: cm
  substrate: canvas
  substrateSize:
    width: 40.6
    height: 50.8
    unit: cm
  medium: acrylic
  year: '2024'
  alt: Descriptive alt text for screen readers
  order: 1
```

Note: The `id` and image filename are derived automatically from the title.

### Required Fields

| Field           | Format                        | Example                                   |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `title`         | Title case                    | `Autumn Leaves`                           |
| `description`   | Plain text                    | `A vibrant fall scene...`                 |
| `dimensions`    | Object with width/height/unit | `{ width: 40.6, height: 50.8, unit: cm }` |
| `substrate`     | String (canvas, paper, etc.)  | `canvas`                                  |
| `substrateSize` | Object with width/height/unit | `{ width: 40.6, height: 50.8, unit: cm }` |
| `medium`        | Art medium description        | `acrylic`                                 |
| `year`          | String (quoted)               | `'2024'`                                  |
| `alt`           | Accessibility text            | `Colorful maple leaves...`                |
| `order`         | Integer                       | `5`                                       |

### Step 4: Add Translations (Optional)

For non-English translations, add entries to `content/paintings/locales/{lang}/painting-locales.yaml`:

```yaml
# content/paintings/locales/zh/painting-locales.yaml
paintings:
  - id: painting-title # kebab-case of original title
    title: 中文标题
    description: 中文描述
    alt: 中文替代文本
```

### Step 5: Validate

```bash
make build  # Verify GraphQL picks up the new content
make test   # Ensure no regressions
```

## Editing the About Page

About pages are internationalized. Edit the appropriate language file in `content/about/`:

- `content/about/en.md` - English
- `content/about/zh.md` - Chinese (Simplified)
- `content/about/yue.md` - Cantonese

```markdown
---
title: About
artistName: ';-)'
photo: about.jpeg
locale: en
---

Markdown content here...
```

- `locale` field must match the filename language code
- Photo path is relative to the about directory
- Body supports full Markdown syntax

## Site Configuration

### Invariant Data

Edit `content/site/site.yaml` for data that doesn't change by language:

```yaml
site:
  name: lulutracy
  author: Tracy Mah
  email: tracy@lulutracy.com
  url: https://our-nature.github.io/lulutracy.com
```

### UI Translations

Edit `locales/{lang}/common.json` for navigation, buttons, and other UI text:

```json
{
  "nav": {
    "about": "about",
    "home": "lulutracy"
  },
  "theme": {
    "switchToDark": "Switch to dark mode",
    "switchToLight": "Switch to light mode"
  }
}
```

**Translation files by namespace:**

- `common.json` - Shared UI strings (nav, buttons)
- `about.json` - About page specific strings
- `painting.json` - Painting detail page strings
- `404.json` - 404 page strings

## Supported Languages

| Code  | Language             |
| ----- | -------------------- |
| `en`  | English (default)    |
| `zh`  | Chinese (Simplified) |
| `yue` | Cantonese            |

## Common Issues

**Painting not showing**: Check that the image filename matches the kebab-case of the title.

**Build fails**: Verify YAML syntax (proper indentation, quoted strings where needed).

**Image not processing**: Ensure image is in `content/paintings/images/` (not elsewhere).

**Translation not appearing**: Verify the `locale` field matches the filename and the language code is correct.
