name: codify
description: This skill should be used when implementing patterns as Claude Code components (skills, commands, hooks, agents), or when "codify", "capture workflow", "turn into a skill", or "make reusable" are mentioned. For pattern identification, see patterns skill. Use when this capability is needed.

# Codify

Identified pattern → component mapping → implementation.

<when_to_use>

- Spotting repeated behavior worth codifying
- User explicitly wants to capture a workflow
- Recognizing orchestration sequences in conversation
- Identifying decision heuristics being applied

NOT for: one-off tasks, simple questions, well-documented existing patterns

</when_to_use>

<pattern_types>

| Type | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Workflow | Multi-step sequences | Debug → Test → Fix → Verify |
| Orchestration | Tool coordination | Git + Linear + PR automation |
| Heuristic | Decision rules | "When X, do Y because Z" |

Workflows: Step-by-step processes with defined stages and transitions.
Orchestration: Tool combinations that work together for a goal.
Heuristics: Conditional logic and decision trees for common situations.

</pattern_types>

<component_mapping>

Match pattern type to implementation:

```text
Is it a multi-step process with stages?
├─ Yes → Does it need tool restrictions?
│        ├─ Yes → Skill (with allowed_tools)
│        └─ No → Skill
└─ No → Is it a simple entry point?
         ├─ Yes → Command (thin wrapper → Skill)
         └─ No → Is it autonomous/long-running?
                  ├─ Yes → Agent
                  └─ No → Is it reactive to events?
                           ├─ Yes → Hook
                           └─ No → Probably doesn't need codifying
```

Composites:
- Skill + Command: Skill holds logic, command provides entry point
- Skill + Hook: Skill holds logic, hook triggers automatically
- Agent + Skill: Agent orchestrates, skill provides methodology

</component_mapping>

<specification>

Pattern spec format (YAML):

```yaml
name: pattern-name
type: workflow | orchestration | heuristic
trigger: when to apply
stages:  # workflow
  - name: stage-name
    actions: [...]
    exit_criteria: condition
tools:   # orchestration
  - tool: name
    role: purpose
    sequence: order
rules:   # heuristic
  - condition: when
    action: what
    rationale: why
quality:
  specific: true | false
  repeatable: true | false
  valuable: true | false
  documented: true | false
  scoped: true | false
```

All five quality checks must pass before codifying.

</specification>

<workflow>

1. Identify: Spot repeatable behavior in conversation
   - If hint/argument provided, focus analysis on that specific pattern
   - Otherwise scan for: workflows, orchestrations, and heuristics worth capturing
   - For deep analysis, load `outfitter:codebase-recon` skill and use `outfitter:patterns` techniques
   - Extract success, frustration, workflow, and request signals
   - Look for 3+ occurrences of similar behavior
2. Classify: Workflow, Orchestration, or Heuristic?
3. Map: Which component(s) should implement it?
4. Specify: Document with pattern spec format
5. Quality: Validate against SRVDS criteria
6. Implement: Create the component(s)

Task stages:

```text
- Identify { pattern description }
- Classify { pattern type }
- Map { component decision }
- Specify { pattern name }
- Implement { component type }
```

</workflow>

<quality>

SRVDS criteria — all must pass:

| Check | Question | Red Flag |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Specific | Clear trigger + scope? | "Sometimes useful" |
| Repeatable | Works across contexts? | One-off solution |
| Valuable | Worth the overhead? | Saves < 5 minutes |
| Documented | Can others understand? | Tribal knowledge |
| Scoped | Single responsibility? | Kitchen sink |

Skip if: < 3 occurrences, context-dependent, simpler inline

</quality>

<anti_patterns>

- Premature abstraction: Codifying after first occurrence
- Over-specification: 50-line spec for 5-line pattern
- Wrong component: Hook when Skill needed, Agent when Command suffices
- Missing trigger: Pattern exists but no clear activation
- Scope creep: Pattern grows to handle edge cases

</anti_patterns>

<rules>

ALWAYS:
- Identify pattern type before choosing component
- Validate all SRVDS criteria
- Start with minimal implementation
- Document trigger conditions clearly
- Test pattern in at least 2 contexts

NEVER:
- Codify after single occurrence
- Create Agent when Skill suffices
- Skip quality validation
- Implement without clear trigger
- Add "might need later" features

</rules>

**Identification vs Implementation**:
- `patterns` skill identifies and documents patterns
- This skill (`codify`) implements patterns as Claude Code components

Use `patterns` first to identify what's worth capturing. Use `codify` to turn identified patterns into skills, commands, hooks, or agents.

**Component skills** (loaded during implementation):
- `claude-skills` — skill authoring
- `claude-commands` — command authoring
- `claude-hooks` — hook authoring
- `claude-agents` — agent authoring
