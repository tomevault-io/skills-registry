# Documentation Audit Skill

Audit documentation files against the current codebase state, checking for accuracy, completeness, and freshness.

## Workflow

### Stage 1: Discovery

Run the discovery script to get a manifest of all markdown files with git metadata:

```bash
bun "$(dirname "$0")/scripts/discover-docs.ts" ${path ? `--path "${path}"` : ""} --limit 50 --sort staleness
```

Parse the JSON output to understand:
- Total documentation files in scope
- Activity status distribution (active/recent/idle/stale/ancient)
- Files with related code changes (potential staleness indicators)

### Stage 2: Prioritization

Select files for deep analysis based on `focus` argument:

| Focus | Strategy |
|-------|----------|
| `stale` | Prioritize files with oldest commits, especially those with recent related code changes |
| `all` | Balanced sampling across activity statuses |
| `recent` | Focus on recently modified docs that may have introduced errors |

Target: Select top `limit` files (default 10) for deep analysis.

### Stage 3: Deep Analysis

For each selected file, perform these checks:

#### 3.1 Correctness (see references/correctness-checklist.md)

- [ ] Code examples use correct imports/require paths
- [ ] Function signatures match current implementation
- [ ] Configuration examples reflect current schema
- [ ] CLI commands and flags are accurate
- [ ] Environment variables mentioned actually exist

#### 3.2 Link Validation

- [ ] Internal markdown links (`[text](./other.md)`) resolve
- [ ] Anchor links (`[text](#section)`) point to existing headings
- [ ] Image references exist
- [ ] External URLs (sample only if many) - note but don't block on these

#### 3.3 Completeness (see references/completeness-checklist.md)

- [ ] Required sections present (varies by doc type)
- [ ] All public exports documented (for API docs)
- [ ] Examples provided for complex features
- [ ] Error handling documented where relevant

### Stage 4: Docstring Coverage

Check TSDoc/JSDoc/docstring coverage for code files related to the documentation:

**TypeScript/JavaScript:**
```bash
# Find exports without TSDoc
grep -rn "^export " --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" | head -20
# vs exports with TSDoc (/** precedes export)
grep -B1 "^export " --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" | grep -c "/\*\*"
```

**Python:**
```bash
# Find functions/classes without docstrings
grep -rn "^def \|^class " --include="*.py" | head -20
```

**Rust:**
```bash
# Find pub items without doc comments
grep -rn "^pub " --include="*.rs" | head -20
```

**Go:**
```bash
# Find exported funcs without godoc
grep -rn "^func [A-Z]" --include="*.go" | head -20
```

Calculate coverage percentage per language detected.

### Stage 5: Report Generation

First, generate the report path using the helper script:

```bash
REPORT_PATH=$(bun "$(dirname "$0")/scripts/report-path.ts" --session "${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}" --json)
# Extracts: timestamp, sessionShort, path, timestampISO
```

Write the report to the generated path (e.g., `.pack/reports/202601251900-docs-audit-a7b3c2d1.md`):

```markdown
---
type: docs-audit
generated: {timestampISO}
timestamp: "{timestamp}"
session: "{CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}"
session_short: "{sessionShort}"
scope: {path or "entire repo"}
focus: {focus}
files_analyzed: {count}
files_total: {total}
status: {pass|needs-work|critical}
---

# Documentation Audit Report

**Generated**: {timestamp}
**Session**: `{sessionShort}`
**Scope**: {path or "entire repo"}
**Files analyzed**: {count} / {total}
**Focus**: {focus}

## Summary

| Dimension | Status | Score |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Correctness | {PASS/NEEDS WORK} | {x}/{y} files |
| Links | {PASS/NEEDS WORK} | {valid}/{total} |
| Docstrings | {GOOD/ACCEPTABLE/POOR} | {x}% |
| Freshness | {CURRENT/STALE} | {stale_count} files |

## Critical Issues (blocking)

Issues that could cause user confusion or errors:
- {file}: {issue description}

## Warnings (should fix)

Non-blocking but should be addressed:
- {file}: {issue description}

## Stale Documentation

Files that may need review (old docs + recent code changes):
- {file}: Last updated {days}d ago, related code changed {code_days}d ago

## Docstring Coverage by Language

| Language | Coverage | Files Checked |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| TypeScript | {x}% | {n} |
| Python | {x}% | {n} |

## Recommendations

1. {Prioritized recommendation}
2. {Next recommendation}
```

## Report Output

### Path Generation & Scaffolding

Use the `report-path.ts` helper script to generate paths and scaffold directories:

```bash
# Get just the path
bun scripts/report-path.ts --session "${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}"
# → .pack/reports/202601251900-docs-audit-a7b3c2d1.md

# Scaffold the directory structure (creates .pack/reports/)
bun scripts/report-path.ts --scaffold --session "${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}"

# Multi-file mode: scaffold with placeholder files
bun scripts/report-path.ts --scaffold --multi --session "${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}"
# Creates:
#   .pack/reports/202601251900-docs-audit/
#   .pack/reports/202601251900-docs-audit/summary.md
#   .pack/reports/202601251900-docs-audit/markdown-docs.md
#   .pack/reports/202601251900-docs-audit/docstrings.md
#   .pack/reports/202601251900-docs-audit/recommendations.md
#   .pack/reports/202601251900-docs-audit/meta.json

# Get all components as JSON (includes scaffolded paths if --scaffold used)
bun scripts/report-path.ts --scaffold --multi --session "${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}" --json
```

### Default Location

Reports are written to `.pack/reports/` with frontloaded timestamp:

```
.pack/reports/202601251900-docs-audit-a7b3c2d1.md   # Single file (with session)
.pack/reports/202601251900-docs-audit.md            # Single file (no session)
.pack/reports/202601251900-docs-audit/              # Multi-file (no session in dir name)
```

**Filename patterns:**
- **Single-file**: `{timestamp}-docs-audit-{sessionShort}.md` (session for parallel disambiguation)
- **Multi-file**: `{timestamp}-docs-audit/` (session tracked in frontmatter inside files)

### Multi-File Mode

For comprehensive audits covering different documentation types, use `--multi`:

```
.pack/reports/202601251900-docs-audit/
├── summary.md           # Overall findings + links to other reports
├── markdown-docs.md     # docs/, README, etc.
├── docstrings.md        # TSDoc/JSDoc/docstring coverage
├── recommendations.md   # Prioritized actionable recommendations
└── meta.json            # Session metadata (structured, machine-readable)
```

Each file includes frontmatter with full session ID for traceability.

### Frontmatter Schema

All report artifacts include YAML frontmatter for searchability:

```yaml
---
type: docs-audit           # Report type (searchable)
generated: 2026-01-25T19:00:00Z
timestamp: "202601251900"
session: abc123-def456...  # Full session ID
session_short: a7b3c2d1    # First 8 chars (matches filename)
scope: docs/               # Audit scope
focus: stale               # Focus strategy used
files_analyzed: 10
files_total: 47
status: needs-work         # pass | needs-work | critical
---
```

**Why frontmatter:**
- Grep/ripgrep searchable (`rg "session: abc123"`)
- Tooling can parse and aggregate reports
- Enables filtering by status, scope, date range
- Parallel agent runs are distinguishable by session

### Session ID for Parallel Agents

**Single-file mode** uses session suffix for parallel disambiguation:

```
.pack/reports/202601251900-docs-audit-a7b3c2d1.md  # Agent 1
.pack/reports/202601251900-docs-audit-f8e9d0c1.md  # Agent 2
.pack/reports/202601251900-docs-audit-12345678.md  # Agent 3
```

**Multi-file mode** relies on timestamps (coordinated audits typically don't run in parallel). Session is tracked inside each file's frontmatter for traceability.

### Custom Output

Override the default location (session ID still included in frontmatter):

```
/docs-audit --output docs/audits/latest.md
/docs-audit --multi --output .pack/reports/202601-quarterly/
```

Note: Custom filenames don't auto-include session ID prefix - use frontmatter for tracking.

### Output Behavior

1. **Create directory** if it doesn't exist
2. **Write report(s)** with session ID embedded
3. **Print summary** to conversation (critical issues + file path)
4. **Return path** so user can open/commit the report

### Git Considerations

The default `.pack/reports/` location:
- Should be gitignored for ephemeral reports
- Can be selectively committed for audit history
- Keeps reports separate from actual documentation

## Context Efficiency

This skill uses `context: fork` to run in isolation. The token budget strategy:

| Stage | Token Target | Strategy |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| Discovery | ~200-500 | Script output is compact JSON |
| Prioritization | ~100 | Selection logic only |
| Deep Analysis | ~500-2000/file | Read only selected files |
| Docstring Check | ~500 | Grep summaries, not full files |
| Report | ~1000 | Structured output |

**Total target**: 15-30k tokens for a typical audit.

## Task Management

Use task tools (`TaskCreate`, `TaskUpdate`, `TaskList`) to track progress through stages. Tasks survive context compaction and allow resumption if the audit is interrupted.

### Initial Task Setup

After discovery, create tasks for the audit stages:

```
TaskCreate:
  subject: "Run docs-audit discovery"
  activeForm: "Running discovery script"
  description: "Execute discover-docs.ts, parse manifest, identify {n} files in scope"

TaskCreate:
  subject: "Analyze {n} priority docs"
  activeForm: "Analyzing documentation"
  description: "Deep analysis of top {limit} files for correctness, links, completeness"

TaskCreate:
  subject: "Check docstring coverage"
  activeForm: "Checking docstring coverage"
  description: "Grep exports vs documented exports per detected language"

TaskCreate:
  subject: "Generate audit report"
  activeForm: "Generating report"
  description: "Compile findings into .pack/reports/{timestamp}-docs-audit-{sessionShort}.md"
```

### Progress Tracking

Update tasks as you work:

1. **Before starting a stage** → `TaskUpdate` with `status: in_progress`
2. **After completing a stage** → `TaskUpdate` with `status: completed`, update description with key findings
3. **If issues found** → `TaskCreate` follow-up tasks for fixes

### State Persistence

Before context approaches limit, update task descriptions with checkpoint data:

```
TaskUpdate:
  taskId: "2"
  description: |
    [CHECKPOINT] Analyzed 7/10 docs.
    Critical: 2 broken imports in api.md (lines 45, 89)
    Warnings: 3 stale files (config.md, setup.md, advanced.md)
    Remaining: config.md, setup.md, advanced.md
```

This ensures findings survive compaction even if the stage isn't complete.

### Resumption

If context resets mid-audit:
1. `TaskList` to see current state
2. `TaskGet` on `in_progress` task to read checkpoint data
3. Skip completed stages
4. Resume from checkpoint, don't re-analyze completed files
5. Reference persisted findings in final report

## Handling Edge Cases

**No documentation found:**
Report "No markdown files found in {scope}. Consider adding documentation for your project."

**Very large repos (100+ docs):**
- Stick to `limit` parameter strictly
- Focus on highest-staleness files
- Note total count in report for context

**Non-git repos:**
- Skip git-based metadata (SHA, author, etc.)
- Use file modification times as fallback
- Note "Git metadata unavailable" in report

**Mixed language repos:**
- Detect languages from file extensions
- Report coverage per detected language
- Skip languages with no source files

## Example Invocations

```
/docs-audit                                    # Single report to .pack/reports/
/docs-audit --path docs/                       # Scope to docs/ directory
/docs-audit --focus all --limit 20             # Analyze 20 files across all statuses
/docs-audit --multi                            # Multi-file mode with separate reports
/docs-audit --output docs/audits/latest.md     # Custom output location
/docs-audit --multi --path src/                # Multi-file audit of src/ docs
```
