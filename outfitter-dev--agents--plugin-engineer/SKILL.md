# Plugin Engineer

Transform external repositories into Claude Code plugins.

```text
External Repo → Research → Recon → Patterns → Codify → Author → Package → Audit → Plugin
```

## Steps

1. Clarify target repo and plugin goals
2. Load the `outfitter:research` skill for external discovery (docs, APIs, community patterns)
3. Load the `outfitter:codebase-recon` skill for internal analysis of target repo
4. Load the `outfitter:patterns` skill to extract repeatable patterns worth automating
5. Load the `outfitter:codify` skill to map patterns to component types
6. Author components using `outfitter:skills-dev` or `outfitter:claude-skills`
7. Load the `outfitter:claude-plugins` skill to package into distributable plugin
8. Delegate by loading the `outfitter:claude-plugin-audit` skill for validation

<when_to_use>

- Turning a CLI tool into a Claude Code plugin
- Creating skills that wrap an external library or API
- Building plugin companions for MCP servers
- Extracting automation opportunities from a third-party repo
- Packaging workflow patterns around external tools

NOT for: plugins from scratch (use `claude-plugins`), single-skill creation (use `skills-dev`), existing Claude Code plugins (use `claude-plugin-audit`)

</when_to_use>

## Artifact Structure

Track progress with artifacts in `artifacts/plugin-engineer/`:

```text
artifacts/plugin-engineer/
├── discovery.md      # Research output (docs, APIs, community patterns)
├── recon.md          # Codebase analysis (structure, conventions, key files)
├── patterns.md       # Extracted patterns with automation value
├── mapping.md        # Pattern → component mapping decisions
├── components/       # Authored skills, agents, hooks, commands
│   ├── skill-1/
│   ├── skill-2/
│   └── ...
└── audit.md          # Plugin validation results
```

## Quick Mode

For simple repos (single-purpose CLI, small API wrapper):

1. Skip stages 3-4 — go direct from recon to authoring
2. Create 1-2 skills covering primary use cases
3. Package immediately

Trigger: User says "quick", repo has < 5 main commands, or clear single purpose.

## Stages

Load the **maintain-tasks** skill for stage tracking. Stages advance only.

| Stage | Skill | activeForm |
|-------|-------|------------|
| 1. Discovery | `outfitter:research` | "Researching external docs" |
| 2. Recon | `outfitter:codebase-recon` | "Analyzing target repo" |
| 3. Patterns | `outfitter:patterns` | "Extracting patterns" |
| 4. Mapping | `outfitter:codify` | "Mapping to components" |
| 5. Authoring | `outfitter:skills-dev` | "Creating components" |
| 6. Packaging | `outfitter:claude-plugins` | "Packaging plugin" |
| 7. Audit | `outfitter:claude-plugin-audit` | "Validating plugin" |

<workflow>

### Stage 1: Discovery

Load `outfitter:research` skill. Gather external docs, community patterns, pain points.

See [stage-1-discovery.md](references/stage-1-discovery.md) for details.

### Stage 2: Recon

Load `outfitter:codebase-recon` skill. Analyze structure, API surface, conventions.

See [stage-2-recon.md](references/stage-2-recon.md) for details.

### Stage 3: Patterns

Load `outfitter:patterns` skill. Extract workflows, command sequences, decision points.

See [stage-3-patterns.md](references/stage-3-patterns.md) for details.

### Stage 4: Mapping

Load `outfitter:codify` skill. Map patterns to component types (skill, command, hook, agent).

See [stage-4-mapping.md](references/stage-4-mapping.md) for details.

### Stage 5: Authoring

Load appropriate skill per component type. Create in `artifacts/plugin-engineer/components/`.

See [stage-5-authoring.md](references/stage-5-authoring.md) for details.

### Stage 6: Packaging

Load `outfitter:claude-plugins` skill. Create plugin structure with manifest and README.

Ask: "Do you have an existing marketplace to add this plugin to?" If yes, prepare the marketplace entry.

See [stage-6-packaging.md](references/stage-6-packaging.md) for details.

### Stage 7: Audit

Delegate by loading `outfitter:claude-plugin-audit` skill. Validate before distribution.

See [stage-7-audit.md](references/stage-7-audit.md) for details.

<decision_points>

Key decisions during engineering process:

**Which patterns to automate?**
- High frequency + medium complexity = best ROI
- Low frequency + high complexity = consider if audience is technical
- One-off patterns = skip

**Skills vs Commands?**
- Multi-step, needs guidance → Skill
- Quick action, obvious usage → Command
- User entry point to skill → Both (command loads skill)

**Include agents?**
- Only for complex repos with orchestration needs
- Most plugins don't need custom agents
- Consider if existing agents (analyst, engineer) suffice

**Quick mode vs full pipeline?**
- Single-purpose tool → Quick mode
- Complex tool with many features → Full pipeline
- Unclear → Start with recon, decide after

</decision_points>

<rules>

ALWAYS:
- Start with discovery before touching code
- Track artifacts at each stage
- Validate patterns have 3+ use cases before creating components
- Use existing skills for authoring (don't reinvent)
- Run audit before declaring complete

NEVER:
- Skip recon stage (even for familiar repos)
- Create agents without clear orchestration need
- Package without audit validation
- Over-engineer (simpler plugin > feature-complete plugin)

</rules>
