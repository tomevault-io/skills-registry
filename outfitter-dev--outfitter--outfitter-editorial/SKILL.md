# Editorial Review

Complete editorial pass for Outfitter documentation — covering voice, style, correctness, and completeness in a single skill.

## Steps

1. **Load skills**: Load the `outfitter-voice` and `outfitter-styleguide` skills. If you cannot, do not proceed — report the failure.
2. **Identify target**: $ARGUMENTS — can be:
   - A file path (`README.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`)
   - A directory (`docs/`)
   - A focus area (`voice`, `correctness`, `code examples`)
   - A specific question (`are all links valid?`)
   - Empty — review the most relevant doc in the current context
3. **Voice**: Verify Outfitter voice (see `outfitter-voice` skill): confident stance, agent-first framing, plain language over jargon.
4. **Style**: Verify craft patterns (see `outfitter-styleguide` skill): punch-and-flow rhythm, earned enthusiasm, strong opening and closing.
5. **Technical checks**: Work through the verification checklist below.
6. **Report**: Structured output per [TEMPLATE.md](TEMPLATE.md). If the document is ready, say so briefly. If it needs work, be specific about locations and fixes.

## Verification Checklist

| API signatures match      | Compare documented signatures against source code.              |

| Cross-references | Related docs linked where helpful.                       |
| Agent-friendly   | Structured for AI consumption (clear headers, examples). |
