# Skill Distillery

Transform external repositories into Claude Code plugins.

```text
External Repo → Research → Recon → Patterns → Codify → Author → Package → Audit → Plugin
```

## Steps

1. Clarify target repo and plugin goals
2. Load the `research` skill for external discovery (docs, APIs, community patterns)
3. Load the `codebase-analysis` skill for internal analysis of target repo
4. Load the `find-patterns` skill to extract repeatable patterns worth automating
5. Load the `codify` skill to map patterns to component types
6. Author components using `skillcraft` or `claude-craft`
7. Load the `claude-plugins` skill to package into distributable plugin
8. Validate using the `claude-plugins` audit checklists

<when_to_use>

- Turning a CLI tool into a Claude Code plugin
- Creating skills that wrap an external library or API
- Building plugin companions for MCP servers
- Extracting automation opportunities from a third-party repo
- Packaging workflow patterns around external tools

NOT for: plugins from scratch (use `claude-plugins`), single-skill creation (use `skillcraft`), auditing existing plugins (use `claude-plugins`)

</when_to_use>

## Artifact Structure

Track progress with artifacts in `artifacts/skill-distillery/`:

```text
artifacts/skill-distillery/
├── discovery.md      # Research output (docs, APIs, community patterns)
├── recon.md          # Codebase analysis (structure, conventions, key files)
├── patterns.md       # Extracted patterns with automation value
├── mapping.md        # Pattern → component mapping decisions
├── components/       # Authored skills, agents, hooks, commands
│   ├── skill-1/
│   ├── skill-2/
│   └── ...
└── audit.md          # Plugin validation results
```

## Quick Mode

For simple repos (single-purpose CLI, small API wrapper):

1. Skip stages 3-4 — go direct from recon to authoring
2. Create 1-2 skills covering primary use cases
3. Package immediately

Trigger: User says "quick", repo has < 5 main commands, or clear single purpose.

## Stages

Load the `maintain-tasks` skill for stage tracking. Stages advance only.

| Stage        | Skill               | activeForm                  |
| ------------ | ------------------- | --------------------------- |
| 1. Discovery | `research`          | "Researching external docs" |
| 2. Recon     | `codebase-analysis` | "Analyzing target repo"     |
| 3. Patterns  | `find-patterns`     | "Extracting patterns"       |
| 4. Mapping   | `codify`            | "Mapping to components"     |
| 5. Authoring | `skillcraft`        | "Creating components"       |
| 6. Packaging | `claude-plugins`    | "Packaging plugin"          |
| 7. Audit     | `claude-plugins`    | "Validating plugin"         |

<workflow>

### Stage 1: Discovery

Load `research` skill. Gather external docs, community patterns, pain points.

See [stage-1-discovery.md](references/stage-1-discovery.md) for details.

### Stage 2: Recon

Load `codebase-analysis` skill. Analyze structure, API surface, conventions.

See [stage-2-recon.md](references/stage-2-recon.md) for details.

### Stage 3: Patterns

Load `find-patterns` skill. Extract workflows, command sequences, decision points.

See [stage-3-patterns.md](references/stage-3-patterns.md) for details.

### Stage 4: Mapping

Load `codify` skill. Map patterns to component types (skill, command, hook, agent).

See [stage-4-mapping.md](references/stage-4-mapping.md) for details.

### Stage 5: Authoring

Load appropriate skill per component type. Create in `artifacts/skill-distillery/components/`.

See [stage-5-authoring.md](references/stage-5-authoring.md) for details.

### Stage 6: Packaging

Load `claude-plugins` skill. Create plugin structure with manifest and README.

Ask: "Do you have an existing marketplace to add this plugin to?" If yes, prepare the marketplace entry.

See [stage-6-packaging.md](references/stage-6-packaging.md) for details.

### Stage 7: Audit

Validate using the `claude-plugins` audit checklists. See its `references/audit.md`.

See [stage-7-audit.md](references/stage-7-audit.md) for details.

<decision_points>

Key decisions during engineering process:

**Which patterns to automate?**

- High frequency + medium complexity = best ROI
- Low frequency + high complexity = consider if audience is technical
- One-off patterns = skip

**Skills vs Commands?**

- Multi-step, needs guidance → Skill
- Quick action, obvious usage → Command
- User entry point to skill → Both (command loads skill)

**Include agents?**

- Only for complex repos with orchestration needs
- Most plugins don't need custom agents
- Consider if existing agents (analyst, engineer) suffice

**Quick mode vs full pipeline?**

- Single-purpose tool → Quick mode
- Complex tool with many features → Full pipeline
- Unclear → Start with recon, decide after

</decision_points>

<rules>

ALWAYS:

- Start with discovery before touching code
- Track artifacts at each stage
- Validate patterns have 3+ use cases before creating components
- Use existing skills for authoring (don't reinvent)
- Run audit before declaring complete

NEVER:

- Skip recon stage (even for familiar repos)
- Create agents without clear orchestration need
- Package without audit validation
- Over-engineer (simpler plugin > feature-complete plugin)

</rules>
