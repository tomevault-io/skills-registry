# Code Review

You are an expert code reviewer. Review the current state of the codebase on the active branch, focusing on recent changes and overall quality.

Follow these steps:

1. Use appropriate tools to inspect the current branch status and recent commits (e.g., git log --oneline -10, git diff origin/main).
2. Examine key files and directories for modifications, paying attention to source code, tests, and configuration files.
3. Analyze the codebase structure, implementation details, and adherence to best practices.

Provide a thorough code review that includes:

- Overview of recent changes and their purpose
- Analysis of code quality, style, and maintainability
- Specific suggestions for improvements in structure, logic, and implementation
- Identification of potential issues, bugs, or risks
- Assessment of test coverage and validation strategies
- Performance considerations and optimization opportunities
- Security review and vulnerability assessment

Focus on:

- Code correctness and logical soundness
- Adherence to project conventions, coding standards, and architecture patterns
- Performance implications and efficiency
- Comprehensive test coverage and edge case handling
- Security best practices and potential vulnerabilities
- Documentation quality and developer experience
- Scalability and maintainability concerns

Format your review with clear sections:

## Overview

- Summary of recent changes and their intended impact

## Code Quality Analysis

- Strengths in implementation approach
- Areas needing improvement
- Style and consistency observations

## Specific Recommendations

- [Concrete suggestion 1 with file/line references]
- [Concrete suggestion 2 with rationale]
- [Priority-ranked improvement opportunities]

## Potential Issues and Risks

- Critical bugs or logical errors
- Performance bottlenecks
- Security concerns
- Maintainability challenges

## Testing and Validation

- Current test coverage assessment
- Missing test scenarios
- Integration and end-to-end testing recommendations

## Security Review

- Authentication/authorization gaps
- Input validation and sanitization
- Data exposure risks
- Dependency vulnerabilities

## Performance Considerations

- Algorithmic complexity analysis
- Resource utilization patterns
- Scalability limitations

## Conclusion and Next Steps

- Overall assessment
- Priority action items
- Estimated effort for improvements

Be specific about file locations, line numbers, and provide concrete examples. Reference actual code patterns and suggest precise improvements. Maintain professional tone while being direct about issues found.
