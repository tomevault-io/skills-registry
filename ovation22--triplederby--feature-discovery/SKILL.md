# Feature Discovery and Planning

## When to Use
- Planning a new game feature or capability
- Analyzing feature requirements and scope
- Breaking down complex features into implementable tasks
- Conducting feasibility studies for new mechanics
- Designing game systems (race mechanics, betting, training, etc.)

## Process

### Phase 1: Discovery
1. **Gather Context**: Ask clarifying questions about feature goals and game design intent
2. **Identify Requirements**: Document what the feature must do (functional requirements)
3. **Explore Constraints**: Understand technical, gameplay, and performance constraints
4. **Map Use Cases**: Identify player interactions and game scenarios
5. **Review Codebase**: Examine existing patterns and systems that may be affected

### Phase 2: Technical Analysis
1. **Evaluate Feasibility**: Assess technical viability within the current architecture
2. **Identify Dependencies**: Map relationships to existing systems (Race, Horse, Betting, etc.)
3. **Review Data Model**: Consider database schema changes needed
4. **Assess Integration Points**: Identify where new code connects to existing systems
5. **Consider Performance**: Evaluate impact on race simulation, UI responsiveness

### Phase 3: Planning
1. **Break Down Tasks**: Decompose the feature into concrete, implementable tasks
2. **Sequence Work**: Identify logical implementation phases and dependencies
3. **Estimate Complexity**: Note particularly complex or risky areas
4. **Create Task List**: Use TodoWrite to create a structured task breakdown
5. **Define Milestones**: Identify testable checkpoints and deliverables

### Phase 4: Documentation
1. **Write Specification**: Create clear feature requirements document
2. **Document Assumptions**: Record decisions and assumptions made during planning
3. **Define Success Criteria**: Establish how to validate the feature works correctly
4. **Reference Templates**: Use PLANNING_TEMPLATE.md and DISCOVERY_CHECKLIST.md

## Output

Create a feature specification document in `/docs/features/` that includes:

1. **Feature Summary**: One-paragraph overview
2. **Requirements**: Functional and non-functional requirements
3. **Technical Approach**: Architecture and integration points
4. **Implementation Plan**: Phased task breakdown
5. **Success Criteria**: How to validate correctness
6. **Open Questions**: Items needing further clarification

Use PLANNING_TEMPLATE.md as a starting point.

## Diagram Guidelines

**Use Mermaid for all diagrams:**

- **Architecture**: `graph TB` or `graph LR`
- **Sequences**: `sequenceDiagram`
- **State machines**: `stateDiagram-v2`
- **Data models**: `erDiagram`

Benefits: Renders in GitHub, version control friendly, no external files needed.

## Integration with Existing Systems

When planning features, consider integration with:
- **Core Entities**: Horse, Race, RaceRun, RaceRunHorse, Player
- **Services**: RaceService, simulation logic, game flow
- **Data Layer**: Entity Framework, repositories, ModelBuilderExtensions
- **Game Balance**: Stats, probabilities, progression systems

## Tools Used
- Read, Grep, Glob to explore the codebase
- TodoWrite for structured planning
- AskUserQuestion to clarify ambiguous requirements

## Next Steps

After completing discovery, use `/plan-implementation` to create a detailed implementation roadmap with TDD phases.
