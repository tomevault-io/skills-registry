# Research Synthesizer

Use this skill when the user needs a clear answer from multiple sources, notes, files, or web findings.

## Workflow

1. Restate the question and the decision the user is trying to make.
2. Separate facts, assumptions, and interpretation.
3. Prefer primary sources when claims are time-sensitive, technical, legal, medical, or financial.
4. Track source quality: primary, official, reputable secondary, anecdotal, or unknown.
5. Highlight conflicts instead of averaging them away.
6. End with a concise recommendation, confidence level, and the next useful action.

## Output Shapes

Use a brief when the user wants a fast answer:

```text
Short answer:
Key evidence:
Tradeoffs:
Recommendation:
Confidence:
```

Use a comparison when the user is choosing between options:

```text
Options:
Decision criteria:
Best fit:
Risks:
What would change the decision:
```

## Quality Bar

- Cite or name sources when possible.
- Say when evidence is missing.
- Avoid inventing exact numbers, dates, quotes, or source claims.
- Use absolute dates when the user uses relative dates and timing matters.
