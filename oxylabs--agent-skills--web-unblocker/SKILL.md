# Oxylabs Web Unblocker

AI-powered proxy solution that automatically manages fingerprinting, headers, retries, and JavaScript rendering.

## Endpoint

```
https://unblock.oxylabs.io:60000
```

## Authentication

HTTP Basic Auth via proxy credentials:

```bash
curl -k -x "https://unblock.oxylabs.io:60000" \
  -U "$OXYLABS_USERNAME:$OXYLABS_PASSWORD" \
  "https://example.com"
```

## Quick Start

**Basic request:**
```bash
curl -k -x "https://unblock.oxylabs.io:60000" \
  -U "$OXYLABS_USERNAME:$OXYLABS_PASSWORD" \
  "https://ip.oxylabs.io/headers"
```

**With JavaScript rendering:**
```bash
curl -k -x "https://unblock.oxylabs.io:60000" \
  -U "$OXYLABS_USERNAME:$OXYLABS_PASSWORD" \
  -H "x-oxylabs-render: html" \
  "https://example.com/spa-page"
```

## Headers

| Header | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `x-oxylabs-render` | `html` for rendered HTML, `png` for screenshot |
| `X-Oxylabs-Session-Id` | Reuse same IP across requests (any random string) |
| `X-Oxylabs-Geo-Location` | Target country (e.g., `Germany`, `United States`) |
| `x-oxylabs-force-headers: 1` | Enable custom header passthrough |
| `X-Oxylabs-Successful-Status-Codes` | Define custom success codes to prevent retries |

## Session Persistence

Reuse the same IP across multiple requests:

```bash
curl -k -x "https://unblock.oxylabs.io:60000" \
  -U "$OXYLABS_USERNAME:$OXYLABS_PASSWORD" \
  -H "X-Oxylabs-Session-Id: my-session-123" \
  "https://example.com/page1"
```

## Geo-Location Targeting

```bash
curl -k -x "https://unblock.oxylabs.io:60000" \
  -U "$OXYLABS_USERNAME:$OXYLABS_PASSWORD" \
  -H "X-Oxylabs-Geo-Location: Germany" \
  "https://example.com"
```

## When to Use Web Unblocker vs Regular Proxies

| Scenario | Use |
|----------|-----|
| Sites with anti-bot protection | Web Unblocker |
| CAPTCHAs, fingerprint detection | Web Unblocker |
| JavaScript-heavy SPAs | Web Unblocker with `x-oxylabs-render: html` |
| Simple requests, no protection | Regular Proxies |
| High volume, price sensitive | Regular Proxies |

## Key Guidelines

- Always use `-k` flag (or disable SSL verification) - the proxy uses its own certificates
- Add `x-oxylabs-render: html` if experiencing empty content or low success rates
- Avoid adding custom unblocking headers that may interfere with the AI
