description: Enforce git commit best practices using gitmoji + Conventional Commits format. TRIGGER when creating commits. Ensures quality-gate passes, prevents issue auto-closing (no Close/Fix keywords), includes Co-Authored-By for AI commits, and requires user approval before committing. Use when this capability is needed.

# Git Commit Guidelines

This skill enforces git commit best practices for the Packmind project, combining gitmoji for visual commit type identification with Conventional Commits format.

## TRIGGER CHECKLIST - Read This First

**TRIGGER THIS SKILL WHEN:**

- [ ] User asks you to commit changes
- [ ] User asks you to create a commit
- [ ] You are about to run `git commit`
- [ ] User says "commit this" or similar

**TRIGGER IMMEDIATELY** - before running any git commit command.

## Failure Examples - What NOT To Do

### Failure 1: Committing Without User Permission

```
User: "Fix the bug in the login function"

AI: [Fixes the bug]
AI: [Runs git commit directly without asking] ❌

CORRECT BEHAVIOR:
AI: [Fixes the bug]
AI: [Asks user: "Ready to commit. Here's the proposed message: ..."]
AI: [Waits for user approval]
AI: [Then commits]
```

### Failure 2: Using Close/Fix Before Issue References

```
AI: git commit -m "Fix login bug

Closes #123" ❌

CORRECT BEHAVIOR:
AI: git commit -m "Fix login bug

#123" ✓
```

### Failure 3: Skipping Quality Gate

```
AI: [Makes changes]
AI: [Commits immediately without running quality-gate] ❌

CORRECT BEHAVIOR:
AI: [Makes changes]
AI: [Runs npm run quality-gate]
AI: [Fixes any issues]
AI: [Then proposes commit]
```

### Failure 4: Missing Gitmoji

```
AI: git commit -m "feat(auth): add login validation" ❌

CORRECT BEHAVIOR:
AI: git commit -m "✨ feat(auth): add login validation" ✓
```

## Commit Message Format

```
<gitmoji> <type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<issue-reference>

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

## 7-Step Commit Workflow

### Step 1: Complete Work

Ensure all changes are complete and the feature/fix is working.

### Step 2: Run Quality Gate

```bash
npm run quality-gate
```

**MANDATORY**: This must pass before committing. Fix any issues found.

### Step 3: Review Changes

Run these commands to understand what will be committed:

```bash
git status
git diff --staged
```

If changes aren't staged, stage them first:

```bash
git add <files>
```

### Step 4: Prepare Commit Message

Compose the commit message following the format above:

1. Choose the appropriate gitmoji based on the change type
2. Write a clear subject line in imperative mood
3. Add body with bullet points if multiple changes
4. Include issue reference WITHOUT "Close/Fix/Resolve" prefix
5. Add Co-Authored-By footer

### Step 5: Ask User for Permission (MANDATORY)

**NEVER skip this step.** Present the commit to the user:

> Ready to commit. Here's the proposed message:
>
> ```
> <full commit message>
> ```
>
> Do you want me to proceed with this commit?

Wait for explicit user approval.

### Step 6: Create Commit

Use HEREDOC format to preserve formatting:

```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
✨ feat(scope): subject line here

- First change description
- Second change description

#123

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>
EOF
)"
```

**NEVER use `--no-verify`**

### Step 7: Verify Commit

After committing, verify it was successful:

```bash
git log -1 --pretty=format:"%h %s"
git status
```

- ✅ Use imperative mood in subject line ("add" not "added")
- ✅ Keep subject line under 72 characters
- ✅ Use bullet points with `-` for multi-line bodies
- ✅ Reference issues with just `#123` format

### DO NOT

- ❌ Never write commit messages in languages other than English (e.g., French, Spanish, etc.)

- ❌ Never use `--no-verify` flag
- ❌ Never use "Close", "Fix", or "Resolve" before issue numbers
