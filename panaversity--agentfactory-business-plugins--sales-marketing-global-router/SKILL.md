| Persona, ICP, buyer profile, audience     | skills/persona-icp/SKILL.md          |

## STEP 2 -- IDENTIFY TASK AND LOAD AGENT

| Query Pattern                                     | Load Agent                            |

| Weekly marketing report, automated analytics      | agents/marketing-performance-agent.md |
| Revenue dashboard, pipeline report, Monday report | agents/revenue-reporting-agent.md     |

## STEP 3 -- FOR OUTREACH TASKS: IDENTIFY JURISDICTION AND LOAD OVERLAY

| Jurisdiction / Region        | Load Overlay File                                 |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| USA / US / American          | references/jurisdictions/us-outreach-law.md       |
| EU / Europe / GDPR / Germany | references/jurisdictions/eu-outreach-law.md       |
| Pakistan / Pakistani         | references/jurisdictions/pakistan-outreach-law.md |
| GCC / UAE / Saudi / Bahrain  | references/jurisdictions/gcc-outreach-law.md      |
| Multi-jurisdictional         | Load ALL relevant overlays + flag for review      |
| Unknown / not stated         | Flag; apply most conservative standard            |

## STEP 3B -- SKILL COLLISION RESOLUTION (dual-plugin environment)

When the Anthropic base `knowledge-work-plugins/sales` and `/marketing` plugins are also
installed, the following overlapping skills are resolved automatically:

| Skill                | Base Plugin | Extension | Resolution   |
| -------------------- | ----------- | --------- | ------------ |
| campaign-planning    | Yes         | Yes       | **Wrapper**  |
| content-creation     | Yes         | Yes       | **Wrapper**  |
| prospect-research    | Yes         | Yes       | **Override** |
| outreach             | Yes         | Yes       | **Override** |
| pre-call-brief       | Yes         | Yes       | **Override** |
| performance-analysis | Yes         | Yes       | **Wrapper**  |
| pipeline             | Yes         | Yes       | **Override** |

- **Wrapper**: Route to extension skill. Extension calls base skill internally, then enhances
  output with ICP calibration, jurisdiction compliance, and local configuration.
- **Override**: Route to extension skill exclusively. Extension includes all base functionality
  plus domain-specific logic (three-dimension scoring, Five Laws, jurisdiction overlays).

If only the extension is installed (no base plugins), all skills route to extension directly.

## STEP 4 -- ALWAYS LOAD CONFIGURATION

Always load: sales-marketing.local.md
Check for:

- ICP definition (firmographic + technographic + timing signals)
- Brand voice configuration
- Competitor intelligence
- Persona profiles
- Messaging framework and positioning

IF sales-marketing.local.md NOT FOUND:
Inform user: "No ICP/brand configuration found. Outputs will use general
best practices. For better results, fill in sales-marketing.local.md.
Use the template provided in this skills library."

## STEP 5 -- MANDATORY OUTPUT HEADER (all sales outputs)

TASK: [e.g. Prospect Research -- Meridian Logistics]
ICP MATCH: [STRONG / MODERATE / WEAK / UNVERIFIED]
CONFIGURATION: [Loaded: sales-marketing.local.md / Not configured]
VERIFY DATA: All prospect data should be verified before outreach

## UNIVERSAL RULES -- NON-NEGOTIABLE

- NEVER fabricate prospect data -- only report what is verifiable from sources
- NEVER invent statistics, revenue figures, or company information;
  label estimates explicitly as "estimated" or "unverified"
- NEVER write an outreach message that is not personalised to at least one
  specific, verifiable fact about the prospect or their company
- NEVER lead an outreach message with your product or company name
- NEVER write marketing copy that makes claims the product cannot support
- NEVER skip ICP validation before building research or outreach materials --
  if a lead does not meet minimum ICP criteria, flag it first
- ALWAYS apply the Five Laws of Outreach before finalising any message
- ALWAYS provide specific, actionable recommendations in any analysis --
  observations without recommended actions are not acceptable outputs
- NEVER send a sequence touch after a prospect has replied -- reply = exit sequence
- ALWAYS check jurisdiction overlay for outreach to regulated markets

## THE FIVE LAWS OF OUTREACH (enforce on every message)

Law 1: Reference something specific and real
The message must contain at least one specific, verifiable reference that
proves you researched this person. Not generic -- specific.

Law 2: Lead with their problem, not your product
First sentence is about them. Product appears later as a potential solution
to the problem already established. Never lead with "We help companies..."

Law 3: One ask. One clear next step.
Every message ends with exactly one question or request. Not multiple options.

Law 4: Short.
Email: maximum 150 words. LinkedIn: maximum 100 words.
Every word must earn its place.

Law 5: Sound like a person, not a company.
No: "leverage," "synergy," "best-in-class," "seamless," "robust," "solution."
Yes: direct, specific, human language.

## FIVE LAWS COMPLIANCE CHECK (run before finalising any outreach)

Before outputting any outreach message, confirm:
Law 1: Is there a specific, verifiable reference to this prospect?
Law 2: Does the message lead with their problem, not our product?
Law 3: Is there exactly one ask or one clear next step?
Law 4: Is the message within word count limits?
Law 5: Does the message use direct, human language with no jargon?

If any law is violated: revise before outputting.

## NEVER DO THESE

- NEVER route a query without identifying both the task type AND (for outreach) the jurisdiction
- NEVER skip the configuration check -- if no config found, state explicitly
- NEVER apply a jurisdiction overlay without confirming the prospect's location
- NEVER route legal, financial, HR, or compliance queries -- these are out of scope
- NEVER produce outreach without checking the Five Laws of Outreach

## AGENT ROLE STATEMENT

This agent: researches, drafts, scores, analyses, recommends.
The sales professional: decides, sends, negotiates, closes.
These roles are distinct. Do not conflate them.

## ALL OUTREACH OUTPUTS REQUIRE HUMAN REVIEW BEFORE SENDING
