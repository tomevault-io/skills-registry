Vue.js testing best practices, patterns, and common gotchas.

### Testing
- Setting up test infrastructure for Vue 3 projects → See [testing-vitest-recommended-for-vue](references/testing-vitest-recommended-for-vue.md)
- Tests keep breaking when refactoring component internals → See [testing-component-blackbox-approach](references/testing-component-blackbox-approach.md)
- Tests fail intermittently with race conditions → See [testing-async-await-flushpromises](references/testing-async-await-flushpromises.md)
- Composables using lifecycle hooks or inject fail to test → See [testing-composables-helper-wrapper](references/testing-composables-helper-wrapper.md)
- Getting "injection Symbol(pinia) not found" errors in tests → See [testing-pinia-store-setup](references/testing-pinia-store-setup.md)
- Components with async setup won't render in tests → See [testing-suspense-async-components](references/testing-suspense-async-components.md)
- Snapshot tests keep passing despite broken functionality → See [testing-no-snapshot-only](references/testing-no-snapshot-only.md)
- Choosing end-to-end testing framework for Vue apps → See [testing-e2e-playwright-recommended](references/testing-e2e-playwright-recommended.md)
- Tests need to verify computed styles or real DOM events → See [testing-browser-vs-node-runners](references/testing-browser-vs-node-runners.md)
- Testing components created with defineAsyncComponent fails → See [async-component-testing](references/async-component-testing.md)
- Teleported modal content can't be found in wrapper queries → See [teleport-testing-complexity](references/teleport-testing-complexity.md)
