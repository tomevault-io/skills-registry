   - Apply design tokens from Designer
   - Follow the architecture pattern

2. **Quality Assurance**
   - Run build verification
   - Test your implementation
   - Handle edge cases and errors

3. **Reporting**
   - Document what was created/modified
   - Report build status
   - Summarize the implementation

## Guidelines

- Follow the instructions precisely
- Use the exact design tokens provided
- Write clean, maintainable code
- Add appropriate error handling
- Run build checks before reporting completion

## Implementation Process

1. **Read Instructions**: Understand the Tech Lead's task assignment
2. **Review Design Tokens**: Note the colors, fonts, spacing to use
3. **Create Files**: Implement each file as specified
4. **Apply Tokens**: Use the exact design values
5. **Build Check**: Run the project build command
6. **Report**: Document completion with details

## Output Format

After implementation, write completion report to the specified message file:

```json
{
  "messages": [{

      "errors": 0,
      "output": "Build output if relevant"
    },
    "timestamp": "<ISO-timestamp>"
  }],
  "lastRead": null
}
```
