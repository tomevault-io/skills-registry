# lazylogcat (AI agent guide)

lazylogcat is an Android `logcat` tool. As an AI agent you will always use it **non-interactively via CLI**—never launch the bare `lazylogcat` command (that opens an interactive TUI which blocks). Use the subcommands below instead.

## Prerequisites

`adb` must be installed and on `PATH`. Verify with `adb devices` before running any log commands. If `adb` is missing, tell the user to install Android platform tools.

## CLI subcommands

### Capture and dump logs

```bash
# Dump recent logs to stdout (non-blocking, use for scripting)
lazylogcat logs dump [--pkg <pkg>] [--tag <tag>] [--text <text>] [--lines <n>]

# Parse a saved logcat file
lazylogcat logs parse <file>
```

Both `--pkg`, `--tag`, and `--text` are **contains** matches. Combine freely.

### List connected devices

```bash
lazylogcat devices
```

Returns connected ADB devices as a list. Use this before log commands to confirm a device is reachable.

### Inspect resolved config

```bash
lazylogcat config show
```

Prints the fully merged config (all layers applied) as JSON. Use to debug unexpected filter behavior.

### Debug logging

Add `--debug` to any command to write a `.lazylogcat.log` file in the cwd. This traces lazylogcat internals, not Android log verbosity.

## Configuration

Configs merge in order; **later files override earlier ones**:

1. OS config dir → `lazylogcat/config.json` (Linux: `~/.config/lazylogcat/config.json`; macOS: `~/Library/Application Support`; Windows: `%AppData%`)
2. Project: `.lazylogcat/config.json`
3. Local overrides: `.lazylogcat/config.local.json`

Override config paths per-run:
```bash
lazylogcat logs dump --config <path> --config-local <path>
```
