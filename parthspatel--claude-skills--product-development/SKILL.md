# Product Development Workflow

Requirements gathering and design with iterative review loops. Produces artifacts for implementation.

## When to Use

- Planning new backend services, APIs, or microservices
- Designing CLI tools or developer utilities
- Architecting frontend applications or components
- Planning infrastructure or platform capabilities
- Any project needing systematic requirements and design

## Role Boundaries

| Activity | Claude | User |
|----------|--------|------|
| Draft requirements | ✅ Proposes structure, asks questions | Provides domain knowledge |
| Write user stories | ✅ Drafts based on discussion | Reviews, corrects, approves |
| Technical decisions | ✅ Presents options with trade-offs | Selects option, approves |
| Create diagrams | ✅ Generates via `diagrams-kroki` | Reviews for accuracy |
| Approval gates | ✅ Summarizes, asks for approval | Approves / requests changes |

## Iteration Limits

Each phase allows **max 3 iterations** before escalation:

| Iteration | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| 1st | Initial draft → user feedback |
| 2nd | Revised draft → user feedback |
| 3rd | Final revision → must approve or descope |
| Blocked | Escalate: "Requirements may be infeasible. Options: (A) Reduce scope, (B) Accept risks, (C) Abandon" |

## Artifacts Location

All outputs go to `./planning/{YYYYMMDD}_{project}/`:

## Phase 1: Product Requirements

**Goal**: Define WHO uses the product and WHAT they expect.

### Clarify Loop

```
Draft Requirements → Review with User → Gaps/Issues?
        ▲                                    │
        │              Yes                   │ No
        └────────────────┘                   ▼
                                         Approved
```

### Key Activities

1. **Identify personas**: Who are the users? What are their goals?
2. **Write user stories**: "As a [X], I expect to [Y] so that [Z]"
3. **Define boundaries**: What's in/out of scope?
4. **Success criteria**: How do we know it works?

### Critical Questions

- Who is NOT a user?
- What happens when expectations aren't met?
- Are there conflicting user needs?

### Approval Gate

```markdown
## Phase 1: Product Requirements

**Personas Defined**: X
**User Stories**: Y
**Boundaries**: Documented

**Gaps or Issues?**
- [ ] Any personas missing?
- [ ] Any user stories unclear?
- [ ] Scope concerns?

If gaps → Clarify and iterate
If clear → **Approve to proceed**
```

See [phases/01-PRODUCT-REQUIREMENTS.md](phases/01-PRODUCT-REQUIREMENTS.md) for details.

---

## Phase 2: Technical Requirements

**Goal**: Define WHAT the technology must do to meet user needs.

### Clarify Loop

```
Draft Tech Reqs → Review with User → Feasible? Complete?
        ▲                                    │
        │              No                    │ Yes
        └────────────────┘                   ▼
                                         Approved
```

### Key Activities

1. **Translate stories** to technical capabilities
2. **Define NFRs**: Performance, security, scalability
3. **Identify constraints**: Tech stack, integrations, resources
4. **Specify data**: Models, storage, retention

### Critical Questions

- Can we actually build this?
- What are the failure modes?
- What technical debt are we accepting?

### Approval Gate

```markdown
## Phase 2: Technical Requirements

**Capabilities**: X technical requirements
**NFRs**: Performance, security, scalability defined
**Constraints**: Documented

**Feasibility Issues?**
- [ ] Any requirements unbuildable?
- [ ] Resource constraints?
- [ ] Technical risks?

If issues → Clarify and iterate
If feasible → **Approve to proceed**
```

See [phases/02-TECHNICAL-REQUIREMENTS.md](phases/02-TECHNICAL-REQUIREMENTS.md) for details.

---

## Phase 3: Requirements Integration

**Goal**: Link product ↔ technical requirements, identify gaps.

### Review Loop

```
Create Traceability → Review Mapping → Gaps Found?
        ▲                                  │
        │         Yes (go back)            │ No
        └─── to Phase 1 or 2 ──────────────▼
                                       Approved
```

### Key Activities

1. **Traceability matrix**: User story → technical requirement
2. **Find orphans**: Technical reqs without product justification
3. **Find gaps**: User needs without technical solutions
4. **Prioritize**: By user impact

### Critical Questions

- Does every technical requirement serve a user need?
- Are all user stories technically addressed?
- What's the minimum viable scope?

### Approval Gate

```markdown
## Phase 3: Requirements Integration

**Traceability**: All stories mapped to technical reqs
**Orphans**: X technical reqs without user justification
**Gaps**: Y user needs without technical solutions

**Action Required?**
- If orphans → Remove or justify (back to Phase 2)
- If gaps → Add technical solution (back to Phase 1/2)
- If complete → **Approve to proceed**
```

See [phases/03-REQUIREMENTS-INTEGRATION.md](phases/03-REQUIREMENTS-INTEGRATION.md) for details.

---

## Phase 4: Diagrams & Artifacts

**Goal**: Visualize user journeys and system behavior.

### Review Loop

```
Create Diagrams → Review Coverage → All Paths Covered?
        ▲                                  │
        │              No                  │ Yes
        └──────────────┘                   ▼
                                       Approved
```

### Key Artifacts

- Use case diagrams (actor → system)
- State diagrams (system states/transitions)
- User flow diagrams (step-by-step journeys)
- Error/edge case mappings

Use `diagrams-kroki` skill for diagram generation.

### Approval Gate

```markdown
## Phase 4: Diagrams & Artifacts

**Diagrams Created**:
- [ ] Use cases: X diagrams
- [ ] State machines: Y diagrams
- [ ] User flows: Z diagrams
- [ ] Error cases: Documented

**Coverage Complete?**
If missing paths → Add diagrams and iterate
If complete → **Approve to proceed**
```

See [phases/04-DIAGRAMS-ARTIFACTS.md](phases/04-DIAGRAMS-ARTIFACTS.md) for details.

---

## Phase 5: Architecture & Design

**Goal**: Define system structure and component relationships.

### Review Loop

```
Create Architecture → Review Design → Sound & Complete?
        ▲                                  │
        │              No                  │ Yes
        │    (may need earlier phase)      │
        └──────────────────────────────────▼
                                       Approved
```

### Key Artifacts

- C4 diagrams (context, container, component)
- Class/module diagrams
- Sequence diagrams (key interactions)
- Data models and schemas

### Approval Gate

```markdown
## Phase 5: Architecture & Design

**Architecture Defined**:
- [ ] C4 Context diagram
- [ ] C4 Container diagram
- [ ] Component diagrams
- [ ] Data models

**Design Sound?**
- [ ] Meets NFRs?
- [ ] Addresses all use cases?
- [ ] No major risks?

If issues → Iterate (may need Phase 1-4 changes)
If sound → **Approve to proceed**
```

See [phases/05-ARCHITECTURE-DESIGN.md](phases/05-ARCHITECTURE-DESIGN.md) for details.

---

## Phase 6: Interface Contracts

**Goal**: Define all interaction boundaries.

### Review Loop

```
Define Contracts → Review Completeness → All Interfaces Covered?
        ▲                                       │
        │                  No                   │ Yes
        └──────────────────┘                    ▼
                                            Approved
```

### Interface Types

| Product Type | Interfaces |
|--------------|------------|
| **API** | OpenAPI spec, request/response schemas |
| **CLI** | Command syntax, flags, I/O formats |
| **Frontend** | Component props, state shapes |
| **Infrastructure** | Config schemas, resource definitions |

### Approval Gate

```markdown
## Phase 6: Interface Contracts

**Contracts Defined**:
- [ ] API endpoints: X with full specs
- [ ] CLI commands: Y with syntax
- [ ] Events/messages: Z with schemas

**All Interfaces Covered?**
If missing → Add contracts and iterate
If complete → **Approve and proceed to implementation**
```

See [phases/06-INTERFACE-CONTRACTS.md](phases/06-INTERFACE-CONTRACTS.md) for details.

---

## Completion & Handoff

```markdown
## Product Development Complete

**Artifacts Produced**:
- [ ] Product requirements (personas, stories, boundaries)
- [ ] Technical requirements (capabilities, NFRs, constraints)
- [ ] Traceability matrix
- [ ] Diagrams (use case, state, flow, architecture)
- [ ] Interface contracts

**Ready for Implementation**:
Run `software-engineering` skill with these artifacts.

**Planning Location**: ./planning/{project}/
```

---

## Interaction Style

1. **Iterate**: Use review loops, don't assume first draft is final
2. **Clarify**: Ask questions, surface assumptions
3. **Show Trade-offs**: Every decision has pros/cons
4. **Recommend Clearly**: Mark recommended option with **
5. **Wait for Approval**: Never proceed without user confirmation
6. **Link to Users**: Connect every decision to user impact
