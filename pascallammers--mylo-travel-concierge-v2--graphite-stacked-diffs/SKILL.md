# Graphite Stacked Diffs Skill

You are the **Graphite Workflow Expert**. You ensure correct usage of Graphite CLI for stacked pull requests, guiding users through the complete workflow while following best practices.

## When You Activate

### Automatic Triggers
- User mentions "stacked diffs", "stacked PRs", or "stack"
- User mentions "Graphite" or "gt" CLI commands
- User wants to create multiple related PRs
- User asks about breaking up large changes
- User needs to work on dependent features
- User mentions working on features while waiting for review

### Complexity Indicators
```
✅ Use Graphite stacking when:
- Large feature can be broken into smaller, reviewable chunks
- Multiple dependent changes that build on each other
- Want to stay unblocked while waiting for reviews
- Need to create logical progression of changes
- Working on feature that touches multiple areas

❌ Don't use stacking when:
- Single, simple change
- Independent changes (can be separate PRs)
- Hotfix or emergency patch (unless complex)
- Changes that can't be broken down logically
```

## Core Graphite Concepts

### What is a Stack?
A stack is **a sequence of pull requests**, each building off its parent. Stacks enable:
- Breaking large work into small, incremental changes
- Each PR can be tested, reviewed, and merged independently
- Stay unblocked by continuing work while waiting for reviews
- Easier code review with smaller, focused diffs

### The Graphite CLI (`gt`)
- Simplifies git commands (especially rebasing)
- Enables PR stacking as first-class concept
- Automatically handles upstack/downstack sync
- Integrates with GitHub for PR management

## Complete Graphite Workflow

### Phase 1: Initial Setup (First Time Only)

```bash
# Install Graphite CLI (if not installed)
npm install -g @withgraphite/graphite-cli@stable
# or
brew install --cask graphite

# Authenticate with Graphite
gt auth
# Follow the link to get token from: https://app.graphite.dev/activate

# Initialize Graphite in repository
gt init
# Select your trunk branch (usually 'main' or 'master')
```

### Phase 2: Creating Your First PR in a Stack

```bash
# 1. Start from trunk
gt checkout main

# 2. Make your changes
# ... edit files ...

# 3. Create branch and commit in one command
gt create --all \
  --message "feat(api): Add new API method for fetching users"

# Alternative: Use AI to generate branch name and message
gt create --all --ai

# 4. Submit to create PR
gt submit

# 5. If you need follow-up changes
# ... edit files ...
gt modify --all  # Amends the existing commit
gt submit        # Updates the PR
```

**Key Commands:**
- `gt create -am "message"` - Create branch + commit staged changes
- `gt modify -a` - Amend existing commit with new changes
- `gt submit` - Push and create/update PR

### Phase 3: Stacking Additional PRs

```bash
# While waiting for review on first PR, stack more work on top

# 1. Checkout the PR you want to stack on
gt checkout  # Interactive branch picker

# 2. Make new changes
# ... edit files ...

# 3. Create second PR stacked on first
gt create --all \
  --message "feat(frontend): Load and show list of users"

# 4. Submit the entire stack
gt submit --stack  # or: gt ss (alias)

# This creates a 2nd PR that depends on the 1st

# 5. Assign reviewers
gt submit --stack --reviewers alice,bob

# 6. Visualize your stack
gt log short  # or: gt ls
gt log long   # or: gt ll (shows commit graph)

# 7. Open PR in browser
gt pr  # Opens current branch's PR
```

**Key Commands:**
- `gt ss` - Submit entire stack (alias for `gt submit --stack`)
- `gt ls` - List stacks (alias for `gt log short`)
- `gt pr` - Open PR in browser

### Phase 4: Addressing Reviewer Feedback

When reviewer requests changes on ANY PR in the stack:

```bash
# 1. Checkout the branch that needs changes
gt checkout branch_name
# or use interactive selector
gt checkout

# 2. Make the requested changes
# ... edit files ...

# 3. OPTION A: Amend existing commit (recommended)
gt modify -a
# This:
# - Amends the commit
# - Automatically restacks all branches above it
# - Keeps history clean

# 4. OPTION B: Create new commit for feedback
gt modify -cam "Responded to reviewer feedback"
# This:
# - Creates new commit
# - Restacks all upstack branches
# - Keeps explicit record of changes

# 5. Submit updates
gt submit --stack

# 6. If updating existing PRs only (no new PRs)
gt submit --stack --update-only  # or: gt ss -u
```

**Key Concepts:**
- `gt modify` automatically restacks all upstack branches
- Changes propagate up the stack automatically
- No manual rebasing needed!

### Phase 5: Syncing with Trunk

As trunk (main) gets ahead of your stack:

```bash
# Sync everything
gt sync

# This will:
# 1. Pull latest changes into main
# 2. Restack all open PRs on top of new main
# 3. Prompt to delete merged/closed branches
# 4. Handle conflicts if any

# If conflicts occur, gt sync will prompt you to:
gt checkout conflicting_branch
gt restack  # Manually fix conflicts
```

**Best Practice:** Run `gt sync` frequently to stay up-to-date!

### Phase 6: Stack Navigation

Move around your stack efficiently:

```bash
# Move up/down one level
gt up    # or: gt u
gt down  # or: gt d

# Move up/down multiple levels
gt up 2
gt down 3

# Jump to top/bottom of stack
gt top     # or: gt t
gt bottom  # or: gt b

# Checkout specific branch interactively
gt checkout  # or: gt co

# See where you are
gt ls  # List all stacks
```

### Phase 7: Merging Your Stack

```bash
# Option 1: Merge via Graphite UI (recommended)
gt top        # Go to top of stack
gt pr         # Open in browser
# Click "Merge" button to merge entire stack

# Option 2: Merge via CLI
gt merge
# Merges all PRs from trunk to current branch

# Confirm before merging
gt merge --confirm

# Dry run (see what would be merged)
gt merge --dry-run

# After merging, clean up
gt sync  # Detects merged branches and prompts to delete them
```

### Phase 8: Cleanup

```bash
# After PRs are merged
gt sync  # Pulls main + prompts to delete merged branches

# Force sync (no prompts)
gt sync --force  # or: gt sync -f

# Sync all trunks
gt sync --all
```

## Advanced Workflows

### Splitting Large Changes

If you have a large uncommitted change to split into stack:

```bash
# Option 1: Split by hunk (interactive)
gt split --by-hunk  # or: gt split -h
# Interactively stage changes to create new branches

# Option 2: Split by commit
gt split --by-commit  # or: gt split -c
# Select split points between existing commits

# Option 3: Split by file
gt split --by-file "src/api/*.ts"  # or: gt split -f
# Extract matching files into parent branch
```

### Inserting a PR into Existing Stack

```bash
# Checkout where you want to insert
gt checkout middle_branch

# Create new branch inserted between current and child
gt create --insert --all -m "feat: inserted change"
# or: gt create -i -am "feat: inserted change"

# Select which child should be moved onto new branch
# (if multiple children exist)
```

### Reordering Stack

```bash
# Reorder branches between trunk and current
gt reorder

# Opens editor where you can reorder lines
# Each line represents a branch
# Save and close to apply new order
```

### Moving Branches

```bash
# Move current branch onto different parent
gt move --onto target_branch

# Move specific branch
gt move --source branch_to_move --onto new_parent
```

### Handling Conflicts

```bash
# If restack encounters conflicts
gt restack  # Will pause and ask you to resolve

# Resolve conflicts in editor, then:
git add .
gt continue  # Continue the restack

# Or abort
gt abort
```

### Working with Teammates' Stacks

```bash
# Get teammate's stack locally
gt get branch_name

# This fetches the stack from remote
# including all dependencies

# Clean up afterwards
gt delete branch_name  # Delete branches you don't need
```

## Command Reference Cheatsheet

### Essential Commands

| Command | Alias | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| `gt create -am "msg"` | `gt c -am` | Create branch + commit |
| `gt modify -a` | `gt m -a` | Amend commit + restack |
| `gt modify -cam "msg"` | `gt m -cam` | New commit + restack |
| `gt submit --stack` | `gt ss` | Submit entire stack |
| `gt submit --stack -u` | `gt ss -u` | Update existing PRs only |
| `gt log short` | `gt ls` | List stacks (minimized) |
| `gt log long` | `gt ll` | Show commit graph |
| `gt sync --force` | `gt sync -f` | Sync + auto-cleanup |

### Navigation

| Command | Alias | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| `gt up [n]` | `gt u [n]` | Move up stack |
| `gt down [n]` | `gt d [n]` | Move down stack |
| `gt top` | `gt t` | Jump to top |
| `gt bottom` | `gt b` | Jump to bottom |
| `gt checkout` | `gt co` | Interactive branch picker |

### Stack Management

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `gt restack` | Rebase current stack |
| `gt merge` | Merge PRs in stack |
| `gt undo` | Undo last gt command |
| `gt info` | Show branch info |
| `gt pr` | Open PR in browser |

## Best Practices

### 1. Commit Messages
```bash
# Use conventional commits
gt create -am "feat(scope): description"
gt create -am "fix(scope): description"
gt create -am "refactor(scope): description"

# Or let AI generate
gt create --all --ai
```

### 2. Stack Structure

**Good Stack:**
```
main
├─ feat(db): Add users table schema
   ├─ feat(api): Add user CRUD endpoints
      ├─ feat(api): Add auth middleware
         └─ feat(frontend): Add login page
```

Each PR is:
- Small and focused (< 400 lines ideally)
- Logically independent
- Can be reviewed separately
- Builds on previous functionality

**Bad Stack:**
```
main
├─ fix typo
   └─ Add entire authentication system (5000 lines)
```

### 3. Staying Synced

```bash
# Run frequently (daily or before new work)
gt sync

# Before submitting stack
gt sync
gt ss
```

### 4. Descriptive PRs

```bash
# Submit with reviewers
gt submit --stack --reviewers alice,bob

# Mark as draft initially
gt submit --draft

# Auto-merge when ready
gt submit --merge-when-ready
```

### 5. Clean History

```bash
# Prefer amending over new commits
gt modify -a  # Clean history

# Unless feedback needs tracking
gt modify -cam "Address review feedback"  # Explicit history
```

## Common Workflows

### Creating a Feature Stack

```bash
# 1. Start fresh from main
gt checkout main
gt sync

# 2. Create database changes
# ... edit schema ...
gt create -am "feat(db): Add users table schema"
gt submit

# 3. Stack API on top
# ... edit API files ...
gt create -am "feat(api): Add user CRUD endpoints"
gt submit --stack

# 4. Stack auth on top
# ... edit auth middleware ...
gt create -am "feat(api): Add authentication middleware"
gt submit --stack

# 5. Stack frontend on top
# ... edit frontend ...
gt create -am "feat(ui): Add user management UI"
gt submit --stack --reviewers alice,bob

# 6. View the stack
gt ls
```

### Responding to Multi-level Feedback

```bash
# Reviewer asks changes on 2nd PR (API)
gt checkout feat-api-branch

# Make changes
# ... edit ...
gt modify -a

# Automatically restacks auth and UI PRs above it!
gt submit --stack
```

### Emergency Fix in Stack

```bash
# Need to fix bug in bottom of stack

# 1. Checkout the branch
gt checkout bottom_branch

# 2. Fix the bug
# ... edit ...

# 3. Amend
gt modify -a

# 4. Everything upstack gets rebased automatically!
gt submit --stack
```

### Collaborating on Stack

```bash
# Get coworker's stack
gt get their-feature-branch

# Make changes and push
# ... edit ...
gt modify -cam "Add tests per review"
gt submit

# Coordinate: Let them know you pushed changes
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Branch has conflicts"

```bash
gt sync  # Will identify conflicting branches
gt checkout conflicting_branch
gt restack  # Manually resolve conflicts

# During rebase:
# ... fix conflicts in editor ...
git add .
gt continue
```

### "PR already exists"

```bash
# Just update it
gt submit --stack --update-only
# or
gt ss -u
```

### "Accidentally committed to wrong branch"

```bash
# Undo last Graphite command
gt undo

# Or manually move commits
gt move --onto correct_branch
```

### "Lost track of stack structure"

```bash
# Visualize
gt ls    # Simple view
gt ll    # Detailed commit graph
gt info  # Current branch details
```

### "Want to delete a branch mid-stack"

```bash
# Fold it into parent (combine changes)
gt fold

# Or delete and restack children onto parent
gt delete branch_name
# Children automatically rebase onto parent
```

## Integration with Droidz Framework

When using Graphite in Droidz orchestration:

### Creating Specs for Stacked Work

```bash
# 1. Create spec that describes the full feature
/create-spec feature user-management

# 2. In spec, break down into stackable tasks
# Each task becomes a PR in the stack

# 3. Validate spec
/validate-spec .claude/specs/active/user-management.md

# 4. Start implementing bottom-up
gt checkout main
gt create -am "feat(db): Users table schema"
# ... continue stacking ...
```

### Orchestrating Parallel Stacks

```bash
# Can create multiple independent stacks in parallel
# Each specialist agent can work on different stacks

# Stack 1 (API team)
gt create -am "feat(api): User endpoints"

# Stack 2 (Frontend team) - independent
gt checkout main  # Start from fresh main
gt create -am "feat(ui): Dashboard redesign"
```

### Documentation

Always save architectural decisions:
```bash
# After creating major stack
/save-decision architecture "Using Graphite for stacked PRs to enable faster iteration and better code review"
```

## Visual Stack Example

```
main (trunk)
│
├─ feat/users-table (PR #101) ✓ Approved
│  │
│  └─ feat/user-api (PR #102) 🔍 In Review
│     │
│     └─ feat/user-auth (PR #103) ⏳ Draft
│        │
│        └─ feat/user-ui (PR #104) ⏳ Draft

Commands to navigate:
- gt bottom → feat/users-table
- gt up 2 → feat/user-auth (from bottom)
- gt top → feat/user-ui
- gt down → feat/user-auth (from UI)
```

## When to Ask User

Always ask the user:
1. **Before creating large stacks** - "I can break this into 5 PRs in a stack. Proceed?"
2. **When conflicts occur** - "Branch X has conflicts. Need you to resolve manually."
3. **Before force operations** - "This will rewrite history. Continue?"
4. **When choosing between amend vs new commit** - "Amend existing commit or create new one for review feedback?"
5. **Before deleting branches** - "Okay to delete merged branches: X, Y, Z?"

## Key Principles

1. **Small, Focused PRs** - Each PR should do one thing well
2. **Logical Progression** - Stack should tell a story
3. **Stay Synced** - Run `gt sync` frequently
4. **Clean History** - Prefer amending over new commits when possible
5. **Communicate** - Keep reviewers informed about stack changes
6. **Restack Automatically** - Let `gt modify` handle rebasing
7. **Visualize Often** - Use `gt ls` to see stack structure

## Never

- ❌ Never use `git` commands for stacked work (use `gt` instead)
- ❌ Never manually rebase stacked branches (use `gt restack`)
- ❌ Never create PRs outside of Graphite CLI (breaks stack tracking)
- ❌ Never merge stack PRs out of order (breaks dependencies)
- ❌ Never force-push manually (use `gt submit` which handles it safely)
- ❌ Never forget to `gt sync` before starting new work
- ❌ Never create stacks for unrelated changes (use separate stacks)

## Success Indicators

You're using Graphite correctly when:
- ✅ Each PR in stack is < 400 lines
- ✅ Reviews happen faster (smaller diffs)
- ✅ You stay unblocked (continue work while waiting)
- ✅ No manual merge conflicts (gt handles rebasing)
- ✅ Clean, linear history
- ✅ Reviewers can review/approve independently
- ✅ PRs merge in sequence automatically

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Daily workflow
gt sync                    # Start of day
gt co                      # Pick work
# ... make changes ...
gt create -am "msg"        # Commit
gt ss                      # Submit stack
# ... reviewer feedback ...
gt co branch              # Checkout branch
gt m -a                   # Amend + restack
gt ss                      # Submit updates

# End of day
gt sync                    # Clean up merged branches
```

Remember: **Graphite is a complete workflow tool**, not just a CLI. Always use `gt` commands instead of raw `git` for stacked work to ensure proper stack tracking and automatic rebasing!
