# Microsoft Fabric Notebook Performance remediate

Systematic toolkit for diagnosing, analyzing, and resolving performance bottlenecks in Microsoft Fabric notebooks powered by Apache Spark.

## When to Use This Skill

- Fabric notebook cells are running slowly or timing out
- Spark jobs are being throttled with HTTP 430 errors
- Capacity Metrics app shows high CU consumption
- Data skew is causing unbalanced task execution
- Shuffle operations are consuming excessive resources
- Delta Lake tables have degraded read/write performance
- OOM (Out of Memory) errors during notebook execution
- Spark Advisor shows warnings or errors in cell output
- Session startup is slow or sessions expire unexpectedly
- Pipeline-triggered notebooks are queued for extended periods

## Prerequisites

- Workspace Admin or Contributor role in the target Fabric workspace
- Access to the Fabric Monitoring Hub for your capacity
- Fabric Capacity Metrics app installed (for capacity-level analysis)
- Familiarity with PySpark or Spark SQL syntax

## remediate Decision Tree

Identify your symptom and follow the corresponding workflow.

| Symptom | Root Cause Category | Action |
|---------|-------------------|--------|
| Notebook cell runs for minutes on small data | Spark session config or query plan | See [Spark Session Tuning](./references/spark-session-tuning.md) |
| HTTP 430 error on job submission | Capacity exhausted, concurrency limit | See [Capacity and Throttling](#capacity-and-throttling) |
| One task takes 10x longer than others | Data skew | See [Data Skew Diagnosis](./references/data-skew-diagnosis.md) |
| Write operations are slow | V-Order overhead or small file problem | See [Delta Table Optimization](./references/delta-table-optimization.md) |
| OOM / executor lost errors | Memory pressure, partition sizing | See [Memory and Partition Tuning](#memory-and-partition-tuning) |
| Session expired / timed out | Idle timeout settings | See [Common Errors](./references/common-errors.md) |
| Notebook queued, never starts | Queue limits for SKU | See [Capacity and Throttling](#capacity-and-throttling) |

## Quick Wins Checklist

Apply these optimizations first — they resolve the majority of performance issues.

1. **Enable Native Execution Engine (NEE)** — delivers 2x–5x improvement:

```python
spark.conf.set("spark.native.enabled", "true")
```

2. **Enable Autotune** for adaptive configuration:

```python
spark.conf.set("spark.ms.autotune.enabled", "true")
```

3. **Right-size shuffle partitions** — default 200 is often wrong:

```python
# For datasets under 1 GB
spark.conf.set("spark.sql.shuffle.partitions", "20")
# For datasets 1-10 GB
spark.conf.set("spark.sql.shuffle.partitions", "100")
# For datasets over 10 GB, leave default or increase
```

4. **Enable Adaptive Query Execution (AQE)**:

```python
spark.conf.set("spark.sql.adaptive.enabled", "true")
spark.conf.set("spark.sql.adaptive.coalescePartitions.enabled", "true")
spark.conf.set("spark.sql.adaptive.skewJoin.enabled", "true")
```

5. **Use DataFrame APIs instead of RDDs** — enables Catalyst optimizer and Tungsten engine.

6. **Break complex query chains** into staged intermediate writes to reduce Catalyst plan complexity. See [Common Errors](./references/common-errors.md#excessive-query-complexity).

Run the [notebook health check script](./scripts/notebook-health-check.py) to audit your current session configuration.

## Capacity and Throttling

Each Fabric SKU maps to a fixed number of Spark VCores (1 CU = 2 Spark VCores). When all VCores are consumed, new jobs receive HTTP 430 errors.

| SKU | Spark VCores | Queue Limit |
|-----|-------------|-------------|
| F2 | 4 | 4 |
| F8 | 16 | 8 |
| F64 / P1 | 128 | 64 |
| F128 / P2 | 256 | 128 |
| F256 / P3 | 512 | 256 |

**Resolution steps:**

1. Open the **Monitoring Hub** and cancel idle or unnecessary Spark sessions.
2. Stop sessions you are not actively using — default idle timeout is 20 minutes.
3. Reduce executor count in custom Spark pools to free VCores for parallel jobs.
4. Enable **Autoscale Billing for Spark** for bursty workloads — jobs use dedicated serverless resources instead of consuming capacity CUs.
5. For pipeline-triggered notebooks, leverage job queueing (FIFO). Queue expiry is 24 hours.

> Queueing is not supported for interactive notebook jobs or Fabric trial capacities.

## Memory and Partition Tuning

OOM errors typically stem from oversized partitions or insufficient executor memory.

**Diagnose with Spark UI:**

1. Open the cell's Spark job progress indicator.
2. Click **Resources** tab to view executor usage graph.
3. Check the Spark Advisor light-bulb icon for memory warnings.

**Tune partitions:**

```python
# Check current partition count
df.rdd.getNumPartitions()

# Repartition for parallelism (increases partitions)
df = df.repartition(200)

# Coalesce to reduce partitions (avoids full shuffle)
df = df.coalesce(50)

# Adjust max partition bytes for reads
spark.conf.set("spark.sql.files.maxPartitionBytes", "128m")
```

**Tune task memory:**

```python
# For memory-intensive tasks causing OOM
spark.conf.set("spark.task.cpus", "2")  # More memory per task

# For CPU-bound tasks needing more parallelism
spark.conf.set("spark.task.cpus", "0.5")  # More concurrent tasks
```

## Monitoring and Diagnostics

### In-Notebook Monitoring

- **Spark job progress bar** — real-time per-cell execution status
- **Resources tab** — executor allocation and resource usage line chart (Spark 3.4+)
- **Spark Advisor** — Info/Warning/Error recommendations per cell (expand via light-bulb icon)

### Monitoring Hub

Navigate to Monitoring Hub to view all active Spark applications across your workspace. Key actions: cancel sessions, view executor count, check job duration, identify queued jobs.

### Capacity Metrics App

Filter by item type (Notebook, Lakehouse, Spark Job Definition) to see CU consumption per job. Use the Multi metric ribbon chart to identify capacity spikes over time.

**Formula:** CU consumption = Total Spark VCores / 2 × duration

## Spark Pool Configuration

### Starter Pools (Default)

Session initialization in 5–10 seconds, pre-configured, no manual setup. Good for development and small workloads.

### Custom Spark Pools

Configure via Workspace Settings → Data Engineering/Science → Spark Settings:

| Scenario | Node Size | Guidance |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| Transform-heavy with shuffles and joins | Large (16–64 cores) | Maximize per-node memory |
| Bursty or unpredictable jobs | Medium + Autoscale | Let cluster grow/shrink dynamically |
| Many small parallel jobs | Small/Medium | Use `mssparkutils.notebook.runMultiple()` |
| Development / exploration | Small, single node | Driver and executor share 1 VM |
| ML / distributed training | Many medium/large nodes | Maximize parallelism |

Enable **Customize compute configurations for items** in Workspace Settings → Pool tab to allow per-notebook pool overrides.

## Resource Profiles

Use predefined Spark resource profiles to auto-configure for your workload type:

| Profile | Best For |
|---------|----------|
| `Default` | General-purpose workloads |
| `readHeavyforSpark` / `ReadHeavy` | Interactive queries, dashboards (enables V-Order) |
| Write-heavy | Data ingestion pipelines (V-Order disabled by default) |

## Library Management Impact

Library installation in Fabric environments takes 5–15 minutes during publishing. For interactive development, use inline installation (`%pip install`) to avoid environment republish delays. However, inline commands are turned off by default in pipeline runs due to dependency tree instability.

| Method | Session Impact | Pipeline Safe |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| Environment libraries | None (pre-installed) | Yes |
| Inline `%pip install` | Current session only | No |
| Inline `install.packages()` (R) | Current session only | No |
