# Microsoft Fabric Power BI Security remediate

Systematic diagnostic toolkit for resolving security and access control issues across the Microsoft Fabric Power BI stack. Covers workspace permissions, data-level security (RLS/OLS/CLS), sensitivity labels, service principal access, and governance policy restrictions.

## When to Use This Skill

- User reports "access denied" or "unauthorized" errors in Power BI reports or workspaces
- Report visuals show blank data or "field cannot be found" errors
- RLS filters are not applying correctly or returning unexpected data
- Sensitivity labels are greyed out, blocking exports, or preventing publishing
- Service principal cannot access workspaces or semantic models
- DirectLake reports fall back to DirectQuery unexpectedly due to security
- DLP or Purview protection policies are blocking item access
- Workspace role assignments are not behaving as expected
- XMLA endpoint connections fail with permission errors
- Users lose access to items after policy or label changes

## Prerequisites

- **PowerShell 7+** with `MicrosoftPowerBIMgmt` module
- **Fabric Admin** or **Workspace Admin** role for diagnostic scripts
- **Power BI REST API** access (interactive or service principal)
- Optional: Tabular Editor for OLS/RLS inspection

Install required modules:

```powershell
Install-Module -Name MicrosoftPowerBIMgmt -Scope CurrentUser -Force
Install-Module -Name Az.Accounts -Scope CurrentUser -Force
```

## Step-by-Step Workflows

### 1. Workspace Permission Issues

**Symptoms**: User cannot see workspace or items within it.

1. Verify the user's workspace role:

```powershell
# Run the diagnostic script
./scripts/Get-PBISecurityDiagnostic.ps1 -WorkspaceName "Sales Analytics" -UserEmail "user@contoso.com"
```

2. Understand the permission hierarchy:

| Role | See Items | Use Items | OneLake Access | RLS Enforced? |
|------|-----------|-----------|----------------|---------------|
| Admin | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ (bypassed) |
| Member | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ (bypassed) |
| Contributor | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ (bypassed) |
| Viewer | ✅ | Read-only | ❌ | ✅ (enforced) |

3. Key rule: **RLS only applies to Viewers**. If a user has Admin, Member, or Contributor role, RLS is bypassed entirely.

4. To enforce RLS, ensure content consumers have **only Viewer** workspace role and **only Read** permission on the semantic model.

### 2. Row-Level Security (RLS) Not Filtering

**Symptoms**: Users see all data instead of their filtered subset.

See [RLS remediate Guide](./references/rls-remediate.md) for the full diagnostic workflow.

Quick checks:

1. Confirm user is mapped to the correct RLS role
2. Verify the user has only **Viewer** permissions (Admin/Member/Contributor bypass RLS)
3. Test using "Test as role" in the Power BI service
4. Add a `USERNAME()` DAX measure to a card visual to verify identity
5. Check relationship filter directions — RLS filters only propagate through **active** relationships

### 3. Object-Level Security (OLS) / Column-Level Security (CLS)

**Symptoms**: Visuals display "The field cannot be found" or "may not be used in this expression."

See [OLS/CLS remediate Guide](./references/ols-cls-remediate.md) for the full workflow.

Quick checks:

1. OLS only applies to **Viewers** — same bypass rules as RLS
2. OLS must be configured using Tabular Editor (not natively in Power BI Desktop)
3. OLS and RLS cannot be combined from **different roles** — this causes query-time errors
4. Measures referencing secured columns are automatically restricted
5. Q&A, Quick Insights, and Smart Narrative visuals do not support OLS

### 4. Sensitivity Label Issues

**Symptoms**: Labels greyed out, exports blocked, PBIX files inaccessible.

See [Sensitivity Labels Guide](./references/sensitivity-labels-guide.md) for the full workflow.

Quick checks:

1. Ensure the tenant setting "Allow users to apply sensitivity labels" is enabled
2. User needs Pro or PPU license AND create/edit permissions on the item
3. Protected PBIX files require Full Control or Export usage rights
4. Service principals **cannot** publish protected PBIX files — remove label first
5. B2B and multi-tenant scenarios are not supported with sensitivity labels

### 5. DirectLake Security Fallback

**Symptoms**: DirectLake reports unexpectedly run in DirectQuery mode.

- If RLS is defined in the **SQL analytics endpoint**, DirectLake falls back to DirectQuery for those tables
- To avoid fallback: define RLS in the semantic model only, not in SQL
- For app-based distribution without fallback, switch from SSO to a **fixed identity** credential
- Create a new Lakehouse with shortcuts to avoid inheriting SQL-level security

### 6. Service Principal & XMLA Access

**Symptoms**: API calls return 401/403, XMLA connections fail.

See [XMLA & API Access Guide](./references/xmla-api-access.md) for the full workflow.

Quick checks:

1. Verify tenant setting: "Allow service principals to use Fabric APIs" is enabled
2. Add the service principal to a security group referenced in the tenant setting
3. Add the service principal to the workspace with the correct role
4. For XMLA: verify "Allow XMLA endpoints" is enabled in tenant Integration settings
5. Impersonation via `EffectiveUserName` requires both Read and Build permissions

### 7. Governance Policy Restrictions

**Symptoms**: User suddenly loses access to items they previously could see.

- Check for Purview **protection policies** that restrict access based on sensitivity labels
- Check for Purview **DLP policies** with "restrict access" actions on sensitive content
- In the item's Manage Permissions page, look for "No access" — indicates policy-level restriction
- Label issuers and item creators retain access even when policies restrict others
- Contact your Microsoft 365 compliance admin to review active policies

## remediate Decision Matrix

| Symptom | Likely Cause | First Action |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| Can't see workspace | Missing workspace role | Check `Get-PowerBIWorkspace` |
| Blank visuals | RLS misconfiguration | Test as role, check USERNAME() |
| "Field not found" | OLS restriction | Inspect roles in Tabular Editor |
| Can't export PBIX | Sensitivity label encryption | Check usage rights |
| Label greyed out | Missing license or permissions | Verify Pro/PPU + security group |
| API 401/403 | Service principal not authorized | Check tenant settings + workspace role |
| DirectQuery fallback | SQL-level RLS on endpoint | Move RLS to semantic model |
| Sudden access loss | Purview/DLP policy change | Check Manage Permissions for "No access" |

## Available Scripts

Run the [security diagnostic script](./scripts/Get-PBISecurityDiagnostic.ps1) for automated workspace and permission analysis.

Run the [RLS validation script](./scripts/Test-PBIRowLevelSecurity.ps1) to test RLS role membership and filter expressions.

Use the [incident report template](./templates/security-incident-template.md) to document and track security remediate cases.
