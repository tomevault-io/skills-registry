# Microsoft Fabric REST API Performance remediate

Structured diagnostic workflows and automation scripts for identifying and resolving performance bottlenecks in Microsoft Fabric REST API integrations.

## When to Use This Skill

- API calls to `api.fabric.microsoft.com` are slow or timing out
- Receiving HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) responses with Retry-After headers
- Long running operations (LRO) polling is inefficient or stalling
- Paginated API responses are taking too long to enumerate
- Bulk workspace or item operations exceed capacity throttle limits
- Entra ID token acquisition is adding unexpected latency
- Spark job submissions return HTTP 430 (TooManyRequestsForCapacity)
- Need to benchmark Fabric REST API throughput for a given capacity SKU

## Prerequisites

- PowerShell 7+ with `Invoke-RestMethod` support
- Microsoft Entra ID app registration with appropriate Fabric scopes
- A valid Bearer token or MSAL-based authentication flow
- Access to at least one Fabric workspace

## Diagnostic Decision Tree

Determine the root cause category before applying a fix:

```
API Call Slow or Failing?
├── HTTP 429 returned?
│   ├── YES → Throttling. See §1 Throttling Diagnosis
│   └── NO  → Continue
├── HTTP 430 returned?
│   ├── YES → Capacity exhausted. See §2 Capacity Limits
│   └── NO  → Continue
├── HTTP 202 + LRO stalling?
│   ├── YES → Polling issue. See §3 LRO Optimization
│   └── NO  → Continue
├── Large result sets slow?
│   ├── YES → Pagination. See §4 Pagination Tuning
│   └── NO  → Continue
├── Token acquisition slow?
│   ├── YES → Auth latency. See §5 Token Performance
│   └── NO  → General latency. See §6 Baseline Benchmarking
```

## §1 Throttling Diagnosis (HTTP 429)

Fabric throttles per-user, per-API within a time window. When exceeded, the API returns HTTP 429 with a `Retry-After` header (in seconds).

**Diagnosis Steps:**

1. Run the [throttle diagnostic script](./scripts/Test-FabricApiThrottle.ps1) to measure your current request rate against throttle limits
2. Capture `Retry-After` header values to understand cooldown periods
3. Review call patterns for burst behavior vs. steady-state

**Resolution Patterns:**

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Exponential backoff | Respect `Retry-After`, then add jitter to avoid thundering herd |
| Request batching | Group related calls to reduce total API invocations |
| Caller isolation | Use separate service principals for independent workloads |
| Rate limiter | Implement a client-side token bucket before sending requests |

**Key Facts:**

- Every Fabric admin and core public API call is throttled
- Throttle window and limits are per-user, per-API (not published explicitly)
- The `Retry-After` value is in seconds (commonly 30-60s)

See [throttling-deep-dive.md](./references/throttling-deep-dive.md) for implementation patterns.

## §2 Capacity Rate Limits (HTTP 430)

Spark jobs and compute-bound operations have a separate throttle tied to the Fabric capacity SKU. When the max queue limit is reached, new jobs return HTTP 430.

**Capacity Queue Limits:**

| SKU | Queue Limit |
|-----|-------------|
| F2 / F4 | 4 |
| F8 | 8 |
| F16 | 16 |
| F32 | 32 |
| F64 (P1) | 64 |
| F128 (P2) | 128 |
| F256 (P3) | 256 |
| F512 (P4) | 512 |
| F1024 | 1024 |
| F2048 | 2048 |
| Trial | Not supported |

**Resolution:**

1. Cancel active Spark jobs via the Monitoring Hub
2. Upgrade to a larger capacity SKU
3. Enable optimistic job admission for higher concurrency
4. Implement client-side queue management before submitting jobs

## §3 Long Running Operation (LRO) Optimization

Many Fabric APIs return HTTP 202 Accepted with three critical headers:

- `Location` — polling URL (Get Operation State endpoint)
- `x-ms-operation-id` — operation GUID for constructing polling URLs
- `Retry-After` — seconds to wait before first poll

**Common Performance Issues:**

| Issue | Symptom | Fix |
|-------|---------|-----|
| Aggressive polling | Hundreds of GET calls, wastes quota | Honor `Retry-After`, use exponential backoff |
| Ignoring Location header | Building URLs manually, missing result endpoint | Use Location header directly; it transitions from State to Result when complete |
| Not checking for result | Polling succeeds but result never fetched | After `Succeeded` status, call Get Operation Result |
| Missing failure handling | Stuck in infinite poll loop | Check for `Failed` and `Skipped` statuses |

**LRO Status Values:** `Succeeded`, `Failed`, `Skipped`, `Completed`

Run the [LRO polling benchmark script](./scripts/Measure-FabricLroPolling.ps1) to profile your polling efficiency.

See [lro-patterns.md](./references/lro-patterns.md) for complete polling implementation patterns.

---

## §4 Pagination Tuning

Fabric paginated APIs return `continuationToken` and `continuationUri` in response bodies. Performance degrades when consuming large result sets sequentially.

**Optimization Strategies:**

1. Use `continuationUri` directly rather than rebuilding URLs with `continuationToken`
2. Process pages concurrently when downstream logic allows
3. Implement early termination when the target item is found
4. Cache intermediate results for retry resilience

**Template:** Use the [pagination walker template](./templates/Invoke-FabricPaginatedApi.ps1) for efficient enumeration.

---

## §5 Token Acquisition Performance

Slow Entra ID token acquisition adds latency to every API call chain.

**Diagnosis:**

1. Measure token acquisition time separately from API call time
2. Check if tokens are being acquired per-request instead of cached
3. Verify token lifetime and refresh logic

**Optimization:**

| Technique | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| Token caching | Eliminate redundant auth round-trips |
| MSAL token cache serialization | Persist tokens across process restarts |
| Certificate-based auth | Faster than client secret for service principals |
| Reduce scope requests | Request only needed scopes per call |

---

## §6 Baseline Benchmarking

Before remediate, establish a performance baseline.

Run the [baseline benchmark script](./scripts/Measure-FabricApiBaseline.ps1) to capture:

- Token acquisition latency (ms)
- Simple GET endpoint response time (ms)
- Paginated enumeration throughput (items/sec)
- LRO polling round-trip time (ms)

Compare results against expected ranges in the [baseline reference](./references/baseline-expectations.md).

## Quick Reference: HTTP Status Codes

| Code | Meaning | Action |
|------|---------|--------|
| 200 | Success | Process response |
| 201 | Created (LRO complete) | Fetch result |
| 202 | Accepted (LRO started) | Begin polling via Location header |
| 400 | Bad request | Validate request body/parameters |
| 401 | Unauthorized | Refresh token, check scopes |
| 403 | Forbidden | Verify workspace/item permissions |
| 404 | Not found | Confirm workspace/item IDs |
| 429 | Throttled | Wait `Retry-After` seconds, then retry |
| 430 | Capacity exhausted | Reduce concurrent jobs or scale SKU |

---

## remediate

| Problem | Likely Cause | Resolution |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| All calls slow (>2s) | Token not cached | Implement MSAL token caching |
| Intermittent 429s | Burst pattern | Add rate limiter with token bucket |
| LRO never completes | Operation failed silently | Check for `Failed` status in poll response |
| Pagination returns duplicates | Stale continuationToken | Always use fresh `continuationUri` from latest response |
| 430 on Spark submit | Capacity queue full | Check Monitoring Hub, scale SKU, or wait |
| Token acquisition >3s | Network/DNS issue | Test connectivity to `login.microsoftonline.com` |
