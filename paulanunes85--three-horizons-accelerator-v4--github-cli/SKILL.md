## When to Use

- Workflow triggering
- Issue management

## Prerequisites
- GitHub CLI installed and authenticated
- Appropriate repository permissions

## Commands

# Check auth status
gh auth status

# Login
gh auth login
```

### Repository Operations
```bash
# Clone repository
gh repo clone <owner/repo>

# View repository
gh repo view

# Create repository
gh repo create <name> --public --description "Description"
```

### Pull Request Operations
```bash
# Create PR
gh pr create --title "Title" --body "Description"

# List PRs
gh pr list

# View PR
gh pr view <number>

# Merge PR
gh pr merge <number> --merge
```

### Workflow Operations
```bash
# List workflows
gh workflow list

# Run workflow
gh workflow run <workflow-name>

# View workflow run
gh run view <run-id>

```

### Issue Operations
