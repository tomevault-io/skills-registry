# copilot

Drive the GitHub Copilot CLI and coding agent. Three modes:

| Mode | Invocation | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `review` | `/copilot review <pr>` | Review a PR, route fixes to Copilot via inline comments. |
| `delegate` | `/copilot delegate <task>` | Create a `gh agent-task`, monitor until it produces a PR. |
| `setup` | `/copilot setup` | One-time bootstrap of `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and friends. |

Routine work is `review` and `delegate`. Read
[references/setup.md](references/setup.md) **only** when the user
explicitly says "copilot setup", "generate copilot instructions", or
"bootstrap copilot for this repo" — never for routine review/delegate
work, since it adds ~12 KB of repo-bootstrap content irrelevant to those
modes.

## Mode selection

Parse the first positional argument as the mode. If no mode is given, ask
the user which mode they want with `AskUserQuestion`. Never silently default
— each mode has very different side effects.

| First arg | Mode |
| --- | --- |
| `review` (with optional PR number / URL after) | `review` |
| `delegate` followed by a task description | `delegate` |
| `setup` | `setup` (load `references/setup.md`) |
| Bare PR URL (`https://github.com/...`) | `review` |
| Anything else (bare integer, ambiguous, missing) | ask via `AskUserQuestion` |

A bare integer is **ambiguous** — it could be a PR number, a `gh
agent-task` ID, or noise. Always ask before assuming review mode.

## Mode: review

Review a PR and post Copilot-actionable fixes as inline review comments.

### Phase 1: fetch PR context

Determine the PR number. If the argument is a PR URL, extract the number.
If a bare integer was passed, confirm with the user it is a PR number (it
could equally be a `gh agent-task` ID). If no number was provided, run
`gh pr list` and ask which PR.

```bash
PR=<number>
gh pr view "$PR" --json title,body,author,baseRefName,headRefName,url,number,additions,deletions,changedFiles
gh pr diff "$PR"
OWNER_REPO=$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner --jq '.nameWithOwner')
gh api "repos/${OWNER_REPO}/pulls/${PR}/files" \
  --jq '.[] | {filename, status, additions, deletions, patch}'
```

Present a brief summary (title, author, base ← head, files changed,
additions/deletions) before continuing.

### Phase 2: run the review

Invoke whatever code-review skill the calling environment provides (in the
cheese-flow ecosystem this is `age`; elsewhere it may be `code-review` or
similar). The review must surface findings with confidence scores so
phase 3 can triage. If no review skill is available, ask the user to point
at one before continuing — do not guess at findings.

### Phase 3: triage findings for Copilot

For each finding, assign a disposition:

- `COPILOT_FIX` — straightforward fix Copilot can handle (add validation,
  fix logic, delete dead code, inline a wrapper, remove a docstring that
  restates the function name).
- `FUTURE_TASK` — broader context needed, architectural decision, or a
  multi-file refactor.

Present a per-file table:

```text
### path/to/file.ts

| # | Score | Line | Category | Issue                       | Disposition |
|---|-------|------|----------|-----------------------------|-------------|
| 1 | 95    | 42   | BUG      | Null check missing          | COPILOT_FIX |
| 2 | 80    | 78   | COUPLING | Domain imports HTTP client  | FUTURE_TASK |
```

Then show the full comment body for each item.

**`COPILOT_FIX` body**:

```text
**[CATEGORY]**: <issue description>

**Why this matters:** <teaching moment — the principle behind the fix>

@copilot fix this
```

**`FUTURE_TASK` body**:

```text
**[CATEGORY]**: <issue description>

**Why this matters:** <teaching moment — the principle behind the suggestion>

_Noted for future work — not a Copilot fix._
```

Ask the user which to post, which to skip, which to edit, and whether any
disposition should change. **Never post without explicit approval.**

### Phase 4: post the review

Build a single review payload and submit it:

```bash
cat > /tmp/copilot-review-payload.json <<'JSON'
{
  "body": "Automated review — items marked for @copilot are actionable fixes.",
  "event": "COMMENT",
  "comments": [
    {
      "path": "path/to/file.ts",
      "line": 42,
      "side": "RIGHT",
      "body": "**BUG**: Null check missing...\n\n@copilot fix this"
    }
  ]
}
JSON
gh api --method POST \
  "repos/${OWNER_REPO}/pulls/${PR}/reviews" \
  --input /tmp/copilot-review-payload.json
rm -f /tmp/copilot-review-payload.json
```

Print a summary: total posted, `COPILOT_FIX` count, `FUTURE_TASK` count,
PR link.

### Review-mode rules

- Never post without user approval.
- Frame in business terms — never "this function processes data".
- One comment per issue — note "same pattern at lines X, Y, Z" for repeats.
- Respect the codebase — do not flag consistent existing patterns.
- All review intelligence comes from the review sub-skill; this mode handles
  PR fetch + Copilot formatting only.

## Mode: delegate

Create a `gh agent-task`, poll until the Copilot coding agent opens a PR,
then optionally hand off to review mode.

### Copilot model constraints

The coding agent runs on Auto model selection (typically Claude Sonnet
4.5). The CLI has no `--model` flag. Optimize the task description:

- Be explicit and concrete. Spell out expected behavior.
- Scope tightly. One focused task per delegation.
- Name files and symbols. "In `src/auth/login.ts`, `validateToken` should…"
- State acceptance criteria. "Return 400 for empty email, 422 for malformed."
- Include constraints. Reference existing patterns (e.g., `AppError`).
- Skip the why. Sonnet does not need motivation, just what and where.

When confirming the task with the user (phase 1 step 3), check the
description against these criteria. Suggest concrete improvements if it is
vague or under-specified.

### Phase 1: create the agent task

1. If no task description was passed, ask the user what to delegate.
2. Capture repo context: `gh repo view --json nameWithOwner --jq '.nameWithOwner'`.
3. Confirm with the user before creating: show the task description, target
   repo, and ask whether a non-default base branch is needed.
4. Create the task: `gh agent-task create "<task description>"`.
5. Capture the task reference with `gh agent-task list --limit 1`. Parse
   the tab-separated row (`description \t #PR \t repo \t status \t timestamp`)
   and extract the **PR number** and **status**.
6. Confirm to the user: task description, PR number, status, and link
   (`https://github.com/<repo>/pull/<number>`).

### Phase 2: monitor for completion

Poll every **90 seconds**, up to a **15-minute** timeout.

```bash
sleep 90
gh agent-task list --limit 5
```

Find the row matching the captured PR number. Branch on status:

- **In progress / Working** — print a one-line status update with elapsed
  time. Continue.
- **Ready for review / Completed** — break and proceed to phase 3.
- **Failed / Error** — show details via `gh agent-task view <PR#>` and stop.

On 15-minute timeout, tell the user the task is still running, give the PR
link, and ask whether to wait another 10 minutes or stop and review later.

### Phase 3: review the PR

Print a completion summary (PR number, link, final status, elapsed time)
and ask "Run `/copilot review` on PR #N?". On yes, invoke this skill in
review mode with the PR number. On no, print the link and exit.

### Delegate-mode rules

- Always confirm before creating. The user must approve the task and repo.
- Keep polling updates minimal — one line per check.
- Fail fast on errors. If `gh agent-task create` fails, surface the error
  and stop.
- Never guess PR numbers — always parse `gh agent-task list` output.

## Mode: setup

`setup` is a one-time bootstrap that writes `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
and the per-language / per-role files under `.github/instructions/`.

See [references/setup.md](references/setup.md) — read **only** when the
user explicitly says "copilot setup", "generate copilot instructions", or
"bootstrap copilot for this repo". It contains the full walkthrough:
project-type detection, tooling detection, overwrite gating, the global
instructions template, the code-review instructions template,
language-specific stubs, and the coding-agent instructions. Loading it
costs ~12 KB of context and is irrelevant to routine `review` / `delegate`
work.

## What this skill never does

- Run `git push`, open PRs, or merge — that is `/gh`'s job.
- Commit code — that is `/commit`'s job.
- Generate a code review on its own — `review` mode delegates to whatever
  review skill the environment provides (e.g. `age`, `code-review`).
- Modify any file outside `.github/` during `setup`.
- Post review comments without explicit user approval.
