# session-analytics

Query Claude Code session logs. DuckDB is the database, SQL is the interface.

## How it works

Session logs live as JSONL files in `~/.claude/projects/`. Each conversation
turn is one JSON line. This skill materializes them into a DuckDB database
with pre-flattened tables so you can answer questions with single SQL queries.

## Prerequisites

Requires the `duckdb` CLI on PATH (`brew install duckdb` on macOS). The ingest
script shells out to duckdb — it will error if the binary isn't found. Never
use python3 for querying — always use the duckdb CLI directly.

## Step 1: Ensure the database exists

Run the ingestion script. It has a 1-hour TTL — it skips work if the database
is fresh. Always run this first.

```bash
python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/ingest.py
```

Use `--force` to re-ingest regardless of TTL (e.g., if the user wants the
latest data from the current session).

The database lives at `~/.claude/analytics/sessions.duckdb`.

## Step 2: Query via DuckDB CLI

All queries go through the CLI. Use `-json` for structured output you can
reason about, or omit it for human-readable tables.

```bash
duckdb ~/.claude/analytics/sessions.duckdb -json -c "SELECT ..."
```

## Schema

### `tool_uses`
Flattened from assistant message `content[]` blocks where `type = 'tool_use'`.

### `raw_entries`
The full unflattened JSONL data. Use only when the materialized tables
don't have what you need.

## Query Catalog

Organized by investigation type. Use as starting points — modify for your question.

### Tool usage frequency
```sql
SELECT tool_name, count(*) AS uses
FROM tool_uses
GROUP BY tool_name
ORDER BY uses DESC;
```

### Error rate by tool
```sql
SELECT
    tu.tool_name,
    count(*) AS total,
    sum(CASE WHEN tr.is_error = 'true' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS errors,
    round(sum(CASE WHEN tr.is_error = 'true' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / count(*), 1) AS error_pct
FROM tool_uses tu
JOIN tool_results tr ON tu.tool_use_id = tr.tool_use_id
GROUP BY tu.tool_name
ORDER BY errors DESC;
```

### MCP server usage breakdown
```sql
SELECT
    split_part(tool_name, '__', 2) AS server,
    split_part(tool_name, '__', 3) AS method,
    count(*) AS calls
FROM mcp_calls
GROUP BY server, method
ORDER BY calls DESC;
```

### Skill usage over time
```sql
SELECT
    skill_name,
    timestamp::DATE AS day,
    count(*) AS uses
FROM skill_invocations
GROUP BY skill_name, day
ORDER BY day DESC, uses DESC;
```

### Busiest sessions
```sql
SELECT
    s.sessionId,
    s.project,
    s.branch,
    s.first_seen,
    s.last_seen,
    (SELECT count(*) FROM tool_uses tu WHERE tu.sessionId = s.sessionId) AS tool_calls
FROM sessions s
ORDER BY tool_calls DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Most common Bash commands
```sql
SELECT
    substr(bash_cmd, 1, 80) AS cmd,
    count(*) AS uses
FROM tool_uses
WHERE tool_name = 'Bash' AND bash_cmd IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY cmd
ORDER BY uses DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### Permission friction audit
```sql
SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN bash_cmd LIKE '%python3%' THEN 'python3 inline'
        WHEN bash_cmd LIKE '%cat %' AND bash_cmd LIKE '%>%' THEN 'cat redirect (use Write)'
        WHEN bash_cmd LIKE 'find %' OR bash_cmd LIKE '% find %' THEN 'find (use Glob)'
        WHEN bash_cmd LIKE 'grep %' OR bash_cmd LIKE 'egrep %' THEN 'grep (use Grep)'
        WHEN bash_cmd LIKE 'sed %' OR bash_cmd LIKE '%sed -i%' THEN 'sed (use Edit)'
        WHEN bash_cmd LIKE 'cd %' AND bash_cmd LIKE '%git%' THEN 'cd+git compound'
        WHEN bash_cmd LIKE 'cd %' AND bash_cmd LIKE '%gh %' THEN 'cd+gh compound'
        ELSE 'other: ' || substr(bash_cmd, 1, 50)
    END AS category,
    count(*) AS denials
FROM tool_uses tu
JOIN tool_results tr ON tu.tool_use_id = tr.tool_use_id
WHERE tu.tool_name = 'Bash'
AND tr.is_error = 'true'
AND tr.content LIKE 'Permission to use Bash%'
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY denials DESC;
```

### Hook impact analysis
```sql
SELECT
    level,
    preventedContinuation,
    substr(stopReason, 1, 100) AS reason,
    count(*) AS cnt
FROM stop_hooks
GROUP BY level, preventedContinuation, reason
ORDER BY cnt DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### Hook duration breakdown
```sql
SELECT
    json_extract_string(hook_info, '$.command') AS hook_command,
    count(*) AS executions,
    round(avg(CAST(json_extract_string(hook_info, '$.durationMs') AS DOUBLE)), 0) AS avg_ms,
    max(CAST(json_extract_string(hook_info, '$.durationMs') AS DOUBLE)) AS max_ms
FROM stop_hooks,
     unnest(json_extract(hookInfos, '$[*]')) AS t(hook_info)
WHERE hookInfos IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY hook_command
ORDER BY executions DESC;
```

### Agent spawn patterns by skill
```sql
SELECT
    si.skill_name,
    asp.agent_type,
    substr(asp.description, 1, 60) AS agent_desc,
    count(*) AS spawns
FROM skill_invocations si
JOIN agent_spawns asp
    ON si.sessionId = asp.sessionId
    AND asp.timestamp::TIMESTAMP BETWEEN si.timestamp::TIMESTAMP
        AND si.timestamp::TIMESTAMP + INTERVAL '10' MINUTE
GROUP BY si.skill_name, asp.agent_type, agent_desc
ORDER BY si.skill_name, spawns DESC;
```

### Daily activity heatmap
```sql
SELECT
    timestamp::DATE AS day,
    extract(hour FROM timestamp::TIMESTAMP) AS hour,
    count(*) AS calls
FROM tool_uses
WHERE timestamp::DATE >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '14' DAY
GROUP BY day, hour
ORDER BY day DESC, hour;
```

### Filter by project cwd
Restrict any query to a single project by matching `cwd LIKE '%<keyword>%'`.
Substitute `<keyword>` with a fragment of the project's working directory
(e.g. `vaudeville`, `port-louis`). This is the same pattern
`vaudeville.analytics.query_session_patterns(project_filter=...)` uses.

```sql
-- Top bash commands scoped to one project
SELECT bash_cmd, count(*) AS uses
FROM tool_uses
WHERE tool_name = 'Bash'
  AND bash_cmd IS NOT NULL
  AND cwd LIKE '%vaudeville%'
GROUP BY bash_cmd
ORDER BY uses DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Top tool uses scoped to one project
SELECT tool_name, count(*) AS uses
FROM tool_uses
WHERE cwd LIKE '%vaudeville%'
GROUP BY tool_name
ORDER BY uses DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Permission denials scoped to one project (join through sessions.project)
SELECT pd.content, count(*) AS cnt
FROM permission_denials pd
JOIN sessions s ON pd.sessionId = s.sessionId
WHERE s.project LIKE '%vaudeville%'
GROUP BY pd.content
ORDER BY cnt DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

## Pre-built query scripts

For common analytics questions, use these scripts instead of writing inline SQL
or Python. All scripts live in `<skill-dir>/scripts/queries/`. Most accept
`--days N`, `--limit N`, and `--json` flags; `hook_stats.py` accepts `--days`
and `--json` but uses a fixed error-pattern limit of 10.

```bash
# Denied tool names ranked by frequency (replaces inline Python regex extraction)
python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/queries/denied_tools.py [--days 14] [--json]

# Top tools by usage count
python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/queries/tool_usage.py [--days 14] [--json]

# Tools ranked by error rate
python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/queries/error_rates.py [--days 14] [--min-uses 5] [--json]

# Most-repeated bash commands (add --dangerous for risky ones only)
python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/queries/bash_patterns.py [--days 14] [--dangerous] [--json]

# Bash commands that should use dedicated tools (cat→Read, grep→Grep, etc.)
python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/queries/tool_misuse.py [--days 14] [--json]

# Hook coverage ratio and error patterns
python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/queries/hook_stats.py [--days 14] [--json]
```

Use `--json` for structured output you can pipe to `jq`. Without it, most
scripts output tab-separated values; `hook_stats.py` prints a multi-line
human-formatted summary instead.

## Query patterns

When answering user questions:

1. Run `python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/ingest.py` first (fast if cached)
2. Translate the question into SQL against the schema above
3. Use `duckdb ~/.claude/analytics/sessions.duckdb -json -c "..."` to execute
4. Present results as markdown tables when there are 3+ rows. For single-value
   answers, state the number directly. Lead with the answer, then show the
   query if the user might want to modify it.
5. For follow-up questions, skip ingestion — the database persists

For complex analysis, chain multiple queries. Aim to answer within 5-8 queries.
If the question needs more, present intermediate findings and ask if deeper
analysis is needed.

When filtering by project, use `LIKE '%keyword%'` on the `cwd` column since
full paths are verbose.

Timestamps are ISO 8601 strings stored as VARCHAR. Cast to TIMESTAMP for
date math: `timestamp::TIMESTAMP`, `timestamp::DATE`, or use `extract()`.

## Gotchas

- Empty DuckDB CLI JSON results return `[{]` not `[]` — handle both
- `is_error` in tool_results is VARCHAR `'true'`/`'false'`, not boolean
- Timestamps are VARCHAR — cast explicitly for date math
- The `input` column in tool_uses is full JSON — use `json_extract_string()`
  to pull specific fields not already materialized as columns
- DuckDB CLI `-json` mode returns all values as strings

## What This Skill Doesn't Do

- Read or reconstruct individual session transcripts
- Debug issues in the current session
- Modify or delete session log files
- Query external data sources
- Write ad-hoc Python scripts — all queries go through duckdb CLI
