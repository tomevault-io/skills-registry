# CodeRabbit Review Triage

Fetch and analyze CodeRabbit review comments from a GitHub PR, or run a local CodeRabbit CLI review. Default mode fetches from the remote PR. Use `--local` to run the CLI against local diffs.

## Arguments

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for:

- `<pr-number>` — integer PR number
- `<pr-url>` — GitHub PR URL (e.g., `https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123`), extract the PR number from the path
- `--local` — switch to local review mode (see below)

### Mode Dispatch

If `$ARGUMENTS` contains `--local`, strip it and forward remaining arguments to `references/local-review.md`. Follow that workflow instead of continuing here. All flags after `--local` (`--base`, `--base-commit`, `--type`, `--config`) are forwarded to the local workflow.

Otherwise, continue with the PR comment analysis workflow below.

## Prerequisites

Run these checks in order. Stop at the first failure.

### 1) GitHub CLI Authenticated

```bash
gh auth status
```

If not authenticated, stop and tell the user to run `gh auth login`.

### 2) Detect Repository

```bash
gh repo view --json owner,name --jq '"\(.owner.login)/\(.name)"'
```

Store the result as `{owner}/{repo}`.

### 3) Resolve PR Number

- If a PR number was provided as an argument, use it directly.
- If a PR URL was provided, extract the number from the URL path.
- If neither was provided, auto-detect from the current branch:

```bash
gh pr view --json number --jq '.number' 2>/dev/null
```

If auto-detection fails, stop: "No open PR found for the current branch. Provide a PR number or URL, or use `--local` for local review."

### 4) Validate PR

```bash
gh pr view {pr_number} --json state,url --jq '"\(.state) \(.url)"'
```

If the command fails, the PR does not exist. Report and stop. Otherwise, note the state (OPEN/MERGED/CLOSED) and URL for the report scope section.

## Workflow

### 1) Fetch CodeRabbit Comments

Fetch from three GitHub API endpoints, filtering for the CodeRabbit bot. Use `--paginate` for large PRs. The bot's login is `coderabbitai` but may appear as `coderabbitai[bot]`, so match with `startswith`.

**Walkthrough/summary comments** (issue comments where CodeRabbit posts its walkthrough):

```bash
gh api "repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{pr_number}/comments" \
  --paginate \
  --jq '[.[] | select(.user.login | startswith("coderabbitai"))]'
```

**Review objects** (top-level review body and state):

```bash
gh api "repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr_number}/reviews" \
  --paginate \
  --jq '[.[] | select(.user.login | startswith("coderabbitai"))]'
```

**Inline review comments** (file-level comments with path and line info):

```bash
gh api "repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr_number}/comments" \
  --paginate \
  --jq '[.[] | select(.user.login | startswith("coderabbitai"))]'
```

If no CodeRabbit comments are found across all three endpoints, report "No CodeRabbit review found on PR #{pr_number}" and stop.

### 2) Parse Comments into Findings

Process the raw API responses into a normalized list of findings:

- **From inline comments** (`pulls/{pr}/comments`): Each comment becomes a finding with `path` (from `.path`), `line` (from `.line` or `.original_line`), `body` (the comment text), `diff_hunk` (surrounding context), and `source: "inline"`. These are the primary source of actionable findings.
- **From review bodies** (`pulls/{pr}/reviews`): Parse each review's `body` for actionable items. Extract individual suggestions. Mark `source: "review"`.
- **From issue comments** (`issues/{pr}/comments`): Parse for file-level summaries and actionable items within the walkthrough. Mark `source: "walkthrough"`.

Inline comments are the primary source of actionable findings. Review summaries and walkthrough comments provide context and may surface additional actionable items not tied to specific lines.

### 3) Triage Findings

Load `references/triage.md` and follow the shared triage process — categorize, classify, confirm ambiguous, generate fix plan, and report.

## Stop Conditions

Stop and ask for direction when:

- `gh` CLI is not authenticated.
- The PR does not exist or is not accessible.
- No CodeRabbit comments found on the PR.
- Auto-detection fails and no PR number was provided.
- A finding requires architectural changes beyond the PR's scope.
- Classification confidence is low for code on critical paths (auth, payments, data integrity).
