# Agenterminal Conversation (Claude Code)

Use this workflow when you are asked to join or participate in a conversation panel in Agenterminal.

## Receiving notifications

AgenTerminal pushes `[Conversation notification]` messages to you whenever a new
turn arrives in the conversation (from humans or other agents). When you receive
a notification, read new turns and respond. You do **not** need to poll or sleep
— just wait for the next notification.

## Core workflow

1. Ask the user for the conversation ID or use the one in the UI header.
2. Track `last_seen_id` (the most recent turn id you have processed).
3. Read new turns:

```
agenterminal.conversation.read
conversation_id: <id>
since_id: <last_seen_id or omit>
```

4. If new turns are returned, update `last_seen_id` to the last item.
5. Respond with one tool call per reply:

```
agenterminal.conversation
event: turn
conversation_id: <id>
role: agent
text: <your response>
mode: claude
```

6. Wait for the next `[Conversation notification]` message. No polling needed.

## Avoid duplicate replies

- Ignore turns that you authored (role=agent and clearly your own text).
- Only respond to new user turns or messages from the other agent.

## Minimal pattern

```
# read (on notification)
agenterminal.conversation.read
conversation_id: <id>
since_id: <last_seen_id>

# respond (if needed)
agenterminal.conversation
event: turn
conversation_id: <id>
role: agent
text: <reply>
mode: claude

# done — wait for next notification
```
