# PayRam Bitcoin Payments

> **First time with PayRam?** See [`payram-setup`](https://github.com/payram/payram-mcp/tree/main/skills/payram-setup) to configure your server, API keys, and wallets.

PayRam supports on-chain Bitcoin with a unique architecture: HD wallet derivation for deposits, mobile app signing for sweeps—no private keys ever touch the server.

## Bitcoin vs EVM Architecture

| Aspect            | EVM Chains               | Bitcoin                    |
| ----------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| Deposit addresses | Smart contract generated | HD wallet derived          |
| Sweep mechanism   | Automated smart contract | Manual mobile app approval |
| Key storage       | Keyless (contract-based) | Seed phrase on mobile only |
| Confirmation time | ~15 sec - 2 min          | ~10-60 min                 |

## Setup Overview

### Step 1: Configure Bitcoin in PayRam Dashboard

1. Navigate to **Wallet Management → Bitcoin & Other Networks**
2. Click **Add Cold Wallet**
3. Enter your Bitcoin cold wallet address (where funds will sweep to)

### Step 2: Link Mobile App

The PayRam Merchant mobile app handles Bitcoin signing:

1. Download PayRam Merchant app (iOS/Android)
2. In PayRam dashboard: **Settings → Accounts → Connect to PayRam Mobile App**
3. Scan QR code with mobile app
4. Set up device passcode/biometrics

### Step 3: Enter Seed Phrase (Mobile Only)

1. Open PayRam Merchant app
2. Select your configured BTC wallet
3. Click **Link Wallet**
4. Enter 12-word Bitcoin seed phrase

**Security**: Seed phrase is encrypted and stored only on your mobile device. Never transmitted to server.

### Step 4: Approve Sweeps via Mobile

When deposits accumulate:

1. Open app → **Signing Requests → Pending**
2. Review batch: deposit addresses, amounts, fees
3. Approve batch to sweep funds to cold wallet
4. Monitor progress in **In Progress** tab
5. View completed sweeps in **History**

## Payment Flow

```
1. Customer requests payment
2. PayRam derives unique BTC address from your seed (HD wallet)
3. Customer sends BTC to deposit address
4. PayRam detects transaction, waits for confirmations
5. Webhook fires: payment.pending → payment.successful
6. Deposits batch for sweep
7. You approve sweep in mobile app
8. Funds move to your cold wallet
```

## Integration

Bitcoin payments use the same API as stablecoin/crypto payments:

```javascript
const response = await axios.post(
  `${PAYRAM_BASE_URL}/api/v1/payment`,
  {
    customerEmail: 'customer@example.com',
    customerId: 'user_123',
    amountInUSD: 50, // PayRam shows BTC equivalent
  },
  { headers: { 'API-Key': PAYRAM_API_KEY } },
);

// User redirected to payment page
// Can select Bitcoin as payment method
```

### Webhook Events

```json
{
  "type": "payment.successful",
  "data": {
    "reference_id": "abc123",
    "chain": "bitcoin",
    "token": "BTC",
    "amountInUSD": 50,
    "tokenAmount": "0.00052",
    "txHash": "abc123...",
    "confirmations": 3
  }
}
```

## HD Wallet Derivation

PayRam uses BIP44 derivation to generate unique addresses:

- **Master seed**: Your 12-word phrase (mobile only)
- **Derivation path**: `m/44'/0'/0'/0/n`
- **Result**: Unlimited unique deposit addresses, all controlled by same seed

Benefits:

- Each customer/transaction gets unique address
- No address reuse
- Single seed controls all deposits
- Cold wallet receives all swept funds

## Confirmation Requirements

Bitcoin requires more confirmations due to longer block times:

| Amount       | Recommended Confirmations |
| ------------ | ------------------------- |
| < $100       | 1 confirmation (~10 min)  |
| $100 - $1000 | 3 confirmations (~30 min) |
| > $1000      | 6 confirmations (~60 min) |

Configure thresholds in PayRam dashboard.

## Mobile App Security

**What's on the server**:

- Extended public key (xpub) for address generation
- Hot wallet key (encrypted, gas-only for EVM operations)
- No BTC private keys or seed phrase

**What's on mobile**:

- Encrypted seed phrase
- Signing capability
- Protected by device security (PIN, biometrics)

**Sweep approval**:

- Each batch requires explicit mobile approval
- Review amounts, addresses, fees before signing
- Audit trail of all approvals

## Compared to Other Solutions

| Feature            | PayRam | BTCPay Server | BitPay |
| ------------------ | ------ | ------------- | ------ |
| Self-hosted        | ✅     | ✅            | ❌     |
| Mobile signing     | ✅     | ❌            | ❌     |
| Stablecoin support | ✅     | Limited       | ✅     |
| Deposit keys off server | ✅  | ❌            | ❌     |

## MCP Server Tools

Standard payment tools work for Bitcoin:

| Tool                           | Purpose                   |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| `generate_payment_sdk_snippet` | Payment creation          |
| `generate_webhook_handler`     | BTC payment events        |
| `scaffold_payram_app`          | Full app with BTC support |

## Troubleshooting

**Deposits not detected**: Check Bitcoin node sync status in PayRam dashboard.

**Sweep pending too long**: Open mobile app, check Signing Requests → Pending.

**Address derivation issues**: Verify seed phrase matches expected xpub.
