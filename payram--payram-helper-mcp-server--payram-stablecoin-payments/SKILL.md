# PayRam Stablecoin Gateway

> **First time with PayRam?** See [`payram-setup`](https://github.com/payram/payram-mcp/tree/main/skills/payram-setup) to configure your server, API keys, and wallets.

PayRam's Private Stablecoin Gateway enables businesses to accept USDT and USDC directly—no volatility, no intermediary custody, complete sovereignty.

## Why Stablecoins for Payments

**Price Stability**: 1 USDT ≈ 1 USD. No Bitcoin/ETH volatility risk during payment window.

**Global Settlement**: Instant cross-border payments without SWIFT delays or correspondent banking.

**Lower Fees**: On-chain fees (especially on L2s like Base, Polygon) are fractions of traditional payment processing.

**24/7 Availability**: No bank holidays, no cutoff times, no weekend delays.

## Supported Stablecoins & Networks

| Token | Networks                | Notes                         |
| ----- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| USDT  | Ethereum, Polygon, Tron | Tron has lowest fees          |
| USDC  | Ethereum, Base, Polygon | Base recommended for low fees |

**Chain Selection Strategy**:

- **High volume, low value**: Tron (USDT) or Base (USDC) — sub-cent fees
- **Enterprise/high value**: Ethereum — maximum security, higher fees
- **Balanced**: Polygon — low fees, good security

## Architecture: Private Stablecoin Gateway

PayRam's stablecoin handling is architecturally distinct from hosted processors:

**Deposit Flow**:

1. Customer requests payment → PayRam generates unique deposit address
2. Customer sends USDT/USDC to deposit address
3. PayRam detects on-chain transfer
4. Smart contract sweeps funds to your cold wallet
5. Webhook fires to your backend

**Key Differentiators**:

- **Unlimited deposit addresses**: Each transaction gets a unique address (industry first)
- **Zero-key-exposure**: Only the hot wallet key is on the server (encrypted, gas-only — no access to deposit funds). Smart contracts hardcode sweep destinations on-chain — a server breach cannot redirect deposit funds.
- **Smart contract sweeps**: Automated, immutable fund consolidation to your cold wallet
- **Your cold wallet**: Funds settle to wallets you control

## Integration

### MCP Server Tools

```bash
cd payram-mcp && yarn dev
```

Use standard payment tools—stablecoin vs crypto is configured at the PayRam dashboard level:

| Tool                           | Purpose                                 |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| `generate_payment_sdk_snippet` | Create payment (works for stablecoins)  |
| `generate_webhook_handler`     | Handle stablecoin payment confirmations |
| `scaffold_payram_app`          | Full app with stablecoin support        |

### Payment Creation

Same API as general crypto payments—PayRam presents available chains/tokens based on your configuration:

```javascript
const response = await axios.post(
  `${PAYRAM_BASE_URL}/api/v1/payment`,
  {
    customerEmail: 'customer@example.com',
    customerId: 'user_123',
    amountInUSD: 100, // Customer pays ~100 USDT/USDC
  },
  { headers: { 'API-Key': PAYRAM_API_KEY } },
);
// Redirect to response.data.url
// User selects USDT on Tron, USDC on Base, etc.
```

### Webhook Payload for Stablecoins

```json
{
  "type": "payment.successful",
  "data": {
    "reference_id": "abc123",
    "amountInUSD": 100,
    "chain": "tron",
    "token": "USDT",
    "tokenAmount": "100.000000",
    "txHash": "0x...",
    "depositAddress": "T..."
  }
}
```

## Cold Wallet Setup for Stablecoins

### EVM Chains (Ethereum, Base, Polygon)

1. Deploy sweep contract via PayRam dashboard
2. Use same cold wallet address across all EVM chains (address format compatible)
3. Funds auto-sweep when threshold reached

### Tron

1. Deploy separate Tron sweep contract
2. Use Tron-format cold wallet (starts with T)
3. TRX required in hot wallet for energy/bandwidth

## Settlement & Reconciliation

**Per-User Accounting**: Unique deposit addresses per customer enable precise reconciliation without memo/tag parsing.

**Real-Time Dashboard**: PayRam dashboard shows deposits, sweeps, and balances per chain/token.

**Export**: Transaction history exportable for accounting integration.

## Use Cases

- **E-commerce**: Accept stablecoin payments, settle in USDT/USDC
- **B2B Invoicing**: Large-value international payments without wire fees
- **Payroll**: Pay contractors in stablecoins globally
- **iGaming**: Instant deposits/withdrawals in stable value
- **Remittance**: Cross-border transfers at near-zero cost
