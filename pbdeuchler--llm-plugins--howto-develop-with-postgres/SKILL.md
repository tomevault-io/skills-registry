# PostgreSQL Development Patterns

## Overview

Enforce transaction safety, type safety, and naming conventions to prevent data corruption and runtime errors.

**Core principles:**

- Transactions prevent partial updates (data corruption)
- Type safety catches errors at compile time
- Naming conventions ensure consistency
- Read-write separation prevents accidental mutations

## Transaction Management

### Transaction vs Query Execution

**Methods that START transactions:**

- Must NOT accept a specific connection/executor parameter, takes things like a database pool or client
- Create the transaction and then pass that transaction object to an underlying method that performs the actual query
- Usually exported or public

**Methods that PARTICIPATE in transactions:**

- MUST accept a generic connection/executor parameter
- Execute queries using the provided executor
- Usually unexported or private

**What DOES NOT count as "starting a transaction":**

- Single INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE operations
- Atomic operations like `onConflictDoUpdate`
- SELECT queries

## Type Safety

### Primary Keys

**Default: ULID stored as UUID**

- When in doubt, use ULID: "Most things can leak in some way"
- Prevents ID enumeration attacks
- Time-sortable for indexing efficiency

**Exceptions (context-dependent):**

- Pure join tables (composite PK from both FKs)
- Small lookup tables (serial/identity acceptable)
- Internal-only tables with no user visibility (serial/identity acceptable)

**Rule:** If unsure whether data will be user-visible, use ULID.

### Financial Data

**Use exact decimal types (numeric/decimal) for monetary values:**

- Never use float/double for money (causes rounding errors)
- Use numeric/decimal with appropriate precision and scale
- Example: `numeric(19, 4)` for general financial data

**Why:** Floating-point types accumulate rounding errors. Exact decimal types prevent financial discrepancies.

### JSONB Columns

**ALWAYS type JSONB columns in your ORM/schema:**

- Use typed schema when structure is known
- Use `Record<string, unknown>` if truly schemaless
- Never leave JSONB untyped

**Why:** Prevents runtime errors from accessing undefined properties or wrong types.

### Read-Write Separation

**Maintain separate client types at compile time:**

- Read-write client: Full mutation capabilities
- Read-only client: Mutation methods removed at type level
- Default to read-only for query methods
- Use read-write only when mutations needed

**Why:** Prevents accidental writes to replica, enforces deliberate mutation choices.

## Naming Conventions

### Database Identifiers

**All database objects use snake_case:**

- Tables: `user_preferences`, `order_items`
- Columns: `created_at`, `user_id`, `is_active`
- Indexes: `idx_tablename_columns` (e.g., `idx_users_email`)
- Foreign keys: `fk_tablename_reftable` (e.g., `fk_orders_users`)

**Application code:** Map to idiomatic case (camelCase in TypeScript, etc.)

### Schema Patterns

**Standard mixins:**

- `created_at`, `updated_at` timestamps on all tables
- `deleted_at` for soft deletion when needed
- `tenant_id` for multi-tenant tables (project-dependent)

**Proactive indexing:**

- All foreign key columns
- Columns used in WHERE clauses
- Columns used in JOIN conditions
- Columns used in ORDER BY

## Concurrency

**Default isolation (Read Committed) for most operations.**

**Use stricter isolation when:**

- Financial operations: Serializable isolation
- Inventory/count operations: Serializable isolation
- Critical sections: Pessimistic locking (`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`)

## Migrations

**Always use generate + migrate workflow:**

1. Generate migration file
2. Review migration SQL
3. Apply migration to database

**Never use auto-push workflow in production.**

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake                                           | Reality                                                                                 | Fix                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "This is one operation, doesn't need transaction" | Multi-step operations without transactions cause partial updates and data corruption    | Wrap in transaction with TX\_ prefix                          |
| "Single atomic operation needs TX\_ prefix"       | TX\_ is for explicit transaction blocks, not atomic operations                          | No TX\_ for single INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE                       |
| "UUID is just a string"                           | Type confusion causes runtime errors (wrong ID formats, failed lookups)                 | Use strict UUID type in language                              |
| "I'll type JSONB later when schema stabilizes"    | Untyped JSONB leads to undefined property access and type errors                        | Type immediately with known fields or Record<string, unknown> |
| "Read client vs write client doesn't matter"      | Using wrong client bypasses separation, allows accidental mutations                     | Use read-only client by default, switch deliberately          |
| "I'll add indexes when we see performance issues" | Missing indexes on foreign keys cause slow queries from day one                         | Add indexes proactively for FKs and common filters            |
| "This table won't be user-visible, use serial"    | Requirements change, IDs leak in logs/URLs/errors                                       | Use ULID by default unless certain it's internal-only         |
| "Float/double is fine for money, close enough"    | Rounding errors accumulate, causing financial discrepancies (0.01 differences multiply) | Use numeric/decimal types for exact arithmetic                |

## Red Flags - STOP and Refactor

**Transaction management:**

- Method calls `.transaction()` but no `TX_` prefix
- Method has `TX_` prefix but accepts executor parameter
- Multi-step operation without transaction wrapper

**Type safety:**

- JSONB column without type annotation
- UUID/ULID stored as plain string type
- No separation between read and write clients
- Float/double types for monetary values

**Schema:**

- Missing indexes on foreign keys
- No `created_at`/`updated_at` timestamps
- camelCase or PascalCase in database identifiers

**All of these mean: Stop and fix immediately.**
