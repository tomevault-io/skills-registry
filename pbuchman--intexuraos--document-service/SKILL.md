# Document Service

Generate comprehensive documentation for IntexuraOS services (apps, workers, and packages).

## Usage

```
/document-service                   # List available services (discovery mode)
/document-service <service-name>    # Document service interactively
```

**Autonomous mode:** Use Task tool with `subagent_type: service-scribe` for batch documentation without user interaction.

**Team mode:** Orchestrate parallel documentation agents for full monorepo coverage with cross-validation.

## Core Mandates

1. **Code-First Analysis**: Always analyze actual code before generating docs
2. **No Fabrication**: Never invent version numbers, endpoints, env vars, resource limits, line counts, or method names — only document what exists in source code. See `workflows/autonomous.md` Phase 3.5 for grounding rules
3. **Preserve User Insights**: Never lose user-provided context from previous runs
4. **Incremental Updates**: Website content updates are additive, not full regenerations
5. **Quality Assurance**: Self-critique before writing files to disk — includes mandatory factual validation (Phase 4.5)
6. **Debt Tracking**: Archive resolved items, never delete history
7. **Cross-Validation**: After generation, validate docs against code and other service docs
8. **Typographic Consistency**: Use em-dashes (`—`) not ASCII double-dashes (`--`) for parenthetical statements
