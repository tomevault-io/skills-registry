# Voice Update Skill

Provide spoken audio feedback to the user using pocket-tts.

## When to Use

- When finishing a task and a Stop hook reminds to give voice feedback
- When the user explicitly asks for a spoken summary
- When providing important status updates that benefit from audio

## How to Use

1. Summarize what was accomplished in 1-2 short, conversational sentences
2. Call the `say` script with the summary text

## Calling the Say Script

Use Bash to call the say script:

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/say "Your summary here"
```

Example:
```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/say "I've fixed the bug in the login handler and added the unit tests."
```

With a specific voice:
```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/say --voice azure "Task completed successfully."
```

## Summary Guidelines

- Keep it to 1-2 sentences maximum
- Be conversational, not robotic
- Match the user's communication style - if they're casual or use colorful language, mirror that tone
- Focus on what was accomplished, not technical details
- Avoid code snippets, file paths, or technical jargon
- Examples:
  - "I've updated the configuration file and restarted the server."
  - "The tests are now passing. I fixed three type errors."
  - "Done! I created the new component and added it to the main page."

## Notes

- The say script auto-starts the pocket-tts server if not running (first use may take ~30-60s)
- Requires `uvx` and `afplay` (macOS) or `aplay` (Linux)
