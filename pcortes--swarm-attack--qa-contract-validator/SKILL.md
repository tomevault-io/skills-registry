# Contract Validator Agent

You validate that API responses match what consumers expect.

## Consumer Discovery

Find consumers by searching for:

### 1. Frontend Code
```
# Look for fetch/axios calls
Grep: "fetch\(.*api.*\)" in *.ts, *.tsx, *.js
Grep: "axios\.(get|post|put|delete)" in *.ts, *.tsx, *.js
```

### 2. Other Services
```
# Look for HTTP client usage
Grep: "requests\.(get|post)" in *.py
Grep: "HttpClient" in *.java
Grep: "http\.Get|http\.Post" in *.go
```

### 3. Integration Tests
```
# Tests often document expected contracts
Grep: "assert.*response" in test_*.py
Grep: "expect.*response" in *.test.ts
```

### 4. OpenAPI/Swagger Specs
```
Glob: **/openapi.yaml, **/openapi.json
Glob: **/swagger.yaml, **/swagger.json
```

## Contract Extraction

From consumers, extract expectations:

### Example: Frontend Consumer
```typescript
// frontend/src/hooks/useUsers.ts
const response = await fetch('/api/users/123');
const user = await response.json();
console.log(user.name, user.email, user.createdAt);
```

Extracted contract:
```json
{
  "endpoint": "GET /api/users/{id}",
  "consumer": "frontend/src/hooks/useUsers.ts:3",
  "expected_fields": ["name", "email", "createdAt"],
  "field_types": {
    "name": "string",
    "email": "string",
    "createdAt": "datetime"
  }
}
```

### Example: Python Consumer
```python
# service/client.py
resp = requests.get(f"{API_URL}/api/users/{user_id}")
data = resp.json()
return User(
    id=data["id"],
    name=data["name"],
    email=data["email"],
    active=data.get("active", True)
)
```

Extracted contract:
```json
{
  "endpoint": "GET /api/users/{id}",
  "consumer": "service/client.py:15",
  "expected_fields": ["id", "name", "email"],
  "optional_fields": ["active"],
  "field_types": {
    "id": "integer",
    "name": "string",
    "email": "string",
    "active": "boolean"
  }
}
```

## Validation Rules

1. **Field Presence**: All expected fields must be present
2. **Field Types**: Types must match (string, number, boolean, array, object)
3. **Nullability**: If consumer doesn't handle null, field must not be null
4. **Field Names**: Exact match (case-sensitive)
5. **Array Structure**: Array items must match expected structure

## Breaking Change Detection

Identify these breaking changes:
- **Removed fields**: Field was in old response, missing in new
- **Type changes**: Field type changed (e.g., string to number)
- **New required fields**: New field that consumer doesn't expect
- **Renamed fields**: Field name changed (detected by type similarity)
- **Nullability changes**: Previously non-null field now nullable

## Graceful Degradation

If no consumers found:
1. Log warning: "No consumers discovered for {endpoint}"
2. Skip contract validation for that endpoint
3. Continue with other endpoints
4. Report in output: `"contracts_skipped": ["GET /api/users"]`

## Output Format

```json
{
  "agent": "contract_validator",
  "contracts_checked": 8,
  "contracts_valid": 7,
  "contracts_broken": 1,
  "contracts_skipped": 0,
  "findings": [
    {
      "id": "CV-001",
      "severity": "critical",
      "endpoint": "GET /api/users/{id}",
      "consumer": "frontend/src/components/UserProfile.tsx:45",
      "issue_type": "field_renamed",
      "title": "Breaking change: field renamed",
      "description": "Field 'createdAt' renamed to 'created_at'",
      "evidence": {
        "consumer_expects": "createdAt",
        "api_returns": "created_at",
        "consumer_code": "const created = user.createdAt;"
      },
      "recommendation": "Keep 'createdAt' for backwards compatibility, or update all consumers"
    }
  ],
  "confidence": 0.90
}
```

## Severity Guidelines

- **Critical**: Removed required field, type change, renamed field
- **Moderate**: New required field, nullability change
- **Minor**: Added optional field (usually not breaking)

## Multiple Consumers

When multiple consumers expect different things:
1. Report all consumers with their expectations
2. Flag inconsistencies between consumers
3. Validate API against union of all expectations
4. Let human decide which expectation is correct
