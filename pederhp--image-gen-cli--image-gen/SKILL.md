# Image Generation Skill

Generate images from text prompts or edit existing images using Gemini, OpenAI, BFL (FLUX), or Poe image models.

For detailed model information, see [MODELS.md](references/MODELS.md) or run `image-gen --list-models -p <provider>`.

## When to Use This Skill

- Creating images from text descriptions
- Editing or modifying existing images with text instructions
- Generating multiple variations of an image concept
- Creating images with specific aspect ratios

## Workflows

Modern image models (Gemini and GPT-Image-1.5) are highly capable at instruction following. They can render readable text, create diagrams, produce technical illustrations, and handle complex multi-element compositions. The quality of output depends heavily on prompt articulation and iterative refinement.

### Articulating the Desired Output

Before generating, clearly define the intent:

**Well-defined outputs** (diagrams, UI mockups, illustrations with specific requirements):
- Be explicit about every element: layout, colors, text content, style
- Specify what should NOT appear if relevant
- Example: "A flowchart showing user authentication flow. Three boxes labeled 'Login Form', 'Validate Credentials', 'Dashboard'. Arrows connecting left to right. Clean minimal style, black lines on white background, sans-serif font."

**Creative exploration** (concept art, aesthetic exploration, inspiration):
- Provide mood, style references, and general direction
- Leave room for interpretation
- Example: "Concept art for a solarpunk city. Organic architecture integrated with nature. Morning light. Studio Ghibli inspired, painterly style."

**Balanced approach** (most common):
- Specify the critical elements precisely
- Allow flexibility on secondary details
- Example: "Product photo of a ceramic coffee mug, matte black finish, on a wooden table. Natural lighting, shallow depth of field. The mug should be the clear focus."

### Generation Budget Strategy

Image generation has an inference cost, either API credits or use of compute resources. Establish a budget strategy based on context:

**Conversational mode** (working with a user):
- Ask the user about their budget tolerance before starting
- Start with 1-2 generations to validate direction
- Show results and gather feedback before generating more
- Offer choices: "Should I generate 4 variations to explore, or refine this single direction?"

**Autonomous mode** (agentic task execution):
- Infer budget from task context and constraints
- For well-defined outputs: start with 1 generation, evaluate, iterate if needed
- For creative exploration: generate 2-4 variations upfront to compare
- Set a reasonable maximum (e.g., 6-10 total generations) unless context suggests otherwise
- Document your generation decisions for transparency

**Budget guidelines by task type:**
| Task Type | Initial | Max Iterations | Notes |
|-----------|---------|----------------|-------|
| Precise diagram/text | 1 | 3-4 | Refine prompt if text/layout wrong |
| Product/marketing image | 2-3 | 5-6 | Variations help find best composition |
| Creative concept art | 3-4 | 8-10 | Exploration is the point |
| Quick illustration | 1 | 2 | Speed over perfection |

### Iterative Refinement

After each generation, evaluate the output and decide the next step:

**Option 1: Accept** — Output meets requirements. Done.

**Option 2: Regenerate with refined prompt** — When the concept or composition needs adjustment:
- Analyze what's wrong: style, composition, missing elements, wrong interpretation
- Adjust the prompt to address specific issues
- Add negative guidance if something unwanted keeps appearing
- Example: First attempt has wrong style → add "photorealistic, not illustrated, not cartoon"

**Option 3: Edit with reference image (-i)** — When the base is good but needs modification:
- Use when composition/layout is correct but details need changes
- Use for removing/adding specific elements
- Use for style adjustments while preserving structure
- Example: `image-gen -i first-output.png "Same composition but change the sky to sunset colors"`

**Decision guide:**
```
Is the overall composition/layout acceptable?
├─ No → Regenerate with refined prompt
└─ Yes → Are specific elements wrong?
         ├─ Yes → Edit with -i flag
         └─ No → Accept or minor prompt refinement
```

### Using Reference Images

The `-i` flag serves multiple purposes beyond editing:

**Style transfer:**
```bash
image-gen -i style-reference.jpg "A portrait of a woman in this artistic style"
```

**Character/subject consistency:**
```bash
# First, generate a character
image-gen "A robot mascot, friendly rounded design, blue and white" -o ./character

# Then use it as reference for new scenes
image-gen -i ./character/gemini-*.png "The same robot mascot waving hello, standing in a garden"
```

**Composition guidance:**
```bash
image-gen -i layout-sketch.png "A detailed illustration following this layout. Fantasy landscape with castle on the left, forest on the right"
```

**Multi-reference combination:**
```bash
image-gen -i style.jpg -i subject.jpg "Combine the artistic style of the first image with the subject matter of the second"
```

### Workflow Example: Logo Design

```
1. Understand requirements (conversational) or extract from context (autonomous)
   - Brand name, industry, style preferences, colors

2. Initial exploration (budget: 3-4 images)
   image-gen -n 4 "Minimalist logo for 'Horizon Analytics', data/analytics company.
   Abstract geometric mark. Professional, modern. Blue and gray palette."

3. Evaluate outputs
   - Which direction resonates? Which elements work?

4. Refine best direction (budget: 2-3 more)
   image-gen -n 2 "Minimalist logo for 'Horizon Analytics'. Abstract rising line
   forming a subtle 'H' shape. Single weight lines. Navy blue on white.
   No gradients, no text, mark only."

5. Polish with editing if needed
   image-gen -i best-logo.png "Same logo but adjust proportions to be more
   horizontally balanced. Maintain exact style."

6. Final variations (optional)
   image-gen -i final-logo.png "Create a reversed version, white mark on navy background"
```

### Tips for Better Results

- **Be specific about style**: "watercolor", "3D render", "flat vector", "photograph" yield very different results
- **Specify viewpoint**: "top-down view", "isometric", "eye-level", "close-up"
- **Include context for text**: These models can render text well—specify font style, size relationship, placement
- **Use negative guidance**: "no text", "no watermark", "not photorealistic" when needed
- **Aspect ratio matters**: Choose based on content (portraits → 2:3 or 9:16, landscapes → 16:9, social → 1:1)

## Examples

### Basic Generation

```bash
# Generate a simple image with Gemini (default)
image-gen "A sunset over mountains with a lake reflection"

# Generate with OpenAI
image-gen -p openai "A futuristic city skyline at night"

# Generate with BFL FLUX
image-gen -p bfl "A cyberpunk street scene with neon signs"

# Generate with Poe (access to many models)
image-gen -p poe "A watercolor landscape"
image-gen -p poe -m Imagen-4 "A photorealistic portrait"
image-gen -p poe -m Seedream-4.0 "A poster with bold typography saying 'HELLO WORLD'"
```

### Aspect Ratios

```bash
# Portrait image (good for mobile wallpapers)
image-gen -a 9:16 "Abstract geometric patterns in blue and gold"

# Landscape image (good for desktop wallpapers)
image-gen -a 16:9 "Rolling hills with wildflowers"

# Square image (good for social media)
image-gen -a 1:1 "Minimalist logo design, coffee cup"
```

### Multiple Images

```bash
# Generate 4 variations
image-gen -n 4 "Watercolor painting of a cat"

# Generate to specific directory
image-gen -n 3 -o ./generated-images "Product photo of a ceramic mug"
```

### Image Editing

```bash
# Edit an existing image
image-gen -i photo.jpg "Remove the background and replace with a beach scene"

# Use multiple reference images
image-gen -i style.png -i content.jpg "Apply the style from the first image to the second"
```

### High Quality (Gemini Pro)

```bash
# Use Pro model with higher resolution
image-gen -m gemini-3-pro-image-preview -r 2K "Detailed architectural blueprint"
```

## Output

Generated images are saved to the output directory with filenames:
- `{provider}-{timestamp}.{ext}` for single images
- `{provider}-{timestamp}-{n}.{ext}` for multiple images

The command prints the full path of each saved image to stdout.

## Error Handling

Exit code `0` indicates success. Non-zero exit codes indicate errors:
- Invalid parameters (unsupported options for provider)
- Missing API key
- API errors (rate limits, content policy, etc.)
- Network errors

Error messages are written to stderr with descriptive text.
