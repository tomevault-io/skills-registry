# Writing Plans

## Overview

Write comprehensive implementation plans assuming the engineer has zero context for our codebase and questionable taste. Document everything they need to know: which files to touch for each task, code, testing, docs they might need to check, how to test it. Give them the whole plan as bite-sized tasks. DRY. YAGNI. TDD. Frequent commits.

Assume they are a skilled developer, but know almost nothing about our toolset or problem domain. Assume they don't know good test design very well.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the writing-plans skill to create the implementation plan."

**Context:** This should be run in a dedicated worktree (created by brainstorming skill).

**Save plans to:** `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>.md`

## Bite-Sized Task Granularity

**Each step is one action (2-5 minutes):**
- "Write the failing test" - step
- "Run it to make sure it fails" - step
- "Implement the minimal code to make the test pass" - step
- "Run the tests and make sure they pass" - step
- "Commit" - step

## Plan Document Header

**Every plan MUST start with this header:**

```markdown
# [Feature Name] Implementation Plan

> **For Claude:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development to implement this plan task-by-task.

**Goal:** [One sentence describing what this builds]

**Architecture:** [2-3 sentences about approach]

**Tech Stack:** [Key technologies/libraries]

---
```

## High-Level Spec (when derived from plan mode)

If this implementation plan was created after a plan mode session (i.e. the user approved a plan via `ExitPlanMode`), include the approved plan as a high-level spec section immediately after the header. This gives the implementer the original requirements and design intent alongside the bite-sized tasks.

```markdown
## High-Level Spec

> Copied from [original plan](path/to/plan-file.md) for reference.

[Paste the full contents of the approved plan here verbatim]

---
```

This section is **only** added when a plan mode plan exists. If the writing-plans skill was invoked directly (e.g. from brainstorming) without a preceding plan mode session, skip this section.

## Task Structure

````markdown
### Task N: [Component Name]

**Files:**
- Create: `exact/path/to/file.py`
- Modify: `exact/path/to/existing.py:123-145`
- Test: `tests/exact/path/to/test.py`

**Step 1: Write the failing test**

```python
def test_specific_behavior():
    result = function(input)
    assert result == expected
```

**Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

Run: `pytest tests/path/test.py::test_name -v`
Expected: FAIL with "function not defined"

**Step 3: Write minimal implementation**

```python
def function(input):
    return expected
```

**Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**

Run: `pytest tests/path/test.py::test_name -v`
Expected: PASS

**Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add tests/path/test.py src/path/file.py
git commit -m "feat: add specific feature"
```
````

## External API Integration

**Mocks are a liability when not validated against reality.** When a plan involves consuming external APIs:

1. **Verify API response shapes with real data FIRST** — before writing specs, design docs, or mocks. Run the actual API call and capture the real response. Include the real response in the plan.
2. **Never assume API field names** — check the official API docs AND make a real call. APIs often differ from documentation or from what seems "obvious."

If a task consumes an external API, the plan must include the verified real response shape in the task description so the implementer works from ground truth, not assumptions.

## Remember
- Exact file paths always
- Complete code in plan (not "add validation")
- Exact commands with expected output
- Reference relevant skills with @ syntax
- DRY, YAGNI, TDD, frequent commits

## Execution Handoff

After saving the plan:

**"Plan complete and saved to `docs/plans/<filename>.md`. Ready to execute with subagent-driven development - I'll dispatch a fresh subagent per task, review between tasks, fast iteration."**

- **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development
- Stay in this session
- Fresh subagent per task + code review
