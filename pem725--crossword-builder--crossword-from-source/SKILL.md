# Crossword Puzzle Generator

Generate crossword puzzles from source material for educational use.

## Process

### 1. Gather Source Material

Ask which files to analyze if not specified. Accept text, markdown, PDF, or code files.

### 2. Extract Key Terms

Identify 15-25 meaningful terms:

**Include:** Technical terminology, proper nouns, domain vocabulary, words appearing multiple times
**Exclude:** Common words, words <4 or >15 letters, obscure jargon

### 3. Generate Clues

Create clues at college level with moderate verbal fluency. See [references/clue-guidelines.md](references/clue-guidelines.md) for detailed calibration.

**Distribution:** 60% straightforward, 30% moderate, 10% challenging

**Clue types:**
- Definitional: "Process of cell division producing gametes" → MEIOSIS
- Contextual: "In the reading, this structure stores genetic information" → NUCLEUS
- Fill-in-blank: "The ___ principle states position and momentum cannot both be precisely known" → UNCERTAINTY

### 4. Generate Grid

Create a valid crossword grid:
- Size 15x15 for 15-20 words, scale as needed
- Use rotational symmetry (180-degree)
- All words must intersect; no isolated sections
- Minimum 4-letter words

Use `src/crossword/grid_generator.py` if available, or generate algorithmically.

### 5. Output

Provide puzzle in this structure:

```
## [PUZZLE TITLE]

### Grid (Student Version)
[ASCII grid with numbers, empty squares]

### Clues
**ACROSS**
1. [Clue] (N letters)

**DOWN**
1. [Clue] (N letters)

---
### Answer Key
[Filled grid]
```

See [references/output-formats.md](references/output-formats.md) for ASCII rendering and JSON export format.

### 6. Render Output Files

After generating the grid and clues, render the puzzle to publishable formats:

```python
from src.crossword import render_all

files = render_all(puzzle, "output/", basename="week03_vocab",
                   title="Week 3: Motivation", subtitle="PSYC 405")
# files → {"png": "...", "png_key": "...", "pdf": "...", "html": "..."}
```

- **PNG** — printable grid image (student + answer key)
- **PDF** — full worksheet with header, grid, two-column clues, and answer key page
- **HTML** — self-contained interactive puzzle (no CDN, works offline, hostable anywhere)

## Options

- **Difficulty level**: Adjust clue subtlety (easy/medium/hard)
- **Word count**: Target specific number of terms
- **Theme**: Focus on specific topics from source
- **JSON export**: Provide structured data for web rendering
- **Output format**: Choose `html`, `pdf`, `png`, or `all` (default: `all`)
