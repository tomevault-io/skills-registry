# Continuous Learning

Strategies for Claude Code to build and maintain project knowledge across sessions.

## Knowledge Sources

### 1. CLAUDE.md as Living Memory

CLAUDE.md is the primary mechanism for persisting knowledge between sessions.
Update it when you discover project-specific patterns.

```markdown
## Discovered Patterns

### Error Handling
- This project uses Result<T, AppError> everywhere — never throw
- All API errors return { error: string, code: string } format

### Testing
- Integration tests require Docker: `docker compose up -d` first
- Test DB resets between suites via `beforeAll` in conftest

### Gotchas
- The `user.status` field is a string enum, not a boolean
- Migrations must be generated with `--name` flag or CI rejects them
```

### 2. Convention Discovery

Before writing code, scan the codebase for patterns:

```
Step 1: Check imports     → How does this project import modules?
Step 2: Check error style → Custom errors? Result types? Try/catch?
Step 3: Check naming      → camelCase? snake_case? What prefixes?
Step 4: Check test style  → describe/it? test()? What assertions?
Step 5: Check structure    → Feature folders? Layer folders? Flat?
```

**Match what exists.** Don't introduce a new pattern unless asked.

### 3. Git History as Context

Recent commits reveal current development focus:

```bash
# What changed recently?
git log --oneline -20

# Who changed this file and why?
git log --oneline -5 -- path/to/file.ts

# What does the team's commit style look like?
git log --format="%s" -10
```

## Error Pattern Recognition

### Build Recurring Error Log

When the same error appears multiple times, document the fix:

```markdown
## Common Errors

### "Module not found: @/components/..."
**Cause**: Path alias not configured in tsconfig
**Fix**: Add `"@/*": ["./src/*"]` to tsconfig paths

### "ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:5432"
**Cause**: PostgreSQL not running
**Fix**: `docker compose up -d postgres`
```

### Resolution Strategy

```
1. Search CLAUDE.md for known error     → Apply documented fix
2. Search git log for similar errors    → Check how it was fixed before
3. Search codebase for error message    → Find error origin
4. Search dependencies for breaking     → Check changelogs
5. Minimal reproduction                 → Isolate the problem
```

## Feedback Incorporation

### When the User Corrects You

If the user says "we don't do it that way" or corrects your approach:

1. **Understand** — Ask why if the reason isn't clear
2. **Apply** — Fix the current code immediately
3. **Record** — Add the convention to CLAUDE.md for future sessions
4. **Verify** — Confirm the updated approach matches expectations

### When Tests Reveal Patterns

```
Test failure → Read full output → Identify pattern → Document in CLAUDE.md
```

Examples of test-revealed patterns:
- "Tests expect ISO 8601 dates, not Unix timestamps"
- "API tests need auth header: `Authorization: Bearer test-token`"
- "Snapshot tests must be updated with `--update` flag"

## Session Handoff

### Start of Session Checklist

```
1. Read CLAUDE.md                    → Understand project context
2. Read recent git log               → Understand current work
3. Check for open issues/PRs         → Understand priorities
4. Check CI status                   → Know if builds are passing
```

### End of Session Updates

Before the session ends, consider updating CLAUDE.md with:

- New gotchas discovered during this session
- Patterns that were unclear and are now understood
- Commands that were useful (build, test, deploy)
- Environment setup steps that were non-obvious

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Better Approach |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Guessing project conventions | Scan 3-5 existing files first |
| Ignoring test failures | Read full output, fix root cause |
| Repeating the same mistake | Document fix in CLAUDE.md |
| Overloading CLAUDE.md | Keep under 2000 tokens, be concise |
| Assuming stack/tools | Check package.json, Cargo.toml, etc. |

## Checklist

- [ ] CLAUDE.md reviewed at session start
- [ ] Codebase conventions discovered before writing code
- [ ] Errors documented with cause and fix
- [ ] User corrections recorded in CLAUDE.md
- [ ] Session discoveries summarized before handoff
