# Workflow Creation Skill

## JSON Structure

```json
{
  "name": "Workflow Name",
  "description": "What it does",
  "variables": {
    "device": "",
    "param": "default_value"
  },
  "steps": [
    {
      "name": "step_id",
      "tool": "tool_name",
      "args": {
        "param": "{{variable}}"
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "analysis",
      "goal": "Instruction for LLM to interpret"
    },
    {
      "name": "use_skill",
      "skill": "skill_name",
      "goal": "Goal that uses the loaded skill content"
    },
    {
      "name": "delegate",
      "agent": "agent_name",
      "goal": "Goal to delegate to another agent"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Rules

1. **Every tool step MUST have `"args": {}`** - even if empty. No exceptions.
2. **Every step needs `"name"`** - use snake_case identifiers.
3. **4 step types**: `tool`+`args`, `goal` only, `skill`+`goal`, `agent`+`goal`.
4. **`tool` cannot combine** with `skill` or `agent`; `skill` and `agent` are mutually exclusive.
5. **`skill` and `agent` require `goal`**.
6. **Use `{{variable}}` for interpolation** in args and goals.
7. **Step outputs** are auto-stored as `{{step_name_output}}`.

**IMPORTANT (workflow context only):** When building workflow JSON and user says "use skill X" or "with skill X", use a **skill step** (`"skill": "X", "goal": "..."`). Do NOT manually replicate the skill's commands via tool/exec steps. The skill step automatically loads the skill content and combines it with the goal.

Do not interpret normal chat requests like "panggil agent", "switch agent", or "use agent" as an instruction to create/save a workflow unless the user explicitly asks for a workflow.

## Available Tools

| Tool | Required Args | Description |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| `adb_devices` | *(none)* | List connected devices |
| `adb_shell` | `command`, `device`(opt) | Run shell on device |
| `adb_tap` | `x`, `y`, `device`(opt) | Tap coordinates (numbers) |
| `adb_input_text` | `text`, `device`(opt) | Type text |
| `adb_screenshot` | `filename`, `device`(opt) | Capture screen |
| `adb_ui_dump` | `device`(opt) | Get UI XML hierarchy |

| `exec` | `command` | Run shell command |
| `read_file` | `path` | Read file |
| `write_file` | `path`, `content` | Write file |
| `web_search` | `query` | Search web |

## Workflow Tools (Agent)

- **`workflow_save`**: Save workflow JSON → `workflow_save(workflow_name, workflow_content)`
- **`workflow_execute`**: Run workflow → `workflow_execute(workflow_name, variables?)`
- **`workflow_list`**: List all workflows → `workflow_list()`

## Workflow CLI (Standalone)

Workflows can be executed directly from the terminal without the agent. This enables cron jobs, shell scripts, CI/CD, and headless automation.

```bash
# List workflows
pepebot workflow list

# Show workflow details (steps, variables, types)
pepebot workflow show <name>

# Run workflow from workspace
pepebot workflow run <name>

# Run with variable overrides (repeatable)
pepebot workflow run <name> --var device=emulator-5554 --var query=hello

# Run directly from any JSON file (bypass workspace)
pepebot workflow run -f /path/to/workflow.json
pepebot workflow run -f /path/to/workflow.json --var key=value

# Validate workflow structure
pepebot workflow validate <name>
pepebot workflow validate -f /path/to/workflow.json

# Delete a workflow
pepebot workflow delete <name>
```

### Key: `-f` flag
The `-f` (or `--file`) flag runs a workflow from any file path, bypassing workspace lookup. This is useful for:
- Testing new workflows before saving to workspace
- Running workflows from external repos or shared directories
- CI/CD pipelines that store workflows alongside code
- One-off automation scripts

### Standalone vs Agent Execution
| Feature | CLI (`pepebot workflow run`) | Agent (`workflow_execute`) |
|---------|----------------------------|--------------------------|
| Tool steps | Executed directly | Executed directly |
| Goal steps | Logged but not interpreted | LLM interprets and acts |
| Skill steps | Content loaded, stored as variable | Content loaded + LLM processes |
| Agent steps | Not available (no gateway) | Delegates to other agents |
| Variable overrides | `--var key=value` | `variables` parameter |
| Use case | Cron, scripts, CI/CD, headless | Chat, interactive, LLM-driven |

**Tip:** For tool-only workflows, CLI execution is faster and doesn't need an LLM. Design workflows with pure tool steps for standalone automation, and add goal/agent steps only when LLM reasoning is needed.

## Patterns

### Device Health Check
```json
{
  "name": "Device Health",
  "description": "Check battery, memory, storage",
  "variables": {"device": ""},
  "steps": [
    {"name": "battery", "tool": "adb_shell", "args": {"command": "dumpsys battery", "device": "{{device}}"}},
    {"name": "memory", "tool": "adb_shell", "args": {"command": "free -h", "device": "{{device}}"}},
    {"name": "storage", "tool": "adb_shell", "args": {"command": "df -h", "device": "{{device}}"}},
    {"name": "report", "goal": "Analyze battery, memory, storage data and generate health report"}
  ]
}
```

### App Launch & Screenshot
```json
{
  "name": "App Launcher",
  "description": "Launch app and capture screen",
  "variables": {"device": "", "package": "com.android.settings"},
  "steps": [
    {"name": "launch", "tool": "adb_shell", "args": {"command": "am start -n {{package}}/.Settings", "device": "{{device}}"}},
    {"name": "wait", "tool": "adb_shell", "args": {"command": "sleep 3", "device": "{{device}}"}},
    {"name": "capture", "tool": "adb_screenshot", "args": {"filename": "app_screen.png", "device": "{{device}}"}}
  ]
}
```

### Nested Workflow (Workflow Calling Workflow)
```json
{
  "name": "Full Test Suite",
  "description": "Run login, tests, and logout workflows in sequence",
  "variables": {"device": ""},
  "steps": [
    {"name": "login", "tool": "workflow_execute", "args": {"workflow_name": "login_flow"}},
    {"name": "test", "tool": "workflow_execute", "args": {"workflow_name": "feature_tests"}},
    {"name": "logout", "tool": "workflow_execute", "args": {"workflow_name": "logout_flow"}}
  ]
}
```

### Agent Delegation
```json
{
  "name": "Multi-Agent Task",
  "description": "Delegate research to another agent",
  "variables": {"topic": "AI trends"},
  "steps": [
    {"name": "research", "agent": "researcher", "goal": "Research {{topic}} and provide a summary"},
    {"name": "save", "tool": "write_file", "args": {"path": "research.txt", "content": "{{research_output}}"}}
  ]
}
```

## Standalone Automation Recipes

### Cron: Scheduled Device Health Check
```bash
# Run every hour — pure tool steps, no LLM needed
0 * * * * pepebot workflow run device_health --var device=emulator-5554

# Run daily report, save output to file
0 8 * * * pepebot workflow run daily_report --var device=abc123 > /var/log/pepebot/daily_$(date +\%F).log 2>&1
```

### Shell Script: Multi-Device Batch
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Run a workflow across multiple devices
for device in emulator-5554 emulator-5556 abc123; do
  echo "=== Running on $device ==="
  pepebot workflow run device_health --var device="$device"
done
```

### Shell Script: Test Before Deploy
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Validate and run before deploying
pepebot workflow validate smoke_test || exit 1
pepebot workflow run smoke_test --var device="$DEVICE" --var build="$BUILD_NUMBER"
```

### CI/CD: Run Workflow From Repo
```bash
# Run a workflow checked into the repo (not from workspace)
pepebot workflow run -f ./ci/workflows/integration_test.json --var env=staging
```

### Combine CLI + Script Output
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Collect data with workflow, post-process with other tools
pepebot workflow run collect_metrics --var device=emulator-5554 > /tmp/metrics.txt
# Parse and send to monitoring
grep "battery" /tmp/metrics.txt | curl -X POST -d @- https://monitoring.example.com/api/metrics
```

### Systemd Timer (Alternative to Cron)
```ini
# /etc/systemd/system/pepebot-health.timer
[Timer]
OnCalendar=*:0/30
# Every 30 minutes

# /etc/systemd/system/pepebot-health.service
[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/pepebot workflow run device_health --var device=emulator-5554
```

## Variable System

1. **Default variables**: Defined in `"variables"` field
2. **Runtime overrides**: Passed via `workflow_execute` variables parameter or `--var` flag in CLI
3. **Step outputs**: Auto-created as `{{step_name_output}}` or `{{step_name}}` (works for both tool and goal steps)
4. **Goal raw text**: `{{step_name_goal}}` contains the original goal text, NOT the LLM output — use `{{step_name_output}}` to get the LLM-processed result

## Design Tips for Powerful Workflows

- **Tool-only workflows** run standalone without LLM — ideal for cron and scripts
- **Goal/agent steps** require the agent loop — use `pepebot agent -m "run workflow X"` for those
- **Nest workflows** using `workflow_execute` as a tool step to build modular test suites
- **Use `-f` flag** to iterate on workflow JSON files before saving to workspace
- **Validate before deploying** with `pepebot workflow validate` to catch errors early
- **Log output** by redirecting CLI output to files for audit trails
- **Combine `--var` with environment variables** in scripts: `--var device="$DEVICE_SERIAL"`

## Notes

- Coordinate values (x, y, x1, y1, etc.) are auto-converted from strings to numbers
- Tool names and required parameters are validated on save
- `adb_ui_dump` may not work on all devices - use coordinates as fallback
- Workflow files are stored in `~/.pepebot/workspace/workflows/` as JSON
