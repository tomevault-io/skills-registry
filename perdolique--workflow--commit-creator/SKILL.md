# Code Committing

## Format

### Language Requirement

Always write in English only

```text
<type>(<scope>): summary
```

- **Summary**: ≤50 chars, imperative mood, no period
- **Scope**: Module/package name (monorepo: exact package name or `all`)
- **Body** (optional): Bullet list `- {emoji} {text}`. Aim to keep explanatory bullets within about 100 characters when that preserves readability, but allow longer lines for package/version entries, URLs, or other tokens that become awkward when wrapped. One bullet = one logical change. Do not group multiple items on a single line or leave empty lines between bullets unless you intentionally want separate paragraphs.
- **Breaking**: Add `!` after type and `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer
- **Issues**: End the body with a bullet like `- Fixes #123` or `- Fixes PROJ-456`
- **No co-authorship**: Never add `Co-authored-by:`, `Co-Authored-By:`, or any attribution to Copilot, coding agents, AI assistants, or any other automated tools.

### Dependency update details

When the commit includes dependency or package version updates, spell out every updated package in the body.

- Use one bullet per updated package
- Include both old and new version for each package
- Use the format `- 📦 package-name: old-version -> new-version`
- Never collapse multiple updates into vague text like `updated dependencies` or `bump packages`
- If several packages changed, list all of them separately

### Message assembly

Git treats every extra `-m` flag as a separate paragraph and inserts a blank line between paragraphs.

- If the commit has only a summary, use a single `-m`
- If the commit has a body, use exactly one additional `-m` for the entire body, with plain newlines between bullet lines
- Never use one `-m` flag per bullet, per package update, or per issue reference
- If multiline quoting becomes awkward, write the whole message with `git commit -F` or `git commit -F-`

Keep the final message layout like this:

```text
<type>(<scope>): summary

- first bullet
- second bullet
- third bullet
```

**Types**: feat ✨, fix 🐛, docs 📚, style 💄, refactor ♻️, perf ⚡, test ✅, build 🔧, ci 👷, chore 🔨, revert ⏪

## Workflow

### Branch check

Before committing, check the current branch:

```bash
git branch --show-current
git remote show origin | grep "HEAD branch"
```

**If the current branch is the default branch** (e.g. `master`, `main`) **and the user has not explicitly indicated they want to commit to it**, ask the user:

- Create a new branch and commit there
- Commit directly to the current (default) branch

Wait for user's answer before proceeding.

**If the user explicitly stated the target branch in their request** (e.g. "commit to master", "commit here"), skip the question and proceed.

### Staging behavior

When both staged and unstaged changes exist in the working directory, and interaction is available:

- Ask the user whether to:
  - Stage all files before committing
  - Commit only the currently staged changes

### Running git commit

After executing `git commit`, **wait for the process to exit on its own** — do not interrupt or kill it. Pre-commit hooks (linters, type checkers, test runners) can run for a long time without producing any output. Killing the process mid-run causes an exit code 130 (SIGINT) and leaves the working tree in a dirty state.

When the commit body spans multiple lines, prefer one of these command shapes:

```bash
git commit -m "chore(deps): update development dependencies" -m "- 📦 eslint: 8.57.0 -> 9.0.0
- 📦 prettier: 2.8.8 -> 3.0.0
- 🔧 Update lint configuration for new versions"
```

```bash
git commit -F- <<'EOF'
chore(deps): update development dependencies

- 📦 eslint: 8.57.0 -> 9.0.0
- 📦 prettier: 2.8.8 -> 3.0.0
- 🔧 Update lint configuration for new versions
EOF
```

Do not generate `git commit -m "summary" -m "bullet 1" -m "bullet 2"` unless you explicitly want blank lines between those body paragraphs.

### Commit error handling

**Exit code 130 (interrupted):**

The commit process was interrupted — this is not a validation failure. Do **not** auto-retry. Report that the commit was interrupted and ask the user whether to:

- Try again
- Cancel

**Any other non-zero exit code (validation failure):**

If the commit fails (e.g., due to pre-commit hooks, linting failures, or other validation errors):

- Report the exact error message and reasons for the failure
- Ask the user whether to:
  - Commit with `--no-verify` flag to bypass hooks
  - Attempt to fix the issues automatically
  - Let the user fix the issues manually

## Examples

**Simple feature:**

```text
feat(button): add loading state

- ✨ Add spinner icon during async operations
- 📦 @ui/icons: v1.0.0 → v1.1.0
- Fixes #42
```

**Breaking change:**

```text
feat(theme)!: redesign color tokens

- ✨ Replace RGB values with HSL format
- 💄 Update all component styles to use new tokens
- 📦 @ui/theme: v2.1.0 → v3.0.0

BREAKING CHANGE: Color token values changed from RGB to HSL format
```
