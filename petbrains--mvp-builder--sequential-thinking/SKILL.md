name: sequential-thinking
description: Structured reasoning framework for complex multi-step analysis using MCP sequential thinking tool. Provides state-based reasoning, branch/revise decision thresholds, quality scoring, and convergence rules for problems requiring 3+ logical steps, debugging unclear root causes, or handling multiple valid approaches. Use when this capability is needed.

# Sequential Thinking Methodology

Framework for using `/mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` tool effectively.

## Quick Assessment

**Skip entirely for:** Simple facts, obvious fixes, single-step answers, routine tasks

**Apply when:**
- Problem requires 3+ logical steps
- Multiple valid approaches exist  
- Debugging with unclear root causes
- Initial confidence <70%
- State transitions or causal chains involved

## Core Framework

### 1. Initial Classification
```
Simple → Skip tool
Medium → 3-4 thoughts  
Complex → up to 7 thoughts
```

Define: initial state → goal state → success criteria

### 2. State-Based Reasoning

For each thought:
1. **Current state**: What's true now?
2. **Preconditions**: What must be true for next action?
3. **Effects**: How does action change state?
4. **Verify**: Valid and closer to goal?
5. **Check**: Success criteria met?

### 3. Thought Structure
```
Thought N: [Hypothesis/Analysis/Action]
- State: [explicit]
- Logic: [deduction|induction|abduction|causal]  
- Confidence: X%
- Next: [what this enables]
```

### 4. Decision Points

**Branch** (`branch_from_thought` + unique `branch_id`):
- Confidence <60% WITH alternative
- Contradiction found
- Equal validity paths (Δ<10%)

**Revise** (`is_revision=true` + `revises_thought`):
- Fundamental error
- Precondition false
- Better approach (>20% gain)

**Extend** (`needs_more_thoughts=true`):
- Approaching limit but incomplete

### 5. Quality Scoring

Start: 0 | Minimum: 5 points

**Positive:** Clear mechanism (+2), Verified assumption (+2), Resolved contradiction (+2), Valid transition (+1)

**Negative:** Circular reasoning (-3), Invalid transition (-3), Unverified assumption (-2), Logical leap (-1)

If <5 after 3 thoughts → reassess approach

### 6. Convergence Rules

- Thoughts 1-2: Explore breadth (20%)
- Thoughts 3-5: Deep dive (60%)  
- Thoughts 6-7: Verify only (20%)

**Terminate when:** 7 thoughts reached | Confidence >90% for 2 consecutive | Cycling detected | Success met

## Code-Specific Additions

Track: Variable states, Pre/postconditions, Resource constraints, Error paths

Verify: Execution traces, Edge cases, Resource cleanup, Thread safety

## Natural Language Integration

Use markers like:
- "Let me work through this systematically..."
- "This leads me to consider..."
- "A potential issue here is..."

Never expose: Internal scores, Framework mechanics, Artificial confidence percentages

## Meta-Rules

- Admit uncertainty rather than guess
- Each thought must advance solution
- No pure repetition
- Don't fake confidence to avoid branching
