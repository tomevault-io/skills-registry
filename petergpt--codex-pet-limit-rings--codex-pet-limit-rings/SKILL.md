# Codex Pet Limit Rings

## Core Rule

Keep the Codex desktop app unpatched by default. Ship and modify the rings as a companion macOS app that reads local Codex state and exposes its own menu-bar icon. Only discuss direct Codex app menu patching as a brittle optional route, because it requires `app.asar` patching, Electron integrity updates, and re-signing after Codex updates.

The rings are pet-agnostic. Do not add pet-specific setup unless a user explicitly asks for a custom visual treatment; by default the overlay follows whatever Codex pet is currently active.

## Locate The Project

If this skill is bundled in the repository, the project root is two directories above this `SKILL.md`. Otherwise find or ask for a checkout containing:

```text
tools/codex-pet-limit-rings.swift
tools/install-limit-rings.sh
tools/run-limit-rings.sh
```

Use that checkout as the working directory. Read `AGENTS.md` first if it exists.

## Common Tasks

Install or enable the rings for a user:

```bash
tools/install-limit-rings.sh
```

Run a development build without installing a login item:

```bash
tools/run-limit-rings.sh
```

Uninstall:

```bash
tools/uninstall-limit-rings.sh
```

Install this skill into local Codex:

```bash
tools/install-codex-skill.sh
```

Verify the live app:

```bash
pgrep -fl CodexPetLimitRings
launchctl print "gui/$(id -u)/com.codex-pet.limit-rings" >/dev/null
```

## Data Contract

The rings read:

- `~/.codex/auth.json` for a local ChatGPT access token, then `https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/wham/usage` for live usage data.
- `~/.codex/.codex-global-state.json` for `electron-avatar-overlay-open` and `electron-avatar-overlay-bounds.mascot`.
- `~/.codex/logs_2.sqlite` for fallback to the newest `codex.rate_limits` event when live usage fails.

The outer ring is the short-window remaining percentage. The inner ring is the weekly remaining percentage. The menu summary should say `Live` when direct usage succeeds and `Cached` when the local log fallback is active.

Pet wakeups and moves are driven by a filesystem watcher on `~/.codex/.codex-global-state.json`, with a slow fallback timer for missed events. Keep that event-driven path intact when changing frame-following behavior.

## Editing Workflow

When changing behavior or visuals:

1. Edit `tools/codex-pet-limit-rings.swift`.
2. Keep packaging scripts in `tools/` and update `docs/limit-rings.md` when the user-facing contract changes.
3. Run:

```bash
bash -n tools/*.sh
swiftc tools/codex-pet-limit-rings.swift -o tmp/codex-pet-limit-rings -framework AppKit -lsqlite3
tmp/codex-pet-limit-rings --preview tmp/limit-rings-preview.png --size 164
```

4. Relaunch with `tools/run-limit-rings.sh` for development or `tools/install-limit-rings.sh` for the packaged login-item flow.

## Open-Source Hygiene

Keep the app privacy-preserving, source-buildable, and uninstallable. Do not commit local `tmp/` builds, logs, derived pet spritesheets, or user-specific Codex data. Preserve the MIT license and document any new local files or permissions in `docs/limit-rings.md`.
