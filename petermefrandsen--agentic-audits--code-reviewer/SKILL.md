# Code Reviewer

## When to use

Use this skill when your mission involves reviewing, auditing, or analysing
code for quality, security, or performance issues.

## Instructions

### Review process

1. **Scan the target files** — read each file in the context to understand
   its purpose and structure.

2. **Check each category** in order of priority:

   | Priority | Category | What to look for |
   |----------|----------|-----------------|
   | 🔴 Critical | **Security** | Hardcoded secrets, injection vulnerabilities, insecure defaults, missing auth checks |
   | 🔴 Critical | **Data safety** | Unvalidated inputs, missing error handling, data leaks in logs |
   | 🟡 Important | **Performance** | N+1 queries, unnecessary allocations, missing caching, blocking I/O |
   | 🟡 Important | **Best practices** | SOLID violations, dead code, duplicated logic, missing types |
   | 🔵 Minor | **Style** | Naming conventions, formatting, comment quality |

3. **Produce structured findings** using this format for each issue:

   ```markdown
   ### [SEVERITY] Short title

   **File:** `path/to/file.ext` (line X-Y)
   **Category:** Security | Performance | Best Practices | Style
   **Description:** What the issue is and why it matters.
   **Suggestion:**
   ```diff
   - current problematic code
   + suggested fix
   ```
   ```

4. **Summarise** at the end with:
   - Total issues by severity
   - Top 3 most impactful improvements
   - Overall assessment (pass / pass with warnings / needs attention)

### If no issues are found

Report a clean bill of health — do not invent issues.

## Rules

- Be constructive, not nitpicky.
- Prioritise issues that affect correctness and security over style.
- Include line numbers and file paths for every finding.
- Suggest fixes, not just problems.
- Never modify files directly during a review — only report findings.
