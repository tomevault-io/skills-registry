# MCP Server Design & Review

Guide the user through designing new MCP servers or reviewing existing ones against established best practices. All guidance is language-agnostic but applies principles from the official MCP specification (through 2025-06-18), Block Engineering's production playbook (60+ servers), FastMCP creator insights, and community learnings from the broader ecosystem.

## Core Philosophy

> "You are not building a tool. You are building a user interface."
> -- Jeremiah Lowin

Agents are not humans. Three critical differences drive every design decision:

| Dimension | Humans | AI Agents |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| **Discovery** | Cheap (read docs once) | Expensive (enumerates ALL tools, consumes tokens) |
| **Iteration** | Fast (write script, run repeatedly) | Slow (each call sends entire history) |
| **Context** | Rich (memories, experiences) | Limited (~200K tokens is the entire "brain") |

**The key verb: CURATE.** Every design decision filters through token budget consciousness.

## Mode Selection

Determine which mode to operate in based on user intent:

- **Design Mode** -- user wants to build a new MCP server or redesign an existing one
- **Review Mode** -- user wants to audit/improve an existing MCP server

## MCP Primitives: Choose the Right One

MCP defines four server primitives. Choosing the wrong primitive is a fundamental design error.

| Primitive | Purpose | Controlled By | Side Effects? |
|-----------|---------|---------------|---------------|
| **Tools** | Executable actions (API calls, DB writes, computations) | The model decides when to invoke | Yes |
| **Resources** | Read-only data and context (files, schemas, configs, logs) | The client application fetches explicitly | No |
| **Prompts** | Reusable instruction templates (like slash commands) | The user selects explicitly | No |
| **Sampling** | Server requests LLM completions from client | Server initiates via `sampling/complete` | Depends |

**Rule of thumb:**
- Read-only data with no side effects → **Resource** (cheaper, subscribable, cacheable)
- Action with side effects → **Tool**
- Reusable user-facing workflow template → **Prompt**
- Server needs to "think" → **Sampling**

**Anti-pattern: wrong primitive.** Using a tool for read-only data wastes a tool call, requires model decision-making, and muddies your permission model. Use a Resource instead.

**Resource design tips:**
- Use URI templates (RFC 6570) for dynamic content: `file://{path}`, `issue://{id}`
- Keep resources lightweight -- they're fetched into context
- Use subscriptions (`resources/subscribe`) for live data that changes

**Prompt design tips:**
- Clear, actionable names (`summarize-errors`, not `get-summarized-error-log-output`)
- Keep prompts stateless -- same input = same output
- Embed resource references when the prompt needs context

Most servers are tool-heavy, but modeling read-only data as Resources instead of Tools reduces tool count, improves token efficiency, and enables client-side caching.

## Design Mode

Follow these steps sequentially. Each step applies one or more foundational principles from `references/design-principles.md`.

### Step 1: Understand the Domain

Ask the user:
- What service/API is being wrapped?
- What are the 3-5 key workflows users (agents) want to accomplish?
- What data flows in and out?
- What data is read-only vs requires mutation?

Focus on **agent stories**, not API endpoints. Frame questions as "What does the agent need to achieve?" not "What endpoints exist?"

### Step 2: Choose Primitives & Design Tool Inventory

First, classify each piece of functionality using the primitives table above. Then apply **Outcomes Not Operations** principle for tools.

- Classify read-only data as **Resources** (schemas, configs, docs) -- reduces tool count
- Map each action workflow to a single **Tool** that delivers a complete outcome
- Name tools for agent intent (e.g., `track_latest_order` not `get_order`)
- Target 5-15 tools total per server
- Apply "One Server = One Job" -- if scope exceeds one clear purpose, split into multiple servers

**Red flags to catch:**
- CRUD-style atomic operations (get/create/update/delete patterns)
- Tools that require chaining to accomplish a single workflow
- REST-to-MCP 1:1 endpoint mirroring

Consult `references/design-principles.md` for detailed guidance on the Outcomes principle and Block's Linear MCP evolution example.

### Step 3: Shape Tool APIs

Apply **Flatten Arguments** principle.

For each tool:
- All arguments as top-level primitives (string, int, bool)
- Use `Literal`/`Enum` for constrained choices -- LLMs handle these well
- Strong defaults to hide complexity -- most args should be optional
- No nested objects, config dicts, or "mystery meat" arguments
- Avoid tightly coupled arguments (where valid values of B depend on A)

### Step 4: Write Documentation as Context

Apply **Instructions Are Context** principle.

- Rich docstrings: purpose, args with descriptions, return format, examples
- Examples are contracts -- LLMs treat them as strong templates
- Actionable error messages that guide recovery, not cryptic failures
- Tool annotations (`readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`, `idempotentHint`, `openWorldHint`, `title`) for permission systems
- Consider `outputSchema` for structured tool output (spec 2025-06-18)
- Use elicitation (`ctx.elicit()`) for destructive operations requiring user confirmation

### Step 5: Token Budget Check

Apply **Respect Token Budget** principle. Consult `references/llm-alignment.md` for detailed math.

- Estimate total token cost: `200K context / tool_count = tokens per tool`
- Check output sizes -- return summaries + IDs, not raw dumps
- Plan truncation/pagination for large responses
- Consider prompt caching implications (avoid dynamic data in instructions)

Guidelines:
| Tool Count | Status |
|------------|--------|
| 5-15 | Ideal |
| ~50 | Performance degradation begins |
| 100+ | Requires sophisticated routing |

### Step 6: Idempotency & Reliability

Apply **Idempotency & Retry Safety** principle. Agents may retry or parallelize tool calls.

- Make write tools idempotent -- accept optional `idempotency_key` parameter
- Use cursor-based pagination for list operations
- Annotate with `idempotentHint: true` when safe to retry

### Step 7: Security Posture

Consult `references/security-checklist.md` for comprehensive guidance.

Key decisions:
- Auth method: OAuth 2.1 (mandatory for HTTP), token-based, or env vars
- Separate read-only vs write/mutate tools (one tool = one risk level)
- Input validation strategy
- Session security (non-deterministic IDs, user binding)
- Scope minimization (progressive, least-privilege)
- Elicitation for destructive operations (human-in-the-loop confirmation)

### Step 8: Transport & Deployment

Consult `references/transport-deployment.md` for detailed guidance.

Key decisions:
- Transport: stdio (local) vs Streamable HTTP (remote)
- Containerization strategy (Docker for production remote servers)
- Observability: structured logging, usage metrics
- Testing plan: unit, integration, security, client compatibility

### Step 9: Output Design Document

Produce a structured design document using `examples/design-review-template.md` as template. Include:
- Server purpose and scope
- Tool inventory table (name, description, risk level)
- Per-tool API shape (args, types, defaults, return format)
- Security decisions
- Token budget estimate

## Review Mode

Follow these steps to audit an existing MCP server. Use `references/review-rubric.md` for detailed scoring criteria.

### Step 1: Discover Scope

- Read the server's tool definitions (scan for decorators, handler registrations, tool schemas)
- Count total tools, categorize read vs write
- Identify the server's declared purpose
- Map tools to workflows they serve

### Step 2: Apply Review Rubric

Score each dimension 1-5 using criteria from `references/review-rubric.md`:

| Dimension | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Outcome orientation | Each tool = complete workflow? |
| Argument design | Flat primitives with defaults? |
| Documentation quality | Rich docstrings, actionable errors? |
| Token efficiency | Tool count, output sizes controlled? |
| Curation | No redundant tools, focused scope? |
| Security | Auth, read/write separation, validation? |
| LLM alignment | Leverages agent strengths? |
| Reliability | Idempotent writes, pagination, structured output? |
| Operations | Logging, containerization, versioning? |

### Step 3: Generate Findings

For each issue found:
- **Severity**: critical / warning / suggestion
- **Principle violated**: which of the 5 foundational principles
- **Current state**: what the code does now
- **Recommended fix**: specific, actionable change with example

### Step 4: Produce Review Report

Output a structured report:
- Summary scorecard (dimension scores)
- Prioritized issue list (critical first)
- Consolidation opportunities (e.g., "these 5 tools could become 2")
- Positive observations (what's done well)
