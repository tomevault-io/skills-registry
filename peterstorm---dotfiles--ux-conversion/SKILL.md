# UX & Conversion Optimization

Build interfaces that convert. This skill covers UX patterns for desktop/mobile, conversion optimization, and user psychology.

## Core Philosophy

1. **Every element earns its place** - Remove visual noise; minimize cognitive load
2. **Reduce friction ruthlessly** - Every click/field is a potential drop-off
3. **Mobile-first always** - 60%+ traffic is mobile; design smallest viewport first
4. **Data beats assumptions** - A/B test everything; use heatmaps and session recordings
5. **Speed is UX** - 1 second improvement = 7% conversion boost

## Quick Reference

| Topic | Key Principle | Details |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| **Forms** | Minimize fields; inline validation | [form-patterns.md](references/form-patterns.md) |
| **CTAs** | Specific, first-person, high-contrast | [cta-optimization.md](references/cta-optimization.md) |
| **Mobile** | 44px touch targets; thumb-zone primary actions | [mobile-patterns.md](references/mobile-patterns.md) |
| **Signup** | Time-to-value < 60s; progressive disclosure | [signup-flows.md](references/signup-flows.md) |
| **Trust** | Place near CTAs and checkout | [trust-signals.md](references/trust-signals.md) |
| **Copy** | Clarity over cleverness; action verbs | [microcopy.md](references/microcopy.md) |

## High-Impact Quick Wins

1. **Reduce form fields** to essentials only (42% lift from 15→5 fields)
2. **Use inline validation** with helpful error messages (22% success rate increase)
3. **Make CTAs specific** with first-person copy ("Get my report" > "Submit")
4. **Add progress indicators** to multi-step flows
5. **Place trust signals** near CTAs and checkout
6. **44px+ touch targets** on mobile with adequate spacing
7. **Offer guest checkout** prominently (62% of sites fail this)
8. **Get users to value** within 60 seconds of signup
9. **White space around CTAs** can boost conversions 232%
10. **Personalized CTAs** convert 42% better than generic

## Decision Framework

### When designing forms:
- Single column layout (always on mobile)
- Labels above fields (not placeholder-as-label)
- Smart defaults and autofill where possible
- Validate on blur, not on submit
- Mark optional fields, not required
- Group related fields logically

### When designing CTAs:
- High contrast against background
- Action verb + benefit: "Start my free trial"
- Large enough to tap (min 44px height)
- Isolated with generous padding/white space
- Repeat at end of long content

### When designing for mobile:
- Start at 320px, enhance upward
- Primary actions in bottom 1/3 (thumb zone)
- Reduce input: autofill, smart defaults, minimize typing
- Touch targets 44x44px minimum with spacing
- Compress images, lazy-load below fold

### When building signup/onboarding:
- Collect only essential info at signup (name, email, password)
- Use progress indicators ("Step 2 of 3")
- Get user to first "win" ASAP
- Personalize flow based on user type/goal (2-5 options)
- Provide skip option for experienced users
- Celebrate milestones to build momentum

### When adding trust signals:
- Security badges near payment/checkout
- Testimonials with real names, photos, specific results
- Social proof numbers ("10,000+ customers")
- Guarantees near CTAs to reduce hesitation
- Client logos for B2B credibility

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Placeholder text as the only label (accessibility fail)
- Requiring account creation before showing value
- Credit card upfront for free trials
- Desktop-only optimization
- Generic CTAs ("Submit", "Click here")
- Validating only on form submit
- Hiding guest checkout option
- Tutorial overload on first visit
- Jargon and clever-but-unclear copy

## Responsive Breakpoints

```css
/* Mobile-first base styles */
.container { padding: 1rem; }

/* Tablet and up */
@media (min-width: 48em) {
  .container { padding: 2rem; max-width: 75rem; }
}

/* Desktop */
@media (min-width: 64em) {
  .container { /* desktop enhancements */ }
}
```

Break when content breaks, not at arbitrary device widths.

## Metrics That Matter

| Metric | Target | How to Improve |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| Conversion rate | 5-10%+ (avg is 2.35%) | Reduce friction, personalize CTAs |
| Form completion | 80%+ | Fewer fields, inline validation |
| Time to value | < 60 seconds | Streamline onboarding |
| Mobile bounce | < 40% | Speed, touch targets, thumb-zone design |
| Cart abandonment | < 70% | Guest checkout, trust signals, simplify |
