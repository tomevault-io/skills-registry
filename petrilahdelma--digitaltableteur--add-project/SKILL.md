   - Thumbnail configuration (static or video with autoplay)

2. **Project Route**
   - `app/work/[slug]/page.tsx` with metadata, OpenGraph, Twitter cards

3. **Project Page Component**
   - `nextjs-app/shared/components/pages/Work/[ProjectName]/[ProjectName]Page.tsx`
   - `nextjs-app/shared/components/pages/Work/[ProjectName]/[projectName].module.css`
   - `nextjs-app/shared/components/pages/Work/[ProjectName]/index.ts`

4. **Navigation Update**
   - Entry in `app/work/NextWorkNav.tsx` workPages array

5. **Assets Checklist**
   - Required images with dimensions

## File Generation

After gathering all information, generate files in this order:

### 1. Update projects.ts

Add entry to the projects array:

```typescript
{
  id: "[slug]",
  slug: "[slug]",
  title: "[Project Name]",
  description: "[Short description]",
  thumbnail: "/images/portfolio/[slug]/[thumbnail]",
  thumbnailVideo: "[if video]",
  autoPlayVideo: [true/false if video],
  category: "[category]",
  tags: ["Tag1", "Tag2"],
  featured: [true/false],
  order: [next order number],
},
```

### 2. Create Route File

`app/work/[slug]/page.tsx`:

```tsx
import type { Metadata } from "next";

import { [ProjectName]Page } from "@dt-pages/Work/[ProjectName]";
import { NextWorkNav } from "../NextWorkNav";

export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: "[Project Name] Case Study | Digitaltableteur",
  description: "[Description]",
  openGraph: {
    title: "[Project Name] Case Study | Digitaltableteur",
    description: "[Description]",
    type: "article",
    siteName: "Digitaltableteur",
    images: [
      {
        url: "/logo512.png",
        width: 512,
        height: 512,
        alt: "Digitaltableteur Logo",
      },
    ],
  },
  twitter: {
    card: "summary_large_image",
    title: "[Project Name] Case Study | Digitaltableteur",
    description: "[Description]",
    images: ["/logo512.png"],
  },
  alternates: {
    canonical: "/work/[slug]",
  },
};

export const revalidate = 3600;

export default function [ProjectName]() {
  return <[ProjectName]Page nav={<NextWorkNav />} />;
}
```

### 3. Create Page Component

Use the selected template as a base, replacing content placeholders.

### 4. Update NextWorkNav

Add entry to workPages array:

```typescript
{ path: "/work/[slug]", label: "[Project Name]" },
```

### 5. Generate Assets Checklist

Output a markdown checklist of required assets:

```markdown
## Required Assets for [Project Name]

### Thumbnail
- [ ] `/images/portfolio/[slug]/[thumbnail]`
  - Dimensions: 1200x630 (video aspect ratio) or 800x800 (square)
  - Format: WEBP preferred, PNG/JPG acceptable
  - Alt text: "[Project Name] thumbnail"

### Hero Image (if applicable)
- [ ] `/images/portfolio/[slug]/hero.png`
  - Dimensions: 1200x600
  - Alt text: "[Project Name] hero image"

### Gallery Images (if applicable)
- [ ] `/images/portfolio/[slug]/gallery/[image1].webp`
- [ ] `/images/portfolio/[slug]/gallery/[image2].webp`
...

### Team Photos (if applicable)
- [ ] `/images/portfolio/[slug]/team/[name].png`
  - Dimensions: 200x200 (square)
  - Alt text: "[Name], [Role]"
```

## Validation Before Completion

Before finishing, verify:

1. **TypeScript**: Run `npm run typecheck` to verify no type errors
2. **Lint**: Run `npm run lint` to check for issues
3. **Build**: Optionally run `npm run build` to verify page compiles

## Example Usage

User: `/add-project`

Agent: "Let's add a new work project! I'll ask a few questions to set everything up."

Agent: [Uses AskUserQuestion for Q1]

User: "Acme Corp Design System"

Agent: [Uses AskUserQuestion for Q2]

... continues through all questions ...

Agent: "Great! I have all the information. Let me generate the files..."

Agent: [Creates all files]

Agent: "Done! Here's what I created:
- ✅ Added entry to projects.ts
- ✅ Created app/work/acme-corp-design-system/page.tsx
- ✅ Created component files
- ✅ Updated NextWorkNav

**Next steps:**
1. Add your images to `/images/portfolio/acme-corp-design-system/`
2. Update the page content with your actual text
3. Run `npm run dev` to preview"

## Key Principles

- **One question at a time** - Don't overwhelm with multiple questions
- **Provide defaults** - Always suggest sensible defaults
- **Use templates** - Base new projects on existing successful ones
- **Generate complete files** - Don't leave placeholders that break the build
- **Validate** - Run type checks before declaring success
