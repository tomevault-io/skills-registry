# Node.js (Backend) Skill

## Goal
Strict-typed, layered, testable Node services. No `any`, no callback soup,
no magic strings. A junior should be able to trace a request end-to-end.

## Quick reference

| Concept | Best practice |
|---|---|
| TypeScript | Use strict mode, ESM imports (`"type": "module"`), correct path aliases |
| Frameworks | Fastify or NestJS with ChangeDetectionStrategy / proper DI |
| Performance | Do not block the event loop, use worker threads for CPU-heavy tasks |
| Key commands | `npm run dev`, `npm run build`, `npm test`, `npx tsc --noEmit` |
