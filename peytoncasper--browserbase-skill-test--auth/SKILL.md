# Authentication Skill

Guide Claude through interactive authentication flows using the `browse` CLI.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- A website requires login to access content
- You encounter a login page or authentication wall
- The user needs to authenticate to complete a task
- Session cookies have expired

## Prerequisites

Requires the `browse` CLI and Chrome/Chromium:
```bash
browse --version  # Check if installed
bash scripts/setup-browse.sh  # Install if needed
```

Install manually: `pnpm add -g @browserbasehq/browse-cli`

## Authentication Flow

### 1. Detect Login Page

After navigating to a URL, check if authentication is needed:

```bash
browse snapshot
```

Look for indicators:
- Form elements with `type="password"` or `type="email"`
- Text containing "sign in", "log in", "username", "password"
- OAuth buttons (Google, GitHub, Microsoft, etc.)

### 2. Prompt User for Credentials

**Always ask the user for credentials - never assume or store them.**

Example prompt:
```
I've detected a login page. To continue, I'll need your credentials:

1. What is your email/username?
2. What is your password?

Note: Your credentials will only be used to fill the login form and won't be stored.
```

### 3. Fill Login Form

Use the snapshot refs to identify form fields:

```bash
# Get the current page state
browse snapshot

# Fill the email/username field
browse fill @0-5 "user@example.com"

# Fill the password field  
browse fill @0-8 "their-password"

# Click the submit button
browse click @0-12
```

### 4. Handle 2FA/MFA

If a 2FA prompt appears after login:

```bash
browse snapshot
```

Prompt the user:
```
Two-factor authentication is required. Please provide:
- The code from your authenticator app, OR
- The code sent to your phone/email

What is your 2FA code?
```

Then fill and submit:
```bash
browse fill @0-3 "123456"
browse click @0-5
```

### 5. Verify Success

After submitting credentials:

```bash
browse wait networkidle
browse snapshot
```

Check for:
- Redirect away from login page
- User profile/avatar elements
- Dashboard or home page content
- Absence of error messages

If login failed:
```
The login attempt was unsuccessful. I see an error message: "[error text]"

Would you like to:
1. Try again with different credentials
2. Use a different login method (OAuth, SSO)
3. Reset your password
```

## OAuth/SSO Flows

For OAuth buttons (Google, GitHub, etc.):

1. Click the OAuth button
2. A popup or redirect will occur
3. User completes authentication in the OAuth provider
4. Wait for redirect back to the original site

```bash
# Click OAuth button
browse click @0-15

# Wait for OAuth flow to complete
browse wait networkidle

# Verify authentication succeeded
browse snapshot
```

## Common Patterns

### Username + Password Form
```html
<form>
  <input type="email" name="email">
  <input type="password" name="password">
  <button type="submit">Sign In</button>
</form>
```

### Magic Link / Passwordless
```
I see this site uses passwordless authentication (magic link).

1. Enter your email address
2. Check your email for the login link
3. Let me know when you've clicked the link

What email should I use?
```

### CAPTCHA
```
This login page has a CAPTCHA. I cannot solve CAPTCHAs automatically.

Options:
1. Use `browse session live` to open the browser and solve it manually
2. Try a different authentication method
3. Contact the site administrator
```

## Security Reminders

- Never store or log user credentials
- Credentials are only used to fill form fields
- Recommend users use password managers
- Suggest enabling 2FA when available
- Clear sensitive data from conversation context after use

## Troubleshooting

### Login button doesn't work
```bash
# Try waiting for page to be fully loaded
browse wait networkidle

# Check if button is actually clickable
browse snapshot

# Try clicking by coordinates if ref doesn't work
browse click 450,320
```

### Form fields not found
```bash
# Get full snapshot to find correct refs
browse snapshot

# Try using evaluate to find elements
browse eval "document.querySelector('input[type=password]')?.id"
```

### Session expires quickly
- Some sites have short session timeouts
- Consider using `browse session create` with Browserbase for persistent sessions
- Check if "Remember me" checkbox is available
