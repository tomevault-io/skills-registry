# Code Review Checklist

## Overview

This skill provides a systematic approach to code reviews, ensuring consistent quality standards across your codebase. Use it to conduct thorough, constructive code reviews that improve code quality and team knowledge sharing.

## When to Use This Skill

- Reviewing pull requests
- Conducting pair programming sessions
- Establishing code review standards for your team
- Self-reviewing code before submitting
- Mentoring junior developers on code quality
- Complementing the **code-quality agent** for comprehensive reviews

## Core Review Categories

### 1. Functionality & Correctness

**Does the code work as intended?**

- [ ] Code accomplishes the intended purpose
- [ ] Edge cases are handled appropriately
- [ ] Error handling is comprehensive
- [ ] Input validation is present and correct
- [ ] Boundary conditions are tested
- [ ] No obvious bugs or logic errors
- [ ] Code handles null/undefined/empty values safely

**Questions to Ask:**
- What happens if this API call fails?
- Are all user inputs validated?
- What if the array is empty?
- Are there any race conditions?

### 2. Design & Architecture

**Is the code well-designed?**

- [ ] Code follows SOLID principles
- [ ] Appropriate design patterns used
- [ ] Separation of concerns is clear
- [ ] No tight coupling between components
- [ ] Abstractions are at the right level
- [ ] Code is modular and reusable
- [ ] No circular dependencies

**Red Flags:**
- God classes (doing too much)
- Excessive method parameters (>3-4)
- Deep nesting (>3 levels)
- Duplicate code (DRY violation)
- Overly clever code (premature optimization)

### 3. Readability & Maintainability

**Can others understand and maintain this code?**

- [ ] Code is self-documenting
- [ ] Variable/function names are descriptive
- [ ] Functions are single-purpose and focused
- [ ] Code follows project style guide
- [ ] Complex logic has explanatory comments
- [ ] Magic numbers are named constants
- [ ] Code structure is logical and intuitive

**Naming Conventions:**
```javascript
// BAD
function d(a, b) { return a + b; }
const x = 42;

// GOOD
function calculateTotalPrice(basePrice, taxRate) {
  return basePrice * (1 + taxRate);
}
const MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS = 3;
```

### 4. Testing

**Is the code adequately tested?**

- [ ] Unit tests cover new functionality
- [ ] Edge cases are tested
- [ ] Negative test cases included
- [ ] Tests are readable and maintainable
- [ ] Test names describe what they test
- [ ] No flaky tests
- [ ] Integration tests for complex interactions
- [ ] Test coverage meets standards (typically >80%)

**Test Quality Checks:**
- Tests follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Mocks/stubs are used appropriately
- Tests are independent (no shared state)
- Test data is meaningful, not random

### 5. Security

**Is the code secure?**

- [ ] No sensitive data in code or logs
- [ ] SQL injection prevented (parameterized queries)
- [ ] XSS vulnerabilities addressed
- [ ] CSRF protection implemented
- [ ] Authentication/authorization checks present
- [ ] Secrets stored securely (environment variables, vaults)
- [ ] Input sanitization in place
- [ ] Rate limiting for APIs

**OWASP Top 10 Considerations:**
1. Injection flaws
2. Broken authentication
3. Sensitive data exposure
4. XML external entities (XXE)
5. Broken access control
6. Security misconfiguration
7. Cross-site scripting (XSS)
8. Insecure deserialization
9. Using components with known vulnerabilities
10. Insufficient logging & monitoring

### 6. Performance

**Will this code perform well at scale?**

- [ ] No obvious performance bottlenecks
- [ ] Database queries are optimized
- [ ] Indexes are used appropriately
- [ ] No N+1 query problems
- [ ] Appropriate data structures chosen
- [ ] Caching used where beneficial
- [ ] Large datasets handled efficiently
- [ ] Async operations used where appropriate

**Performance Anti-Patterns:**
- Synchronous I/O in loops
- Missing database indexes
- Loading entire datasets into memory
- Unnecessary object creation
- Inefficient algorithms (O(n²) where O(n) possible)

### 7. Documentation

**Is the code adequately documented?**

- [ ] Complex algorithms explained
- [ ] Public APIs documented
- [ ] README updated if needed
- [ ] CHANGELOG updated
- [ ] Migration guide provided (if breaking changes)
- [ ] Code comments explain "why", not "what"
- [ ] Docstrings/JSDoc for functions
- [ ] Architecture decisions recorded (ADRs)

**Good Comment Example:**
```python
# GOOD: Explains WHY
# Use exponential backoff to avoid overwhelming the API
# after transient failures (recommended by vendor)
retry_delay = base_delay * (2 ** attempt)

# BAD: Explains WHAT (obvious from code)
# Set retry_delay to base_delay times 2 to the power of attempt
retry_delay = base_delay * (2 ** attempt)
```

### 8. Dependencies & Libraries

**Are dependencies managed properly?**

- [ ] Dependencies are up-to-date
- [ ] No known security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Dependency versions are pinned
- [ ] License compatibility checked
- [ ] Dependencies are actually needed
- [ ] Bundle size impact considered
- [ ] Dependency documentation reviewed

### 9. Error Handling & Logging

**Are errors handled gracefully?**

- [ ] Errors are caught and handled appropriately
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly
- [ ] Errors are logged with context
- [ ] No swallowed exceptions
- [ ] Proper logging levels used (DEBUG/INFO/WARN/ERROR)
- [ ] PII not logged
- [ ] Stack traces available for debugging

**Logging Best Practices:**
```javascript
// GOOD: Structured logging with context
logger.error('Payment processing failed', {
  orderId: order.id,
  userId: user.id,
  amount: payment.amount,
  errorCode: error.code
});

// BAD: Generic error logging
console.log('Error');
```

### 10. Code Style & Consistency

**Does the code follow team standards?**

- [ ] Linter passes
- [ ] Formatter applied
- [ ] Naming conventions followed
- [ ] File organization consistent
- [ ] Import statements organized
- [ ] No commented-out code
- [ ] No debug statements (console.log, etc.)

## Review Process Guidelines

### Before You Review

1. **Understand the context**
   - Read the PR description
   - Review linked issues/tickets
   - Understand the "why" behind the change

2. **Set aside time**
   - Don't rush reviews
   - Block dedicated time for thorough analysis
   - Review in multiple sessions if large PR

3. **Check CI/CD**
   - Ensure tests pass
   - Check build succeeds
   - Review test coverage reports

### During Review

1. **Be constructive**
   - Praise good code
   - Suggest, don't demand
   - Explain your reasoning
   - Offer alternatives

2. **Use review labels**
   - **Nitpick**: Minor suggestion, not blocking
   - **Question**: Seeking clarification
   - **Suggestion**: Proposed improvement
   - **Issue**: Needs to be addressed before merge

3. **Focus on what matters**
   - Prioritize functionality and security
   - Don't bike-shed over style (use linters)
   - Consider technical debt trade-offs

### Giving Feedback

**Good Feedback Examples:**

```
✅ "Great use of the factory pattern here! This makes the code much
more testable. Consider extracting the validation logic into a
separate validator class for even better separation of concerns."

✅ "Question: What happens if the API returns a 429 (rate limit)?
Should we implement exponential backoff here?"

✅ "Suggestion: Instead of nested if statements, consider using
early returns to reduce complexity:
[code example]"
```

**Avoid:**

```
❌ "This is wrong."
❌ "Why didn't you use X pattern?"
❌ "This code is terrible."
❌ Rewriting entire sections without explanation
```

### Review Size Guidelines

**Small PR (< 200 lines):**
- Ideal size
- 15-30 minutes to review
- Easy to understand and test

**Medium PR (200-500 lines):**
- Acceptable
- 30-60 minutes to review
- May need to be split across sessions

**Large PR (> 500 lines):**
- Request split into smaller PRs
- Difficult to review thoroughly
- Higher chance of bugs slipping through

## Self-Review Checklist

Before submitting your PR, review your own code:

- [ ] Re-read your changes with fresh eyes
- [ ] Run tests locally
- [ ] Check test coverage
- [ ] Remove debug statements
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Add descriptive commit messages
- [ ] Ensure PR description is clear
- [ ] Consider reviewer's perspective

## Team-Specific Considerations

Customize this checklist for your team:

- **Technology-specific checks** (React hooks rules, async/await patterns)
- **Business logic validation** (pricing calculations, data transformations)
- **Compliance requirements** (GDPR, HIPAA, SOX)
- **Company coding standards** (internal style guides)
- **Performance benchmarks** (API response time < 200ms)

## Quick Reference: Review Commands
