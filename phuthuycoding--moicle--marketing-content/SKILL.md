# Content Writing Workflow

One skill, two modes: build a multi-channel content strategy, or write one evergreen post really well.

## Pick your mode

| Situation | Mode | Jump to |
|-----------|------|---------|
| Building a content strategy (pillars, calendar, multi-channel) | **STRATEGY** | [Mode STRATEGY](#mode-strategy) |
| Writing ONE evergreen blog post optimized for Search + AI | **POST** | [Mode POST](#mode-post) |

- ❌ Writing API / project documentation → use `/docs-sync`
- ❌ Designing a logo or video → use `/marketing-brand`
- ❌ Full go-to-market plan (brand + content) → use `/marketing` command

---
---

# Mode STRATEGY

Create content strategy: audience research, content pillars, SEO blog posts, social media plans, newsletters.

## When to use
- ✅ Building a content strategy from scratch (pillars, calendar, channels)
- ✅ Writing one specific piece (blog post, newsletter, social thread)
- ✅ Repurposing one piece into multi-channel content
- ❌ Writing one evergreen SEO/AI post deeply → **Mode POST**

## Workflow

```
RESEARCH → PLAN → WRITE → OPTIMIZE → DISTRIBUTE
```

## Phase 1: RESEARCH

### Gather brief (skip what's already known)

| Field | Example |
|-------|---------|
| Brand / Product | "Acme — DevOps platform for indie teams" |
| Voice / Tone | "Casual but technical, no marketing fluff" |
| Primary audience | "Solo / small-team DevOps engineers" |
| Pain points | "Too many tools, none integrate well" |
| Goals (pick ≤2) | SEO traffic, lead gen, brand awareness, education, community, thought leadership |
| Current channels | Blog / X / LinkedIn / Dev.to / YouTube / Newsletter / Discord |
| Competitors | 3–5 names + what they do well |

### Audience & SEO research
- **Search intent** for the topic (informational / navigational / transactional / commercial)
- **Top 10 SERP** for 3–5 target keywords — what content ranks?
- **Gaps** competitors miss (more depth, better examples, fresher data)
- **Keyword set** — primary + 2–5 long-tails per piece

### Gate
- [ ] Brief captured · Target keywords with search intent · Competitor gap identified

## Phase 2: PLAN

### Content pillars
Pick 3–5 themes that ladder up to the brand's positioning. Each pillar gets a mix of formats.

| Pillar | Why it matters to audience | Formats |
|--------|---------------------------|---------|
| {pillar 1} | {pain → outcome} | blog, social, newsletter |

### Calendar template (4–6 weeks ahead, consistent cadence)

| Week | Blog (long-form) | Social (short-form) | Newsletter |
|------|------------------|---------------------|------------|
| W1 | {title} | 3 posts (1 educational, 1 hot take, 1 personal) | {topic} |

### Content mix rule (per channel)
- **80/20:** 80% value (educate / entertain), 20% promote
- **Don't post when you have nothing to say** — skip a slot rather than post filler

### Gate
- [ ] 3–5 pillars with rationale · Calendar ≥4 weeks · Channels matched to audience habits

## Phase 3: WRITE

One format at a time.

### Blog post structure (long-form, SEO)
```
TITLE (≤60 chars, primary keyword)  ·  META DESCRIPTION (≤155 chars, keyword + CTA)
H1 (matches title)
HOOK (2–3 sentences: the reader's problem)
TL;DR (3 bullets: the answer up front)
H2: Problem context — why this matters now
H2: The solution — main argument  (H3: Step 1 / Step 2 / Step 3)
H2: Common pitfalls — what NOT to do
H2: Real example — actual code / screenshot / case
H2: Next steps — what to do today
CTA (1 line: try / subscribe / share)
```
Target length: 1200–2500 words for SEO; 500–1000 for opinion.

### Social thread (X / LinkedIn)
```
HOOK (1–2 lines — must work alone in the feed)
↓ 3–7 posts each ≤280 chars (each stands alone, one idea per post, line breaks)
↓ CTA (link to blog / signup)
```

### Newsletter
```
SUBJECT (≤50 chars, curiosity > clickbait)  ·  PREVIEW TEXT (≤90 chars)
GREETING (personal, 1–2 lines)
MAIN STORY (1 idea, 200–400 words)
LINKS (3–5 curated, 1-line why-it-matters)
CTA (one ask only)  ·  SIGNATURE
```

### Writing rules
- **One idea per paragraph** (≤4 lines) · **Active voice** · **Concrete > abstract** (numbers, code, names)
- **Cut filler:** "in order to"→"to", "due to the fact that"→"because", "very important"→"critical"
- **Read aloud** before publishing — if you stumble, rewrite

### Gate
- [ ] Draft matches the format · Primary keyword in title + H1 + first 100 words (blog) · Read aloud, no stumbles · ≥1 concrete example

## Phase 4: OPTIMIZE

### Combined checklist (SEO + quality)
- [ ] Title ≤60 chars + primary keyword · Meta description ≤155 chars · H1 matches search intent
- [ ] H2/H3 use related keywords naturally · Alt text on all images
- [ ] Internal links ≥2 related posts · External links ≥1 authoritative source per claim
- [ ] No keyword stuffing · Mobile-friendly (short paragraphs, clear hierarchy)
- [ ] Reading level appropriate (Hemingway grade ≤10 for general) · No typos

## Phase 5: DISTRIBUTE

### Per-channel adaptation

| Channel | Adaptation |
|---------|------------|
| Blog | Full piece, optimized for search |
| X | Thread of 3–7 posts + link to blog |
| LinkedIn | 1 long-form post (200–500 words), link in comments |
| Dev.to / Hashnode | Republish with canonical link |
| Reddit | Comment in relevant thread first, share only if community allows |
| Newsletter | Featured story or blurb + link |
| YouTube Shorts / TikTok | 30–60 sec extract of key insight |

### Tracking
- UTM tags per channel: `?utm_source=X&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign={pillar}`
- Track per piece: views, time-on-page, scroll depth, conversions
- Iterate: double down on what works, kill what doesn't after 3 attempts

### Gate
- [ ] Adapted for each channel · UTM tags applied · Tracking in place

# Mode POST

Write **one** evergreen blog post that ranks on traditional search AND is easy for AI systems (ChatGPT, Bing/Copilot, Perplexity) to cite or recommend. Intent-first, answer-first, overlap-audited.

## When to use
- ✅ Writing a single evergreen blog post (entity / trust / compare / glossary / use-case / FAQ)
- ✅ Updating an existing evergreen post that has drifted
- ✅ Replacing a thin / outdated post with a stronger version on the same intent
- ❌ Multi-post content plan / calendar / strategy → **Mode STRATEGY**
- ❌ Changelog / feature launch → write manually
- ❌ Time-sensitive news → not evergreen, different rules

## Core principle
**Don't write a blog "to fill the calendar." Write the answer to a question users actually ask** on Search or to an AI. One strong intent = **one canonical post**. If an existing post is stale → fix it; don't pile a new post on top.

## Workflow

```
1 INTENT → 1.5 OVERLAP AUDIT → 2 RESEARCH → 3 FILE → 4 FRONTMATTER → 5 BODY → 6 PATTERN → 7 RULES → 8 LINKS → 9 VERIFY → 10 REPORT
```

## Step 1: Classify intent

Pick **one** category (don't write a hybrid — split into two posts if needed):

| # | Intent | Example queries |
|---|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | **Entity** | "What is {Brand}", "How does {Brand} work" |
| 2 | **Trust** | "Is {Brand} legit", "Why is {Brand} {claim}" |
| 3 | **Compare** | "{Brand} vs {Competitor}", "Best {category} apps in {region}" |
| 4 | **Glossary** | "What is {term}", "{term} explained" |
| 5 | **Use case** | "How to {action} with {Brand}" |
| 6 | **Problem / FAQ** | "Why is my {thing} not working" |

## Step 1.5: Overlap audit (mandatory)

Before writing anything new, inventory existing posts:
```bash
find {blog_dir} -name "*.md" -maxdepth 2 | sort   # common: content/blog/, app/blog/, docs/blog/
```
For each existing post, extract: slug, primary intent, funnel stage, evergreen/seasonal, stale/off-brand claims.

### Decision rules
| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| New post overlaps >60% intent with existing | **Do not create new.** Update existing OR refocus both to distinct intents |
| Existing post has stale claims | Update the existing post first or in the same batch — never ignore it |
| New intent genuinely uncovered | Proceed to Step 2 |

### Gate
- [ ] Inventory read · No >60% overlap (or plan to update existing) · Stale-claim audit done (or N/A)

## Step 2: Research (short but solid)

If the post mentions current facts, third parties, or specific numbers — **verify before writing**: competitor/partner facts, stats/dates/policies, app-store claims, pricing/fees.

**Source priority:** 1) official project source 2) official third-party source 3) project marketing docs 4) reputable recent third-party (≤1 year for pricing/stats).

**Hard rules:** no invented benchmarks · no invented comparisons · prefer durable claims over snapshot stats.

### Gate
- [ ] Every non-trivial factual claim has a source · Sources noted for reviewer

## Step 3: File output

```text
{blog_dir}/{slug}.md
```
**Slug rules:** lowercase, hyphen-separated, language convention for non-English projects, maps to **intent** not campaign. Examples: `what-is-{brand}.md`, `is-{brand}-legit.md`, `{brand}-vs-{competitor}.md`.

## Step 4: Frontmatter

```yaml
---
title: "Title that matches the real query"
description: "140-160 chars. What this post does for the reader — not fluff."
date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
author: "{Brand} Team"
image: "/images/blog/{slug}.svg"
category: "<from project's category enum>"
tags: ["<brand>", "<topic>", "<intent>"]
---
```
**Picking `category`:** use the project's existing enum — never invent. Common: `guide`/`tutorial` (entity, glossary, use-case, FAQ), `tips` (optimization), `compare`/`review` (comparison).

## Step 5: Body structure (answer-first)

```markdown
{2-4 sentences directly answering the title question — no warm-up, no story}

## TL;DR
- Key takeaway 1 / 2 / 3

## {Primary heading 1 — the main answer expanded}
## {Primary heading 2 — supporting context}
## When to choose / use / consider {Brand}
## Important caveats

## FAQ
### {Question 1 — phrased exactly as users ask}
{Direct answer, 2-4 sentences}

## Conclusion / Next step
```

**Why this works for AI systems:** TL;DR + direct answer + FAQ blocks are the highest-cited patterns. AI tools quote concise answers; long intros get skipped.

## Step 6: Pattern per intent type
- **Entity / Trust:** what it is, who it's for, where the core value comes from (sources, business model), who's behind it, support/app-stores/community.
- **Compare:** real comparison table (criterion × options); fair, no dunking without evidence; state when each option fits better; verify every cell.
- **Glossary:** define in 1-2 sentences at top, concrete example, end-user language, link to related guide.
- **Use case / How-to:** numbered steps (≤7), visuals, prerequisites first, expected outcome.
- **Problem / FAQ:** describe symptom, list causes by likelihood, fix per cause, when to escalate.

## Step 7: SEO + AI optimization rules
- **H1 = the real query** · **First paragraph answers directly** (no warm-up)
- **Headings tell the story** (scan H2s → understand the post) · **Tables/lists** beat paragraphs
- **Internal links** to related posts + product pages · **One consistent brand positioning sentence**
- **No keyword stuffing** · **No filler** · **Sensitive claims need evidence** or safe wording ("may", "in some cases")

## Step 8: Internal link rules
Minimum **2-4 internal links**: 1 to core product/about page, 1 to support/help page, 1-2 to related foundational posts. Anchor text natural + varied (no repeated exact-match).

## Step 9: Verify (pre-publish)
- [ ] Intent distinct from existing posts · Title = real query · First paragraph answers directly
- [ ] Table / FAQ / numbered steps where intent calls for them · ≥2 internal links, natural anchors
- [ ] No unverified claims · Frontmatter `category` matches enum · Sitemap updated (if required) · OG image exists · Reading level reasonable

## Step 10: Report
```markdown
## SEO Blog Post: {title}
### File: `{blog_dir}/{slug}.md`
### Intent: {category} · Primary query: "{search query}"
### Key internal links: {anchor → /path}
### Overlap audit: Checked {N} posts · Decision: {NEW / UPDATED `slug` / REFOCUSED}
### Items needing user review: {claim X — verify source}
```

## Hard Rules (both modes)

- **One idea per piece / one canonical post per intent** — if you have two intents, write two pieces.
- **No filler** — every paragraph earns its place. **No keyword stuffing** — humans first, search engines second.
- **Skip a slot rather than post filler. Iterate based on data** — kill what doesn't work after 3 attempts.
- **POST specifics:** overlap audit before writing (Step 1.5 not optional); answer-first (TL;DR + direct answer in first paragraph); no invented facts/benchmarks/comparisons; stale-claim audit fixes outdated posts in the same batch; slug = intent; update sitemap if required.
