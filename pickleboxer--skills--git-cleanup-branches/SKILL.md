# Git Branch Cleanup

Automatically identifies and removes local git branches that track remote branches that no longer exist (marked as "gone").

## When to Use This Skill

- User asks to "clean up git branches"
- User wants to "remove deleted branches"
- User mentions "prune branches" or "cleanup stale branches"
- Local branches show `[origin/branch: gone]` status
- After merging pull requests and deleting remote branches

## Prerequisites

- Git repository initialized
- **Must be on main/master branch** (not on a branch you want to delete)
- Active internet connection to fetch from remote

## Workflow

### 1. Switch to main branch (Required)

```bash
git checkout main
```

**Important**: You cannot delete a branch you're currently on. Always switch to main/master first.

### 2. Check current branch status

```bash
git branch -vv
```

Look for branches with `[origin/branch-name: gone]` - these track deleted remotes.

### 3. Prune remote tracking references

```bash
git fetch --prune
```

### 4. Find stale branches

**PowerShell:**
```powershell
git branch -vv | Select-String 'gone'
```

**Bash:**
```bash
git branch -vv | grep 'gone'
```

### 5. Delete stale branches

**Single branch:**
```bash
git branch -D <branch-name>
```

**Automated cleanup (PowerShell):**
```powershell
git branch -vv | Select-String 'gone' | ForEach-Object { 
    $branchName = $_.Line.Trim() -split '\s+' | Select-Object -First 1
    git branch -D $branchName
}
```

**Automated cleanup (Bash):**
```bash
git branch -vv | grep 'gone' | awk '{print $1}' | xargs -r git branch -D
```

### 6. Verify cleanup

```bash
git branch -vv
```

## Safety Notes

- **Always switch to main/master before cleaning** - you can't delete the branch you're on
- Use `-D` (force delete) - bypasses merge check
- Deleted local branches can't be easily recovered
- Remote branches are NOT affected - this only cleans local copies
- Backup branches (no remote tracking) won't be deleted by this process
