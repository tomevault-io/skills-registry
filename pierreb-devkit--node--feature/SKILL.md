# Feature Skill

## Phase 0 — Scope Analysis (interactive, before coding)

### 1. Identify target module

- Which module? Default to **ONE** unless justified.
- **If the module doesn't exist** → run `/create-module` to scaffold it first, then continue.

### 2. Module boundaries

- All new code isolated inside the target module (`modules/{module}/`)
- No modifications to shared core files (`lib/middlewares/`, `config/`) — except `config/templates/` for new email templates; additions to `lib/helpers/` or `lib/services/` require explicit justification
- Module registers its own capabilities via exports (policies, subjects) and file discovery (config auto-discovered by filepath pattern) — auto-discovered by the core

### 3. Analyze flows & edge cases

For each user-facing flow this feature creates or modifies, identify:

- **Happy path** — standard success scenario
- **Error path** — what fails, what does the user see?
- **"Last one" edge** — last owner, last org, last member, sole record
- **Retry edge** — can the user retry after failure/rejection? (check unique indexes)
- **Multi-user impact** — who else is affected? Do they need notification?

### 4. Check boilerplate resilience

- Works WITHOUT mailer configured? (graceful skip, no crash)
- Works WITHOUT organizations enabled?
- No hard dependency on external services for core flow?

### 5. Present plan & ask questions

**STOP and present to the user:**
- Flows identified (happy + error + edge cases)
- Users impacted + notification plan
- Open questions or scope decisions

**Wait for user validation before coding.**

## Phase 1 — Implementation

### 6. Apply layer rules

Strict order — never skip or reverse:

```
Routes → Controllers → Services → Repositories → Models
```

- **Controllers**: HTTP only, call services, format via `lib/helpers/responses.js`
- **Services**: Business logic, call repositories, throw `AppError`
- **Repositories**: Database only — sole layer importing mongoose

### 7. Apply modularity rules

- Isolate inside module boundary
- No cross-module imports unless justified (shared code → `lib/helpers/`)
- **No cross-module Repository/Model imports** — a service must never import another module's repositories or models; use the target module's Service instead
- Follow `/naming` conventions

### 8. Handle notifications

If an action affects another user:
- Use `lib/helpers/mailer/` abstraction (never nodemailer directly)
- Check `mailer.isConfigured()` — skip silently if not configured
- Create template in `config/templates/` for each new email type
- Send async, non-blocking (`.catch(() => {})`)

## Phase 2 — Definition of Done

### 9. Self-review checklist

**Edge cases:**
- [ ] "Last one" handled (last owner can't leave/be demoted)
- [ ] Retry works after rejection (unique indexes freed)
- [ ] Works without mailer (graceful skip)
- [ ] Error responses have user-friendly `description` field

**Tests:**
- [ ] Tests: add unit (`*.unit.tests.js`) + integration (`*.integration.tests.js`) tests. Add E2E (`*.e2e.tests.js`) only if the change affects a critical user flow (auth, org onboarding, invite/join).

**Schema consistency:**
- [ ] New enum values added to ALL schema definitions (Mongoose model `enum`, Zod `z.enum`, tests)
- [ ] Grep existing enum values to find all locations before committing

**Module autonomy:**
- [ ] No shared-file changes unless explicitly required; any `lib/helpers/` or `lib/services/` additions include explicit justification, and `config/templates/` is used for new email templates
- [ ] Module self-registers capabilities (subjects, abilities) via policy exports
- [ ] New routes/middleware defined inside the module boundary

**Modularity:**
- [ ] Isolated in ONE module (or justified)
- [ ] No cross-module Repository/Model imports (use target module's Service)
- [ ] Layer order respected

**Notifications:**
- [ ] Actions affecting other users trigger email (if configured)
- [ ] Templates created for each email type

**Error documentation:**
- [ ] If a non-obvious bug was fixed, add a single-line entry to `ERRORS.md` (root of repo) using format: `[YYYY-MM-DD] <scope>: <wrong> -> <right>` (see existing examples in `ERRORS.md`)

### 9b. Elegance check

For non-trivial changes: pause and ask yourself "is there a simpler or more elegant approach?" If the current implementation feels hacky, refactor before proceeding.

### 10. Run `/verify`

### 11. Run `/pull-request`
