# Jira Issue Management via jira-cli

Manage Jira Cloud issues using the `jira-w` wrapper command through Bash.

## Security Model

Authentication is handled entirely outside the agent context:
- A wrapper script `jira-w` reads the API token from a local credential file and injects it
  into the environment only for the `jira` child process.
- **Never** attempt to read, echo, print, or reference the token file, its path, or its contents.
- **Never** attempt to read `~/.config/.jira.yml`, `%APPDATA%\.jira.yml`, or any auth config.
- **Never** run `echo $JIRA_API_TOKEN` or equivalent — the token must not appear in output.
- If auth fails (401 errors), tell the user to re-run `jira init` or regenerate their token
  externally. Do not attempt to debug auth yourself.

All commands use `jira-w` (not `jira` directly).

## Prerequisites

- `jira-w` wrapper installed and on PATH (see `scripts/` for reference copies)
- `jira init` completed externally (one-time setup)
- Project-specific config in `.jira-config.md` at project root

## Before Any Operation

1. Read `.jira-config.md` from the project root for project keys, valid components, conventions.
2. For full CLI syntax, read `references/cli-ref.md` in this skill directory.

## Core Operations

### Query Issues

```bash
jira-w issue list -q "<JQL>" --plain --columns key,summary,status,assignee,priority
```

Always use `--plain` for machine-readable output. Use `--no-headers` when parsing.

### Create Issue

```bash
jira-w issue create \
  -t"<Type>" \
  -s"<Summary>" \
  -b"<Description>" \
  -C"<Component>" \
  -p <PROJECT_KEY> \
  --no-input
```

- **Type**: `Task`, `Bug`, `Story`, `Epic` (case-sensitive, project-dependent)
- **Component**: Must match a valid component from `.jira-config.md` — verify before using
- `--no-input` is mandatory to prevent interactive prompts

### Create Subtask

```bash
jira-w issue create \
  -t"Sub-task" \
  -P"<PARENT-KEY>" \
  -s"<Summary>" \
  -b"<Description>" \
  -C"<Component>" \
  -p <PROJECT_KEY> \
  --no-input
```

- Type must be exactly `Sub-task` (hyphenated, capital S and lowercase t)
- `-P` (capital P) sets the parent issue key

### Update Description

```bash
jira-w issue edit <ISSUE-KEY> -b"<New description>" --no-input
```

### Add Comment

```bash
jira-w issue comment add <ISSUE-KEY> -b"<Comment body>"
```

**Warning:** On Windows, multiline comment bodies get truncated during bash-to-cmd
translation. Content after the first newline may be silently lost. Always flatten
comments to a single line (use periods/semicolons as separators instead of newlines),
or write the comment body to a temp `.cmd` file and execute that.

### List Project Components

```bash
jira-w --components <PROJECT_KEY>
```

Returns all components defined in the project, one name per line.
Use this to validate component names before create/edit operations.
Falls back to `.jira-config.md` if the API call fails.

### Set/Change Component

```bash
jira-w issue edit <ISSUE-KEY> --component "<ComponentName>" --no-input
```

## Error Handling

Non-zero exit codes indicate failure — always check stderr. Match against these patterns:

| Stderr pattern | Cause | Action |
|----------------|-------|--------|
| `401 Unauthorized` | Token expired/invalid | Tell user to regenerate token. **Never retry.** |
| `403 Forbidden` | Insufficient permissions | Tell user their account lacks this permission. |
| `429` or `rate limit` | API rate-limited | Wait 1-2 minutes before retrying. |
| `token file not found` | Missing credential file | Direct user to setup procedure. |
| `Component name` + `not valid` | Bad component | List valid components via `jira-w --components <KEY>`. |
| `Issue type` + `not valid` | Wrong type string | Check case: `Sub-task` not `Subtask`. |
| `Project` + `does not exist` | Bad project key | Verify key in `.jira-config.md`. |
| `timeout` / `connection refused` | Network failure | Report to user, do not retry. |

**Rules:**
- Never retry auth (401) or permission (403) failures
- For validation errors, provide correct values immediately
- For rate limits, wait and retry once — escalate on second failure
- For network errors, report once and stop

## Output Guidelines

- Return concise results: issue key, summary, and status
- For queries: compact table, max 20 results unless asked for more
- Never include raw JSON API responses
- Always confirm create/update operations with the resulting issue key

## Platform Notes

- On Unix (Linux/macOS): `jira-w` is a bash script
- On Windows: `jira-w` or `jira-w.cmd` is a batch script
- Both behave identically — always invoke as `jira-w` (shell resolves the extension on Windows)
