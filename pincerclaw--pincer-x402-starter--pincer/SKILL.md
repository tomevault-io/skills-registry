# Pincer x402 Integration

Pincer is a facilitator for the **x402 Payment Protocol**, enabling crypto micro-payments and sponsored access for API resources.

Agents typically interact with Pincer in three ways:

1.  **As a Seller**: You have valuable data/tool and want to charge for it (or allow sponsored access).
2.  **As a Buyer**: You need to access a protected resource and must pay for it (or use a sponsor).
3.  **As a Sponsor**: You want to pay for other people's access in exchange for their attention (ads).

## Role 1: Monetize Your Agent (Seller)

If you are an Agent offering a service (e.g., "Premium Search", "Data Analysis"), use the `pincer-sdk` to protect your endpoints.

### Prerequisites

- Install SDK: `uv add pincer-sdk`
- Env Vars: `PINCER_URL=https://pincer.zeabur.app`

### Implementation

Use the `PincerPaymentMiddleware` to automatically handle payment verification.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request
from pincer_sdk.client import PincerClient
from pincer_sdk.facilitator import PincerFacilitatorClient
from pincer_sdk.middleware import PincerPaymentMiddleware
from x402.server import x402ResourceServer
from x402.http.types import RouteConfig, PaymentOption

app = FastAPI()

# 1. Setup Pincer Facilitator
client = PincerClient(base_url="https://pincer.zeabur.app")
facilitator = PincerFacilitatorClient(client)
server = x402ResourceServer(facilitator)

# 2. Define Payment Rules
routes = {
    "/premium-tool": RouteConfig(
        accepts=[
            PaymentOption(
                scheme="exact",
                pay_to="<YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS>",
                price="$0.01",  # Price in USD
                network="solana:mainnet" # or base:sepolia
            )
        ]
    )
}

# 3. Protect App
app.add_middleware(PincerPaymentMiddleware, routes=routes, server=server)

@app.get("/premium-tool")
async def premium_tool(request: Request):
    # Payment is already verified!
    # Check for sponsors (rebates)
    payment = getattr(request.state, "payment", None)
    sponsors = getattr(payment, "sponsors", [])

    return {"data": "Expensive result", "sponsors": sponsors}
```

## Role 2: Access Paid Resources (Buyer)

If you are an Agent trying to access a protected tool, you will receive a `402 Payment Required` error. You must sign a payment to proceed.

### Prerequisites

- Wallet Private Key (Solana or EVM)

### Implementation

Use the `x402` client to automatically handle the 402 challenge-response loop.

```python
from x402 import x402Client
from x402.http.clients import x402HttpxClient
from x402.mechanisms.svm import KeypairSigner
from x402.mechanisms.svm.exact.register import register_exact_svm_client

# 1. Initialize Client with Wallet
client = x402Client()
signer = KeypairSigner.from_base58("<YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY>")
register_exact_svm_client(client, signer)

# 2. Access Protected Resource
async with x402HttpxClient(client) as http:
    response = await http.get("https://premium-agent-service.com/tool")

    if response.status_code == 200:
        print("Success!", response.json())

        # Check for Sponsors/Rebates in response
        # (Pincer services often return 'sponsors' list)
```

## Role 3: Run Ad Campaigns (Sponsor)

If you want to sponsor user transactions (pay their fees in exchange for them viewing your ad), you can create a Campaign.

### Implementation

Currently, Campaigns are loaded from a JSON configuration file.
Modify `src/data/campaigns.json` in the Pincer deployment.

### Campaign Schema

```json
[
  {
    "id": "my-promo-campaign",
    "merchant_name": "My Brand",
    "offer_text": "Get x402 fee rebate on your first order",

    "rebate": {
      "amount": 0.1, // Amount to pay back to user (Rebate)
      "asset": "USDC", // Currency (USDC)
      "network": "solana:devnet" // Network to pay on
    },

    "budget": {
      "total": 100.0, // Total budget for this campaign
      "remaining": 100.0, // Remaining budget
      "asset": "USDC"
    },

    "coupons": [
      {
        "code": "WELCOME20",
        "description": "20% off your purchase",
        "discount_type": "percentage",
        "discount_value": 20.0
      }
    ]
  }
]
```
