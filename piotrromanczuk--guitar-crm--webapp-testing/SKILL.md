# Web Application Testing Toolkit

## Overview

Test Guitar CRM web application using Playwright for comprehensive E2E testing. Two Playwright tools are available as MCP servers:

| Tool | Best For | How It Works |
|------|----------|--------------|
| **Playwright MCP** (`playwright`) | Exploratory testing, debugging, long-running workflows | MCP server with rich introspection via accessibility snapshots, persistent state |
| **Playwright CLI** | Fast scripted automation, CI pipelines, quick checks | Shell commands via `npx @playwright/cli@latest`, token-efficient, session management |

## Playwright CLI Quick Reference

The CLI is available via `npx @playwright/cli@latest` (run through Bash). It is NOT an MCP server - use it as a shell command.

### Essential Commands

```bash
# Browser lifecycle
playwright-cli open http://localhost:3000     # Open browser at URL
playwright-cli snapshot                        # Get page accessibility snapshot (element refs)
playwright-cli close                           # Close browser

# Navigation
playwright-cli goto http://localhost:3000/dashboard
playwright-cli go-back
playwright-cli reload

# Interaction (use ref numbers from snapshot)
playwright-cli click <ref>
playwright-cli fill <ref> "text value"
playwright-cli type "text to type"
playwright-cli select <ref> "option-value"
playwright-cli check <ref>
playwright-cli hover <ref>

# Capture
playwright-cli screenshot                     # Full page screenshot
playwright-cli screenshot <ref>               # Element screenshot
playwright-cli pdf                            # Save page as PDF

# Session management (parallel sessions)
playwright-cli -s=admin open http://localhost:3000
playwright-cli -s=student open http://localhost:3000
playwright-cli list                            # List all sessions
playwright-cli close-all                       # Close all sessions

# Storage/Auth state
playwright-cli state-save auth-teacher.json    # Save auth state
playwright-cli state-load auth-teacher.json    # Restore auth state

# DevTools
playwright-cli console                         # View console messages
playwright-cli network                         # List network requests
playwright-cli tracing-start                   # Start trace recording
playwright-cli tracing-stop                    # Stop and save trace

# Network mocking
playwright-cli route "*/api/lessons*" --body='[]' --status=200
playwright-cli route-list
playwright-cli unroute
```

### Session Workflow for Multi-Role Testing

```bash
# Test as teacher in one session
playwright-cli -s=teacher open http://localhost:3000/login
playwright-cli -s=teacher snapshot
playwright-cli -s=teacher fill <email-ref> "teacher@example.com"
playwright-cli -s=teacher fill <pass-ref> "test123_teacher"
playwright-cli -s=teacher click <submit-ref>
playwright-cli -s=teacher state-save auth-teacher.json

# Test as student in parallel session
playwright-cli -s=student open http://localhost:3000/login
playwright-cli -s=student fill <email-ref> "student@example.com"
playwright-cli -s=student fill <pass-ref> "test123_student"
playwright-cli -s=student click <submit-ref>
playwright-cli -s=student state-save auth-student.json

# Reuse saved auth later
playwright-cli -s=teacher state-load auth-teacher.json
playwright-cli -s=teacher goto http://localhost:3000/dashboard
```

## Playwright MCP Tools Reference

The Playwright MCP server exposes these tool categories through Claude's tool system:

- **browser_navigate** - Navigate to URLs
- **browser_click** / **browser_type** / **browser_fill** - Interact with elements
- **browser_snapshot** - Get accessibility tree (primary way to see page state)
- **browser_screenshot** - Take visual screenshots
- **browser_tab_list** / **browser_tab_new** / **browser_tab_close** - Tab management
- **browser_evaluate** - Execute JavaScript in page context

Use MCP tools when you need iterative exploration with rich context preservation.

## Testing Patterns for Guitar CRM

### Pattern 1: Login + Verify Dashboard

```bash
# Using CLI
playwright-cli open http://localhost:3000/login
playwright-cli snapshot                          # Find form refs
playwright-cli fill <email-ref> "teacher@example.com"
playwright-cli fill <pass-ref> "test123_teacher"
playwright-cli click <submit-ref>
playwright-cli snapshot                          # Verify dashboard content
```

### Pattern 2: Test CRUD Operations (Lessons)

```bash
playwright-cli -s=crud state-load auth-teacher.json
playwright-cli -s=crud goto http://localhost:3000/dashboard/lessons/new
playwright-cli -s=crud snapshot
# Fill lesson form fields using refs from snapshot
playwright-cli -s=crud fill <student-ref> "Test Student"
playwright-cli -s=crud fill <date-ref> "2025-02-15"
playwright-cli -s=crud click <submit-ref>
playwright-cli -s=crud snapshot                  # Verify success message
```

### Pattern 3: Visual Regression

```bash
playwright-cli screenshot screenshots/dashboard-before.png
# ... make changes ...
playwright-cli screenshot screenshots/dashboard-after.png
```

### Pattern 4: API + UI Combined Testing

```bash
# Mock API response
playwright-cli route "*/api/students/needs-attention*" --body='[{"id":1,"name":"Test"}]'
playwright-cli goto http://localhost:3000/dashboard
playwright-cli snapshot                          # Verify UI renders mock data
playwright-cli unroute                           # Clear mocks
```

### Pattern 5: Debug Failing UI

```bash
playwright-cli open http://localhost:3000/dashboard
playwright-cli console error                     # Check for JS errors
playwright-cli network                           # Check for failed requests
playwright-cli tracing-start                     # Record trace
# ... reproduce the issue ...
playwright-cli tracing-stop                      # Save trace for analysis
```

## Python Test Scripts (Existing Cypress Complement)

```python
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

def test_login_flow():
    with sync_playwright() as p:
        browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=True)
        page = browser.new_page()
        page.goto("http://localhost:3000/login")
        page.wait_for_load_state('networkidle')
        page.fill('input[name="email"]', 'student@example.com')
        page.fill('input[name="password"]', 'test123_student')
        page.click('button[type="submit"]')
        page.wait_for_url('**/dashboard**')
        assert 'dashboard' in page.url
        browser.close()
```

### Helper Functions

```python
def login_as_student(page):
    page.goto("http://localhost:3000/login")
    page.fill('input[name="email"]', 'student@example.com')
    page.fill('input[name="password"]', 'test123_student')
    page.click('button[type="submit"]')
    page.wait_for_url('**/dashboard**')

def login_as_teacher(page):
    page.goto("http://localhost:3000/login")
    page.fill('input[name="email"]', 'teacher@example.com')
    page.fill('input[name="password"]', 'test123_teacher')
    page.click('button[type="submit"]')
    page.wait_for_url('**/dashboard**')

def login_as_admin(page):
    page.goto("http://localhost:3000/login")
    page.fill('input[name="email"]', 'p.romanczuk@gmail.com')
    page.fill('input[name="password"]', 'test123_admin')
    page.click('button[type="submit"]')
    page.wait_for_url('**/dashboard**')
```

## Dev Credentials (Local Only)

| Role | Email | Password |
|------|-------|----------|
| Admin | p.romanczuk@gmail.com | test123_admin |
| Teacher | teacher@example.com | test123_teacher |
| Student | student@example.com | test123_student |

## Best Practices

1. **Use `snapshot` before interacting** - Get element refs from the accessibility tree
2. **Use sessions for multi-role testing** - Test teacher/student views simultaneously
3. **Save auth state** - Avoid re-logging in for every test scenario
4. **Use `console` and `network`** - First steps when debugging failures
5. **Prefer CLI for scripted flows** - More token-efficient than MCP for sequential actions
6. **Prefer MCP for exploration** - Better context when investigating unknown page state
7. **Use data-testid selectors** in Python scripts for reliability
8. **Wait for network idle** before assertions in Python tests
9. **Run headless in CI**, headed for local debugging
10. **Clean up sessions** with `close-all` when done

## Dependencies

- **Playwright MCP**: Configured as `playwright` MCP server (accessible as Claude tools)
- **Playwright CLI**: Installed globally via `npx @playwright/cli@latest` (use via Bash tool)
- **Python tests** (optional): `pip install playwright && playwright install`

## Integration with Existing Cypress Tests

This skill complements the existing Cypress E2E tests in `/cypress`. Use Playwright for:
- Interactive browser debugging via CLI/MCP
- Cross-browser testing (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
- Multi-session role-based testing
- Network mocking and tracing
- API testing alongside UI tests
- Visual regression testing
