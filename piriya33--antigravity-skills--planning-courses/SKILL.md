# Course Planning Skill

## Triggering Contexts

- User wants to create a new course from scratch
- User feels an existing course is drifting or inconsistent
- User needs to restructure a curriculum
- User asks "what should this course cover?"

## Core Principle

> **Outcomes first, topics second.**
> Never start with "what should we teach?" Always start with "what should students be able to DO?"

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Define Course Identity

Ask for and document:

```markdown
## Course Identity
- **Course Name:**
- **Duration:** (weeks, total hours, # sessions)
- **Format:** (lecture / workshop / hybrid / online / project-based)
- **Domain:** (e.g., investing, Bitcoin, programming)
- **One-line promise:** "After this course, students will be able to ____"
```

### Step 2: Define Observable Outcomes

Outcomes must be **observable and measurable**, not vague.

| ❌ Vague | ✅ Observable |
|----------|--------------|
| "Understand technical analysis" | "Build a complete trading system using 3+ indicators" |
| "Learn about Bitcoin" | "Explain Bitcoin's monetary properties to a skeptic" |
| "Know risk management" | "Calculate position size given account size and stop loss" |

**Rule: Use action verbs.** Build, Calculate, Design, Evaluate, Compare, Demonstrate, Explain, Create.

Ask the user to define **3-5 core outcomes**. Fewer is better.

### Step 3: Create Student Personas

Define 2-3 student profiles that represent the audience:

```markdown
### Persona: [Name]
- **Background:** What they already know
- **Goal:** Why they're taking this course
- **Challenge:** What will be hardest for them
- **Success looks like:** What makes the course worth it for them
```

**Why this matters:** Every design decision should be checked against these personas. "Would Beginner Ben understand this? Would Advanced Amy be bored?"

### Step 4: Map Modules to Outcomes

Create a **module-outcome matrix**:

| Module | Outcome 1 | Outcome 2 | Outcome 3 | Outcome 4 |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Module 1: Foundations | ✅ Intro | ✅ Intro | | |
| Module 2: Core Skills | ✅ Build | | ✅ Intro | |
| Module 3: Application | | ✅ Build | ✅ Build | ✅ Intro |
| Module 4: Mastery | ✅ Assess | ✅ Assess | ✅ Build | ✅ Assess |

**Every outcome must appear at least twice:** once for learning, once for assessment.
**Every module must serve at least one outcome.** Modules with no outcomes get cut.

### Step 5: Sequence Modules

Check the sequence with these questions:

1. Does each module build on the previous one?
2. Are prerequisites taught before they're needed?
3. Is there a logical arc? (Foundation → Skill building → Application → Mastery)
4. Is the difficulty curve progressive, not flat or spiking?

### Step 6: Design Assessment Strategy

Map assessments to outcomes:

| Outcome | Assessment Type | When |
|---------|----------------|------|
| "Build a trading system" | Project | Module 4 |
| "Calculate position size" | Quiz / Exercise | Module 2 |
| "Explain to a skeptic" | Presentation | Module 3 |

**Rule:** Every outcome must have at least one assessment. If you can't assess it, it's not a real outcome.

## Output: Course Blueprint

The final deliverable is a `course-blueprint.md`:

```markdown
# [Course Name] Blueprint

## Course Identity
[From Step 1]

## Outcomes
1. [Observable outcome]
2. [Observable outcome]
3. [Observable outcome]

## Student Personas
[From Step 3]

## Module Structure
[Module-outcome matrix from Step 4]

### Module 1: [Name]
- **Sessions:** [N]
- **Outcomes served:** [list]
- **Key topics:** [brief]
- **Format mix:** [lecture %, workshop %, project %]

### Module 2: [Name]
...

## Assessment Map
[From Step 6]

## Prerequisite Chain
[Which modules depend on which]
```

## Red Flags to Call Out

- ⚠️ **Orphan topic:** Content that doesn't serve any outcome → Cut it
- ⚠️ **Unassessed outcome:** Outcome with no assessment → Add one
- ⚠️ **Persona neglect:** All content targets one persona → Rebalance
- ⚠️ **Front-loaded theory:** First 3+ sessions are all lecture → Add early hands-on
- ⚠️ **Missing prerequisites:** Module requires knowledge not taught yet → Resequence

## Cross-References

- After blueprint is done → Use `designing-classes` for each session
- After all sessions designed → Use `aligning-curriculum` to check consistency
