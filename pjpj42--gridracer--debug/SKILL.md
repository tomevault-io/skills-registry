# Debug GridRacer Issue

Investigate and diagnose a specific problem.

## Arguments
`$ARGUMENTS` - Description of the issue to debug

## Steps

### 1. Reproduce and Capture

xcrun simctl launch --console booted trouarat.GridRacer 2>&1 | head -100
```

Or take a screenshot to see current state:
- Use `mcp__automation__screenshot` to capture the game

### 2. Gather Context
- Search codebase for related code
- Read relevant Swift files
- Check recent git changes: `git log --oneline -10`

### 3. Form Hypothesis
Based on:
- Error messages in console
- Visual state in screenshot
- Code analysis

### 4. Verify
- Add print statements or breakpoints conceptually
- Trace execution path
- Check edge cases

### 5. Report
Provide:
- **Root cause**: Why the bug occurs
- **Location**: File and line number
- **Fix**: Specific code change needed
- **Verification**: How to confirm the fix works

### 6. Create Issue (Optional)

After completing investigation, offer:

```
🐛 Investigation Complete

Root Cause: [Identified cause]
Location: [File:line]
Suggested Fix: [Proposed solution]

Create GitHub issue to track this bug? [Y/n]
```

If yes:
```bash
gh issue create \
  --title "BUG: [Short summary from investigation]" \
  --template bug_report.md \
  --label "bug" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
