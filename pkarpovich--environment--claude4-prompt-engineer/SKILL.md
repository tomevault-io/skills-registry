# Claude 4.x Prompt Engineering

## Core Principles

**1. Be Explicit** — Claude 4.x follows instructions literally. Request "above and beyond" behavior explicitly.

**2. Context Over Commands** — Explain WHY, not just WHAT. Claude generalizes from explanations.

**3. Positive Framing** — Say what TO DO, not what NOT to do.

**4. XML Structure** — Use XML tags for complex instructions. Claude responds well to structured prompts.

**5. Match Style** — Your prompt's formatting influences Claude's output formatting.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify Prompt Type

| Type | Characteristics | Reference |
|------|-----------------|-----------|
| **System Prompt** | Sets assistant personality, constraints, capabilities | [examples.md](references/examples.md) |
| **Agentic Prompt** | Tool use, multi-step tasks, autonomous work | [agentic.md](references/agentic.md) |
| **Optimization** | Improving existing prompt that underperforms | [examples.md](references/examples.md) |

### Step 2: Apply Core Transformations

**Transform vague → explicit:**
```
Before: "Create a dashboard"
After:  "Create a dashboard with filtering, sorting, and export. Include interactive charts and responsive design."
```

**Transform commands → context:**
```
Before: "NEVER use ellipses"
After:  "Output will be read by TTS, so avoid ellipses which TTS cannot pronounce."
```

**Transform negative → positive:**
```
Before: "Don't use bullet points"
After:  "Write in flowing prose paragraphs"
```

### Step 3: Structure with XML

For complex prompts, wrap sections in XML tags:

```xml
<role>
Define who Claude is and their expertise
</role>

<guidelines>
Behavioral guidelines and approach
</guidelines>

<constraints>
Hard limits and requirements
</constraints>

<output_format>
Expected structure of responses
</output_format>
```

### Step 4: Add Relevant Patterns

Select patterns from [patterns.md](references/patterns.md) based on needs:

- **Action control**: `<default_to_action>` or `<do_not_act_before_instructions>`
- **Tool usage**: `<use_parallel_tool_calls>` or `<sequential_execution>`
- **Code quality**: `<minimal_implementation>`, `<investigate_before_answering>`
- **Output**: `<avoid_excessive_markdown_and_bullet_points>`

### Step 5: Validate

Check the prompt against:

- [ ] No vague modifiers ("be detailed", "be concise" without specifics)
- [ ] No contradictions ("thorough but brief")
- [ ] No negative-only instructions (all "don't" have a "do instead")
- [ ] No assumed context (all needed info is provided or referenced)
- [ ] No over-emphasis for Opus 4.5 (avoid "CRITICAL", "MUST", "ALWAYS" unless truly necessary)

## Quick Patterns

### Make Claude Act (Not Just Suggest)
```xml
<default_to_action>
Implement changes rather than suggesting them. If intent is unclear, infer the most useful action and proceed.
</default_to_action>
```

### Prevent Over-Engineering
```xml
<minimal_implementation>
Only make changes directly requested. Keep solutions simple. Don't add features or refactor beyond the ask.
</minimal_implementation>
```

### Force Investigation First
```xml
<investigate_before_answering>
ALWAYS read relevant files before proposing edits. Do not speculate about code you haven't inspected.
</investigate_before_answering>
```

### Control Output Format
```xml
<output_style>
Write in flowing prose paragraphs. Reserve markdown for code blocks and simple headings only.
</output_style>
```

## Reference Files

- **[patterns.md](references/patterns.md)** — Complete XML patterns library with copy-paste templates
- **[examples.md](references/examples.md)** — Before/after transformations and full system prompt examples
- **[agentic.md](references/agentic.md)** — Multi-context window tasks, state management, subagent orchestration

## Model-Specific Notes

### Opus 4.5
- Very responsive to system prompts — dial back aggressive language
- Replace "CRITICAL: You MUST..." with "Use X when..."
- Excellent at parallel tool calls
- May over-engineer — use `<minimal_implementation>`

### Sonnet 4.5
- Aggressive parallelism — may need `<sequential_execution>` for stability
- Good balance of capability and efficiency
- Strong at following structured XML prompts

### Haiku 4.5
- Keep prompts concise — smaller context window
- Prioritize essential instructions
- Good for simple, well-defined tasks
