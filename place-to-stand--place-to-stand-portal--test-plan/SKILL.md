```

## Actions

1. Analyze the feature or change scope
2. Identify all user-facing behaviors
3. Map permission requirements
4. Consider failure modes
5. Include regression scenarios

## Test Plan Principles

- Cover both positive and negative cases
- Include data boundary conditions
- Test with different user roles
- Verify soft delete behavior
- Check loading and empty states

## Post-Generation

Provide:
- Prioritized test case list (P0 first)
- Estimated testing time
- Required test data setup scripts
- Automation candidates for future
