# Expo Camera Workflow

This skill handles the complete camera integration workflow for Expo React Native apps, including permissions, capture, sticker creation, and file system management.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need to:
- Implement camera functionality with permission handling
- Capture photos using `CameraView`
- Implement photo editing or sticker creation logic
- Manage photo storage and file system operations
- Integrate camera features with MST stores

## Camera Workflow Steps

### 1. Permission Management
Always request camera permissions before accessing camera:

```typescript
import { Camera } from 'expo-camera'

export async function requestCameraPermissions(): Promise<boolean> {
  const { status } = await Camera.requestCameraPermissionsAsync()
  return status === 'granted'
}
```

### 2. Camera Setup
Configure `CameraView` with proper settings:

```typescript
import { CameraView } from 'expo-camera'

<CameraView
  ref={cameraRef}
  style={styles.camera}
  facing="back"
  flash="off"
/>
```

### 3. Photo Capture
Capture photos with `takePictureAsync`:

```typescript
const photo = await cameraRef.current?.takePictureAsync({
  quality: 1.0,
})
```

### 4. Photo Editing (Sticker Creation)
Create stickers by drawing paths and using `captureRef`:

```typescript
import { manipulateAsync, SaveFormat } from 'expo-image-manipulator'
import { captureRef } from 'react-native-view-shot'

// 1. Capture drawing view
const uri = await captureRef(viewRef, { format: 'png', quality: 1 })

// 2. Crop to sticker bounding box
const result = await manipulateAsync(
  uri,
  [{ crop: { originX, originY, width, height } }],
  { format: SaveFormat.PNG }
)
```

### 5. File Storage
Store captured images in app's document directory:

```typescript
import * as FileSystem from 'expo-file-system'

const PHOTOS_DIR = `${FileSystem.documentDirectory}purrsuit/photos/`
await FileSystem.copyAsync({ from: photoUri, to: `${PHOTOS_DIR}${filename}` })
```

## Best Practices

1. **Permissions**: Use `requestCameraPermissions` and handle denied states.
2. **Icons**: Use `lucide-react-native` for consistent UI.
3. **Storage**: Always ensure directories exist before saving.
4. **Compression**: Use high quality (1.0) for stickers, slightly lower for originals if needed.
