description: OpenAI Codex 官方文档参考技能。When working with OpenAI Codex features, configuration, hooks, skills, MCP, AGENTS.md, CLI, plugins, subagents, sandboxing, or any other Codex internals — either when users ask OR when the Agent needs to know how something works. Fetch from https://developers.openai.com/codex as the authoritative source instead of relying on training data. Make sure to use this skill whenever the Agent encounters a Codex feature it doesn't fully understand, needs to configure Codex settings, create hooks/scripts, use MCP servers, work with skills, or needs accurate information about Codex commands, permissions, or APIs. Use when this capability is needed.

# OpenAI Codex Reference Skill

## Core Principle

**Always prefer fetching from official documentation over relying on training data.** When working with Codex features, use the official docs at `https://developers.openai.com/codex` as the authoritative source. This applies both when users ask AND when the Agent needs accurate information about how Codex works internally.

## When to Use This Skill

**Trigger in all these contexts:**
- User asks about Codex features, configuration, or commands
- Agent needs to implement hooks, skills, MCP servers, or plugins for Codex
- Agent needs to configure Codex settings (config files, rules, AGENTS.md)
- Agent encounters an unfamiliar Codex feature or command
- Agent needs to write Codex scripts (hooks, slash commands)
- Agent needs to understand sandboxing, subagents, or workflows
- Agent needs to integrate with GitHub, Slack, Linear, or other platforms
- Agent needs to use Codex CLI, IDE extension, or cloud features
- Agent needs to troubleshoot Codex issues
- Agent needs accurate API reference, SDK usage, or configuration syntax

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify the Topic

Map the question to the most relevant documentation page(s). Use the index above for guidance.

### Step 2: Fetch from Official Docs

Use WebFetch to retrieve the relevant page(s):

```
WebFetch(url="https://developers.openai.com/codex/[topic]", prompt="Extract all relevant information about [specific topic]")
```

For unknown topics, start with the main Codex page:
```
WebFetch(url="https://developers.openai.com/codex", prompt="Find documentation related to [topic]")
```

### Step 3: Synthesize and Answer

Combine information from official docs with your own knowledge. When citing specific features, configuration options, or command syntax, **always reference the official documentation** as the source.

### Step 4: Provide Actionable Guidance

Don't just quote docs — provide concrete examples, configuration snippets, or step-by-step instructions based on what the official docs say.

## Examples

**User asks about hooks:**
→ Fetch `/codex/hooks`, explain hook types, configuration, and provide examples.

**Agent needs to create a skill:**
→ Fetch `/codex/skills`, explain skill structure, SKILL.md format, and how to trigger skills.

**Agent needs to configure MCP:**
→ Fetch `/codex/mcp`, explain MCP server setup, configuration, and provide examples.

**User asks about AGENTS.md:**
→ Fetch `/codex/guides/agents-md`, explain the purpose and format of AGENTS.md files.

**User asks about CLI commands:**
→ Fetch `/codex/cli/reference`, list relevant commands with flags and examples.

**User asks about sandboxing:**
→ Fetch `/codex/concepts/sandboxing`, explain how Codex sandboxing works and its security implications.

## Important Notes

- The documentation is comprehensive. You don't need to fetch all pages — only the ones relevant to the question.
- When users ask about "how Codex works" or "what can Codex do", start with the overview page `/codex`.
- Codex has many similarities to Claude Code but also differences — always fetch the specific Codex documentation rather than assuming features work the same way.
- Codex documentation is actively maintained — prefer real-time fetch over cached knowledge.
- If a page doesn't exist or can't be fetched, fall back to your training knowledge but clearly note when the information may be outdated.
