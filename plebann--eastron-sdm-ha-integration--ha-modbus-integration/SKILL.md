description: Patterns for building Home Assistant custom integrations that talk Modbus (TCP/RTU-over-TCP/serial): pymodbus device_id usage, safe polling/writing, pacing/backoff, encoding multi-register values, cached fallback, and translation-backed entities. Use when this capability is needed.

# HA Modbus Integration

Use this when implementing or refactoring HA custom components that communicate with Modbus devices.

## Quick start
- Pick connection mode (tcp, rtuovertcp, serial); set timeout and message spacing.
- Always pass the correct unit id (device_id/slave) on every read/write.
- Batch contiguous reads, lock IO, and tier polling; cache last good data for availability.
- Encode multi-register writes (float32/uint32) and avoid immediate post-write refresh.
- Use translation_key + entity.sensor names and stable unique/device ids.
