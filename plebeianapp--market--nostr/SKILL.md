# Nostr Protocol Expert

## Purpose

This skill provides expert-level assistance with the Nostr protocol, a simple, open protocol for global, decentralized, and censorship-resistant social networks. The protocol is built on relays and cryptographic keys, enabling direct peer-to-peer communication without central servers.

## When to Use

Activate this skill when:

- Implementing Nostr clients or relays
- Working with Nostr events and messages
- Handling cryptographic signatures and keys (schnorr signatures on secp256k1)
- Implementing any Nostr Implementation Possibility (NIP)
- Building social networking features on Nostr
- Querying or filtering Nostr events
- Discussing Nostr protocol architecture
- Implementing WebSocket communication with relays

## Core Concepts

### The Protocol Foundation

Nostr operates on two main components:

1. **Clients** - Applications users run to read/write data
2. **Relays** - Servers that store and forward messages

Key principles:

- Everyone runs a client
- Anyone can run a relay
- Users identified by public keys
- Messages signed with private keys
- No central authority or trusted servers

### Events Structure

All data in Nostr is represented as events. An event is a JSON object with this structure:

```json
{
	"id": "<32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded sha256 of the serialized event data>",
	"pubkey": "<32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded public key of the event creator>",
	"created_at": "<unix timestamp in seconds>",
	"kind": "<integer identifying event type>",
	"tags": [["<tag name>", "<tag value>", "<optional third param>", "..."]],
	"content": "<arbitrary string>",
	"sig": "<64-bytes lowercase hex of the schnorr signature of the sha256 hash of the serialized event data>"
}
```

### Event Kinds

Standard event kinds (from various NIPs):

- `0` - Metadata (user profile)
- `1` - Text note (short post)
- `2` - Recommend relay
- `3` - Contacts (following list)
- `4` - Encrypted direct messages
- `5` - Event deletion
- `6` - Repost
- `7` - Reaction (like, emoji reaction)
- `40` - Channel creation
- `41` - Channel metadata
- `42` - Channel message
- `43` - Channel hide message
- `44` - Channel mute user
- `1000-9999` - Regular events
- `10000-19999` - Replaceable events
- `20000-29999` - Ephemeral events
- `30000-39999` - Parameterized replaceable events

### Tags

Common tag types:

- `["e", "<event-id>", "<relay-url>", "<marker>"]` - Reference to an event
- `["p", "<pubkey>", "<relay-url>"]` - Reference to a user
- `["a", "<kind>:<pubkey>:<d-tag>", "<relay-url>"]` - Reference to a replaceable event
- `["d", "<identifier>"]` - Identifier for parameterized replaceable events
- `["r", "<url>"]` - Reference/link to a web resource
- `["t", "<hashtag>"]` - Hashtag
- `["g", "<geohash>"]` - Geolocation
- `["nonce", "<number>", "<difficulty>"]` - Proof of work
- `["subject", "<subject>"]` - Subject/title
- `["client", "<client-name>"]` - Client application used

### Core Protocol NIPs

#### NIP-01: Basic Protocol Flow

The foundation of Nostr. Defines:

- Event structure and validation
- Event ID calculation (SHA256 of serialized event)
- Signature verification (schnorr signatures)
- Client-relay communication via WebSocket
- Message types: EVENT, REQ, CLOSE, EOSE, OK, NOTICE

#### NIP-02: Contact List and Petnames

Event kind `3` for following lists:

- Each `p` tag represents a followed user
- Optional relay URL and petname in tag
- Replaceable event (latest overwrites)

#### NIP-04: Encrypted Direct Messages

Event kind `4` for private messages:

- Content encrypted with shared secret (ECDH)
- `p` tag for recipient pubkey
- Deprecated in favor of NIP-44

#### NIP-05: Mapping Nostr Keys to DNS

Internet identifier format: `name@domain.com`

- `.well-known/nostr.json` endpoint
- Maps names to pubkeys
- Optional relay list

#### NIP-09: Event Deletion

Event kind `5` to request deletion:

- Contains `e` tags for events to delete
- Relays should delete referenced events
- Only works for own events

#### NIP-10: Text Note References (Threads)

Conventions for `e` and `p` tags in replies:

- Root event reference
- Reply event reference
- Mentions
- Marker types: "root", "reply", "mention"

#### NIP-11: Relay Information Document

HTTP endpoint for relay metadata:

- GET request to relay URL
- Returns JSON with relay information
- Supported NIPs, software, limitations

### Social Features NIPs

#### NIP-25: Reactions

Event kind `7` for reactions:

- Content usually "+" (like) or emoji
- `e` tag for reacted event
- `p` tag for event author

#### NIP-42: Authentication

Client authentication to relays:

- AUTH message from relay
- Client responds with event kind `22242`
- Proves key ownership

#### NIP-50: Search

Query filter extension for full-text search:

- `search` field in REQ filters
- Implementation-defined behavior

### Advanced NIPs

#### NIP-19: bech32-encoded Entities

Human-readable identifiers:

- `npub`: public key
- `nsec`: private key (sensitive!)
- `note`: note/event ID
- `nprofile`: profile with relay hints
- `nevent`: event with relay hints
- `naddr`: replaceable event coordinate

#### NIP-44: Encrypted Payloads

Improved encryption for direct messages:

- Versioned encryption scheme
- Better security than NIP-04
- ChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD

#### NIP-65: Relay List Metadata

Event kind `10002` for relay lists:

- Read/write relay preferences
- Optimizes relay discovery
- Replaceable event

## Client-Relay Communication

### WebSocket Messages

#### From Client to Relay

**EVENT** - Publish an event:

```json
["EVENT", <event JSON>]
```

**REQ** - Request events (subscription):

```json
["REQ", <subscription_id>, <filters JSON>, <filters JSON>, ...]
```

**CLOSE** - Stop a subscription:

```json
["CLOSE", <subscription_id>]
```

**AUTH** - Respond to auth challenge:

```json
["AUTH", <signed event kind 22242>]
```

#### From Relay to Client

**EVENT** - Send event to client:

```json
["EVENT", <subscription_id>, <event JSON>]
```

**OK** - Acceptance/rejection notice:

```json
["OK", <event_id>, <true|false>, <message>]
```

**EOSE** - End of stored events:

```json
["EOSE", <subscription_id>]
```

**CLOSED** - Subscription closed:

```json
["CLOSED", <subscription_id>, <message>]
```

**NOTICE** - Human-readable message:

```json
["NOTICE", <message>]
```

**AUTH** - Authentication challenge:

```json
["AUTH", <challenge>]
```

### Filter Objects

Filters select events in REQ messages:

```json
{
  "ids": ["<event-id>", ...],
  "authors": ["<pubkey>", ...],
  "kinds": [<kind number>, ...],
  "#e": ["<event-id>", ...],
  "#p": ["<pubkey>", ...],
  "#a": ["<coordinate>", ...],
  "#t": ["<hashtag>", ...],
  "since": <unix timestamp>,
  "until": <unix timestamp>,
  "limit": <max number of events>
}
```

Filtering rules:

- Arrays are ORed together
- Different fields are ANDed
- Tag filters: `#<single-letter>` matches tag values
- Prefix matching allowed for `ids` and `authors`

## Cryptographic Operations

### Key Management

- **Private Key**: 32-byte random value, keep secure
- **Public Key**: Derived via secp256k1
- **Encoding**: Hex (lowercase) or bech32

### Event Signing (schnorr)

Steps to create a signed event:

1. Set all fields except `id` and `sig`
2. Serialize event data to JSON (specific order)
3. Calculate SHA256 hash → `id`
4. Sign `id` with schnorr signature → `sig`

Serialization format for ID calculation:

```json
[
  0,
  <pubkey>,
  <created_at>,
  <kind>,
  <tags>,
  <content>
]
```

### Event Verification

Steps to verify an event:

1. Verify ID matches SHA256 of serialized data
2. Verify signature is valid schnorr signature
3. Check created_at is reasonable (not far future)
4. Validate event structure and required fields

## Implementation Best Practices

### For Clients

1. **Connect to Multiple Relays**: Don't rely on single relay
2. **Cache Events**: Reduce redundant relay queries
3. **Verify Signatures**: Always verify event signatures
4. **Handle Replaceable Events**: Keep only latest version
5. **Respect User Privacy**: Careful with sensitive data
6. **Implement NIP-65**: Use user's preferred relays
7. **Proper Error Handling**: Handle relay disconnections
8. **Pagination**: Use `limit`, `since`, `until` for queries

### For Relays

1. **Validate Events**: Check signatures, IDs, structure
2. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent spam and abuse
3. **Storage Management**: Ephemeral events, retention policies
4. **Implement NIP-11**: Provide relay information
5. **WebSocket Optimization**: Handle many connections
6. **Filter Optimization**: Efficient event querying
7. **Consider NIP-42**: Authentication for write access
8. **Performance**: Index by pubkey, kind, tags, timestamp

### Security Considerations

1. **Never Expose Private Keys**: Handle nsec carefully
2. **Validate All Input**: Prevent injection attacks
3. **Use NIP-44**: For encrypted messages (not NIP-04)
4. **Check Event Timestamps**: Reject far-future events
5. **Implement Proof of Work**: NIP-13 for spam prevention
6. **Sanitize Content**: XSS prevention in displayed content
7. **Relay Trust**: Don't trust single relay for critical data

## Common Patterns

### Publishing a Note

```javascript
const event = {
	pubkey: userPublicKey,
	created_at: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000),
	kind: 1,
	tags: [],
	content: 'Hello Nostr!',
}
// Calculate ID and sign
event.id = calculateId(event)
event.sig = signEvent(event, privateKey)
// Publish to relay
ws.send(JSON.stringify(['EVENT', event]))
```

### Subscribing to Notes

```javascript
const filter = {
	kinds: [1],
	authors: [followedPubkey1, followedPubkey2],
	limit: 50,
}
ws.send(JSON.stringify(['REQ', 'my-sub', filter]))
```

### Replying to a Note

```javascript
const reply = {
	kind: 1,
	tags: [
		['e', originalEventId, relayUrl, 'root'],
		['p', originalAuthorPubkey],
	],
	content: 'Great post!',
	// ... other fields
}
```

### Reacting to a Note

```javascript
const reaction = {
	kind: 7,
	tags: [
		['e', eventId],
		['p', eventAuthorPubkey],
	],
	content: '+', // or emoji
	// ... other fields
}
```
