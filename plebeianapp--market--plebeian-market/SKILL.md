# Plebeian Market Development Skill

## Overview

This skill provides comprehensive guidance for developing features in the Plebeian Market application, a decentralized e-commerce marketplace built on the Nostr protocol. It ensures consistency with the established architecture, coding patterns, styling conventions, and Nostr integration approaches used throughout the codebase.

Use this skill when:

- Implementing new marketplace features (products, checkout, orders)
- Creating or modifying UI components
- Adding new routes or pages
- Working with Nostr events and NDK
- Fixing bugs or refactoring existing code
- Styling components with Tailwind CSS
- Managing state with TanStack Store or React Query

## Technology Stack

### Core Technologies

- **Runtime:** Bun (JavaScript runtime and bundler)
- **Frontend:** React 19 with TypeScript
- **Routing:** TanStack Router v1 (file-based routing)
- **State Management:** TanStack Store (client state) + React Query (server/async state)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4 with shadcn/ui components
- **Nostr Protocol:** NDK (Nostr Dev Kit) v2.15.2
- **Backend:** Bun WebSocket server

Refer to `references/libraries.md` for complete dependency list and versions.

## Core Development Guidelines

### 1. Architecture Understanding

Before implementing features, understand the project structure:

- `/src/routes/` - File-based routing (use `$param` for dynamic segments, `_layout` prefix for layouts)
- `/src/components/` - React components (organized by feature or in `ui/` for base components)
- `/src/lib/stores/` - TanStack Store state management
- `/src/queries/` - React Query hooks and query key factories
- `/src/hooks/` - Custom React hooks for reusable logic

Read `references/architecture.md` for detailed project structure and architectural patterns.

### 2. React Patterns

Follow these established patterns:

- **Functional components only** - No class components
- **Custom hooks for reusable logic** - Extract complex behavior into hooks
- **Query key factory pattern** - Organize React Query keys for cache invalidation
- **Store + action creator pattern** - Separate state from mutations
- **Data transformation utilities** - Use utility functions to extract data from Nostr events

For detailed patterns and code examples, read `references/patterns.md`.

### 3. Routing Implementation

TanStack Router uses file-based routing:

```typescript
// Example: routes/products.$productId.tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute('/products/$productId')({
  component: ProductDetailComponent,
})

function ProductDetailComponent() {
  const { productId } = Route.useParams()
  const productQuery = useSuspenseQuery(productQueryOptions(productId))

  return <div>{/* render product */}</div>
}
```

**Key conventions:**

- Dynamic routes: `products.$productId.tsx`
- Index routes: `products.index.tsx`
- Layout routes: `_dashboard-layout.tsx`
- Always run `bun run generate-routes` after modifying route files

### 4. State Management Strategy

**Use TanStack Store for:**

- Client-side state (auth, cart, UI state)
- State that needs persistence (localStorage/IndexedDB)
- Simple reactive state updates

**Use React Query for:**

- Fetching data from Nostr relays
- Server/async state with caching
- Background synchronization

Example store implementation:

```typescript
// lib/stores/example.ts
export const exampleStore = new Store<ExampleState>({
	data: [],
	isLoading: false,
})

export const exampleActions = {
	updateData: (newData) => {
		exampleStore.setState({ data: newData })
	},
}

// Component usage
const state = useStore(exampleStore)
```

### 5. Styling with Tailwind CSS

Follow utility-first approach with Tailwind CSS v4:

- Use utility classes exclusively (no CSS modules or styled-components)
- Use `cn()` helper for conditional classes
- Leverage shadcn/ui components from `components/ui/`
- Follow established color palette (zinc scale for neutrals)
- Mobile-first responsive design

Example component styling:

```typescript
import { cn } from '@/lib/utils'

<div className={cn(
  "flex flex-col gap-4 p-4",
  "border border-zinc-800 rounded-lg",
  "hover:shadow-lg transition-shadow"
)}>
  {children}
</div>
```

Read `references/styling.md` for comprehensive styling patterns, color schemes, and component examples.

### 6. Nostr Integration

All data flows through NDK (Nostr Dev Kit):

**Fetching data:**

```typescript
export const fetchProducts = async (limit: number = 500) => {
	const ndk = ndkActions.getNDK()

	const events = await ndk.fetchEvents({
		kinds: [30402], // Product listing kind
		limit,
	})

	return Array.from(events).sort((a, b) => (b.created_at || 0) - (a.created_at || 0))
}
```

**Publishing events:**

```typescript
export const publishProduct = async (productData) => {
	const ndk = ndkActions.getNDK()

	const event = new NDKEvent(ndk)
	event.kind = 30402
	event.tags = [
		['d', productData.id],
		['title', productData.title],
		['price', productData.price.toString(), 'sats'],
	]

	await event.publish()
	return event
}
```

**Data transformation:**
Use utility functions to extract data from Nostr events:

```typescript
const title = getProductTitle(product)
const price = getProductPrice(product)
const images = getProductImages(product)
```

Read `references/nostr-integration.md` for complete Nostr patterns, event kinds, authentication, and NDK usage.

## Development Workflow

### Adding a New Feature

1. **Plan the implementation:**
   - Identify if the feature needs new routes, components, stores, or queries
   - Review existing similar features for consistency
   - Check if shadcn/ui components can be reused

2. **Implement routes (if needed):**
   - Create route files in `/src/routes/` following naming conventions
   - Use appropriate route types (index, dynamic, layout)
   - Run `bun run generate-routes` to update route tree

3. **Create components:**
   - Use functional components with TypeScript
   - Follow established styling patterns with Tailwind
   - Reuse shadcn/ui components where possible
   - Extract reusable logic into custom hooks

4. **Implement state management:**
   - Use TanStack Store for client state
   - Use React Query for Nostr data fetching
   - Follow query key factory pattern
   - Implement action creators for mutations

5. **Integrate with Nostr:**
   - Use NDK for all Nostr operations
   - Follow established event kinds and patterns
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Use data transformation utilities

6. **Test the implementation:**
   - Test in development mode (`bun run dev`)
   - Verify responsive design on mobile/desktop
   - Check dark mode compatibility
   - Test with Nostr relays

### Modifying Existing Features

1. **Locate relevant files:**
   - Routes in `/src/routes/`
   - Components in `/src/components/`
   - Stores in `/src/lib/stores/`
   - Queries in `/src/queries/`

2. **Understand existing patterns:**
   - Read through related code to understand current implementation
   - Check how similar features are implemented
   - Maintain consistency with existing patterns

3. **Make changes:**
   - Preserve existing patterns and conventions
   - Use established utilities and helpers
   - Update TypeScript types as needed
   - Keep changes focused and minimal

4. **Verify integration:**
   - Ensure changes don't break existing functionality
   - Test with real Nostr relays
   - Verify UI consistency

## Common Tasks

### Creating a New Route

1. Create file in `/src/routes/` (e.g., `newpage.tsx`)
2. Define route with `createFileRoute`
3. Implement component
4. Run `bun run generate-routes`

### Adding a New UI Component

1. Check if shadcn/ui has a suitable base component
2. Create component in appropriate directory
3. Use Tailwind utility classes for styling
4. Follow established naming conventions (PascalCase)
5. Export from component file

### Fetching Data from Nostr

1. Create query function in `/src/queries/`
2. Use query key factory pattern
3. Create query options with `queryOptions()`
4. Use `useSuspenseQuery()` or `useQuery()` in components
5. Handle loading and error states

### Managing Client State

1. Create store in `/src/lib/stores/`
2. Define state interface
3. Create action creators
4. Use `useStore()` hook in components
5. Consider persistence (localStorage/IndexedDB)
