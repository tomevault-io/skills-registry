# Run a Plugboard process for a specific scenario

## Use this skill when

- the user wants to run a model with specific parameters, assumptions, or scenarios
- the user gives a set of values and wants the process executed through the CLI

## Goal

Create or update a YAML config for the requested scenario, then run it with `plugboard process run`.

## Instructions

1. Make sure a YAML config exists for the model. If the model only exists in Python, create the YAML first by using the `create-yaml-config` skill at `../create-yaml-config/SKILL.md`.
2. Ask for any missing scenario inputs before running anything.
3. Update the YAML config with the exact parameter values the user requested.
4. Preserve a clear component structure that matches the real-world model. Do not collapse multiple entities into one component just to make the config shorter.
5. Validate the updated YAML against `plugboard_schemas.ConfigSpec` before running it.
6. Run:

```sh
plugboard process run path/to/model.yaml
```

7. Report what configuration was used, what validation was performed, what command was run, and the key outputs or generated artifacts.
8. If the scenario required new parameters, confirm that the final config remains YAML-friendly and reusable.

## Output

- an updated YAML config for the requested scenario
- the command used to run it
- a summary of the results
