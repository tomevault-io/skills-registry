# Plugin Optimization

## Quick Start

Optimize your plugin:

```bash
# Get optimization recommendations
/optimize-plugin my-plugin

# Fix issues automatically
/optimize-plugin my-plugin --auto-fix

# Detailed optimization report
/optimize-plugin my-plugin --report
```

## Performance Optimization

### Response Time Targets

```
Agent invocation:     < 1 second
Skill loading:        < 500ms
Command execution:    < 2 seconds
Hook triggering:      < 100ms
Total workflow:       < 5 seconds
```

### Content Optimization

Before:
```markdown
This agent specializes in various aspects of the field,
including many different topics that are related to the
general area of expertise. The agent can help with many
different things such as...
```

After:
```markdown
Specializes in X, Y, Z with focus on ABC.
```

## Best Practices

### Agent Best Practices

```
✅ DO:
  ├─ Focus on single domain
  ├─ Provide 5-10 capabilities
  ├─ Document integrations
  ├─ Use clear language
  └─ Include status/date

❌ DON'T:
  ├─ Mix unrelated topics
  ├─ Create vague descriptions
  ├─ Ignore other agents
  ├─ Use technical jargon
  └─ Skip examples
```

### Skill Best Practices

```
✅ DO:
  ├─ Name lowercase-hyphenated
  ├─ Provide Quick Start code
  ├─ Explain core concepts
  ├─ Include real projects
  └─ Add usage guidelines

❌ DON'T:
  ├─ Use uppercase/underscores
  ├─ Skip working examples
  ├─ Theory only
  ├─ Ignore real-world use
  └─ Leave users confused
```

### Command Best Practices

```
✅ DO:
  ├─ Use verb-noun naming
  ├─ Document all options
  ├─ Show example output
  ├─ Suggest next steps
  └─ Clear error messages

❌ DON'T:
  ├─ Generic names
  ├─ Undocumented flags
  ├─ Missing output examples
  ├─ Leave guessing
  └─ Cryptic errors
```

## File Size Optimization

### Target Sizes

```
Agent files:    250-400 lines
Skill files:    200-300 lines
Command files:  100-150 lines
Total plugin:   < 50KB
```

### Optimization Techniques

```
Trim verbose sections
  → Remove redundant text
  → Link to external resources
  → Use clear headings

Consolidate examples
  → Use concise code
  → Remove verbose comments
  → Focus on essential cases

Organize content
  → Logical sections
  → Clear headings
  → Table formatting
```
