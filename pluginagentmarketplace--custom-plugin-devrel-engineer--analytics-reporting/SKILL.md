    strategy: "Verify data integrity"
    fallback: "Flag for review"
```

## Failure Modes & Recovery

|--------------|-----------|----------|
| Missing data | Gaps in metrics | Backfill or document |
| Wrong calculations | Audit reveals errors | Fix formula, rerun |
| Outdated dashboard | Stale data shown | Refresh pipeline |

## Debug Checklist

```
□ Data sources connected?
□ Date ranges correct?
□ Calculations verified?
□ Comparison periods aligned?
□ Visualizations rendering?
□ Insights actionable?
```

## Test Template

        assert: "Matches source systems"
    - test_calculations:
        assert: "Formulas correct"

  integration_tests:
    - test_dashboard_load:
        assert: "<5s load time"
```

## Observability

```yaml

  - reports_generated: integer
  - dashboard_views: integer
  - data_freshness: duration
  - insight_accuracy: float
```
