## Decision Trees

### Promotion Readiness Assessment

```
Promotion consideration
|
+-- Consistently meeting current level expectations?
|   +-- No -> Not ready, focus on current level
|   +-- Yes -> Continue
|
+-- Demonstrating next-level behaviors?
|   +-- Rarely -> Not ready, create IDP
|   +-- Sometimes -> Almost ready, targeted development
|   +-- Consistently -> Continue
|
+-- Scope and impact at next level?
|   +-- No opportunities yet -> Create stretch assignments
|   +-- Has delivered at scope -> Continue
|
+-- Peer and stakeholder feedback positive?
|   +-- Concerns -> Address feedback, reassess
|   +-- Strong support -> Ready to promote
```

### IC vs Management Track Decision

```
Career direction question
|
+-- What energizes them?
|   +-- Solving hard technical problems -> IC track
|   +-- Helping others succeed -> Consider management
|   +-- Both -> Explore tech lead role first
|
+-- What's their impact style?
|   +-- Individual mastery -> IC track
|   +-- Multiplier through others -> Management track
|
+-- How do they handle ambiguity?
|   +-- Prefer well-defined problems -> IC track
|   +-- Comfortable with people complexity -> Management track
|
+-- Are they willing to let go of coding?
|   +-- No -> IC track (even at Staff+)
|   +-- Yes -> Management viable
```

---

## Anti-Patterns

```yaml
anti_patterns:
  promotion_as_retention:
    symptom: "Promoting to prevent someone from leaving"
    remedy:
      - "Separate promotion from retention discussions"
      - "Promote when ready, not when threatening"
      - "Find other retention levers if not ready"

  peter_principle:
    symptom: "Promoting until incompetent"
    remedy:
      - "Assess readiness for next level, not current performance"
      - "Trial periods for new responsibilities"
      - "Safe path back if not working"

  neglecting_solid_performers:
    symptom: "All attention on high potentials"
    remedy:
      - "Recognize and value steady contributors"
      - "Create growth within level"
      - "Don't force everyone to climb"

  one_size_fits_all:
    symptom: "Same IDP template for everyone"
    remedy:
      - "Personalize to individual goals"
      - "Multiple paths to senior levels"
      - "Accommodate different learning styles"

  mentoring_without_structure:
    symptom: "Assigned mentors but no framework"
    remedy:
      - "Provide training for mentors"
      - "Set clear expectations"
      - "Regular check-ins on progress"
```

## Quick Reference Cards

### Development Conversation Starters

```yaml
conversation_starters:
  aspirations:
    - "Where do you see yourself in 2-3 years?"
    - "What kind of work gives you energy?"
    - "What would your ideal role look like?"

  strengths:
    - "What are you most proud of this year?"
    - "What do others come to you for?"
    - "When do you feel most confident?"

  growth:
    - "What skills would make you more effective?"
    - "What's holding you back from the next level?"
    - "What feedback have you received that stuck with you?"

  support:
    - "What do you need from me to grow?"
    - "What opportunities would help your development?"
    - "Who else should you be learning from?"
```

### Level Transition Indicators

| From | To | Key Indicators |
|------|-----|----------------|
| Junior | Mid | Independent on features, consistent quality |
| Mid | Senior | System-level thinking, mentoring others |
| Senior | Staff | Cross-team influence, strategic thinking |
| IC | Manager | People focus, letting go of individual work |

### 70-20-10 Development Mix

```
70% - Experience (On-the-job)
  - Stretch assignments
  - New projects
  - Cross-functional work
  - Leading initiatives

20% - Exposure (Learning from others)
  - Mentoring relationships
  - Shadowing senior folks
  - Networking
  - Feedback conversations

10% - Education (Formal learning)
  - Courses and certifications
  - Books and articles
  - Conferences
  - Internal training
```

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Root Cause | Solution |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| Unclear promotion criteria | Vague level expectations | Define observable behaviors per level |
| Stagnant careers | No development focus | Regular IDP discussions, stretch assignments |
| Poor mentor matches | Random pairing | Structured matching based on goals |
| High attrition of high potentials | Not developing fast enough | Accelerated development programs |
| Skill gaps not addressed | No systematic assessment | Annual skill gap analysis |
