name: accept-no-substitutes
description: This skill should be used when agents generate placeholder tokens like "pseudo-", "mock-", "temporary", "TODO", "demo-", or similar incompleteness markers. Detects substitution patterns in agent OUTPUT and triggers mandatory user interview instead of accepting incomplete work. Activates automatically on any output containing forbidden tokens. Use when this capability is needed.

# Accept No Substitutes

Zero tolerance for placeholder tokens **in agent output**. Incompleteness triggers user interview.

## Purpose

Detect and reject incomplete work tokens **generated in agent output**. When uncertainty exists, ask the user rather than substitute with placeholders.

## Scope: Agent Output Only

This skill validates what agents **produce**, not existing code:
- Code being written or modified
- Prose explanations
- Configuration being generated
- Any text output from parallel agents

**NOT** for scanning existing codebases (use linters for that).

## Trit Assignment

- **Trit**: -1 (MINUS/VALIDATOR)
- **Hue**: 240° (cold blue - enforcement)
- **Role**: Constraint enforcer, substitution detector

## Forbidden Token Categories

### Prefix Substitutions
| Pattern | Examples |
|---------|----------|
| `pseudo-*` | pseudo-code, pseudo-implementation |
| `mock-*` | mock-data, mock-service |
| `fake-*` | fake-response, fake-auth |
| `stub-*` | stub-function, stub-api |
| `dummy-*` | dummy-value, dummy-handler |

### Completeness Evasions
| Token | Context |
|-------|---------|
| `temporary` | "temporary solution" |
| `placeholder` | "placeholder for now" |
| `TODO` | inline TODOs as output |
| `FIXME` | deferred fixes |
| `TBD`/`TBA` | undetermined items |
| `WIP` | work-in-progress as deliverable |

### Deferral Signals
| Pattern | Context |
|---------|---------|
| `later` | "we'll add this later" |
| `eventually` | "eventually this will..." |
| `for now` | "for now just use..." |
| `skeleton` | incomplete implementation |

### Example/Demo Evasions
| Pattern | Examples |
|---------|----------|
| `example_*` | example_config, example_key |
| `demo_*` | demo_mode, demo_data |
| `foo/bar/baz` | metasyntactic placeholders |
| `xxx`/`yyy` | marker placeholders |

## Enforcement Protocol

### On Detection

1. **HALT** - Stop generation immediately
2. **ABANDON** - Discard substituted content with complete disgust
3. **INTERVIEW** - Ask user for clarification

### Interview Template

```
Substitution detected that indicates incomplete work:
  - Token: "[detected token]"
  - Context: [what was being attempted]

This requires input:
1. What is the ACTUAL implementation needed?
2. What specific details are missing?
3. Should research be conducted before proceeding?
```

## GF(3) Integration

Operates as MINUS (-1) validator in any triad:

```
accept-no-substitutes(-1) + generator(+1) + coordinator(0) = 0
```

When generator produces substitution tokens:
- Validator REJECTS with -1
- Generator must RE-ATTEMPT with +1
- Coordinator mediates user interview at 0

## Examples

### Rejected Output (triggers interview)
```python
def authenticate(user):
    # TODO: implement actual auth
    return True  # temporary bypass
```

### Accepted Output (no substitution)
```python
def authenticate(user: User) -> AuthResult:
    credentials = vault.get_credentials(user.id)
    return verify_signature(user.token, credentials.public_key)
```

### Rejected Prose (triggers interview)
```
Here's a pseudo-implementation you can adapt...
```

### Accepted Prose (no substitution)
```
Clarification needed before implementing:
- Which authentication provider is used?
- What is the expected token format?
```

## Rationale

Placeholder tokens are **technical debt laundering**:
1. Create false sense of progress
2. Defer decisions that need making NOW
3. Accumulate into unmaintainable systems
4. Signal uncertainty that should be surfaced

**The correct response to uncertainty is asking, not substituting.**

## Integrated Detection Pipeline

### Phase 1: Regex Scan
```bash
scripts/detect.py --stdin < output.txt
```

### Phase 2: AST Check (if code)
```bash
# Invoke tree-sitter for structural detection
tree-sitter query '(comment) @comment' | grep -iE 'TODO|FIXME|placeholder'
```

### Phase 3: Compression Test
```python
# High compression ratio = likely template/placeholder
from zlib import compress
ratio = len(compress(output.encode())) / len(output)
if ratio < 0.3:  # Suspiciously compressible
    flag_as_boilerplate()
```

### Phase 4: GF(3) Emit
```python
# On detection, emit MINUS signal
emit_trit(-1, reason="substitution_detected", token=matched)
```

## Hook Integration

Add to `.claude/settings.json`:
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [{
      "matcher": {"toolName": "Write|Edit"},
      "command": "~/.claude/skills/accept-no-substitutes/scripts/validate.sh"
    }]
  }
}
```

## MCP Bridge

Call via babashka for fast validation:
```clojure
(require '[babashka.process :refer [shell]])
(defn validate-output [text]
  (let [{:keys [exit]} (shell {:in text} "scripts/detect.py" "-")]
    (zero? exit)))
```
