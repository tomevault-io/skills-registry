**Plurigrid Connection**: CRDTs embody the principle of **autopoietic ergodicity** — self-sustaining distributed systems that explore all accessible states and converge automatically. This aligns with bmorphism's vision of:
- **Local-first** computing (offline-capable, no single point of failure)
- **Bidirectional sync** (Play/Coplay structure for state transfer)
- **Conflict-free** composition (open games with guaranteed Nash equilibria)

## Overview

The CRDT Skill provides conflict-free replicated data types with bidirectional lens optics for compositional game theory. It implements core CRDT types with full merge semantics and property verification.

## Features

### Core CRDT Types

1. **LWW Register** (Last-Write-Wins)
   - Timestamp-based value ordering
   - Simple conflict resolution
   - Use case: Simple mutable state

2. **G-Counter** (Grow-only Counter)
   - Monotonically increasing counts
   - Distributed increment operations
   - Use case: Metrics and counters

3. **PN-Counter** (Positive-Negative Counter)
   - Both increment and decrement
   - Composed from two G-Counters
   - Use case: Inventory, balance tracking

4. **OR-Set** (Observed-Remove Set)
   - Unordered collection with add/remove
   - Unique ID tagging for removal
   - Use case: Group membership, tags

5. **Text CRDT** (Character-based)
   - Vector clock causality tracking
   - Collaborative text editing
   - Use case: Distributed text documents

### Verified Properties

All CRDTs verify these mathematical properties:

- ✓ **Idempotence**: merge(A, A) = A
- ✓ **Commutativity**: merge(A, B) = merge(B, A)
- ✓ **Associativity**: merge(merge(A,B),C) = merge(A,merge(B,C))
- ✓ **Causality**: Vector clocks maintain partial order

### Open Games Interface

```ruby
# Forward pass (play)
result = skill.play(
  crdt_name: "state",
  operations: [{op: :set, value: 100}],
  strategy: :sequential
)

# Backward pass (coplay)
ack = skill.coplay(
  transfer_id: result[:transfer_id],
  acknowledged: true,
  consistency_verified: true
)
```

### Composition

Compose with other games:
- File transfer verification
- Payment games
- Encryption games
- State synchronization

## API

### Core Operations

```ruby
skill = CRDTSkill.new

# Create CRDT
skill.create("counter", :pn_counter, "replica-1")

# Mutate
skill.mutate("counter", :increment, 5)
skill.mutate("counter", :decrement, 2)

# Query
result = skill.query("counter")
# => { value: 3, ... }

# Merge two CRDTs
skill.merge("counter1", "counter2")

# Verify properties
skill.verify_idempotence(crdt1, crdt2)
skill.verify_commutativity("counter1", "counter2")
skill.verify_associativity("c1", "c2", "c3")
```

### Open Games

```ruby
# Forward: Client sends operations
result = skill.play(
  crdt_name: "shared_state",
  operations: [
    {op: :add, value: "alice"},
    {op: :add, value: "bob"}
  ]
)
# => { success: true, transfer_id: "...", operations_count: 2 }

# Backward: Server acknowledges with consistency verification
ack = skill.coplay(
  transfer_id: result[:transfer_id],
  acknowledged: true,
  consistency_verified: true
)
# => { success: true, utility: 1.0, properties: {...} }
```

### Statistics

```ruby
stats = skill.statistics
# => {
#   total_crdts: 12,
#   total_merges: 5,
#   total_operations: 47,
#   merge_success_rate: 100.0,
#   avg_merge_time: 0.05,
#   operations_by_type: {...}
# }
```

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Simple Counter

```ruby
skill = CRDTSkill.new

# Create and use
skill.create("views", :g_counter, "server-1")
skill.mutate("views", :increment, 1)
skill.mutate("views", :increment, 1)

result = skill.query("views")
# => { value: 2, ... }
```

### Example 2: Distributed Set with Merge

```ruby
# Replica 1: Add items
skill.create("tags-1", :or_set, "replica-1")
skill.mutate("tags-1", :add, "music")
skill.mutate("tags-1", :add, "harmony")

# Replica 2: Add different items
skill.create("tags-2", :or_set, "replica-2")
skill.mutate("tags-2", :add, "color")
skill.mutate("tags-2", :add, "perception")

# Merge
result = skill.merge("tags-1", "tags-2")
# All tags now present in merged set

# Verify CRDT properties
is_idempotent = skill.verify_idempotence(
  skill.crdt_store["tags-1"],
  skill.crdt_store["tags-2"]
)
```

### Example 3: Play/Coplay Semantics

```ruby
# Client side: play operations
play_result = skill.play(
  crdt_name: "shared_counter",
  operations: [
    {op: :increment, value: 10},
    {op: :increment, value: 5}
  ],
  strategy: :sequential
)

# Server side: coplay acknowledgment
coplay_result = skill.coplay(
  transfer_id: play_result[:transfer_id],
  acknowledged: play_result[:success],
  consistency_verified: true
)

puts "Utility score: #{coplay_result[:utility]}"
# => Utility score: 1.0 (perfect)
```

### Example 4: Integration with Distributed Learning

```ruby
# Share learned preferences
skill.create("preferences", :or_set, "agent-a")
["red", "green", "blue"].each { |color| skill.mutate("preferences", :add, color) }

# Transfer to remote agent
transfer = skill.play(
  crdt_name: "preferences",
  operations: [
    {op: :create},
    {op: :add, value: "red"},
    {op: :add, value: "green"},
    {op: :add, value: "blue"}
  ]
)

# Remote agent receives and acknowledges
ack = skill.coplay(
  transfer_id: transfer[:transfer_id],
  acknowledged: true,
  consistency_verified: true
)
```

## Integration Points

### With Music-Topos

**ColorHarmonyState**:
- Use PN-Counter for preference voting
- Use OR-Set for active colors
- Use Text CRDT for command logs
- Use LWW Register for latest color state

**Distributed Learning**:
- Merge agent states using CRDT operations
- Verify convergence via merge statistics
- Track causality with vector clocks

### With Amp Code Editor

```ruby
# In Amp buffer
require 'crdt_skill'

skill = CRDTSkill.new

# Collaborate on code comments
skill.create("comments", :or_set, "editor-1")
skill.mutate("comments", :add, "TODO: optimize performance")
skill.play(crdt_name: "comments", operations: [...])
```

### With Codex Self-Rewriting

```rust
// In Codex self-improvement loop
use skills::crdt_skill;

let mut skill = CRDTSkill::new();

// Track improvements
skill.create("improvements", :or_set, "codex-1");
skill.mutate("improvements", :add, "optimization_v2");

// Share with team
skill.play(crdt_name: "improvements", operations: [...])?;
```

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
ruby lib/crdt_skill.rb

# Expected output
# ✓ Test 1: Create and Query
# ✓ Test 2: GCounter increment
# ✓ Test 3: ORSet merge
# ✓ Test 4: Idempotence verified
# ✓ Test 5: Play/Coplay semantics

# ✓ All tests passed!
# ✓ CRDT Skill Ready for Production
```

## Performance Characteristics

| Operation | Complexity | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Create | O(1) | Instant |
| Mutate | O(1) | Typically <1ms |
| Query | O(1) | Instant lookup |
| Merge | O(n) | Linear in elements |
| Verify | O(n²) | Polynomial for verification |

## CRDT Properties

### Idempotence
```
merge(merge(A, B), B) = merge(A, B)
```
Merging duplicate states produces same result.

### Commutativity
```
merge(A, B) = merge(B, A)
```
Order of merges doesn't matter.

### Associativity
```
merge(merge(A, B), C) = merge(A, merge(B, C))
```
Grouping of merges doesn't matter.

## Comparison with Traditional Databases

### GF(3) Balanced Triad

```
crdt (−) + SDF.Ch10 (+) + [balancer] (○) = 0
```

**Skill Trit**: -1 (MINUS - verification)

### Secondary Chapters

- Ch8: Degeneracy

- Ch6: Layering
- Ch2: Domain-Specific Languages
- Ch7: Propagators

### Connection Pattern

Adventure games synthesize techniques. This skill integrates multiple patterns.
## Cat# Integration

This skill maps to **Cat# = Comod(P)** as a bicomodule in the equipment structure:

```
Trit: 0 (ERGODIC)
Home: Prof
Poly Op: ⊗
Kan Role: Adj
Color: #26D826
```

### GF(3) Naturality

The skill participates in triads satisfying:
```
(-1) + (0) + (+1) ≡ 0 (mod 3)
```

This ensures compositional coherence in the Cat# equipment structure.
