| Amplify               | Automatic      | $0           | Automatic           |
| OpenNext + CloudFront | ACM            | $0           | Automatic           |
| CDK NextJS            | ACM            | $0           | Automatic           |
| Fargate + ALB         | ACM            | $0           | Automatic           |
| EC2 + ALB             | ACM            | $0           | Automatic           |
| EC2 (Exportable)      | ACM Exportable | ~$0.75       | Manual (395 days)   |
| EC2 (Let's Encrypt)   | Certbot        | $0           | Automatic (90 days) |

**Key Takeaway:** ACM certificates are free for all integrated AWS services (CloudFront, ALB, API Gateway). Only exportable certificates for direct EC2 use incur charges.

## Conclusion

For most Next.js applications, **OpenNext with IaC (AWS CDK or Terraform)** provides the best balance of features, performance, and cost. Choose your IaC tool based on team expertise and existing infrastructure standards. Avoid AWS Amplify until the caching issues are resolved. Consider containers only for high-traffic enterprise applications where predictable performance is critical.

### Quick IaC Decision Matrix

| Factor            | Choose CDK                   | Choose Terraform                |
| :---------------- | :--------------------------- | :------------------------------ |
| Team expertise    | TypeScript/Python developers | HCL/Terraform experience        |
| Cloud strategy    | AWS-only                     | Multi-cloud or cloud-agnostic   |
| Existing tooling  | CDK pipelines in place       | Terraform workflows established |
| Abstraction level | Prefer high-level constructs | Prefer explicit resources       |
| Community         | AWS Labs official support    | Larger OSS community            |

**Both tools work equally well for Next.js deployments - choose based on your team's strengths.**

For small projects and MVPs, a simple EC2 deployment offers the fastest path to production with minimal complexity and cost.

**TLS/SSL Recommendation:** Use ACM with CloudFront or ALB for free, managed certificates with automatic renewal. Only use exportable certificates or Let's Encrypt when direct EC2 HTTPS is required without a load balancer.
