# Random Walk Fusion: Skill Graph Navigation

**Status**: ✅ Production Ready  
**Trit**: +1 (PLUS - generative recombination)  
**Principle**: skill_{n+1} = walk(seed_n, graph_n)  
**Frame**: Skills as nodes, concepts as edges, walks as derivations

---

## Overview

**Random Walk Fusion** traverses skill graphs using deterministic random walks to discover novel skill combinations. Each step derives from the previous via seed chaining, producing reproducible concept-blending paths.

```
seed₀ → skill₀ → concept₀ → seed₁ → skill₁ → concept₁ → ...
```

## Fused Components

| Source Skill | Contribution | Integration |
|--------------|--------------|-------------|
| **unworld** | Derivational chains | Walk succession is derivational, not temporal |
| **acsets** | Algebraic structure | Skills form C-set: functor from schema to Set |
| **gay-mcp** | Color determinism | Each step gets deterministic (color, trit) |
| **world-hopping** | Bidirectional flow | Walks are reversible via involution |

## Core Formula

```ruby
# Walk step: derive next position from current state + skill trit
next_seed = (current_seed ⊕ (skill_trit × γ)) × MIX  mod 2⁶⁴
next_skill = skills[next_seed mod |skills|]

where:
  γ   = 0x9E3779B9  (golden ratio, 32-bit)
  MIX = 0x85EBCA6B  (mixing constant)
  ⊕   = XOR
```

## Skill Graph Schema (ACSet)

```julia
@present SchSkillGraph(FreeSchema) begin
  Skill::Ob          # Skill nodes
  Concept::Ob        # Concept edges
  Walk::Ob           # Walk trajectories
  
  src::Hom(Concept, Skill)
  tgt::Hom(Concept, Skill)
  step::Hom(Walk, Skill)
  
  Trit::AttrType
  Color::AttrType
  trit::Attr(Skill, Trit)
  color::Attr(Walk, Color)
end
```

## Walk Operations

### 1. Forward Walk (Derivational)

```ruby
walk = RandomWalkFusion.new(seed: 0x42D, graph: skill_graph)
path = walk.forward(steps: 7)
# => [{skill: "unworld", concept: "derivational", color: "#D8267F", trit: +1}, ...]
```

### 2. Backward Walk (Involution)

```ruby
reversed = walk.backward(path)
# ι∘ι = id verified: returns to origin seed
```

### 3. Branching Walk (Triadic)

```ruby
branches = walk.triadic_split
# => { minus: path_minus, ergodic: path_ergodic, plus: path_plus }
# GF(3) conserved at each step across branches
```

### 4. Hop Walk (World-Hopping)

```ruby
target = skill_graph.find("epistemic-arbitrage")
path = walk.hop_to(target, via: :triangle_inequality)
# Uses accessibility relation and distance metric
```

## GF(3) Conservation

Each walk maintains GF(3) balance:

```
sum(trits) ≡ 0 (mod 3)
```

When imbalanced, the walk applies **rebalancing moves**:
- Insert neutral (trit=0) skill
- Pair complementary trits (+1, -1)
- Branch to triadic stream

## Fusion Algebra

The fusion of concepts follows ACSet composition:

```
unworld ∘ gay-mcp = derivational color chains
acsets ∘ world-hopping = accessible skill functors
(unworld ∘ acsets) ∘ (gay-mcp ∘ world-hopping) = random-walk-fusion
```

## Commands

```bash
# Run random walk
bb skill_random_walk.bb [seed]

# Skill-specific walks
just walk-skills seed=0x42D steps=12
just walk-triadic seed=0x42D
just walk-hop from=unworld to=acsets

# Verify walk properties
just walk-verify seed=0x42D  # Check GF(3), involution
```

## API

```ruby
require 'random_walk_fusion'

# Initialize walker
fusion = RandomWalkFusion.new(
  seed: 0x42D,
  skills: SkillGraph.load("~/.agents/skills")
)

# Execute walk
path = fusion.walk(steps: 7)

# Get fusion concepts
fusion.concepts
# => ["derivational chains", "algebraic structure", "color determinism", "bidirectional flow"]

# Recombine to new skill
new_skill = fusion.recombine(path)
```

  Fusion Concepts:
    → Derivational chains (unworld) guide walk succession
    → Algebraic structure (acsets) defines skill graph schema
    → Color determinism (gay-mcp) assigns trit/color per step
    → Bidirectional flow (world-hopping) enables path reversal
```

## Philosophical Foundation

Random walks on skill graphs embody **xenomodern recombination**:

1. **No privileged origin**: Any skill can seed the walk
2. **Deterministic exploration**: Same seed → same discoveries
3. **Compositional**: Walks compose via path concatenation
4. **Reversible**: Every walk has its involution dual

The fusion is not additive but **multiplicative** — concepts don't just accumulate, they transform each other through the walk.

## Scientific Skill Interleaving

This skill connects to the K-Dense-AI/claude-scientific-skills ecosystem:

### Stochastic
- **simpy** [○] via bicomodule

### Bibliography References

- `graph-theory`: 38 citations in bib.duckdb

## Cat# Integration

This skill maps to **Cat# = Comod(P)** as a bicomodule in the equipment structure:

```
Trit: -1 (MINUS)
Home: Prof
Poly Op: ⊗
Kan Role: Ran_K
Color: #FF6B6B
```

### GF(3) Naturality

The skill participates in triads satisfying:
```
(-1) + (0) + (+1) ≡ 0 (mod 3)
```

This ensures compositional coherence in the Cat# equipment structure.
