## Audit Methodology

### Phase 1: RF Reconnaissance
- Perform broadband spectrum sweep (SDR + GQRX/SDR++)
- Identify active frequencies, modulations, duty cycles
- Catalog all wireless interfaces on target devices
- Map wireless network topology and access points
- Document regulatory bands in use and transmission power

### Phase 2: Protocol Enumeration
- Identify protocols on discovered frequencies (WiFi, BLE, Zigbee, proprietary)
- Enumerate advertised services (GATT, SSIDs, PAN IDs, device names)
- Fingerprint firmware versions and chipset identifiers
- Map protocol state machines and message sequences
- Identify supported security modes and negotiation behavior

### Phase 3: Authentication Analysis
- Test pairing and association mechanisms for weaknesses
- Attempt default/well-known key access (Zigbee HA key, HID iClass standard)
- Evaluate key derivation and entropy (PRNG seeding, key length negotiation)
- Test credential storage on device (flash dump, JTAG/SWD extraction)
- Assess mutual authentication requirements (or lack thereof)

### Phase 4: Traffic Analysis
- Capture and decode protocol traffic (Wireshark, URH, rtl_433)
- Identify cleartext or weakly encrypted data transmissions
- Analyze session management (frame counters, sequence numbers, nonces)
- Look for information leakage in metadata, headers, or advertisements
- Correlate traffic patterns with device behavior

### Phase 5: Injection & Manipulation
- Replay captured frames and assess acceptance (replay protection)
- Inject crafted packets to test input validation
- Attempt protocol downgrade attacks (WPA3→WPA2, S2→S0, BLE SC→Legacy)
- Fuzz protocol parsers with malformed frames
- Test jamming resilience and failover behavior

### Phase 6: Persistence & Lateral Movement
- Assess post-compromise persistence on wireless devices (firmware implants)
- Test pivot from wireless to wired network segments
- Evaluate OTA update mechanisms for hijacking potential
- Check for mesh network propagation of compromised keys
- Document trust relationships between wireless components

## Code Review Patterns

When reviewing source code for RF/wireless implementations, flag:

- **Hardcoded Keys**: Encryption keys, PINs, or network credentials in source/firmware
- **Weak Randomness**: Use of `rand()`, `millis()`, or predictable seeds for nonces/keys
- **Missing Replay Protection**: No frame counter, sequence number, or timestamp validation
- **Cleartext Transmission**: Sensitive data sent without encryption over RF
- **Weak Key Derivation**: Short keys, no KDF, or insufficient PBKDF2/scrypt rounds
- **Missing Mutual Authentication**: Device trusts any peer without verifying identity
- **No Firmware Signature Verification**: OTA updates accepted without code signing
- **Static Session Keys**: ABP-style fixed keys that survive device reboot
- **Insufficient Key Rotation**: Long-lived symmetric keys without renegotiation
- **Debug Interfaces Left Open**: JTAG/SWD/UART enabled in production firmware
