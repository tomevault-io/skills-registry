# Skills: Formal Specification and Implementation Guide

## What is a Skill?

A **skill** is a self-contained, discoverable unit of agent capability encoded as a directory containing:

- **`SKILL.md`** (required): YAML frontmatter + Markdown instructions
- **`scripts/`** (optional): Executable code
- **`references/`** (optional): Supplementary documentation
- **`assets/`** (optional): Templates, data files, images

Each skill is **identified by its name** (kebab-case) and must be **located in a directory matching that name**.

### Design Philosophy

Skills implement **progressive disclosure**: agents load skill metadata on startup (~100 tokens), full instructions when activated (~5000 tokens), and on-demand resources during execution. This minimizes context bloat while maximizing capability.

---

## Part 1: Frontmatter Specification

The SKILL.md file opens with YAML frontmatter delimited by `---`:

```yaml
---
name: pdf-processing
description: Extract text and tables from PDF files. Use when processing documents.
license: MIT
compatibility: Requires Python 3.9, pypdf, pdfplumber
metadata:
  version: 1.0.0
  author: Your Name
allowed-tools: "Bash(python:*) Read"
---
```

### Required Fields

| Field | Type | Constraints |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **name** | string | 1–64 characters. Lowercase alphanumeric + hyphens. No leading/trailing hyphens, no consecutive hyphens (`--`). Must match parent directory name and be NFKC-normalized. |
| **description** | string | 1–1024 characters. Should explain both what the skill does AND when to use it. Include specific keywords for agent matching. |

### Optional Fields

| Field | Type | Constraints |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **license** | string | License name (e.g., `"MIT"`, `"Apache-2.0"`) or reference to a file (e.g., `"Proprietary. LICENSE.txt has full terms"`). |
| **compatibility** | string | 1–500 characters. Environment, system, or product requirements. Examples: `"Requires Node.js 18+, Docker, internet access"` or `"Designed for Claude Code"`. |
| **metadata** | mapping | Arbitrary key-value string pairs. Use unique key names to avoid conflicts. Nested values are converted to strings. Common: `version`, `author`, `updated`. |
| **allowed-tools** | string | Space-delimited tool patterns (experimental). Format: `"ToolName(pattern:*) ..."`. Example: `"Bash(git:*) Read Write"` means only git-related bash commands are pre-approved. |

### Frontmatter Rules

1. **Field whitelist**: Only `name`, `description`, `license`, `compatibility`, `metadata`, `allowed-tools` are recognized. Unknown fields cause validation errors.
2. **No duplicate keys** in metadata.
3. **Type checking**: name and description must be strings (not lists or objects).
4. **Case sensitivity**: All field names are lowercase.

---

## Part 2: Name Validation Rules

The **name** field must satisfy these constraints:

### Regex (simplified)
```
^[a-z0-9]+(-[a-z0-9]+)*$
```

### Detailed Rules

1. **Length**: 1–64 characters
2. **Characters**: Lowercase ASCII letters (`a-z`), digits (`0-9`), hyphens (`-`)
3. **No leading hyphen**: `pdf` is valid; `-pdf` is invalid
4. **No trailing hyphen**: `pdf-processing` is valid; `pdf-` is invalid
5. **No consecutive hyphens**: `pdf-processing` is valid; `pdf--processing` is invalid
6. **Must match parent directory**: If SKILL.md is in `pdf-processing/`, the name must be `pdf-processing`
7. **Unicode normalization**: Name is NFKC-normalized (handles accents, ligatures, etc.)

### Valid Examples
- `pdf`
- `pdf-processing`
- `data-analysis`
- `code-review`
- `xlsx`
- `skill-creator`

### Invalid Examples
- `PDF-Processing` (uppercase)
- `-pdf` (leading hyphen)
- `pdf-` (trailing hyphen)
- `pdf--processing` (consecutive hyphens)
- `pdf_processing` (underscore not allowed)
- `` (empty)
- `pdf-processing-and-analysis-suite` (65 characters, exceeds max)

---

## Part 3: Body Content (Markdown Instructions)

After the closing `---`, everything is Markdown. This is **Level 2: Instructions** in progressive disclosure.

### Guidelines

- **Stay under 500 lines** (hard limit in agentskills spec)
- **Estimate under 5000 tokens** (~20,000 characters) (advisory)
- **Include clear structure**: headings, lists, code blocks
- **Document when to use**: What problems does this skill solve? When should agents reach for it?
- **Provide examples**: Show input/output, common patterns, edge cases
- **Link to resources**: Use `[reference guide](references/REFERENCE.md)` or `scripts/extract.py`
- **Avoid boilerplate**: Don't include README.md, CHANGELOG.md, or license text (those live in the root)

### Example Structure

```markdown
# PDF Processing

## Overview
This skill provides tools for extracting text and tables from PDF files...

## Quick Start
1. Load a PDF: `python scripts/extract.py input.pdf`
2. Parse tables: `python scripts/tables.py input.pdf`

## When to Use
- User provides a PDF and wants specific data extracted
- Need OCR for scanned PDFs
- Converting PDF forms to structured data

## When NOT to Use
- User has a simple PDF they can convert to text with `pdftotext`
- Task requires heavy image processing (use image-processing skill)

## Common Tasks

### Extracting Text
See `references/EXTRACTION_GUIDE.md` for detailed steps.

### Parsing Tables
Tables.py handles:
- Bordered tables (Tabula style)
- Grid-based layouts
- Multi-row headers

### Watermarks & Encryption
Scripts provided for removal (see `references/SECURITY.md`).

## References
- [PyPDF docs](https://pypdf.readthedocs.io/)
- [PDFPlumber guide](references/PDFPLUMBER.md)

## Troubleshooting
Common errors and solutions in `references/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`.
```

## Part 4: Progressive Disclosure Levels

Skills are loaded in three tiers to manage agent context efficiently.

### Level 1: Metadata (~100 tokens)

Loaded at agent startup. Contains:
- **name**: Skill identifier (kebab-case)
- **description**: What the skill does + when to use
- **role** (boxxy extension): GF(3) trit-based role (Generator, Coordinator, Verifier)
- **color** (boxxy extension): Primary color for UI rendering

**Example XML** (from `skills-ref to-prompt`):
```xml
<skill name="pdf" description="Extract text and tables from PDF files."
        location="/path/to/pdf/SKILL.md" trit="0" role="Coordinator"
        color="#F59E0B" />
```

Agents use this to:
1. Recognize available skills
2. Match skills to user requests (semantic matching on name + description)
3. Decide whether to activate this skill (avoiding context bloat)

### Level 2: Instructions (~5000 tokens recommended, <500 lines hard limit)

Loaded when skill is activated. Contains:
- Full Markdown body after frontmatter
- Step-by-step procedures
- Examples and edge cases
- Links to references and scripts

**Example XML**:
```xml
<skill name="pdf" ...>
[full Markdown body here]
</skill>
```

### Level 3: Resources (on-demand)

Loaded during execution as needed. Contains:
- **`scripts/`**: Executable code (Python, Bash, Go, etc.)
  - Should be self-contained or clearly document dependencies
  - Include helpful error messages
  - Useful for deterministic, fragile operations

- **`references/`**: Supplementary docs (1 level deep from SKILL.md)
  - Individual files per topic (e.g., `REFERENCE.md`, `FORMS.md`)
  - Keep focused and modular
  - Examples: API docs, detailed tutorials, templates

- **`assets/`**: Static resources
  - Templates, images, data files, boilerplate
  - Used for output artifacts (forms, generated code, etc.)

**File referencing** from the body:
```markdown
For details, see [FHIR reference guide](references/FHIR_GUIDE.md).
Run [extraction script](scripts/extract.py) with your PDF.
Use [form template](assets/form-template.txt) as a starting point.
```

## Part 5: Directory Structure

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md                    # Required: frontmatter + body
├── scripts/                    # Optional: executable code
│   ├── extract.py            # Python script
│   ├── process.sh            # Bash script
│   └── query.go              # Go program

```

### Conventions

- **SKILL.md** (uppercase preferred, though `skill.md` is accepted)
- **No extraneous files**: Don't include README.md, CHANGELOG.md, or other cruft
- **Scripts self-contained**: Either a single tool with no deps, or clearly documented
- **One level deep references**: Avoid nesting `references/subdir/file.md`
- **Relative paths**: Use `references/GUIDE.md`, not absolute paths or `../`

### What Goes Where?

| Item | Location | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Step-by-step procedures | SKILL.md body | Core instructions |
| API endpoint docs | `references/API.md` | Supplementary detail |
| Code to extract data | `scripts/extract.py` | Executable, deterministic |
| Form template | `assets/form.txt` | Output artifact |
| Troubleshooting tips | `references/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` | Reference material |

## Part 6: Validation

Use the **skills-ref** CLI to validate SKILL.md files:

```bash
# Validate a single skill
skills-ref validate ./pdf

# Validate all skills in a directory
skills-ref validate ./skills

# Get structured output
skills-ref read-properties ./pdf
```

### Validation Checklist

1. ✓ SKILL.md exists (case-insensitive)
2. ✓ Frontmatter is valid YAML
3. ✓ **name** field is present and valid (kebab-case, matches directory)
4. ✓ **description** field is present (1–1024 chars)
5. ✓ **compatibility** field is ≤500 chars (if present)
6. ✓ No unknown fields (only whitelisted: name, description, license, compatibility, metadata, allowed-tools)
7. ✓ **Body** is ≤500 lines (hard limit)
8. ✓ **Body** is ~<5000 tokens (advisory, for context efficiency)
9. ✓ No directory traversal in resource references (e.g., no `../../etc/passwd`)
10. ✓ Metadata has no duplicate keys

### Validation Errors

**Hard errors** (prevent use):
- Missing SKILL.md
- Invalid YAML frontmatter
- Missing required fields (name, description)
- Invalid name (wrong characters, too long, doesn't match directory)
- Unknown frontmatter fields
- Body exceeds 500 lines

**Warnings** (advisory):
- Body approaches 5000 tokens
- Compatibility exceeds 500 chars
- Name doesn't match directory (legacy skills)

## Part 7: Integration with Agent Systems

### For Agent Builders

To integrate skills into your agent:

1. **Discover** skills in designated directories:
   ```bash
   skills-ref validate ./skills
   ```

2. **Extract metadata** at startup:
   ```python
   from skills_ref import read_properties
   props = read_properties("./pdf")
   # props.name, props.description, props.license, ...
   ```

3. **Match requests** to skills semantically:
   - Use name + description to find relevant skills
   - Filter by allowed-tools if provided

4. **Load instructions** when activated:
   ```python
   from skills_ref import to_prompt
   xml = to_prompt(["./pdf", "./xlsx"])
   # Inject <available_skills>...</available_skills> into system prompt
   ```

5. **Execute resources** on demand:
   - Run scripts in isolated environments
   - Load references as context
   - Retrieve assets for output generation

6. **Log and audit**:
   - Track which skills were loaded and when
   - Validate tool usage against allowed-tools whitelist
   - Maintain execution logs for compliance

### Security Considerations

- **Execute in isolation**: Run skill scripts in sandboxed environments
- **Trust boundaries**: Only execute scripts from trusted skill sources
- **User approval**: Obtain consent before dangerous operations (file deletion, network access)
- **Path traversal**: Validate that resource references don't escape the skill directory
- **Tool whitelisting**: Respect the `allowed-tools` field; don't grant skills access beyond their scope

---

## Part 8: Examples

### Minimal Skill

```yaml
---
name: hello
description: A simple greeting skill for testing agent integration.
---

# Hello Skill

Say hello to the world.

## Usage

Just ask the agent to greet you!
```

### Full-Featured Skill

See the `references/FULL_EXAMPLE.md` for a comprehensive example with all optional fields, metadata, and script references.

---

## Part 9: Best Practices

### For Skill Authors

1. **Keep metadata tight**: Name and description should be ~100 tokens total
2. **Use progressive disclosure**: Don't cram everything into SKILL.md; link to references
3. **Document decision boundaries**: Explain when to use and when NOT to use this skill
4. **Version your skills**: Add `version` to metadata; bump on breaking changes
5. **Test validation**: Run `skills-ref validate` before publishing
6. **Name clearly**: Use kebab-case names that hint at function (e.g., `pdf-extraction` not `doc-proc`)
7. **Include examples**: Show input/output; help agents understand scope
8. **Provide troubleshooting**: Common errors and solutions in a reference

### For Agent Builders

1. **Load metadata at startup**: ~100 tokens per skill is acceptable
2. **Match before loading full instructions**: Use semantic search on name + description
3. **Cache instructions**: Load full SKILL.md body only once per session
4. **Respect allowed-tools**: Don't bypass tool restrictions
5. **Log all skill activations**: For debugging and compliance
6. **Graceful degradation**: If a script fails, provide helpful fallbacks
7. **Document constraints**: Tell users which skills you support

---

## Part 10: Relationship to agentskills.io

This skill **IS** the agentskills.io specification, formatted as a self-referential skill. It teaches agents how to:

- Read and understand SKILL.md files
- Validate skill metadata against the spec
- Integrate skills into agent systems
- Author new skills
- Reason about progressive disclosure and context efficiency

The specification itself is maintained at:
- **Spec site**: https://agentskills.io/specification
- **CLI tool**: https://github.com/agentskills/agentskills (skills-ref)
- **Example skills**: https://github.com/anthropics/skills

---

## Part 11: Tooling

### skills-ref (Python CLI)

```bash
# Installation
pip install skills-ref
# or
uv pip install skills-ref

# Subcommands
skills-ref validate <path>              # Check if valid
skills-ref read-properties <path>       # Output JSON metadata
skills-ref to-prompt <path> [<path>...] # Generate XML for agents
```

### boxxy (Go skill system)

The Boxxy skill system adds:
- **GF(3) trit-based classification**: Each skill gets a color-coded role (Generator, Coordinator, Verifier)
- **Glamour rendering**: Rich terminal output with trit-colored themes
- **Batch operations**: Validate and render multiple skills with `ValidateDir` and `RenderTriadSummary`
- **Conservation laws**: Balanced skill sets satisfy `∑ trits ≡ 0 (mod 3)` for triadic harmony

See `/Users/bob/i/boxxy/internal/skill/` for implementation.

---

## Part 12: Formal Specification (Dafny)

A complete formal specification of the agentskills spec is maintained in **AgentSkills.dfy** with predicates for:
- Name validation (`IsValidSkillName`)
- Description constraints (`IsValidDescription`)
- Frontmatter structure (`IsValidFrontmatter`)
- Directory layout (`IsValidSkillDirectory`)
- Progressive disclosure (`IsValidLevel1`, `IsValidLevel2`, `IsValidLevel3`)
- Complete skill validity (`IsValidCompleteSkill`)

Every predicate translates 1:1 to Go validation logic in `boxxy/internal/skill/skill.go`, verified by exhaustive unit tests.

## Troubleshooting

### My skill fails validation
1. Check SKILL.md formatting: ensure it starts with `---` on its own line
2. Validate name: lowercase, no leading/trailing/consecutive hyphens, matches directory
3. Check YAML: use `python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('SKILL.md'))"` to debug
4. Frontmatter fields: only use `name`, `description`, `license`, `compatibility`, `metadata`, `allowed-tools`

### Body exceeds 500 lines
Split content: move detailed guides to `references/GUIDE.md`, scripts to `scripts/`, and keep SKILL.md focused on quick start and key concepts.

### Agents don't find my skill
Ensure the skill directory name matches the **name** field exactly (both kebab-case). Run `skills-ref validate ./your-skill` to confirm.

### Unicode/encoding issues
Ensure SKILL.md is UTF-8 encoded. Use NFKC normalization for the name field.

**This skill is self-validating**: it teaches agents to read skills, and it is itself a valid skill according to this specification. ✓
