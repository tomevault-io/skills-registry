# Secure Flow Skill
This skill provides comprehensive security guidance to help AI coding agents generate secure code, perform security reviews, and implement security best practices. It is based on **Secure Flow**, a security framework that embeds secure-by-default practices into AI coding workflows.

## When to Use This Skill
This skill should be activated when:
- Writing new code in any language
- Reviewing or modifying existing code
- Implementing security-sensitive features (authentication, cryptography, data handling, etc.)
- Working with user input, databases, APIs, or external services
- Configuring cloud infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, or containers
- Handling sensitive data, credentials, or cryptographic operations
- Performing security assessments, threat modeling, or compliance validation
- Creating security tests or remediating vulnerabilities

## How to Use This Skill
When writing or reviewing code:

1. **Always-Apply Rules**: Some rules MUST be checked on every code operation:
   - Security best practices for authentication and authorization
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - Secure credential management
   - Cryptographic best practices

2. **Context-Specific Rules**: Apply rules from `/rules` directory based on the task:
   - **Code Generation**: Use `secure-flow-create-secure-template.md` when creating new code templates
   - **Security Testing**: Use `secure-flow-create-security-tests.md` when generating security tests
   - **Threat Modeling**: Use `secure-flow-create-threat-model.md` when analyzing security threats
   - **Vulnerability Remediation**: Use `secure-flow-security-remediation.md` when fixing vulnerabilities
   - **API Security**: Use `secure-flow-review-api-auth.md` when reviewing API endpoints
   - **Compliance**: Use `secure-flow-validate-compliance.md` when validating compliance requirements
   - **Docker Security**: Use `secure-flow-harden-dockerfile-fips.md` when hardening containers
   - **CI/CD Security**: Use `secure-flow-gate-critical-vulns.md` when setting up security gates
   - **CISA KEV**: Use `secure-flow-fix-exploitable-vulns.md` when fixing exploited vulnerabilities
   - **AI Security**: Use `secure-flow-explain-ai-threats.md` when working with AI applications

3. **Proactive Security**: Don't just avoid vulnerabilities—actively implement secure patterns:
   - Use parameterized queries for database access
   - Validate and sanitize all user input
   - Apply least-privilege principles
   - Use modern cryptographic algorithms and libraries
   - Implement defense-in-depth strategies
   - Follow secure coding standards and best practices

## Secure Flow Security Rules
The security rules are available in the `rules/` directory.

### Usage Workflow
When generating or reviewing code, follow this workflow:

### 1. Initial Security Check
Before writing any code:
- Check: Will this handle credentials? → Apply secure credential management practices
- Check: What language/framework am I using? → Identify applicable security rules
- Check: What security domains are involved? → Load relevant rule files

### 2. Code Generation
While writing code:
- Apply secure-by-default patterns from relevant Secure Flow rules
- Add security-relevant comments explaining choices
- Follow framework-specific security best practices

### 3. Security Review
After writing code:
- Review against implementation checklists in each rule
- Verify no hardcoded credentials or secrets
- Validate that all applicable security rules have been followed
- Explain which security rules were applied
- Highlight security features implemented

## Available Workflows

### Code Generation & Templates
- **`secure-flow-create-secure-template`** - Generate secure code templates with security best practices built-in

### Security Testing
- **`secure-flow-create-security-tests`** - Create comprehensive security test cases and validation scripts

### Threat Analysis
- **`secure-flow-create-threat-model`** - Generate threat models for applications and systems using STRIDE methodology
- **`secure-flow-explain-ai-threats`** - Explain AI-specific security threats and mitigations

### Vulnerability Management
- **`secure-flow-security-remediation`** - Scan and fix high-impact vulnerabilities in the codebase
- **`secure-flow-fix-exploitable-vulns`** - Fix CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) found in your codebase
- **`secure-flow-gate-critical-vulns`** - Set up CI/CD checks to block critical vulnerabilities

### API & Service Security
- **`secure-flow-review-api-auth`** - Review and add authentication to API endpoints

### Compliance & Validation
- **`secure-flow-validate-compliance`** - Validate compliance with security frameworks and standards (SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, PCI DSS)

### Infrastructure Security
- **`secure-flow-harden-dockerfile-fips`** - Make Dockerfiles FIPS compliant with security hardening

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Applied secure-by-default patterns
- [ ] Validated input and output handling
- [ ] Verified authentication and authorization
- [ ] Checked for hardcoded credentials
- [ ] Applied framework-specific security best practices
