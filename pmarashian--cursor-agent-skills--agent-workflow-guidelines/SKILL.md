# Agent Workflow Guidelines

## Overview

Essential workflow guidelines to ensure efficient and reliable task execution. Follow these guidelines at the start of every task.

## High Priority Guidelines

### 1. Mandatory Skill Discovery

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW - Do not skip**:

1. Read task file (tasks/next_task.md)
2. Read progress file (tasks/progress.txt)
3. Call `search_skills("")` to list ALL available skills
4. Load relevant skills before starting implementation
5. Only then proceed with task work

**This is a blocking requirement** - the orchestrator will verify skill discovery was performed.

**Limiting search breadth**: If two skill searches return no relevant match, load the standard set for the task type (e.g. progress-tracking, pre-implementation-check) and proceed. Do not run additional broad queries (e.g. `search_skills("backend")`) repeatedly.

### 2. Port Detection Before Browser Connection

**Before opening browser for testing**:

1. Check `vite.config.ts` for `server.port` configuration
2. Check `package.json` for `PORT` environment variable
3. Check running processes or terminal output for actual port
4. Don't assume default ports (3000, 5173, etc.)
5. Use discovered port in browser commands

**If port detection fails**, try common ports sequentially with timeout.

### 3. Phaser Game Testing Methodology

**For Phaser game tasks**:
- **PRIMARY METHOD**: Use test seam commands (`window.__TEST__.commands`)
- Test seams are the **ONLY reliable way** to interact with Phaser canvas games
- DOM text search (`find text`) does **NOT work** with canvas-rendered text
- Keyboard simulation may not work - use test seam commands instead
- Always check for test seam availability before attempting DOM interactions

**If test seam sceneKey doesn't update on transitions**, use console logs as fallback verification.

### 4. Success Criteria Validation

**Before marking task complete**:

1. Verify **ALL success criteria** are met
2. **Don't mark complete** if progress shows 0/X criteria
3. For each criterion, document how it was verified
4. If browser testing fails, use fallback verification (console logs, code review)
5. Don't abandon testing on first failure - try alternative methods

**Completion Checklist**:
- [ ] All code changes implemented
- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes
- [ ] All success criteria verified
- [ ] Browser testing completed (for web/game tasks)
- [ ] Progress.txt updated
- [ ] Git commit with proper format

## Medium Priority Guidelines

### 5. TypeScript Compilation After Edits

**After making code edits**:

1. Run `npx tsc --noEmit` **immediately** to check for errors
2. Fix any compilation errors before proceeding
3. Don't wait until end of task to check compilation
4. Use smaller, incremental edits with verification

**Common errors to watch for**:
- Syntax errors (extra/missing braces)
- Method name mismatches (check actual method names in code)
- Type mismatches (verify interface compatibility)
- Import path errors (use relative paths)

### 6. Server Readiness Before Testing

**When starting dev server for testing**:

1. Start server with `npm run dev`
2. **Poll server health endpoint** until ready (don't use fixed sleep)
3. Check for "Local:" message in terminal output
4. Implement retry logic with timeout (max 30 seconds)
5. Only proceed with browser testing when server is confirmed ready

**Pattern**:
```bash
for i in {1..10}; do
  if curl -s http://localhost:PORT > /dev/null; then break; fi
  sleep 2
done
```

### 7. Timer Testing Efficiency

**For timer-related features**:
- **NEVER wait for natural countdown** (e.g., 60 seconds)
- Use test seam `setTimer(seconds)` to set timer directly
- Test boundary conditions (9, 10, 11 seconds for color changes)
- Add timer manipulation commands to test seam if not available
- Test both positive (timer works) and negative (timer expires) cases

**If test seam doesn't have timer commands**, add them before testing.

### 8. Error Handling Testing

**For error handling tasks**:
- Create test scenarios to force error conditions
- Add test seam commands to trigger errors (e.g., `forceMazeFailure()`)
- Test fallback behavior works correctly
- Verify console warnings/logs appear
- **Don't commit error handling code without testing error paths**

**If error condition is hard to trigger naturally**, create test mode or test seam command.

### 9. localStorage Key Verification

**Before using localStorage**:

1. Read the storage utility file to find the correct key name
2. Check for constants file with exported storage keys
3. Verify key format (camelCase, kebab-case, etc.) matches codebase
4. Don't assume naming conventions - check actual implementation

**This codebase uses camelCase**: `pixelGameSettings` (not `pixel-game-settings`)

### 10. Scene Transition Testing

**For scene transition testing**:
- Use test seam navigation commands when available
- Wait 1-2 seconds after transition before checking test seam
- Test seam sceneKey may lag - use console logs as fallback
- Don't rely solely on test seam sceneKey for verification
- Document scene navigation patterns in progress.txt

### 11. Browser Automation Timeout

**When browser automation commands hang or timeout**:

1. Set explicit timeout (default: 10 seconds)
2. If command exceeds timeout, try alternative method
3. Don't abandon testing - use fallback verification
4. Document timeout issues in progress.txt

**Fallback order**:
1. Test seam commands (for Phaser games)
2. Console log verification
3. Screenshot comparison
4. Code review + compilation check

### 12. Test Seam Command Discovery

**When testing Phaser games**:

1. First check source code for available test seam commands
2. Look for `window.__TEST__.commands` in scene files
3. Document discovered commands in progress.txt
4. Use test seam commands instead of DOM interactions
5. If command doesn't exist, add it to test seam before testing

## Low Priority Guidelines

### 13. Task Verification Before Starting

**Before implementing new features**:

1. Check if functionality already exists in codebase
2. Search for similar implementations
3. Verify task dependencies are complete
4. If feature exists, still verify it works correctly before marking complete

### 14. Progress Tracking Accuracy

**Note**: If progress tracking shows 0/X criteria despite completion:
- This is a **known orchestrator issue**
- Still verify all success criteria manually
- Don't let progress tracking prevent completion if criteria are met
- Document verification in progress.txt

### 15. Incremental Development Pattern

**For complex implementations**:
- Make smaller, incremental edits
- Verify after each logical change (compile, test)
- Build functionality layer by layer
- Don't make large changes without intermediate verification

**Pattern**: Edit → Compile → Test → Next Edit

## Workflow Summary

**Start of Task**:
1. Read task file and progress file
2. Call `search_skills("")` to discover all skills
3. Load relevant skills
4. Detect port before browser connection
5. Begin implementation

**During Implementation**:
- Run TypeScript compilation after each edit
- Use test seam commands for Phaser games
- Verify server readiness before testing
- Use timer manipulation, not natural countdown

**Before Completion**:
- Verify all success criteria
- Don't mark complete if 0/X criteria shown
- Use fallback verification if primary method fails
- Update progress.txt with learnings

### 16. Loop Detection and Prevention

**Monitor for identical tool calls in short timeframes**:

1. Track tool call patterns (same tool + same arguments)
2. If identical calls >10 times in 5 minutes, **STOP and reassess**
3. Check for progress metrics (files edited, tests run, errors fixed)
4. If no progress in 5 minutes, **intervene** (skip step, try alternative, or ask for help)

**Intervention triggers**:
- 10+ identical tool calls without progress
- No files edited in 5 minutes
- No tests run in 5 minutes
- Tool failures without fallback strategy

**Self-monitoring techniques**:
- Before each tool call, check: "Have I done this before?"
- Track progress: "What have I accomplished since last check?"
- Recognize stuck states: "Am I making progress or repeating?"

**When to skip vs. retry**:
- **Skip**: Tool consistently failing (API errors, network issues)
- **Retry**: Transient failures (timeouts, temporary errors)
- **Alternative**: Use different tool or approach if primary fails

### 17. Error Recovery Patterns

**For common error types**:

**Compilation errors**:
1. Read error message carefully
2. Fix syntax/type errors immediately
3. Re-run compilation check
4. If errors persist, check for missing imports or type definitions

**Test failures**:
1. Read test output to understand failure
2. Check if test is flaky or code is broken
3. Fix code if broken, skip test if flaky (document why)
4. Re-run tests to verify fix

**Tool failures**:
1. Check error message for root cause
2. If API key missing/invalid, skip tool usage (don't retry)
3. If network timeout, retry with exponential backoff (max 3 times)
4. If tool unavailable, use alternative approach
5. Document fallback strategy in progress.txt

**Retry patterns with limits**:
- **First retry**: 1 second delay
- **Second retry**: 2 second delay
- **Third retry**: 4 second delay
- **After 3 retries**: Skip and use alternative

**Graceful degradation**:
- If cost-incurring tool fails, use free alternative
- If browser testing fails, use code review + compilation check
- If test seam unavailable, use console logs + screenshots

### 18. Tool Usage Guardrails

**Before using cost-incurring tools** (ElevenLabs, PixelLab, etc.):

1. **Verify user explicitly requested** the tool usage
2. **Check if free alternative exists** (e.g., browser testing vs. TTS)
3. **Don't use for non-functional purposes** (testing, "thinking", exploration)
4. **Only use when necessary** for task completion

**Validation checklist**:
- [ ] User explicitly requested this tool?
- [ ] Is this necessary for task completion?
- [ ] Is there a free alternative?
- [ ] Is this for functional testing or just exploration?

**If validation fails**: Use alternative approach or skip tool usage.
