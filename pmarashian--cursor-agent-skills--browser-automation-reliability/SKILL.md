# Browser Automation Reliability

## Overview

Improve browser automation reliability with timeout handling, retry logic, and fallback strategies. Prevents hanging commands and abandoned testing.

## Timeout Handling

**Default timeout**: 10 seconds for all commands

**Configurable per command type**:
- Text search: 10s
- Element interaction: 10s
- Navigation: 15s
- Test seam commands: 5s

See `references/timeout-patterns.md` for detailed timeout configuration.

## Retry Logic

**Retry failed commands up to 3 times** with exponential backoff:
- First retry: 1 second delay
- Second retry: 2 second delay
- Third retry: 4 second delay

See `references/retry-strategies.md` for retry implementation patterns.

## Fallback Strategies

Use fallback methods in order when primary method fails:

1. **Primary**: Test seam commands** (for Phaser games)
2. **Secondary**: Console log verification
3. **Tertiary**: Screenshot comparison
4. **Last resort**: Code review + TypeScript compilation

See `references/fallback-order.md` for detailed fallback workflow.

## Phaser Game Testing

**PRIMARY METHOD**: Use test seam commands (`window.__TEST__.commands`)

**Why**: 
- DOM text search doesn't work with canvas-rendered text
- Keyboard events may not register with canvas focus
- Test seams are reliable and fast

**Pattern**:
```javascript
// Check for test seam first
if (window.__TEST__ && window.__TEST__.commands) {
  window.__TEST__.commands.clickStartGame();
} else {
  // Fallback to other methods
}
```

## Common Issues

- **Phaser canvas doesn't respond to DOM-based text search**
  - Solution: Use test seam commands
  
- **Keyboard events may not register with canvas focus**
  - Solution: Use test seam commands or verify focus first
  
- **Scene transitions require wait time**
  - Solution: Wait 1-2 seconds after transition
  
- **Test seam may lag behind actual scene state**
  - Solution: Use console logs as fallback

## Best Practices

1. **Always have a fallback verification method**
2. **Don't abandon testing on first failure**
3. **Use test seams as primary method for game testing**
4. **Document fallback strategies in progress.txt**
5. **Set explicit timeouts for all commands**

## Resources

- `references/timeout-patterns.md` - Configurable timeouts, exponential backoff
- `references/retry-strategies.md` - Retry logic with logging
- `references/fallback-order.md` - Primary → Secondary → Tertiary → Last resort
