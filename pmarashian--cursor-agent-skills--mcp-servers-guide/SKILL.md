# MCP Servers Guide

This skill provides comprehensive guidance for working with MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers, including PixelLab, ElevenLabs, and Screenshot Analyzer.

## Overview

MCP servers provide specialized capabilities:
- **PixelLab**: Pixel art asset generation (characters, animations, tilesets)
- **ElevenLabs**: Audio processing (TTS, STT, voice cloning, music)
- **Screenshot Analyzer**: Visual analysis of screenshots

## PixelLab MCP Server

### Tools Available

- `create_character` - Generate pixel art characters
- `animate_character` - Create character animations
- `get_character` - Check character status and retrieve
- `list_characters` - List all created characters
- `delete_character` - Delete a character
- `create_topdown_tileset` - Generate top-down game tilesets
- `get_topdown_tileset` - Check tileset status
- `create_sidescroller_tileset` - Generate sidescroller tilesets
- `get_sidescroller_tileset` - Check sidescroller tileset status
- `create_isometric_tile` - Generate isometric tiles
- `get_isometric_tile` - Check isometric tile status
- `create_map_object` - Generate map objects with transparent backgrounds

### Critical: Non-Blocking Operations & Asset Download Workflow

**All creation tools return immediately with job IDs** - they process in the background (2-5 minutes). You MUST follow this complete workflow:

1. **Create**: Submit request → Get job ID instantly
2. **Wait**: Poll status using the appropriate `get_*` tool (e.g., `get_character`, `get_topdown_tileset`) until status is "completed"
3. **Download**: Use the download URL from the completed asset to download the file(s)
4. **Save**: Save downloaded files to appropriate locations in the codebase (e.g., `assets/`, `public/`, `src/assets/`, `public/images/`)
5. **Use Local Files**: Reference the local file paths in your code - NEVER use external URLs

### Async Operation Best Practices

**Polling Strategy:**
- Use exponential backoff: 5s → 10s → 20s → 40s intervals
- Respect API-provided ETAs when available
- Don't poll more frequently than every 5 seconds
- Stop polling when status === "completed"

**Download Validation:**
- ALWAYS verify status === "completed" before download
- Handle HTTP 423 (Locked) errors gracefully
- Don't attempt download until resource is ready

**Parallel Work:**
- Use waiting time for parallel work:
  - Code integration
  - Documentation
  - Test preparation
- Don't wait idly for async operations

**Timeout Handling:**
- Set maximum timeout (e.g., 5 minutes for character generation)
- Log progress and ETA for transparency
- Handle timeout errors gracefully

### Mandatory: All Assets Must Be Local Files

- **PROHIBITED**: Using external URLs from PixelLab download links in your code
- **REQUIRED**: Download all asset files and save them to the codebase
- **REQUIRED**: Use local file paths when referencing assets in code
- Save assets to project-appropriate directories:
  - Web projects: `public/`, `public/images/`, `src/assets/`, or `assets/`
  - Game projects: `assets/`, `src/assets/`, or project-specific asset directories
  - Check the project structure to determine the appropriate location

### Example Complete Workflow

```
1. create_character(...) → Returns character_id
2. get_character(character_id) → Check status, repeat until "completed"
3. Extract download URL from completed character data
4. Download ZIP/image files using the download URL
5. Save to codebase: assets/characters/character_name.zip or assets/characters/character_name.png
6. Reference in code: "./assets/characters/character_name.png" (NOT the external URL)
```

### Skill Reference

**When working with PixelLab tools:**
- Load the `pixellab-mcp` skill for complete documentation: `load_skill("pixellab-mcp")`
- The skill includes full API reference, workflows, examples, and best practices

## ElevenLabs MCP Server

### Tools Available

- `text_to_speech` - Convert text to speech
- `speech_to_text` - Transcribe audio to text
- `text_to_sound_effects` - Generate sound effects from text
- `voice_clone` - Clone voices from audio samples
- `create_agent` - Create conversational AI agents
- `compose_music` - Generate music from prompts
- `isolate_audio` - Isolate audio from files
- And more audio processing tools

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: AUDIO TOOLS ONLY - DO NOT USE FOR VISUAL ANALYSIS

- **NEVER** use ElevenLabs tools for screenshot analysis or visual tasks
- **NEVER** use `text_to_speech()` to "verbalize" or "speak about" screenshot content
- For visual analysis of screenshots, use `analyze_screenshot()` from Screenshot Analyzer MCP Server
- ElevenLabs tools are for AUDIO processing only: converting text to speech, speech to text, voice cloning, etc.
- If the task involves analyzing what you see in an image/screenshot, this is a VISUAL task requiring Screenshot Analyzer tools

### Critical: Cost Warnings

**MANY TOOLS INCUR API COSTS** - Only use when explicitly requested by the user:

- Text-to-Speech (TTS) operations
- Speech-to-Text (STT) operations
- Voice cloning
- Agent creation and conversations
- Music composition
- Audio processing
- Outbound phone calls

**Always check with the user before using cost-incurring tools** unless they explicitly request them.

### Skill Reference

**When working with ElevenLabs tools:**
- Load the `elevenlabs-mcp` skill for complete documentation: `load_skill("elevenlabs-mcp")`
- The skill includes full API reference, workflows, examples, parameters, and best practices
- Key capabilities: TTS with multiple voices/models, STT with diarization, voice cloning, conversational AI agents with knowledge bases, music composition, audio processing

## Screenshot Analyzer MCP Server

### Tools Available

- `analyze_screenshot(screenshot, prompt)` - Analyze screenshots with AI vision

### Screenshot Analyzer Workflow

1. **Load Skill**: Load the `screenshot-analysis` skill for complete documentation: `load_skill("screenshot-analysis")`
2. **Analyze**: Use `analyze_screenshot()` with a captured screenshot and custom analysis prompts

### When to Use Screenshot Analyzer

**MANDATORY**: Load the `screenshot-analysis` skill first: `load_skill("screenshot-analysis")`

The skill includes:
- Full API reference
- Workflows and examples
- Prompt crafting best practices
- Common use cases
- Cost optimization
- Error handling
- Workflow patterns

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: DO NOT USE ELEVENLABS TOOLS FOR VISUAL ANALYSIS

- **NEVER** use `text_to_speech()` or any ElevenLabs tool for screenshot analysis
- Screenshot analysis requires `analyze_screenshot()` - this is a VISUAL task, not an AUDIO task
- If you need to analyze what you see in a screenshot, use `analyze_screenshot()` from Screenshot Analyzer
- Only use ElevenLabs tools (`text_to_speech()`, `speech_to_text()`, etc.) for actual AUDIO processing tasks

### Tool Selection Examples

**✅ CORRECT: Screenshot Analysis Tasks**
- "Analyze this screenshot to see if the login button is visible" → `analyze_screenshot()`
- "Check if the error message appears on the page" → `analyze_screenshot()`
- "Describe what you see in this game screenshot" → `analyze_screenshot()`
- "Verify the UI layout matches the design" → `analyze_screenshot()`

**❌ INCORRECT: Using Audio Tools for Visual Tasks**
- "Analyze this screenshot to see if the login button is visible" → ~~`text_to_speech()`~~
- "Check if the error message appears on the page" → ~~`text_to_speech()`~~
- "Describe what you see in this game screenshot" → ~~`text_to_speech()`~~

**✅ CORRECT: Audio Processing Tasks**
- "Convert this text to speech" → `text_to_speech()`
- "Transcribe this audio file" → `speech_to_text()`
- "Create sound effects for the game" → `text_to_sound_effects()`
- "Clone this voice for the character" → `voice_clone()`

## Tool Selection Decision Framework

### Domain Validation

| Task Type | Correct Tool | ❌ Never Use |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| Analyze screenshot content | `analyze_screenshot()` | `text_to_speech()` |
| Check if UI element is visible | `analyze_screenshot()` | `text_to_speech()` |
| Describe what you see in image | `analyze_screenshot()` | `text_to_speech()` |
| Convert text to audio | `text_to_speech()` | `analyze_screenshot()` |
| Transcribe speech | `speech_to_text()` | `analyze_screenshot()` |
| Generate sound effects | `text_to_sound_effects()` | `analyze_screenshot()` |

### Key Principles

1. **Visual tasks** → Screenshot Analyzer
2. **Audio tasks** → ElevenLabs
3. **NEVER cross domains**: Visual ≠ Audio
4. **Cost awareness**: ElevenLabs costs money - Screenshot Analyzer is free

## Integration with Other Skills

This skill works with:

- **tool-selection-framework**: For comprehensive tool selection guidance
- **screenshot-handling**: For proper screenshot file management
