# Interactive Prompts

When a workflow or verification step **requires the user to enter input at a prompt** (e.g. inquirer, readline, “Enter…”, “Select…”), the agent must **not** try to complete that step automatically (e.g. by piping input, simulating keystrokes, or assuming default choices).

## Rule

1. **Do not** run or “complete” steps that depend on interactive prompts.
2. **Do** stop before those steps and tell the user that **their input is needed** to finish.
3. **Do** give **clear, copy-pasteable instructions**: exact commands, what to choose at each prompt, and what to enter (e.g. report name, options).

## Example: Bundle Analyzer

The bundle analyzer (`tools/web-perf/bundle-analyzer`) prompts for:

- “Select a previous report to compare against (or Skip comparison)”
- “Enter a description for report N”

**Agent behavior:** Do not run the analyzer in the background expecting to satisfy prompts. Instead, after implementing changes, say that the user needs to run the analyzer and complete the prompts, and provide:

- The command to run (e.g. `cd tools/web-perf/bundle-analyzer && npm run analyze:web`).
- What to choose at each prompt (e.g. “Skip comparison” or which report to compare).
- What to enter for the report name (e.g. `post-measurement-fix`).
- What to check afterward (e.g. open the generated JSON and confirm `clientBundleSize` / `serverBundleSize` match total asset size).

## Summary

- **Don’t:** Pipe input, fake prompts, or mark interactive steps as “done” without user action.
- **Do:** State that the user must complete the prompt steps and give them the exact instructions to do it.
