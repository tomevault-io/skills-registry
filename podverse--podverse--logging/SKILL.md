# Log directory (LOG_DIR) — monorepo rules

## When to use

- Adding or changing log directory behavior, LOG_DIR env, or file logging in any app or package.

## Rules

1. **No default value for log directory** in any monorepo app. Config must use
   `process.env.LOG_DIR ?? ''` (or equivalent) so that when unset, the value is empty.

2. **When LOG_DIR is empty or unset**, logs are console-only (no file transport). This avoids
   bulky log files inside containers when no external volume is mounted.

3. **When LOG_DIR is set** (e.g. in Docker with a volume), use the path that matches the
   external volume mount (e.g. `/opt/logs` in workers local compose).

4. **Do not default to `./logs` or `/app/logs`** in app code; that causes file logging inside
   containers without a volume and can become bulky.
