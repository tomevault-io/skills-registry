## Integration with Other Components

### After Creating Issue
After using this skill to create an issue, use:
- **gh-issue-triage** skill to apply appropriate labels and priority
- **gh-wrangler** agent to create the issue via gh CLI

### Workflow
1. Use **gh-issue-templates** (this skill) to format the issue
2. Use **gh-issue-triage** to determine labels and priority
3. Use **gh-wrangler** to create the issue with `gh issue create`
4. Use **gh-issue-lifecycle** to manage state transitions
