# Git Worktree Guide

Quick reference and templates for git worktree workflows with AI metadata integration.

## Progressive Disclosure

### Initial Response

**Quick Overview:**

Git worktrees let you checkout multiple branches simultaneously in separate directories. Each worktree has AI metadata (`.ai-context.json`) that helps tools understand context.

**Quick Start:**
- Create worktree: `/working-tree:new <branch-name>`
- List worktrees: `/working-tree:list`
- Check status: `/working-tree:status`
- Remove worktree: `/working-tree:destroy <path>`
- Add metadata: `/working-tree:adopt`

**What would you like to know more about?**
1. Mode semantics (main, feature, bugfix, experiment, review)
2. Metadata file structure and templates
3. Comprehensive best practices guide
4. Strategic organization patterns

### On Request

Based on what you ask for, I can show you:

**Mode Semantics** → Detailed explanation of each mode
**Templates** → Ready-to-use metadata templates
**Best Practices** → Full reference guide (REFERENCE.md)
**Examples** → Specific workflow examples

## Mode Semantics Quick Reference

### main
**Purpose:** Stable, production-ready code
**Restrictions:** Minimal changes only, no experimentation
**Use For:** Hotfixes, urgent production changes, stable baseline
**AI Behavior:** Conservative suggestions, focus on safety

### feature
**Purpose:** Active development of new features
**Restrictions:** None, experimentation encouraged
**Use For:** New features, enhancements, active work
**AI Behavior:** Helpful, suggests improvements freely

### bugfix
**Purpose:** Isolated, surgical bug fixes
**Restrictions:** Minimal scope, no unrelated changes
**Use For:** Specific bug fixes, targeted corrections
**AI Behavior:** Focused on fix only, warns about scope creep

### experiment
**Purpose:** Prototypes, spikes, research
**Restrictions:** None, can be messy, expect to discard
**Use For:** POCs, trying new technologies, A/B testing
**AI Behavior:** Aggressive suggestions, OK with rough code

### review
**Purpose:** Code review, auditing, documentation
**Restrictions:** Read-only mindset, analysis only
**Use For:** PR review, security audits, documentation work
**AI Behavior:** Analytical, suggests improvements, no execution

## Metadata File Structure

### .ai-context.json

```json
{
  "worktree": "directory-name",
  "branch": "branch-name",
  "mode": "main|feature|bugfix|experiment|review",
  "created": "2025-11-23T12:34:56Z",
  "description": "Purpose of this worktree"
}
```

**Fields:**
- `worktree`: Directory name (not full path)
- `branch`: Git branch name
- `mode`: One of the 5 modes above
- `created`: ISO 8601 UTC timestamp
- `description`: Freeform text explaining purpose

### README.working-tree.md

Generated automatically with worktree details, mode semantics, and paths.

## Templates

### Available Templates

Located in `templates/` directory:
1. `ai-context.json.template` - Metadata file template with examples
2. `README.working-tree.template` - README template with placeholders

To view templates:
- Ask "show me the metadata template"
- Ask "show me the README template"

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Feature Development
```bash
/working-tree:new feature/user-auth --mode feature --description "Implement OAuth2"
```
Work in isolation, merge when ready.

### Pattern 2: Production Hotfix
```bash
/working-tree:new bugfix/critical-security-fix --mode bugfix
```
Quick surgical fix, minimizes risk.

### Pattern 3: Experimentation
```bash
/working-tree:new exp/try-new-framework --mode experiment
```
Prototype freely, discard if needed.

### Pattern 4: Code Review
```bash
/working-tree:new review/pr-123 --mode review --description "Review user auth PR"
```
Review without disrupting current work.

### Pattern 5: Internationalization
```bash
/working-tree:new i18n/zh-CN --description "Chinese Simplified translations"
/working-tree:new i18n/42-ja-JP --description "Japanese translations for issue #42"
```
Isolated i18n work for specific locale.

## Supporting Files

- **references/best-practices.md**: Comprehensive guide with detailed best practices, naming conventions, workflows, and advanced patterns
- **templates/ai-context.json.template**: Copy-paste template for manual metadata creation
- **templates/README.working-tree.template**: Template for worktree README

## Quick Tips

**DO:**
- Use descriptive branch names: `feature/user-dashboard`
- Add descriptions to worktrees: `--description "User settings page"`
- Run `/working-tree:list` regularly to see active work
- Choose appropriate mode for context

**DON'T:**
- Create worktree for same branch twice
- Use generic names: `test`, `temp`, `new`
- Use branch names that match existing project folders (e.g., `workflows`, `src`, `backend`)
- Forget to clean up: `/working-tree:destroy` when done
- Ignore uncommitted changes before destroying

## For More Detail

**Comprehensive Guide:**
Ask to see `references/best-practices.md` for:
- Detailed mode usage guidelines
- Naming conventions and patterns
- Multi-worktree organization strategies
- Troubleshooting common issues
- Team collaboration workflows
- CI/CD integration patterns

**Strategic Consulting:**
For complex worktree organization questions, invoke the `working-tree-consultant` agent:
- "Help me organize my worktrees"
- "Review my worktree strategy"
- "Migrate to worktree workflow"

## Examples

### Example 1: Quick Mode Check
```
User: What mode should I use for a prototype?

Skill: For prototypes, use **experiment** mode.

Experiment mode:
- No restrictions, can be messy
- AI will be aggressive with suggestions
- Expect to discard if prototype fails
- Good for POCs and spikes

Command:
/working-tree:new exp/prototype-name --mode experiment --description "Testing new approach"
```

### Example 2: Template Request
```
User: Show me the metadata template

Skill: Here's the .ai-context.json template:

[Shows content of templates/ai-context.json.template]

You can create this manually or use:
- /working-tree:new to auto-generate when creating
- /working-tree:adopt to auto-generate for existing worktree
```

### Example 3: Best Practices Request
```
User: What are worktree best practices?

Skill: **Quick Best Practices:**

1. **Naming**: Use clear, structured names (myapp-feature-user-auth)
2. **Modes**: Choose mode based on work type (see mode semantics above)
3. **Cleanup**: Remove worktrees when done (/working-tree:destroy)
4. **Metadata**: Always add descriptions
5. **Organization**: One feature = one worktree
