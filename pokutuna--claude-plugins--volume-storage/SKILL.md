# RunPod Volume Storage

Manage files on RunPod Network Volume via `aws s3`.

## Prerequisites

- `aws` CLI with `[profile runpod]` in `~/.aws/config`
- `runpod.toml` with `datacenter_id` and `network_volume_id`

## Usage

Build `s3://` paths using `network_volume_id` from `runpod.toml`. Pod's `/workspace/` maps to `s3://VOLUME_ID/`.

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/volume-storage/scripts/volume_storage.sh ls s3://VOLUME_ID/
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/volume-storage/scripts/volume_storage.sh cp s3://VOLUME_ID/data/file.json ./file.json
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/volume-storage/scripts/volume_storage.sh sync ./output/ s3://VOLUME_ID/output/
```

All `aws s3` subcommands and options are passed through.

## Notes

- `--recursive` and `sync` do not work reliably. Use `ls` to navigate directories and locate files before copying.
