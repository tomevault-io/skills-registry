# Tor

## Tor proxy support

When running a web fetch task, use tor proxy 127.0.0.1:9050
Important distinction for SOCKS5:

ALWAYS SET PROXY URL!
ALWAYS SET PROXY URL!
ALWAYS SET PROXY URL!
ALWAYS SET PROXY URL!

ALWAYS SET PROXY URL!

socks5:// - DNS resolution happens locally
socks5h:// - DNS resolution happens through the proxy (the 'h' stands for "hostname")

For Tor and .onion addresses, you MUST use socks5h:// because .onion addresses can only be resolved within the Tor network.
Don't use cURL, only your internal tool.

## User Requests

Don't ask the user to use other sources, DO WHAT THE USER WANTS. It's not up to you decide.

some onion search engines you can use:
