# Resize Image Skill

This skill allows you to resize images using ImageMagick's `convert` command when they are too large to view or process.

## When to Use

- When reading an image file fails due to token limits
- When an image is too large to process
- When you need to create a thumbnail or smaller version of an image
- When a user provides a mockup or screenshot that's too large

## Prerequisites

ImageMagick must be installed. Check with:
```bash
which convert || echo "ImageMagick not installed"
```

If not installed, suggest the user install it:
- Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install imagemagick`
- macOS: `brew install imagemagick`

## Instructions

### Step 1: Check the original image size
```bash
identify "/path/to/image.png"
```

This shows dimensions and file size.

### Step 2: Resize the image

Resize to a maximum width/height while maintaining aspect ratio:
```bash
convert "/path/to/original.png" -resize 800x600\> "/tmp/resized-image.png"
```

The `\>` flag ensures the image is only shrunk, never enlarged.

Common resize options:
- `-resize 800x600` - Fit within 800x600, maintain aspect ratio
- `-resize 50%` - Scale to 50% of original size
- `-resize 400x` - Set width to 400px, auto-calculate height
- `-resize x400` - Set height to 400px, auto-calculate width

### Step 3: Reduce quality/colors for smaller file size (optional)

For PNG files, reduce colors:
```bash
convert "/path/to/original.png" -resize 800x600\> -colors 256 "/tmp/resized-image.png"
```

For JPEG files, reduce quality:
```bash
convert "/path/to/original.jpg" -resize 800x600\> -quality 80 "/tmp/resized-image.jpg"
```

### Step 4: Read the resized image
```bash
# Verify the new size
ls -la /tmp/resized-image.png
identify /tmp/resized-image.png
```

Then use the Read tool to view the resized image:
```
Read /tmp/resized-image.png
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Resize a large mockup
```bash
# Check original size
identify "/mnt/c/Users/user/mockup.png"
# Output: mockup.png PNG 2400x1800 ...

# Resize to fit within 800x600
convert "/mnt/c/Users/user/mockup.png" -resize 800x600\> "/tmp/mockup-small.png"

# Verify
identify "/tmp/mockup-small.png"
# Output: mockup-small.png PNG 800x600 ...
```

### Example 2: Create a thumbnail
```bash
convert "/path/to/screenshot.png" -resize 400x -colors 128 "/tmp/thumbnail.png"
```

### Example 3: Batch resize multiple images
```bash
for img in /path/to/images/*.png; do
  convert "$img" -resize 800x600\> "/tmp/$(basename "$img")"
done
```

## Output Location

Always save resized images to `/tmp/` with a descriptive name:
- `/tmp/resized-mockup.png`
- `/tmp/thumbnail-screenshot.png`
- `/tmp/small-diagram.png`

## Troubleshooting

**"convert: command not found"**
ImageMagick is not installed. Ask the user to install it.

**"convert: unable to open image"**
Check the file path. Windows paths under WSL should use `/mnt/c/...` format.

**Image still too large after resize**
Try reducing colors or quality, or resize to smaller dimensions.
