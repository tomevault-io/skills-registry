description: Self-contained test automation — invoke directly, do not decompose. End-to-end integration test that assembles a fixture, deploys to Cloudflare (with auto-provisioned Connect), and presents a live URL for browser verification. Use when testing the plugin, running E2E tests, verifying deployment works, or checking that templates assemble correctly. Use when this capability is needed.

> **Plan mode**: If you are planning work, this entire skill is ONE plan step: "Invoke /vibes:test". Do not decompose the steps below into separate plan tasks.

## Integration Test Skill

Orchestrates the full test pipeline: credentials → fixture assembly → Cloudflare deploy (with auto-provisioned Connect) → live URL → unit tests.

**Working directory:** `test-vibes/` (gitignored, persists across runs)

### Phase 1: Credentials

Check if `test-vibes/.env` exists and has OIDC credentials.

```bash
# From the plugin root
cat test-vibes/.env 2>/dev/null
```

**If the file exists and contains `VITE_OIDC_AUTHORITY`:**

```
AskUserQuestion:
  Question: "Reuse existing test credentials? (OIDC authority: https://...)"
  Header: "Credentials"
  Options:
  - Label: "Yes, reuse"
    Description: "Use the OIDC credentials already in test-vibes/.env"
  - Label: "No, enter new credentials"
    Description: "I want to use different OIDC credentials"
```

**If the file doesn't exist or credentials are missing, or user wants new ones:**

```
AskUserQuestion:
  Question: "Paste your OIDC Authority URL (e.g., https://studio.exe.xyz/auth)"
  Header: "OIDC Authority"
  Options:
  - Label: "I need to set up OIDC first"
    Description: "I'll configure Pocket ID and come back"
```

If they need to set up OIDC, tell them:
> You need a Pocket ID instance for authentication. Connect is auto-provisioned on first deploy -- you just need the OIDC Authority URL and Client ID from your Pocket ID configuration.

Then ask for the client ID:

```
AskUserQuestion:
  Question: "Paste your OIDC Client ID"
  Header: "OIDC Client ID"
```

Write `test-vibes/.env`:
```
VITE_OIDC_AUTHORITY=<authority-url>
VITE_OIDC_CLIENT_ID=<client-id>
```

### Phase 2: Connect (Auto-Provisioned)

Connect is automatically provisioned on first Cloudflare deploy -- no manual setup needed.
The `deploy-cloudflare.js` script handles R2 bucket, D1 databases, and cloud backend
Worker provisioning via alchemy. Subsequent deploys skip Connect setup.

Proceed directly to fixture selection.

### Phase 3: Fixture Selection

```
AskUserQuestion:
  Question: "Which fixture to test?"
  Header: "Fixture"
  Options:
  - Label: "basic (Recommended)"
    Description: "TinyBase data operations with React singleton — the standard integration test"
  - Label: "minimal"
    Description: "Template + Babel + import map only — fastest, no data layer"
  - Label: "sell-ready"
    Description: "useTenant() + multi-tenant routing — tests sell assembly path"
  - Label: "ai-proxy"
    Description: "/api/ai/chat endpoint + CORS — requires OpenRouter key"
```

**For sell-ready fixture:** Check `test-vibes/.env` for a cached admin user ID from a previous run:

```bash
grep OIDC_ADMIN_USER_ID test-vibes/.env 2>/dev/null
```

**If found**, offer to reuse it (mask the middle of the value in the prompt, e.g., `user_37ici...ohcY`):

```
AskUserQuestion:
  Question: "Reuse stored admin user ID? (user_37ici...ohcY)"
  Header: "Admin ID"
  Options:
  - Label: "Yes, reuse"
    Description: "Use the cached user ID from test-vibes/.env"
  - Label: "Skip admin"
    Description: "Deploy without admin — you can set it up after deploy"
```

If "Yes, reuse": use the stored value in Phase 4 assembly.
If "Skip admin": omit `--admin-ids` in Phase 4. Admin setup will be offered post-deploy in Phase 5.5.

**If not found:** No prompt needed. Admin will be set up post-deploy in Phase 5.5 after the user has a chance to sign up on the live app.

### Phase 3.5: Sell Configuration (sell-ready only)

**Condition:** Only runs when the user selected `sell-ready` in Phase 3.

**Ask billing mode:**

```
AskUserQuestion:
  Question: "Which billing mode should this sell test use?"
  Header: "Billing"
  Options:
  - Label: "Free (billing off)"
    Description: "Claims work without payment — tests auth + tenant routing only"
  - Label: "Billing required"
    Description: "Claims require subscription — tests auth gate flow (Stripe billing is phase 2)"
```

**If "Free":** Store `BILLING_MODE=off` in `test-vibes/.env`. Skip webhook setup. Proceed to Phase 4.

**If "Billing required":** Store `BILLING_MODE=required` in `test-vibes/.env`. Note that Stripe billing integration is phase 2, so the paywall will be a placeholder.

Proceed to Phase 4.

### Phase 4: Assembly

Copy the selected fixture and assemble:

```bash
# Copy fixture to working directory
cp scripts/__tests__/fixtures/<fixture>.jsx test-vibes/app.jsx

# Source env for assembly
set -a && source test-vibes/.env && set +a
```

**For sell-ready fixture:**
```bash
bun scripts/assemble-sell.js test-vibes/app.jsx test-vibes/index.html \
  --domain vibes-test.<account>.workers.dev \
  --admin-ids '["<admin-user-id>"]'  # read OIDC_ADMIN_USER_ID from test-vibes/.env
```
If admin was skipped, omit `--admin-ids`. The `--domain` flag is always required.

**For all other fixtures:**
```bash
bun scripts/assemble.js test-vibes/app.jsx test-vibes/index.html
```

**Validate the output** (same checks as the vitest suite):
1. File exists and is non-empty
2. No `__PLACEHOLDER__` strings remain
3. Import map `<script type="importmap">` is present
4. `<script type="text/babel">` contains the fixture code
5. For sell-ready: `getRouteInfo` function is present

If any check fails, report the error, then ask:

```
AskUserQuestion:
  Question: "What next?"
  Header: "Next"
  Options:
  - Label: "Test another fixture"
    Description: "Go back to Phase 3 and pick a different fixture"
  - Label: "End test session"
    Description: "Clean up artifacts and finish"
```

If "Test another fixture": go to Phase 3.
If "End test session": go to Phase 11.

### Phase 5: Deploy to Cloudflare

**For ai-proxy fixture:** Check `~/.vibes/.env` for a cached OpenRouter key first:

```bash
grep OPENROUTER_API_KEY ~/.vibes/.env 2>/dev/null
```

**If found**, offer to reuse it (mask the key, e.g., `sk-or-v1-...a3b2`):

```
AskUserQuestion:
  Question: "Reuse stored OpenRouter API key? (sk-or-v1-...a3b2)"
  Header: "AI Key"
  Options:
  - Label: "Yes, reuse"
    Description: "Use the cached key from ~/.vibes/.env"
  - Label: "Enter new"
    Description: "I'll paste a different key"
  - Label: "Skip AI proxy"
    Description: "Deploy without AI endpoint"
```

If "Yes, reuse": use the stored value. If "Enter new": collect via the prompt below, then update `~/.vibes/.env`.

**If not found** (or user chose "Enter new"):

```
AskUserQuestion:
  Question: "Paste your OpenRouter API key for the AI proxy"
  Header: "AI Key"
  Options:
  - Label: "Skip AI proxy"
    Description: "Deploy without AI endpoint"
```

After collecting a new key, offer to save it:

```
AskUserQuestion:
  Question: "Save this OpenRouter key to ~/.vibes/.env for future projects?"
  Header: "Cache"
  Options:
  - Label: "Yes, save"
    Description: "Cache the key so you don't have to paste it again"
  - Label: "No, skip"
    Description: "Use for this session only"
```

If "Yes, save":
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.vibes
grep -q OPENROUTER_API_KEY ~/.vibes/.env 2>/dev/null && \
  sed -i '' 's/^OPENROUTER_API_KEY=.*/OPENROUTER_API_KEY=<new>/' ~/.vibes/.env || \
  echo "OPENROUTER_API_KEY=<new>" >> ~/.vibes/.env
```

Run the deploy:

```bash
bun scripts/deploy-cloudflare.js --name vibes-test --file test-vibes/index.html
```

**For sell-ready fixture:** Pass `--env-dir` to auto-detect OIDC config, and pass billing mode from `test-vibes/.env`:
```bash
bun scripts/deploy-cloudflare.js --name vibes-test --file test-vibes/index.html \
  --env-dir test-vibes \
  --billing-mode $BILLING_MODE
```
Read `BILLING_MODE` from `test-vibes/.env`. The `--env-dir` flag auto-detects `VITE_OIDC_AUTHORITY` from `.env` (fetches OIDC discovery, gets PEM key, sets `OIDC_PEM_PUBLIC_KEY` and `PERMITTED_ORIGINS` as Worker secrets). `--billing-mode` patches the `[vars]` in `wrangler.toml` before deploy.

**For ai-proxy with key:**
```bash
bun scripts/deploy-cloudflare.js --name vibes-test --file test-vibes/index.html --ai-key <key>
```

### Phase 5.5: Admin Setup (sell-ready only)

**Condition:** Only runs for the sell-ready fixture AND admin is not yet configured (no cached ID was reused in Phase 3).

After deploy, guide the user through post-deploy admin setup:

1. Tell the user the app is live and they can now sign up:

```
Your app is deployed! To configure admin access, first create an account:
  Sign up here: https://vibes-test.<account>.workers.dev?subdomain=test

After signing up, we'll grab your User ID from Pocket ID.
```

2. Ask if they've signed up:

```
AskUserQuestion:
  Question: "Have you completed signup on the deployed app?"
  Header: "Signup"
  Options:
  - Label: "Yes, signed up"
    Description: "I've created my account and I'm ready to get my User ID"
  - Label: "Skip admin setup"
    Description: "Continue without admin access"
```

If "Skip admin setup": proceed to Phase 6 without admin configured.

3. Guide to finding User ID:

```
Now grab your User ID:
  1. Check the Pocket ID admin panel or your app's user profile
  2. Find and copy your User ID (starts with user_)
```

4. Collect the User ID:

```
AskUserQuestion:
  Question: "Paste your User ID (starts with user_)"
  Header: "Admin ID"
  Options:
  - Label: "I need help finding it"
    Description: "Show me where to find the User ID in Pocket ID"
  - Label: "Skip admin setup"
    Description: "Continue without admin access"
```

Validate the input starts with `user_`. If not, ask again.

5. Save to `test-vibes/.env`:

```bash
grep -q OIDC_ADMIN_USER_ID test-vibes/.env 2>/dev/null && \
  sed -i '' 's/^OIDC_ADMIN_USER_ID=.*/OIDC_ADMIN_USER_ID=<userId>/' test-vibes/.env || \
  echo "OIDC_ADMIN_USER_ID=<userId>" >> test-vibes/.env
```

6. Re-assemble with admin configured:

```bash
set -a && source test-vibes/.env && set +a

bun scripts/assemble-sell.js test-vibes/app.jsx test-vibes/index.html \
  --domain vibes-test.<account>.workers.dev \
  --admin-ids '["<userId>"]'
```

7. Re-deploy:

```bash
bun scripts/deploy-cloudflare.js --name vibes-test --file test-vibes/index.html \
  --env-dir test-vibes \
  --billing-mode $BILLING_MODE
```

8. Confirm:

```
Admin access configured! The admin dashboard at ?subdomain=admin should now work for your account.
```

Proceed to Phase 6.

### Phase 6: Present URL

Print the live URL and what to check:

**For minimal / basic:**
```
Deployed! Open in your browser:
  https://vibes-test.<account>.workers.dev

What to verify:
- Page loads without console errors
- (basic) TinyBase data operations work — add, edit, delete items
- Settings gear icon opens the menu
```

**For sell-ready:**
```
Deployed! Open these URLs:
  Landing:  https://vibes-test.<account>.workers.dev
  Tenant:   https://vibes-test.<account>.workers.dev?subdomain=test
  Admin:    https://vibes-test.<account>.workers.dev?subdomain=admin

What to verify:
- Landing page shows pricing/marketing content
- Claim a subdomain — should succeed (tests /claim + JWT auth)
- Tenant URL shows auth gate (OIDC sign-in via Pocket ID)
- Admin URL shows admin dashboard (if admin was configured in Phase 3 or 5.5)
- Admin URL shows "Admin Access Required" (if admin setup was skipped)
```

**For ai-proxy:**
```
Deployed! Open in your browser:
  https://vibes-test.<account>.workers.dev

What to verify:
- App loads and renders
- AI chat feature works (sends to /api/ai/chat)
- Check Network tab: requests go to OpenRouter via proxy
```

Then ask:

```
AskUserQuestion:
  Question: "How does it look?"
  Header: "Result"
  Options:
  - Label: "Working"
    Description: "Everything renders correctly"
  - Label: "Has issues"
    Description: "Something isn't right — I'll describe it"
```

**If "Working":**

Print a summary table:

```
| Phase       | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| Credentials | ✓      |
| Assembly    | ✓ <fixture>.jsx → index.html |
| Cloudflare  | ✓ <url> (Connect auto-provisioned) |
| Browser     | ✓ User confirmed working |
```

```
AskUserQuestion:
  Question: "What next?"
  Header: "Next"
  Options:
  - Label: "Test another fixture"
    Description: "Go back to Phase 3 and pick a different fixture"
  - Label: "End test session"
    Description: "Clean up artifacts and finish"
```

If "Test another fixture": go to Phase 3.
If "End test session": go to Phase 11.

**If "Has issues":** Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/diagnostics.md` for the full diagnosis flow (Phases 7-10: diagnosis tables, root cause classification, fix-and-verify loop, resolution summary). Then return here for Phase 11.

---

### Phase 11: Unit & Integration Tests

Run the vitest suite to confirm plugin source is healthy. Especially important after any fixes applied in Phase 9.

```bash
cd scripts && npm test
```

**If all tests pass:** Print the count (e.g. "429 tests passed") and proceed to cleanup.

**If any tests fail:** Show the failure output and ask:

```
AskUserQuestion:
  Question: "Unit/integration tests failed. Fix before finishing?"
  Header: "Tests"
  Options:
  - Label: "Yes, fix them"
    Description: "Investigate and fix the failing tests"
  - Label: "Skip"
    Description: "Finish the session anyway"
```

If "Yes, fix them": diagnose and fix the failures, re-run `npm test`, loop until green.

### Phase 12: Session Cleanup

Triggered after Phase 11 completes or when user selects "End test session" from any "What next?" prompt.

Clean up test artifacts while preserving reusable credentials:

```bash
# Clean test artifacts, preserve .env
cd test-vibes && find . -maxdepth 1 ! -name '.' ! -name '.env' -exec rm -rf {} +
```

Print:

```
Test session complete.
  Cleaned: test-vibes/ artifacts
  Preserved: .env (reusable next session)
```
