# bkend-security: Security Policies & Encryption Expert Skill

## 1. Multi-Layer Security Model

bkend.ai implements a defense-in-depth security architecture with multiple layers of protection. Each layer operates independently so that a breach in one layer does not compromise the entire system.

```
Request Flow:

  Client Request
       |
       v
  [ TLS 1.2+ ]              Layer 1: Transport encryption
       |
       v
  [ API Key Validation ]     Layer 2: Identify client type (Public/Secret)
       |
       v
  [ JWT Authentication ]     Layer 3: Verify user identity and session
       |
       v
  [ Row Level Security ]     Layer 4: Enforce data access policies per role
       |
       v
  [ AES-256-GCM ]           Layer 5: Data encrypted at rest
       |
       v
  [ Database ]               Secured data store
```

### Layer Summary

| Layer | Technology        | Purpose                              | Applied At       |
|-------|-------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------|
| 1     | TLS 1.2+          | Encrypt data in transit              | Network edge     |
| 2     | API Keys          | Identify and authorize client apps   | API gateway      |
| 3     | JWT               | Authenticate individual users        | Auth middleware   |
| 4     | RLS               | Enforce row-level data access        | Query engine     |
| 5     | AES-256-GCM       | Encrypt data at rest                 | Storage layer    |

---

## 2. API Keys

### 2.1 Key Format

All bkend.ai API keys follow a consistent format:

```
ak_<64 hexadecimal characters>
```

- **Prefix:** `ak_` identifies the string as a bkend.ai API key
- **Body:** 64 hex characters (256 bits of entropy)
- **Total length:** 67 characters

### 2.2 Key Storage

API keys are stored as **SHA-256 one-way hashes**. The original key value is never stored on bkend.ai servers.

```
Original key:  ak_a1b2c3d4e5f6...   (shown once at creation)
Stored hash:   sha256(ak_a1b2...)  = 9f86d081884c7d659a2feaa...
```

**Implications:**
- Lost keys cannot be recovered; a new key must be generated
- Key validation compares the SHA-256 hash of the submitted key against the stored hash
- Even if the database is compromised, original keys cannot be derived from the hashes

### 2.3 Key Types: Public vs Secret

bkend.ai provides two types of API keys with different security properties.

| Property            | Public Key                          | Secret Key                           |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Exposure**        | Safe to expose in client-side code  | Must never be exposed to clients     |
| **RLS Enforcement** | Always enforced                     | Bypasses RLS (full access)           |
| **Use Case**        | Web apps, mobile apps, SPAs         | Server-side code, admin scripts, CI/CD |
| **Permissions**     | Limited by RLS role of the user     | Full read/write access to all data   |
| **Rate Limit**      | 100 requests/minute                 | 1000 requests/minute                 |
| **CORS**            | Restricted to allowed domains       | Not subject to CORS                  |

### 2.4 Key Creation

API keys can only be created through the bkend.ai Console:

1. Navigate to **Project Settings** > **API Keys**
2. Click **Create New Key**
3. Select key type: **Public** or **Secret**
4. Optionally set an expiration date
5. Click **Generate**
6. **Copy the key immediately** -- it is displayed only once

**Warning:** After closing the creation dialog, the key value can never be retrieved again. Store it securely in your environment variables or secret manager.

### 2.5 Key Usage in Requests

Include the API key in the `X-API-Key` header:

```http
GET /api/v1/tables/users/data
Host: api.bkend.ai
X-API-Key: ak_a1b2c3d4e5f6...
Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
```

- **Public Key** requests must also include a valid JWT token (from user authentication)
- **Secret Key** requests can optionally include a JWT token; without one, the request runs with full admin access

## 3. Row Level Security (RLS)

### 3.1 Overview

Row Level Security (RLS) controls which records a user can access based on their role. RLS policies are defined per table, per operation (read, create, update, delete) in the bkend.ai Console.

### 3.2 Four Roles

| Role      | Description                                  | Data Access                             | Typical Use                    |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `admin`   | Full access to all data                      | All records, all operations             | Admin dashboards, CMS          |
| `user`    | Access to own data via `createdBy` match     | Records where `createdBy == userId`     | User profiles, user content    |
| `guest`   | Access to public data only                   | Records where `isPublic == true`        | Public pages, catalogs         |
| `self`    | Access to own profile record only            | Single record where `_id == userId`     | Profile viewing/editing        |

### 3.3 Role Resolution

The user's role is determined from the JWT token at request time:

```
JWT Payload:
{
  "sub": "user_abc123",
  "role": "user",
  "orgId": "org_xyz",
  "iat": 1700000000,
  "exp": 1700003600
}
```

- The `role` field in the JWT determines which RLS policies are applied
- If no JWT is provided (Secret Key only), the request operates as `admin`
- Roles are assigned during user registration or by an admin via the Console

### 3.4 RLS Policy Configuration

RLS policies are configured per table in the bkend.ai Console:

1. Navigate to **Tables** > select a table > **Security** tab
2. For each operation (Read, Create, Update, Delete), configure access per role:

**Example: `posts` Table**

| Operation | admin | user                     | guest              | self |
|-----------|-------|--------------------------|--------------------|----- |
| Read      | All   | Own + public             | Public only        | N/A  |
| Create    | All   | Own only                 | Denied             | N/A  |
| Update    | All   | Own only (`createdBy`)   | Denied             | N/A  |
| Delete    | All   | Own only (`createdBy`)   | Denied             | N/A  |

**Example: `profiles` Table**

| Operation | admin | user   | guest       | self          |
|-----------|-------|--------|-------------|---------------|
| Read      | All   | All    | Public only | Own only      |
| Create    | All   | Denied | Denied      | Own only      |
| Update    | All   | Denied | Denied      | Own only      |
| Delete    | All   | Denied | Denied      | Denied        |

### 3.5 RLS Filter Injection

When RLS is active, the system automatically injects filter conditions into database queries:

```
User request:       GET /api/v1/tables/posts/data
User role:          user
User ID:            user_abc123

Injected filter:    { "createdBy": "user_abc123" }
Effective query:    db.posts.find({ ...userFilter, "createdBy": "user_abc123" })
```

This injection is transparent to the client and cannot be overridden.

### 3.6 RLS with Secret Key

When a request uses a Secret Key without a JWT token:
- RLS is **completely bypassed**
- The request has full admin-level access to all data
- This is by design for server-side administration scripts

**Important:** Never use a Secret Key in client-side code. Use Public Key + JWT for all client-facing applications.

## 4. Data Encryption

### 4.1 At Rest

| Component         | Encryption Method         | Key Management                     |
|--------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------|
| MongoDB Atlas      | AES-256 encryption        | AWS KMS managed keys               |
| S3 Storage         | Server-side encryption    | AWS SSE-S3 managed keys            |
| Backups            | AES-256 encryption        | Separate backup encryption keys    |

All data stored in bkend.ai infrastructure is encrypted at rest using AES-256. Encryption keys are managed through AWS Key Management Service (KMS) and are rotated automatically.

### 4.2 In Transit

| Property              | Value                          |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------|
| Minimum TLS Version   | TLS 1.2                       |
| Preferred TLS Version | TLS 1.3                       |
| HSTS                  | Enabled (`max-age=31536000`)  |
| Certificate Authority | Let's Encrypt / AWS ACM       |
| Cipher Suites         | Modern suites only (no RC4, 3DES, SHA-1) |

All API communication is encrypted with TLS 1.2 or higher. HTTP requests are automatically redirected to HTTPS. HSTS headers ensure browsers always use HTTPS.

### 4.3 Password Hashing

User passwords are hashed using **Argon2id**, the winner of the Password Hashing Competition and recommended by OWASP.

| Parameter        | Value       | Rationale                            |
|------------------|-------------|--------------------------------------|
| Algorithm        | Argon2id    | Hybrid resistance to side-channel and GPU attacks |
| Memory Cost      | 64 MiB      | High memory usage deters GPU cracking |
| Iterations       | 3           | Balanced computation time            |
| Parallelism      | 4 threads   | Utilizes multi-core CPUs             |
| Salt Length       | 16 bytes    | Unique per password                  |
| Hash Length       | 32 bytes    | 256-bit output                       |

**Why Argon2id:**
- Memory-hard: requires significant RAM, making GPU/ASIC attacks expensive
- Hybrid variant: combines Argon2i (side-channel resistance) and Argon2d (GPU resistance)
- Configurable parameters allow tuning for the target hardware

### 4.4 API Key Hashing

API keys are hashed using **SHA-256** one-way hash:

```
Input:  ak_a1b2c3d4e5f6...  (67 characters)
Output: 9f86d081884c7d659a2feaa0c55ad015a3bf4f1b2b0b822cd15d6c15b0f00a08
```

- One-way: the original key cannot be derived from the hash
- Deterministic: the same key always produces the same hash (for validation)
- Fast: efficient for per-request validation

## 5. Environment Security

### 5.1 Separate Keys per Environment

Each environment (dev, staging, prod) has its own set of API keys:

```
Project: my-app
├── dev
│   ├── Public Key:  ak_dev_...
│   └── Secret Key:  ak_dev_secret_...
├── staging
│   ├── Public Key:  ak_staging_...
│   └── Secret Key:  ak_staging_secret_...
└── prod
    ├── Public Key:  ak_prod_...
    └── Secret Key:  ak_prod_secret_...
```

Keys from one environment cannot access data in another environment. This prevents accidental data leaks between environments.

### 5.2 Environment Variable Management

Store API keys and sensitive configuration in environment variables, never in source code:

```bash
# .env.development
BKEND_API_URL=https://api-client.bkend.ai
BKEND_PUBLIC_KEY=ak_dev_...
BKEND_SECRET_KEY=ak_dev_secret_...

# .env.production
BKEND_API_URL=https://api-client.bkend.ai
BKEND_PUBLIC_KEY=ak_prod_...
BKEND_SECRET_KEY=ak_prod_secret_...
```

**Rules:**
- Add `.env*` to `.gitignore` to prevent committing secrets (Note: In Gemini CLI v0.36.0+, `.gitignore` is write-protected by sandbox governance. Add entries manually.)
- Use a secret manager (AWS Secrets Manager, Vault, etc.) for production deployments
- Never log environment variables containing keys or tokens

### 5.3 Domain Allowlist for CORS

Configure allowed domains per environment to prevent unauthorized cross-origin requests:

```
dev:      http://localhost:3000, http://localhost:5173
staging:  https://staging.myapp.com
prod:     https://myapp.com, https://www.myapp.com
```

- Only Public Key requests are subject to CORS restrictions
- Secret Key requests bypass CORS (server-to-server only)
- Wildcard domains (`*.myapp.com`) are supported but not recommended for production

---

## 6. Security Best Practices

### 1. Never Expose Secret Key in Client Code

The Secret Key bypasses all RLS policies and grants full admin access. It must only be used in server-side code.

```
WRONG:
  <script>
    const API_KEY = "ak_secret_...";  // Visible to anyone inspecting the page
  </script>

RIGHT:
  // Server-side only (Node.js, Python, etc.)
  const API_KEY = process.env.BKEND_SECRET_KEY;
```

### 2. Use httpOnly Cookies for Token Storage

Store JWT tokens in httpOnly cookies to prevent XSS attacks from accessing them:

```http
Set-Cookie: token=eyJhbGc...; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Strict; Path=/
```

- `HttpOnly`: prevents JavaScript access to the cookie
- `Secure`: cookie is only sent over HTTPS
- `SameSite=Strict`: prevents CSRF attacks

**Avoid:** storing tokens in `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` where they are accessible to JavaScript.

### 3. Enable MFA for Admin Accounts

Multi-Factor Authentication adds a second verification step for admin users:

1. Navigate to **Organization Settings** > **Security**
2. Enable **Require MFA for admins**
3. Admin users will be prompted to set up TOTP (authenticator app) on next login

### 4. Set Appropriate RLS Policies per Table

Review and configure RLS policies for every table:

- Use the principle of least privilege
- Default to `denied` and explicitly grant access
- Test policies by impersonating different roles in the Console

### 5. Rotate API Keys Periodically

Regular key rotation limits the impact of a compromised key:

- **Recommended rotation:** every 90 days for production keys
- **Process:** create a new key, update all consumers, then revoke the old key
- **Zero-downtime:** maintain two active keys during the transition period

### 6. Use Environment-Specific Keys

Never share keys across environments:

- Development keys should only access development data
- Production keys should be stored in a secret manager
- Staging keys should use production-like security but with test data

### 7. Validate All User Input Server-Side

Never trust client-side validation alone:

- Validate data types, lengths, and formats on the server
- Use bkend.ai field-level validation rules (min, max, pattern, required)
- Sanitize user input to prevent injection attacks

### 8. Use HTTPS-Only for All API Calls

All bkend.ai API endpoints enforce HTTPS:

- HTTP requests are automatically redirected to HTTPS (301)
- HSTS headers prevent downgrade attacks
- Ensure your application code always uses `https://` URLs
- Configure your CDN/proxy to enforce HTTPS at the edge
