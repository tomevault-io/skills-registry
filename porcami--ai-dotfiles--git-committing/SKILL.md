# Git Committing

Commit messages follow Conventional Commits format.

## Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]
```

## Types

| Type       | Use When                                  |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `feat`     | Adding new functionality                  |
| `fix`      | Correcting a bug                          |
| `test`     | Adding or updating tests (primary change) |
| `refactor` | Restructuring without behaviour change    |
| `docs`     | Documentation only                        |
| `chore`    | Maintenance, dependencies                 |

## Workflow-Aware Type Selection

When a `Workflow:` field exists in PLAN.md, use the default type for that workflow unless the change clearly warrants a different type:

| Workflow | Default Type |
|----------|-------------|
| TDD / One-shot | `feat` |
| Bug-fix / Hotfix | `fix` |
| Refactoring | `refactor` |
| Chore | `chore` |

## Scope

Derive from:

- Repository hint in work item title: `[payments]` → scope `payments`
- Primary domain area affected
- Component or module name

Check recent commits for consistency: `git log --oneline -20`

## Description Rules

- Imperative mood: "add" not "added" or "adds"
- Lowercase throughout
- No trailing period
- Under 50 characters (hard limit: 72)
- Specific: "add balance validation to payment processor" not "update code"
