# Known Issues

**Check your planned action against these known issues before proceeding.**

When you encounter a new mistake that isn't listed here, **add it** to the appropriate section so future runs don't repeat it.

## Scripts & CLI

| #   | Mistake | Correct Behaviour |
| --- | ------- | ----------------- |
| 1   | Added unsupported arguments to scripts (e.g., `--max-results`, `--org`, `--project`, `--team`) | Scripts read org/project/team from environment variables. Only use documented arguments: `--state`, `--unassigned`, `--assigned-to`, `--type` for work items; `--status`, `--include-own` for PRs |

**Rule:** Scripts get Azure DevOps configuration from environment variables (`AZURE_DEVOPS_ORG`, `AZURE_DEVOPS_PROJECT`, `AZURE_DEVOPS_TEAM`, etc.). Do not pass org/project/team as arguments.

## MCP & Azure DevOps

| #   | Mistake | Correct Behaviour |
| --- | ------- | ----------------- |
| 2   | Used MCP to query sprint work items or team PRs | MCP cannot filter by Area Path or team reviewer. Use Python scripts in `.github/skills/azure-devops-api/scripts/` |

**Rule:** Use scripts for team-filtered queries, MCP only for individual item lookups and updates.
