# Project Snapshot Generator

Generate a comprehensive technical snapshot of a codebase that serves as a complete handoff document for developers unfamiliar with the project, using code-explorer agents for deep analysis.

## Multi-Agent Strategy

This skill launches 4 code-explorer agents in parallel for deep codebase analysis. Each agent focuses on a different dimension (architecture, features, dev context, UI/UX) and returns findings independently.

**Default: subagents.** Snapshot exploration agents are independent — each analyzes a different aspect of the codebase and reports key files. There is no need for inter-agent communication since findings are synthesized by you after all agents complete.

**When agent teams could help**: For very large codebases where exploration agents might benefit from sharing discoveries in real-time (e.g., the architecture agent finding a pattern that the feature agent should trace differently). In practice, this is rare — subagents are sufficient for nearly all snapshot generation tasks.

If the calling command passes `--team`, respect that flag and launch agents as a team. Otherwise, use subagents.

## Core Principles

- **NEVER edit prior snapshots**: Previous snapshots are immutable point-in-time records. Always create a NEW checkpoint with a new snapshot. Even if nothing has changed since the last checkpoint, create a fresh snapshot capturing the current state. Never go back to modify, update, or "fix" an earlier snapshot.
- **Read existing context first**: Always read PRDs, previous snapshots, and RFDs before exploring — but only for context, never to edit them
- **Use agents for depth**: Launch code-explorer agents to understand codebase deeply
- **Be specific**: Use actual file paths, function names, and code references
- **Track evolution**: Note how things have changed from previous checkpoints (in the NEW snapshot, not by editing old ones)
- **Clarity over brevity**: Prioritize clear, thorough communication over keeping things concise. A snapshot should be comprehensive enough that any developer can fully understand the project without needing to ask questions. Avoid unnecessary summarization that loses important details.
- **Do NOT over-summarize**: Every section should contain enough detail that a developer can understand the full picture without reading the source code. If a section needs 3 paragraphs, write 3 paragraphs. Brevity at the cost of completeness defeats the purpose of a snapshot. Include specific file paths, function names, configuration values, and architectural rationale.
- **Capture the full picture**: Include UI/UX, design, aesthetics, and multimedia aspects—not just backend logic

## Phase 0: Determine Target

**Goal**: Identify project root

**Target Directory**: $ARGUMENTS

- If `$ARGUMENTS` is provided, use that path as the project root
- If no argument is provided, use the current working directory

**Output Location**: `{project_root}/.claude/checkpoints/checkpoint-{N}/snapshot.md`

---

## Phase 0.5: Existing Codebase Detection & Setup

**Goal**: Detect whether this is an existing codebase being onboarded vs. a new project, and set up checkpoint structure accordingly

**Actions**:

1. **Detect project type** by checking for:
   - Source files (`src/`, `lib/`, `app/`, `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, `*.py`, `*.js`, `*.ts`, etc.)
   - Existing checkpoint structure (`.claude/checkpoints/`)

2. **If existing codebase WITHOUT checkpoint structure** (has source files but no `.claude/checkpoints/`):
   - This is an existing codebase being onboarded to the checkpoint system
   - Create `.claude/checkpoints/` directory
   - Create `checkpoint-1` (NOT checkpoint-0 — checkpoint-0 is reserved for new projects that start with a PRD before any code exists)
   - If no `CLAUDE.md` exists in the project root, suggest: "Consider running `/pr:handle-claude-md` to set up a CLAUDE.md for this project"
   - Proceed with snapshot generation in checkpoint-1

3. **If existing codebase WITH checkpoint structure** (has both source files and `.claude/checkpoints/`):
   - Proceed normally to Phase 1 (auto-increment checkpoint number)

4. **If new/empty project** (no source files, no checkpoint structure):
   - Suggest: "This appears to be a new project with no source code yet. Consider using `/pr:create-prd` first to set up checkpoint-0 with a Product Requirements Document."
   - If user wants to proceed anyway, create checkpoint-1 and generate a minimal snapshot

---

## Phase 1: Checkpoint Setup

**Goal**: Determine checkpoint number and create directory

**Actions**:

1. Check if `.claude/checkpoints/` directory exists

2. If it doesn't exist, create it and use `checkpoint-1`

3. If it exists, find the highest existing checkpoint number and increment by 1 (do NOT simply count directories — numbering may have gaps):

```bash
# Find the highest checkpoint number, not just count directories
HIGHEST=$(ls -d {project_root}/.claude/checkpoints/checkpoint-* 2>/dev/null | grep -oE 'checkpoint-[0-9]+' | grep -oE '[0-9]+' | sort -n | tail -1)
NEXT_CHECKPOINT=$((HIGHEST + 1))
```

4. **Validate sequential numbering**: Check that existing checkpoints are sequentially numbered (0, 1, 2, ...) with no gaps. If gaps are found, warn the user before proceeding.

5. Create the new checkpoint directory: `.claude/checkpoints/checkpoint-{N}/`

---

## Phase 2: Read Existing Documentation

**Goal**: Build context from existing documentation before exploring

**CRITICAL**: This phase must complete before codebase exploration.

**Actions**:

1. **List all existing checkpoints**:
```bash
ls -d {project_root}/.claude/checkpoints/checkpoint-* 2>/dev/null | sort -V
```

2. **For each checkpoint (in order), read**:
   - `prd.md` (if exists, typically in checkpoint-0)
   - `snapshot.md` (if exists)
   - All RFDs in the `rfd/` folder:
   ```bash
   find {project_root}/.claude/checkpoints/checkpoint-*/rfd -name "rfd-*.md" 2>/dev/null | sort
   ```

3. **Read all reference documents**:
```bash
find {project_root}/.claude/references -name "*.md" 2>/dev/null | sort
```

4. **Extract insights from existing documentation**:
   - Project vision and goals (from PRD)
   - Evolution of the codebase (from snapshots)
   - Feature requests and their implementation status (from RFDs)
   - Design decisions made along the way
   - Known issues and technical debt mentioned previously
   - Team guidelines and coding standards (from references)
   - Internal tooling and package usage (from references)
   - Workflow procedures (from references)

---

## Phase 3: Codebase Exploration with Agents

**Goal**: Deep understanding of the current codebase using code-explorer agents

**Actions**:

1. Launch 4 code-explorer agents in parallel (subagents by default) with different focuses:

   **Agent 1 - Architecture Overview**:
   ```
   Analyze the overall architecture of this codebase. Focus on:
   - Directory structure and module organization
   - Technology stack (frontend, backend, database, infrastructure)
   - Design patterns and architectural decisions
   - Configuration and build setup
   - Entry points and main execution flow

   Return a list of 5-10 key architectural files to read.
   ```

   **Agent 2 - Feature Analysis**:
   ```
   Identify and analyze all features in this codebase. Focus on:
   - Completed features and their implementation
   - In-progress features (partial implementation, TODOs)
   - Planned features (mentioned in docs/comments)
   - Key components and their responsibilities

   Return a list of 5-10 key feature files to read.
   ```

   **Agent 3 - Development Context**:
   ```
   Analyze the development context of this codebase. Focus on:
   - Testing strategy and coverage
   - Deployment and CI/CD setup
   - Development workflow (scripts, commands)
   - Dependencies and third-party integrations
   - Known issues and technical debt

   Return a list of 5-10 key development files to read.
   ```

   **Agent 4 - UI/UX & Design Analysis**:
   ```
   Analyze the UI, UX, and visual design aspects of this codebase. Focus on:
   - Design system and component library used (e.g., shadcn/ui, Material UI, custom)
   - Color palette, themes, and color variables/tokens
   - Typography: fonts, sizes, weights, line heights
   - Spacing system and layout patterns
   - Button styles, form elements, and interactive components
   - Icons, images, and multimedia assets
   - Animation and transition patterns
   - Responsive design breakpoints and mobile considerations
   - Accessibility features (ARIA, keyboard nav, screen reader support)
   - Dark mode / light mode implementation
   - CSS architecture (Tailwind, CSS modules, styled-components, etc.)
   - Design tokens and theming configuration files

   Return a list of 5-10 key design/style files to read (CSS, theme configs, component files with significant styling).
   ```

2. Wait for all agents to complete

3. Read all key files identified by agents

4. Synthesize findings into comprehensive understanding

---

## Phase 4: Compare with Previous Checkpoint

**Goal**: Identify changes since last snapshot

**Actions**:

1. If this is not checkpoint-1:
   - Compare current state with previous snapshot
   - Identify new features implemented
   - Note features modified or refactored
   - List bug fixes
   - Document dependency updates
   - Highlight architecture changes
   - Note configuration changes

2. If this is checkpoint-1:
   - Note: "First codebase snapshot - no previous checkpoint to compare."

---

## Phase 5: Generate Snapshot

**Goal**: Write comprehensive snapshot document

**Actions**:

Generate the snapshot following the template structure (see supporting template.md).

Key sections to include:

1. **Executive Summary** - Project overview, status, checkpoint info
2. **Changes Since Last Checkpoint** - What's new since previous snapshot
3. **User Context** - Target users, needs, use cases
4. **Project Vision & Goals** - Core purpose, objectives, philosophy
5. **Features Inventory** - Completed, in-progress, and planned features
6. **Architecture & System Design** - High-level architecture, tech stack, data flow
7. **Key Components Deep Dive** - Detailed component documentation
8. **User Interface (UI) Design** - Visual design system, colors, typography, components, styling architecture
9. **User Experience (UX) Design** - Interaction patterns, user flows, navigation, accessibility, responsive behavior
10. **Development Guidelines** - Coding conventions, patterns, environment setup
11. **Testing Strategy** - Test framework, types, coverage
12. **Deployment & Operations** - Build process, deployment, monitoring
13. **Security Considerations** - Auth, authorization, data protection
14. **Dependencies & Third-Party Services** - Critical dependencies, external services
15. **Known Issues & Technical Debt** - Open issues, TODOs, tech debt
16. **RFD Summary** - Table of all RFDs with status
17. **References Summary** - Table of all reference documents
18. **Glossary** - Project-specific terms
19. **Quick Reference** - Common commands, important files

---

## Phase 6: Save and Report

**Goal**: Write file and confirm completion

**Actions**:

1. Write the snapshot to `{project_root}/.claude/checkpoints/checkpoint-{N}/snapshot.md`

2. Report completion with:
   - File path
   - Checkpoint number
   - Summary of key findings
   - Notable changes since last checkpoint (if applicable)

---

## Writing Guidelines

1. **Be Specific**: Use actual file paths, function names, and code references
2. **Be Honest**: If something is unclear or poorly documented, note it
3. **Be Complete**: Don't skip sections—mark as "N/A" or "Not found" if truly not applicable
4. **Be Practical**: Focus on information a new developer would actually need
5. **Use Code Examples**: Include short code snippets where they clarify understanding
6. **ASCII Diagrams**: Use text diagrams for architecture when helpful
7. **Reference RFDs**: When discussing features, reference their RFD documents if available
8. **Track Evolution**: Note how things have changed from previous checkpoints
9. **Document References**: List all available reference documents so developers know what resources exist
10. **Prioritize Clarity Over Brevity**: Write thorough explanations. Do NOT over-summarize or condense information just to save space. A complete picture is more valuable than a short document. If explaining something fully takes 3 paragraphs, use 3 paragraphs.
11. **Capture Visual/Design Details**: Document colors (with hex codes), fonts, spacing values, animation timings, and other design specifics. Developers recreating the UI need these exact values.
12. **Include Multimedia Context**: Note any images, icons, videos, audio, or other media assets used, where they're stored, and how they're integrated.

## .claude Folder Structure Reference

```
.claude/
├── checkpoints/                     # Project checkpoints (snapshots over time)

    └── {other-reference-folders}/
```

### Document Types

- **prd.md**: Product Requirements Document - exists in checkpoint-0, describes product vision and requirements
- **snapshot.md**: Technical snapshot of the codebase at a point in time (this is what you're creating)
- **rfd/**: Request for Development documents
  - Each RFD is in a numbered folder: `{N}-{feature-name}/`
  - Inside each folder: `rfd-{YYYY-MM-DD}-{HHMM}.md` with timestamp of creation
  - RFDs describe: user's feature request, implementation progress, current status
- **references/**: Reference documents providing context but not directly part of development

---

## Safety Guidelines

**DO NOT:**
- Edit, modify, or overwrite any previous checkpoint's `snapshot.md` — they are immutable historical records
- Edit `prd.md` or prior RFDs unless explicitly requested by the user
- Skip creating a new checkpoint even if the codebase hasn't changed much since the last one — the point is to capture the state at this moment in time
- Reuse an existing checkpoint number — always increment to the next available number
