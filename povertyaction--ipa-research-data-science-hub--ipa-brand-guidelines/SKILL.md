## Writing Guidelines

IPA follows strict writing guidelines to ensure clear, accessible, and professional communication. Key principles include:

### Core Principles

- **Keep it short and simple**: Use concise sentences averaging 15-20 words
- **Write clearly and avoid jargon**: Write for general audiences; explain technical terms on first use
- **Use active voice**: Prefer "Researchers conducted a study" over "A study was conducted"
- **Be evidence-based and objective**: Present findings neutrally without advocacy
- **Show, don't tell**: Use concrete evidence and specific examples
- **Maintain professional tone**: Avoid contractions, slang, and casual language

### Key Terminology

- ✅ Use "evaluation" instead of "experiment"
- ✅ Use "participants" or "respondents" instead of "subjects"
- ✅ Use "Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs)" instead of "developing countries"
- ✅ Use "people living in poverty" instead of "poor people" or "the poor"
- ✅ Use "randomized evaluation" for general audiences instead of "RCT"
- ✅ Avoid "treatment" and "control" language - use descriptive alternatives like "enrolled in the program" vs. "did not receive the program"

### Style Standards

- Follow *Associated Press Stylebook* (56th edition)
- Use American spelling and punctuation
- Follow *Chicago Manual of Style* (17th edition) for citations
- Write out numbers one through nine; use numerals for 10 and above
- Spell out acronyms on first use: "Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA)"
- Use active voice and avoid passive constructions
- No contractions: "it is" not "it's"
