# Stress Hunt

Automated bug-hunting skill that ties together `vole-stress` (synthetic codebase
generation) and `vole-reduce` (test case minimization) in an iterative loop.

## Invocation

Launch via ralph-loop with a completion promise:

```
/ralph-loop "/stress-hunt 5 20" --completion-promise STRESS_HUNT_DONE
/ralph-loop "/stress-hunt 10 10 full,many-modules" --completion-promise STRESS_HUNT_DONE
```

Or invoke directly (single iteration):

```
/stress-hunt 5 20                       # 5 seeds per round, 20 max rounds
/stress-hunt 10 10 full,many-modules    # 10 seeds, 10 rounds, specific profiles
```

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:
- First token: K (seeds per round)
- Second token: Z (max rounds) — default 20
- Optional third token: comma-separated profile names

Default profiles if none specified:
`full`, `many-modules`, `deep-nesting`, `wide-types`, `generics-heavy`.

If new profiles are added during Generator Evolution, they are appended to
the `profiles` list in the state file and used in subsequent rounds.

## How It Works

Each iteration processes one round of K seeds through the workflow. When all K
seeds in a round pass or are verified, the round is **completed**: passing seed
directories are cleaned up, and K fresh seeds are generated for the next round.

The skill tracks iterations internally via `round` in the state file. When
`round > Z` (max rounds), output `<promise>STRESS_HUNT_DONE</promise>` to
signal the ralph loop to stop.

**Iteration cost**: a single bug takes at minimum 5 ralph-loop iterations to
fully process (generate → triage → reduce → fix → verify). Plan accordingly
when setting K and Z.

## State File: `.claude/stress-hunt-state.json`

```json

  "max_rounds": 20,
  "profiles": ["full", "many-modules", "deep-nesting", "wide-types", "generics-heavy"],
  "known_bugs": [

Seed statuses: `pending` -> `pass` | `fail` -> `reducing` -> `reduced` -> `fixing` -> `verified`
                                                                                  `-> skipped`
                                                            `-> dupe` (matched known bug)

## Journal: `.claude/stress-hunt-journal.md`

A persistent log of facts learned across runs — reserved words, syntax
gotchas, generator pitfalls, process lessons. This file is gitignored and
survives across sessions.

<IMPORTANT>
- **Read the journal** at the start of every stress-hunt session (step 1)
- **Append to the journal** whenever you discover something that would save
  a future run from wasting time — wrong syntax assumptions, reserved words,
  codegen quirks, process mistakes. Keep entries terse (one line each).
</IMPORTANT>

## Workflow Per Iteration

Read `.claude/stress-hunt-state.json`. Based on seed statuses, perform the
**first applicable action** from the list below, then update state and finish.

### 1. Initialize (no state file, or stale state from a previous run)

- **Read `.claude/stress-hunt-journal.md`** to load lessons from previous runs
- If `.claude/stress-hunt-state.json` exists from a previous session (i.e. we
  did NOT create it this session), delete it and start fresh
- **Preflight check**: run `just check` to verify the repo compiles. If it
  fails, stop and report — do not generate seeds against a broken repo.
- Pick K random seeds (use `shuf -i 0-4294967295 -n K` for full u32 range)
- Distribute across profiles round-robin (seed 0 gets profile 0, seed 1 gets
  profile 1, etc., wrapping around)
- Write initial state with all seeds as `pending`, `known_bugs` as `[]`
- Set `round` to 1, `max_rounds` to Z, `history` to `[]`

### 2. Generate + Test (`pending` seeds exist)

<IMPORTANT>
ALWAYS use the `run-round.sh` shell script for generation and testing. NEVER
run `cargo run -p vole-stress` or `cargo run -- test` individually per seed.
The script builds once and runs all seeds in a single invocation — it is
faster, handles timeouts, and produces structured JSONL output.
</IMPORTANT>

**Step-by-step:**

1. Collect all `pending` seeds from the state file into `seed:profile` pairs
2. Run them all in one batch via the script:

```bash
bash .claude/skills/stress-hunt/run-round.sh [flags] /tmp/vole-stress \
  <seed1>:<profile1> <seed2>:<profile2> ...
```

For example, if the state has seeds 12345 (profile=full), 67890
(profile=many-modules), and 11111 (profile=deep-nesting):

```bash
bash .claude/skills/stress-hunt/run-round.sh /tmp/vole-stress \
  12345:full 67890:many-modules 11111:deep-nesting
```

3. Capture stdout (JSONL results) and parse it to update seed statuses

**Flags:**

- `--release` — Build and run with the `release-local` cargo profile
  (optimized with debug symbols). Use when recent rounds have had no failures
  — it iterates much faster. Omit for debug builds (better error messages,
  faster compilation).
- `--diff` — Differential testing: builds both debug and release-local, runs
  each seed under both, and reports mismatches (different exit codes or stdout
  output). Catches optimization-related bugs. Output includes a `diff_mismatch`
  field. Use this periodically (e.g. every 3-5 rounds) to catch bugs that only
  manifest under optimization.
- `--asan` — Build vole with AddressSanitizer (nightly toolchain, into
  `target-asan/`). Catches heap corruption, double-free, and use-after-free
  in the compiler runtime. Mutually exclusive with `--release` and `--diff`.
  Use every 5-10 rounds with moderate K (10-20) — ASan adds ~2-3x overhead.
  ASan errors appear in `error_summary` with `AddressSanitizer:` prefixed
  messages and should be categorized as codegen errors during triage.

**Scaling K:** When using `--release` and recent rounds have zero failures,
increase K to 50-100 seeds per round. The expanded name pool (94k unique
names) supports this without collisions, and release-local builds execute
significantly faster than debug.

**Script output format:** The script builds once, then for each seed:profile
pair it generates, tests (60s timeout), and runs main.vole (30s timeout). It
outputs **JSONL to stdout** — one JSON object per line, one per seed:

```json
{"seed":12345,"profile":"full","dir_name":"soaring-swift-penguin","dir":"/tmp/vole-stress/soaring-swift-penguin","test_status":"pass","run_status":"pass","error_summary":""}
```

In `--diff` mode, an additional `diff_mismatch` field is included (empty string
if both builds agree, otherwise describes the difference).

Status values: `pass`, `fail`, `timeout`, `skip`. Progress goes to stderr.

**Parsing the JSONL output:** For each line, update the corresponding seed in
the state file:
- `test_status` and `run_status` both `pass` → mark seed `pass`
- Any `fail` or `timeout` → mark seed `fail`, record `error_summary`
- `diff_mismatch` non-empty → mark seed `fail` even if both builds "pass"
  (the mismatch itself is the bug)
- Update the seed's `dir` and `dir_name` fields from the JSONL output

Process all pending seeds in one iteration before moving on.

### 3. Triage (`fail` seeds without `error_category`)

For each `fail` seed:

#### 3a. Fingerprint the error

Extract a fingerprint from the error: the panic location (e.g.
`panicked at frontend.rs:509`), the error code + message (e.g.
`[E2023]: unknown method 'foo'`), the signal (e.g. `signal 11`), or the
ASan error type and location (e.g.
`AddressSanitizer: heap-use-after-free on address 0x... at pc 0x...`).
Store in `error_fingerprint`.

#### 3b. Check for duplicates

Compare the fingerprint against `known_bugs` in the state file. If it
matches an existing known bug:
- Set `dupe_of` to the matching ticket ID
- Mark seed as `dupe`
- Add a note to the existing ticket: `tk add-note <id> "Also hit by seed <S> (round N)"`
- **Do not reduce or fix** — the original ticket tracks this bug

If multiple seeds in the same round hit the same *new* error (same
fingerprint, no matching known bug), pick ONE as the primary and mark
the rest as `dupe` of that seed's (future) ticket. Only reduce/fix the
primary.

#### 3c. Categorize (non-duplicate seeds only)

**Generator error** (vole-stress bug):
- `[E0xxx]` lexer errors, `[E1xxx]` parser errors
- `[E2xxx]` sema errors where generated code is clearly structurally wrong
  (impossible types, undefined names that should have been declared)
- Runtime panics caused by invalid generated code (e.g. array index OOB
  on empty arrays from `filter().collect()`)
- Set `error_category: "generator"`
- **Generator bugs MUST be fixed** — do not dismiss them as "pre-existing"
  or move on. If the same generator bug keeps appearing, fix the root cause
  in `src/tools/vole-stress/` before proceeding to the next round.

**Sema / VIR lowering error** (type checker or VIR bug):
- `[E2xxx]` errors where generated code looks valid but type checker rejects it
- Read the generated code to verify it should be valid Vole
- Panics or wrong results where `cargo run -- inspect vir <file>` shows
  incorrect VIR output (wrong types, missing coercions, missing RC ops)
- Set `error_category: "sema"`
- Note: many "codegen" symptoms have root causes in VIR lowering — always
  inspect VIR before assuming the fix belongs in codegen

**Codegen error** (code generation / runtime bug):
- No E-code errors, timeouts, signal 11 (segfault), panics, wrong results
  WHERE VIR output looks correct (wrong instruction emission, not wrong metadata)
- AddressSanitizer errors (heap-use-after-free, double-free, heap-buffer-overflow,
  stack-buffer-overflow) — these are always codegen bugs indicating memory
  safety issues in the compiler runtime or generated code
- Set `error_category: "codegen"`

### 4. Reduce (`fail` seeds with `error_category` set)

For each non-dupe `fail` seed, run `vole-reduce` with oracle flags based on
error type:

| Error Pattern | Oracle Flags |
|---------------|-------------|
| Parse/lex error | `--stderr "E0\|E1" --exit-code 1` |
| Sema error | `--stderr "E2" --exit-code 1` |
| Segfault | `--signal 11` |
| Timeout | `--timeout 60` |
| Assertion failure | `--stderr "assertion failed" --exit-code 1` |
| ASan error | `--stderr "AddressSanitizer" --exit-code 1` |
| Generic crash | `--exit-code 1 --stderr "<specific error text>"` |

Always use `--command` with `--manifest-path` since vole-reduce runs from the
result/ directory:

```bash
cargo run -p vole-reduce -- <dir>/ \
  --command 'timeout 90 cargo run --manifest-path /home/phil/code/personal/vole/Cargo.toml -- test {file}' \
  --timeout 60 \
  <oracle-flags>
```

For ASan-detected bugs, use the ASan binary in the oracle command instead:

```bash
cargo run -p vole-reduce -- <dir>/ \
  --command 'timeout 90 env ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_leaks=0 /home/phil/code/personal/vole/target-asan/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/debug/vole test {file}' \
  --timeout 60 \
  --stderr "AddressSanitizer" --exit-code 1
```

After reduction completes:

1. **Copy the reduced directory** to a persistent location:
   ```bash
   cp -r <reduced_dir> .claude/stress-hunt-repros/<seed-name>/
   ```
   This is the canonical repro — survives `/tmp` cleanup and generator
   evolution. The reducer may leave multiple files if the bug requires
   cross-module interaction.
2. Update `reduced_dir` and mark `reducing` -> `reduced`.

### 5. Fix (`reduced` seeds exist)

For each `reduced` seed, **actually attempt to fix the bug**. The goal is to
fix it, not just file it. The ticket exists to track your investigation data
— a running log of what you tried, what you found, and what's left.

Fix ONE seed per iteration to keep changes focused and reviewable.

#### Generator bugs (`error_category: "generator"`)

Generator bugs are straightforward vole-stress fixes and do NOT get tickets.
Read the reduced test case, fix the generator code in `src/tools/vole-stress/`,
run `just pre-commit`, commit, and mark `fixing`.

<IMPORTANT>
Generator bugs MUST be fixed immediately — there is no such thing as a
"pre-existing" generator bug. If the generator produces code that panics at
runtime (e.g. array index OOB on empty arrays), that is a bug in the generator
that must be root-caused and fixed, not noted and skipped. Fix the generator
so it never produces that invalid pattern again.
</IMPORTANT>

#### Sema/codegen bugs — dispatch a sub-agent

For sema and codegen bugs, dispatch a **sequential sub-agent** (using the Task
tool) to investigate and attempt the fix.

**Before dispatching the sub-agent:**

1. Read the minimized test case in `reduced_dir`
2. Create a `tk` ticket for the bug (see Ticket Tracking below)
3. Record the ticket ID in the seed's state as `ticket_id`
4. Add the bug to `known_bugs` in the state file with its fingerprint
   and ticket ID, so future duplicates are detected

**The sub-agent's task:**

Give the sub-agent a detailed prompt including:
- The reduced test case code (paste it in the prompt)
- The path to the persistent repro directory (`.claude/stress-hunt-repros/<name>/`)
- The error category and error summary
- The ticket ID for tracking notes
- Which crate to investigate:
  - `sema`: `src/crates/vole-sema/`
  - `codegen`: `src/crates/vole-codegen/` or `src/crates/vole-runtime/`

The sub-agent MUST:
1. Reproduce the bug by running the test case
2. **Inspect VIR** for the failing file: `cargo run -- inspect vir <file>`
   to understand what sema/VIR lowering produces. If VIR looks wrong, fix
   in sema or VIR lowering. If VIR looks correct, fix in codegen.
3. Investigate the root cause — read relevant compiler code, use debuggers
4. Track findings with `tk add-note <id> "..."` as it goes
5. **Fix upstream**: prefer sema/VIR lowering fixes over codegen special cases.
   Codegen reads decisions, it does not make them. See "Fix Location" section.
6. Attempt to fix the bug
7. Add a regression test to `test/unit/` covering the pattern
8. Run `just pre-commit` to verify
9. If fixed: commit, record the commit hash, `tk close <id>`
10. **15-minute time limit**: if unable to fix within ~15 minutes, stop.
    Add a final note to the ticket explaining what was tried, what the
    blocker is, and any leads for future investigation. Leave the ticket
    open as a backlog item.

**After the sub-agent completes:**

- If fixed: update seed with `fix_commit` hash, mark `fixing`
- If not fixed (15-min limit hit): mark seed `skipped`, move on
  - The ticket remains open with investigation notes for future reference

### 6. Verify (`fixing` seeds exist)

For each `fixing` seed:

- **Generator fixes**: must regenerate the seed (generated code changes):
  ```bash
  cargo run -p vole-stress -- --seed <S> --profile <P> --output /tmp/vole-stress --name <same-name>
  ```
  Then re-test.

- **Sema/codegen fixes**: re-test the same files (no regeneration needed):
  ```bash
  timeout 60 cargo run -- test <dir>/
  ```

If passes: mark `verified`.
If new failure: mark `fail` again with new error, clear `error_category`.

### 7. Round Complete (all seeds `pass`, `verified`, `skipped`, or `dupe`)

**A round is NOT complete if any generator bugs were observed but not fixed.**
Generator bugs must be fixed before moving to the next round. Only sema/codegen
bugs that hit the 15-minute time limit may be `skipped`.

When all K seeds in the current round are terminal (`pass`, `verified`,
`skipped`, or `dupe`):

1. Record round summary in `history`:
   ```json
   { "round": N, "passed": X, "failed": Y, "bugs_fixed": Z, "skipped": S, "dupes": D }
   ```
2. Clean up: `rm -rf` the `/tmp/vole-stress/` directories for all terminal
   seeds in this round
3. Print a summary: `Round N complete: X/K passed, Y bugs fixed, S skipped, D dupes`
4. If `round >= max_rounds`: output `<promise>STRESS_HUNT_DONE</promise>` and stop
5. **If any non-dupe failures occurred**: reset `consecutive_clean` to 0
6. **If zero non-dupe failures** (clean round):
   - Increment `consecutive_clean`
   - If `consecutive_clean == 1`: double K for next round (capped at 100),
     do NOT evolve the generator — just run more seeds at current complexity
   - If `consecutive_clean >= 2`: run Generator Evolution (see below),
     then reset K back to `base_k` for the next round
7. Pick K fresh random seeds, distribute across profiles round-robin,
   replace `seeds` array, increment `round`

## Timeout Handling

All commands use the `timeout` utility:
- `timeout 60` for `vole test` (test suites can be slow)
- `timeout 30` for `vole run` (single main function)
- `timeout 90` in vole-reduce oracle command (extra headroom for reduction)
- `--timeout 60` as vole-reduce oracle flag (for hang detection)

Timeout = potential infinite loop. Check the reduced code to determine:
- Generator error: bad loop generation -> fix vole-stress
- Codegen error: bad loop compilation -> fix vole-codegen

## Ticket Tracking (sema/codegen bugs only)

Tickets exist to **track your investigation data as you work**, not just to
file and forget. When a sema or codegen bug is found (after reduction), create
a `tk` ticket immediately, then use it as a running log of your investigation.
Generator bugs are simple vole-stress fixes and don't need tickets.

### Creating the ticket

```bash
tk create "stress-hunt: <short description of bug>" -d "<detailed description>"
```

The description should include:
- Seed number and profile
- Error category (sema or codegen)
- Error message or symptom (segfault, timeout, wrong result, etc.)
- Path to the persistent repro directory (`.claude/stress-hunt-repros/<name>/`)
- The reduced code itself (paste it in)

Record the ticket ID in the seed's `ticket_id` field in state.

### Updating during investigation

As you investigate, add notes with findings. The ticket is your running log —
if you hit the 15-minute limit, these notes are what makes the ticket useful
for future investigation:

```bash
tk add-note <id> "Root cause: <explanation>"
tk add-note <id> "Attempted fix: <what you tried>"
tk add-note <id> "Blocker: <why this is hard>"
tk add-note <id> "Relevant code: <file:line — what it does>"
```

### On fix

```bash
tk add-note <id> "Fixed in commit <hash>: <what was changed>"
tk close <id>
```

### On skip (15-minute limit exceeded)

```bash
tk add-note <id> "Skipping after 15min. Tried: <approaches>. Blocker: <issue>. Leads: <suggestions>"
```

Leave the ticket open with all investigation notes — it becomes a backlog
item with enough context for someone to pick up where you left off.

## Generator Evolution (clean rounds)

When a round completes with **zero non-dupe failures**, decide whether to
evolve or just run more seeds:

- **First clean round in a row**: double K for the next round (up to 100),
  do NOT evolve. More seeds at current complexity is cheaper than evolving.
- **Second+ consecutive clean round**: evolve the generator, then reset K
  back to the original value for the next round.

The goal is to generate increasingly exotic but **valid** Vole code — with
a bias toward *feature interactions* and *edge cases* over breadth.

This runs **before** the next round starts, not in parallel.

### Process

1. **Re-read `.claude/stress-hunt-journal.md`** before picking a feature —
   check for reserved words, syntax gotchas, and known pitfalls
2. Pick ONE small enhancement from the priority areas below
3. **Verify syntax first**: before writing any generator code, write a small
   hand-crafted `.vole` file in `/tmp/` that uses the feature you plan to
   generate. Run it with `cargo run -- test /tmp/test_feature.vole` (or
   `cargo run -- run /tmp/test_feature.vole`). This catches wrong assumptions
   about syntax early (e.g. tuple indexing is `tuple[0]` not `tuple.0`).
   If the syntax doesn't work as expected, adjust your plan or pick a
   different feature. **If you learn something new (reserved words, syntax
   quirks), append it to the journal.**
4. Launch a sub-agent to implement it. The sub-agent MUST:
   - Read existing `test/**/*.vole` files to understand valid syntax/structure
   - Make the change to `src/tools/vole-stress/`
   - Run `just pre-commit` to verify the change compiles
   - If pre-commit fails, fix or revert
5. **Wait for the sub-agent to complete** before continuing
6. **Validate** with multiple seeds across profiles:
   ```bash
   for seed in 999999 888888 777777 666666 555555; do
     cargo run -p vole-stress -- --seed $seed --profile full --output /tmp/vole-stress-validate
     timeout 60 cargo run -- test /tmp/vole-stress-validate/<dir>/
     rm -rf /tmp/vole-stress-validate/<dir>
   done
   ```
   Also validate any new profile specifically with 3+ seeds.
7. **Classify validation failures** (see below)
8. If validation passes: **commit** the change, then proceed to the next round
9. **If a new profile was added**: append its name to the `profiles` array in
   the state file so it gets used in round-robin seed distribution going forward.
10. The next round's stress tests will exercise the new feature across K seeds

### Classifying validation failures

When a generator evolution causes test failures, determine the failure type:

**Generator bug** (invalid code generated):
- Bad syntax, undefined names, structurally wrong types
- Infinite loops on the Vole side (not compiler-side)
- Code that is clearly not valid Vole

**Action**: fix the generator. If you can't fix it, **revert entirely**
(`git checkout -- src/tools/vole-stress/`).

**Compiler bug** (valid code that exposes a compiler/runtime issue):
- Segfaults, panics, wrong results, codegen crashes
- The generated code is valid Vole — the compiler should handle it

**Action — two parts, BOTH required:**

**Part 1**: commit the generator change — it found a real bug, that's good.

**Part 2 (mandatory — do NOT skip)**: attempt to fix each failing seed's
compiler bug before proceeding to the next round. For each distinct failure:
1. Reduce the failing test case with `vole-reduce`
2. Save the repro to `.claude/stress-hunt-repros/`
3. Create a `tk` ticket for the compiler bug
4. Dispatch a sub-agent to attempt the fix (same as step 5 workflow)
5. If fixed: commit the compiler fix too
6. If not fixed (15-min limit): leave the ticket open

After all failures are attempted (fixed or skipped), check whether the
generator change causes widespread failures:
- If only 1-2 of 5 validation seeds fail: **keep the generator change**.
  The next round will hit the bug, and the dedup logic will handle it.
- If most/all seeds fail: **revert the generator change** to avoid
  poisoning every round. Create a follow-up ticket to re-add the
  generator feature once the compiler bug is fixed:
  ```bash
  tk create "stress-hunt: re-add <feature> after <compiler-bug-id> is fixed" \
    -d "Generator evolution for <feature> was reverted because it triggers <bug>. Re-add once the compiler bug is resolved."
  tk dep <re-add-id> <compiler-bug-id>
  ```

Only proceed to the next round after Part 2 is complete.

### Choosing What to Evolve

Roll a dice (`shuf -i 1-10 -n 1`) to select the evolution category:

| Roll | Category | Why |
|------|----------|-----|
| 1-4  | **Feature interactions** | Cross-cutting combos are where real bugs hide |
| 5-7  | **Edge cases & boundaries** | Boundary conditions stress codegen/RC/sema |
| 8-9  | **Language features** | New syntax coverage, structural patterns |
| 10   | **Breadth** | Stdlib methods, API surface |

Record the roll and chosen category in the commit message (e.g.
`vole-stress: [roll=3/interactions] generate closures capturing union fields`).

### Category Details

Reference `test/**/*.vole` files for valid syntax patterns before implementing.

**Feature interactions** (rolls 1-4) — combine 2+ features that stress
different compiler subsystems together. These find the most bugs because
they exercise codegen paths that individual features don't reach alone.

Pick combinations, not individual features. Examples:
- Generics + interface dispatch (generic fn calling interface method)
- Closures + RC types (closure capturing a class instance or string)
- Unions + pattern matching + RC (match on union variant containing RC type)
- Generics + closures (generic fn taking closure parameter)
- Interface upcasting + method calls in generic context
- Optional chaining on results of generic function calls
- Fallible functions + closures (`try` block inside closure)
- Iterators + closures capturing outer mutable state
- Cross-module generics (generic type defined in one module, used in another)
- Nested containers (array of optional of class implementing interface)
- Match/when inside closures that capture variables
- String interpolation with method calls on generic types
- Destructuring + union types + optional fields
- Multiple interface implementations + generic constraints
- Recursive functions with generic parameters and interface bounds

**Edge cases & boundaries** (rolls 5-7) — boundary conditions, unusual but
valid inputs, and patterns that stress reference counting, memory layout,
or type resolution.

Examples:
- Empty arrays/strings passed to iterator chains
- Deeply nested optional unwrapping (`x??.field??.method()`)
- Zero-variant and single-variant unions
- Functions with many parameters (8+, 16+) — stresses calling conventions
- Large tuple types (5+, 8+ elements)
- Deeply nested function calls (f(g(h(x)))) with type coercions at each level
- Match/when with many arms (20+, 50+)
- Strings containing special characters, empty strings, very long strings
- Numeric boundary values (i32::MAX, i64::MIN, etc.) in expressions
- Classes with many fields (10+, 20+), some optional, some RC
- Arrays with mixed operations (push then pop then iterate then map)
- Chained method calls (5+ deep) on iterators or strings
- Diamond interface inheritance with method name conflicts
- Default parameter values that are complex expressions
- Break/continue in nested loops with closures in between

**Language features** (rolls 8-9) — new syntax or structural patterns
the generator doesn't use yet. Focus on features that are likely to interact
with existing generation in complex ways.

Examples:
- Type aliases (especially aliasing generic types)
- Nested generic types (`Array<Optional<MyClass<T>>>`)
- Multi-line string literals
- `unreachable` keyword in exhaustive branches
- Modules re-exporting imported symbols
- Multiple implement blocks for the same class
- Test blocks that exercise error paths
- Complex control flow (break/continue in nested loops with early returns)
- Recursive data patterns (where valid)
- Functions returning functions (closures)

**Breadth** (roll 10) — adding individual stdlib methods, API surface
coverage. Still useful but unlikely to find new bug categories.

Examples:
- String methods not yet generated
- Array/iterator methods not yet generated
- Math operations: bitwise, shifts
- Type conversions between numeric types

### Rules for generator changes

- Each change should be SMALL and focused (one feature per round)
- Always verify generated code compiles AND passes tests
- If a change generates **invalid code**: fix the generator or revert
- If a change generates **valid code** that crashes the compiler: keep the
  generator change, fix the compiler (see Classifying validation failures)
- Reference `test/` files for syntax, but don't copy tests wholesale

## Fix Location: Where to Put the Fix

When fixing compiler bugs, **always prefer fixing upstream** in the pipeline.
The compiler has a strict layered architecture:

```
Parser → Sema → VIR Lowering → Codegen
```

**The golden rule:** Codegen should read decisions, never make them. Desugar
early — when codegen needs type-specific behavior, add annotations/lowering
in sema or VIR rather than type-detection special cases in codegen.

### Decision hierarchy (fix at the FIRST applicable level)

1. **Sema** (`src/crates/vole-sema/src/analyzer/`) — type-driven decisions,
   annotations, error detection. If the bug is "codegen doesn't know X about
   this expression", the fix is to have sema annotate X in the NodeMap or
   VIR metadata, NOT to have codegen re-derive X from types.

2. **VIR Lowering** (`src/crates/vole-sema/src/vir_lower/`) — desugaring,
   normalization, making implicit operations explicit. If the bug involves
   a missing operation (e.g. RC inc/dec, type coercion, iterator wrapping),
   the fix is usually to emit the correct VIR nodes during lowering rather
   than adding special-case detection in codegen.

3. **VIR types/metadata** (`src/crates/vole-sema/src/vir/`) — if codegen
   needs additional type information to generate correct code, prefer adding
   it to VIR node metadata (e.g. `VirExpr` fields, `VirType` variants) so
   codegen can read it mechanically.

4. **Codegen** (`src/crates/vole-codegen/src/`) — instruction selection and
   memory layout ONLY. Fix here only when the bug is genuinely about wrong
   instruction emission, not wrong type classification or missing metadata.

### Red flags that you're fixing in the wrong place

- Adding `if type_id.is_X()` checks in codegen → should be sema/VIR annotation
- Codegen inspecting interface/class names to decide behavior → should be sema
- Codegen calling back into sema types or name table for decisions → wrong layer
- Adding a new `match` arm in codegen for a type variant → likely needs VIR node
- Codegen computing something that sema already knows → pipe it through VIR

### Using VIR inspect for debugging

Always inspect VIR output for the failing test case to understand what sema
and VIR lowering are producing:

```bash
cargo run -- inspect vir path/to/reduced/file.vole
cargo run -- inspect vir -f function_name path/to/file.vole
```

This shows the VIR that codegen receives. If the VIR looks wrong (missing
coercions, wrong types, missing RC ops), the fix belongs in VIR lowering.
If the VIR looks correct but codegen produces wrong code, the fix belongs
in codegen.

Also useful:
```bash
cargo run -- inspect ir path/to/file.vole    # Cranelift IR (what codegen emits)
cargo run -- inspect ast path/to/file.vole   # Parser output
```

## Regression Tests

When fixing **sema** or **codegen** bugs, always add a regression test to
`test/unit/`. The test should:

- Be in an appropriate subdirectory (e.g. `test/unit/language/interfaces/`)
- Cover the specific pattern that triggered the bug
- Include a descriptive test name
- Test both the failing case and related edge cases

## Important Rules

- NEVER simplify tests — you are hiding bugs
- NEVER assume "pre-existing failures" — you likely broke it
- NEVER skip work or decide it's "too complex"
- **ALL generator bugs must be fixed immediately** — do not label them
  "pre-existing" and move on. If a generator pattern produces invalid code
  (e.g. indexing empty arrays from `filter().collect()`), find and fix the
  root cause in `src/tools/vole-stress/`. A recurring generator bug that is
  never fixed is wasted signal in every future round.
- **Fix upstream, not downstream** — sema/VIR fixes over codegen special cases.
  See "Fix Location" section above.
- Always `just pre-commit` before any commit
- Track shortcuts in tickets with `tk` if any are taken
- Fix ONE bug per iteration to keep commits focused
- Always add regression tests to `test/unit/` for sema/codegen fixes
