Start a new change using the experimental artifact-driven approach.

**Input**: The user's request should include a change name (kebab-case) OR a description of what they want to build.

**Steps**

1. **If no clear input provided, ask what they want to build**

   Use the **AskUserQuestion tool** (open-ended, no preset options) to ask:
   > "What change do you want to work on? Describe what you want to build or fix."

   From their description, derive a kebab-case name (e.g., "add user authentication" → `add-user-auth`).

   **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT proceed without understanding what the user wants to build.

2. **Select a workflow schema**

   Run `openspec schemas --json` to get available schemas with descriptions.

   Use the **AskUserQuestion tool** to let the user choose a workflow:
   - Present each schema with its description
   - Mark `spec-driven` as "(default)" if it's available
   - Example options: "spec-driven - proposal → specs → design → tasks (default)", "tdd - tests → implementation → docs"

   If user doesn't have a preference, default to `spec-driven`.

3. **Create the change directory**
   ```bash
   openspec new change "<name>" --schema "<selected-schema>"
   ```
   This creates a scaffolded change at `openspec/changes/<name>/` with the selected schema.

4. **Show the artifact status**
   ```bash
   openspec status --change "<name>"
   ```
   This shows which artifacts need to be created and which are ready (dependencies satisfied).

5. **Get instructions for the first artifact**
   The first artifact depends on the schema (e.g., `proposal` for spec-driven, `spec` for tdd).
   Check the status output to find the first artifact with status "ready".
   ```bash
   openspec instructions <first-artifact-id> --change "<name>"
   ```
   This outputs the template and context for creating the first artifact.

6. **STOP and wait for user direction**

**Output**

After completing the steps, summarize:
- Change name and location
- Selected schema/workflow and its artifact sequence
- Current status (0/N artifacts complete)
- The template for the first artifact
- Prompt: "Ready to create the first artifact? Just describe what this change is about and I'll draft it, or ask me to continue."

**Guardrails**
- Do NOT create any artifacts yet - just show the instructions
- Do NOT advance beyond showing the first artifact template
- If the name is invalid (not kebab-case), ask for a valid name
- If a change with that name already exists, suggest continuing that change instead
- Always pass --schema to preserve the user's workflow choice
