# Xtext to Langium Port Guide

Comprehensive guide for porting Eclipse Xtext grammars to Langium, covering grammar translation, EMF metamodel replacement, scoping, validation, and packaging as a TypeScript library.

## When to Use

Apply this skill when:
- Porting an Xtext `.xtext` grammar to Langium `.langium` format
- Replacing EMF/Xcore metamodels with Langium-generated TypeScript AST
- Translating Xtext `ScopeProvider` to Langium's scoping services
- Converting Xtext validation rules to Langium validators
- Restructuring ANTLR LL(*) grammar patterns for Chevrotain LL(k)
- Packaging a ported DSL as a TypeScript library (Node.js + browser)

## Core Decision Framework

### 1. Grammar Translation: Manual, Not Automated

**Do not rely on `xtext2langium`** for non-trivial grammars. Automated tools fail on:
- Syntactic predicates (`=>` and `->`) requiring case-by-case LL(k) analysis
- Duplicated rule patterns (e.g., "without left parameter") needing redesign
- Xcore operations that must become TypeScript utilities

**Approach**: Translate rule-by-rule, phase-by-phase, starting with the highest-risk subsystem (typically expressions).

### 2. EMF Metamodel Replacement: Grammar-Inferred AST

Let Langium infer the AST from the grammar. Langium generates `ast.ts` with all node interfaces automatically.

- Xcore **structural properties** become grammar rule fields
- Xcore **derived/computed properties** become TypeScript utility functions
- Xcore **Java operations** become TypeScript utility modules
- **Do not** hand-write separate TypeScript interfaces (two sources of truth)

### 3. Predicate Handling: LL(*) to LL(k)

Xtext uses ANTLR LL(*) with unlimited lookahead. Langium uses Chevrotain LL(k) with bounded lookahead.

| Xtext Pattern | Langium Strategy |
|---|---|
| `=>` syntactic predicate | Restructure rule or increase `maxLookahead` |
| `->` backtracking predicate | Eliminate via rule factoring |
| Deep lookahead | Gate on keywords or use Langium actions |
| `<` ambiguity (doc vs operator) | Separate terminal rules or keyword gating |

Start with `maxLookahead: 3`. Increase only for specific rules that fail.

### 4. Scoping: Custom ScopeProvider

Map each Xtext `EReference` scoping case to Langium's `ScopeComputation` + `ScopeProvider` services. Langium defaults handle simple containment cases (~5 of a typical 20+). The remaining cases require a custom scope provider.

### 5. Validation: Incremental Parity

Port validation rules incrementally by category, targeting 80% parity:
1. Expression type checking (highest priority)
2. Structural constraints (cycles, duplicates)
3. Naming conventions
4. Domain-specific rules (reporting, etc.)

## Phased Delivery Strategy

Execute in this order to retire risk early:

### Phase 1: Infrastructure
Set up monorepo, Langium config, terminal rules, skeleton entry rule, `langium-cli generate` pipeline, Vitest harness.

**Checkpoint**: `langium-cli generate` produces `ast.ts`. `parse("")` returns empty model.

### Phase 2: Highest-Risk Grammar Subsystem (e.g., Expressions)
Port the most complex grammar subsystem first. For typical DSLs this is expressions with precedence chains, postfix operators, and functional operations.

**Checkpoint**: All expression tests pass. Generated `ast.ts` contains typed expression interfaces.

### Phase 3: Core Structural Types
Port data types, enumerations, functions, and other structural constructs. Implement `parse()` and `parseWorkspace()` APIs.

**Checkpoint**: Core types parse. Cross-references resolve. Public API works.

### Phase 4: Scoping & Validation
Implement custom scope provider. Port validation rules by category.

**Checkpoint**: 80%+ validation parity. Zero false positives on test corpus.

### Phase 5: Full Grammar Coverage
Port remaining subsystems (synonyms, annotations, reporting, external sources). Implement round-trip serialization.

**Checkpoint**: 100% test corpus parse rate. Round-trip passes.

### Phase 6: Packaging & Release
Finalize exports, CLI, CI, browser testing, performance benchmarks, npm publish.

## Quick Reference: Syntax Mapping

| Xtext | Langium |
|---|---|
| `grammar G with org.eclipse.xtext.common.Terminals` | `grammar G` (terminals defined inline) |
| `returns TypeName` | `returns TypeName` (same) |
| `{Action}` | `{infer Action}` |
| `[TypeRef\|ID]` | `[TypeRef:ID]` |
| `current` | `infer` keyword in actions |
| `->` (backtrack) | Remove; restructure rule |
| `=>` (synpred) | Remove; restructure for LL(k) |
| `terminal fragment` | `terminal fragment` (same) |
| `@Override` | Not needed; override via DI |

## Package Architecture

Build as a **zero-dependency library** (beyond `langium` + `chevrotain`):
- Export parser services, AST types, and utility functions
- Support Node.js (>=20) and modern browsers (ES2020+)
- Provide optional web worker helper for off-main-thread parsing
- Optional CLI as a separate package
