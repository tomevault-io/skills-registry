# Spec-Kit Feedback Skill

Capture usage patterns during spec-kit workflows to help improve prompts and templates.

## Purpose

This skill helps collect data that can be used to improve spec-kit-extensions:
- Tracks workflow completion patterns
- Identifies friction points
- Reminds to export chat logs at key moments
- Prepares data for RL intake submissions

## When This Skill Activates

### Workflow Completion

When a workflow reaches completion (review passed, PR created, etc.):

```
📋 Workflow Complete - Consider Capturing Feedback

This session used the {{WORKFLOW}} workflow. If you'd like to help
improve spec-kit, consider exporting this chat log for analysis.

Quick export:
  claude export --format markdown > workflow-session.md

The spec-kit team uses this data to improve prompts and templates.
```

### Friction Detected

When the conversation shows signs of friction:
- Multiple clarification questions
- Retries or corrections
- User redirecting the agent
- Confusion about next steps

```
🔍 Friction Point Noted

I noticed some confusion around [specific area]. This is valuable
feedback for improving the {{WORKFLOW}} workflow.

Consider noting this in your feedback:
- What was confusing
- What would have helped
- How it was resolved
```

### Quality Gate Issues

When quality gates are skipped or cause problems:

```
⚠️ Quality Gate Observation

The {{GATE}} gate was [skipped/problematic]. This pattern helps
identify gates that may need adjustment.

If this gate felt unnecessary or blocking, note why in feedback.
```

## Automatic Tracking

Throughout the session, this skill tracks:

### Metrics (Mental Notes)

- **Workflow type**: Which workflow is being used
- **Clarification count**: How many times clarification was needed
- **Retry count**: How many corrections/retries occurred
- **Gate compliance**: Which gates were followed/skipped
- **Completion status**: Did workflow complete successfully

### Patterns to Note

When these occur, make a mental note for the summary:

| Pattern | Indicates |
|---------|-----------|
| "I don't understand" | Prompt clarity issue |
| "Let me try again" | Instruction ambiguity |
| "Actually, I meant..." | Template structure issue |
| Skipped template section | Section may be unnecessary |
| Added content not in template | Missing template section |
| User took over a step | Automation gap |

## End-of-Session Summary

When the workflow completes or session ends, offer a summary:

```
📊 Session Summary

Workflow: {{WORKFLOW}}
Status: {{COMPLETE/PARTIAL/FAILED}}
Duration: ~{{TIME}} (estimated from conversation length)

Observations:
- Clarifications needed: {{N}}
- Retries/corrections: {{N}}
- Gates followed: {{N}}/{{TOTAL}}

{{#if friction_points}}
Friction Points:
{{#each friction_points}}
- {{this}}
{{/each}}
{{/if}}

{{#if positive_patterns}}
What Worked Well:
{{#each positive_patterns}}
- {{this}}
{{/each}}
{{/if}}

To contribute this feedback:
1. Export chat: claude export --format markdown > session.md
2. Share with spec-kit team or submit to RL intake
```

## Export Instructions

### Claude Code

```bash
# Export this session
claude export --format markdown > spec-kit-session-$(date +%Y%m%d).md

# Or find session ID first
claude sessions list
claude export --session <id> --format markdown > session.md
```

### Preparing for RL Intake

If submitting to spec-kit-extensions for analysis, include:

1. **Chat log** (exported above)
2. **Spec files** created:
   ```bash
   cp -r specs/{{WORKFLOW}}/{{NUM}}-*/ feedback-specs/
   ```
3. **Git commits**:
   ```bash
   git log --oneline {{BRANCH}} > feedback-commits.txt
   ```
4. **Test results** (if available):
   ```bash
   npm test 2>&1 | tee feedback-tests.txt
   ```

### Privacy Note

Before sharing:
- Remove proprietary business logic
- Redact API keys, passwords, personal info
- Keep workflow structure and agent interactions
- Focus on the process, not the content

## Feedback Channels

Ways to share feedback:

1. **GitHub Issue**: Open an issue at spec-kit-extensions repo
2. **RL Intake**: Maintainers run `/rl-intake` with your data
3. **Direct**: Share exported session with maintainer

## What Makes Good Feedback

### Most Valuable

- Sessions with friction (confusion, retries, user takeover)
- Failed or abandoned workflows
- Workarounds you had to use
- Sections you skipped and why
- Content you added that wasn't in templates

### Less Valuable

- Perfectly smooth sessions (nice, but less actionable)
- Heavily redacted sessions (hard to analyze context)
- Partial exports (missing key decision points)

## Integration with Workflow Commands

This skill complements the spec-kit commands:

| Command | This Skill's Role |
|---------|-------------------|
| `/speckit.specify` | Track spec creation friction |
| `/speckit.plan` | Note planning clarifications |
| `/speckit.tasks` | Observe task breakdown issues |
| `/speckit.bugfix` | Monitor regression test compliance |
| `/speckit.review` | Capture review feedback |

## Suggested Workflow Tags

When exporting, consider adding tags to help categorize:

```markdown
---
workflow: bugfix
friction_level: medium
gates_followed: 3/4
key_friction: "regression test timing unclear"
---
```

This helps the RL intake process prioritize analysis.
