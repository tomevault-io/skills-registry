# CI/CD Pipeline Architecture

Use this skill when the work is to design, assess, or improve the pipeline itself — the stage sequence, environment topology, promotion rules, and mandatory quality gates — rather than configuring a specific CI tool or running individual deployments. A well-designed pipeline separates concerns: each stage has one job, each gate enforces one class of risk, and promotion is deterministic.

---

## Before Starting

Gather this context before working on anything in this domain:

- **Deployment model:** Is the project org-based (Metadata API / SFDX deploy), unlocked packages, or managed packages? The promotion mechanism and rollback options differ fundamentally across these three.
- **Sandbox inventory:** Which sandbox types are available? Partial Copy and Full sandboxes support complete integration and regression testing; Developer sandboxes do not reliably reflect production data volumes or governor limits.
- **Regulatory constraints:** Does the org fall under SOX, HIPAA, or an internal CAB process? These impose mandatory human approval gates that cannot be automated away.
- **Most common wrong assumption:** That a CI tool configuration *is* a pipeline architecture. A CI YAML file is one implementation of a pipeline; the architecture decision is the stage sequence, gate logic, and promotion strategy — tool-agnostic.
- **Platform limits in play:** Apex test jobs time out at 10 minutes per test class. Validation-only deployments consume a deployment ID but do not alter org state; they are the correct mechanism for CI gate checks on sandboxes that cannot be modified mid-sprint.

---

## Core Concepts

### 1. Stage Sequence and Environment Topology

A Salesforce pipeline is a directed sequence of environments, each representing a higher level of change risk. The canonical stage sequence for an enterprise org-based deployment is:

```
Feature Branch
  → CI Validation Sandbox (read-only validation-only deploy + Apex tests)
    → Integration/QA Sandbox (full deploy, regression tests)
      → Staging / Full Sandbox (UAT, performance validation, final sign-off)
        → Production
```

DevOps Center supports a maximum of **15 pipeline stages per pipeline** (as documented in the DevOps Center Setup and Administration Guide). Pipelines with more than 15 stages must use a CLI-driven or third-party tool (Copado, Flosum, AutoRABIT) for the overflow stages.

Unlocked package pipelines replace environment promotion with version-controlled package versions; the stage sequence shifts to: `scratch org build → CI package version build → QA package install → staging package install → production package install`. The quality gate logic is identical; only the promotion artifact changes.

### 2. Quality Gates

A quality gate is a mandatory, automated check that must pass before metadata is promoted to the next stage. Gates are classified by type:

| Gate Type | Tool | Stage |
|---|---|---|
| Static analysis (PMD / Salesforce Code Analyzer) | External CI tool (not DevOps Center) | Feature Branch → CI |
| Validation-only deployment | `sf project deploy validate` | Feature Branch → CI |
| Apex test threshold (org-wide coverage ≥ 75%) | CI job parsing deployment results | CI → QA |
| Per-class coverage threshold (configurable ≥ 85% recommended) | Custom CI script | CI → QA |
| Regression test suite | CI job or Copado test automation | QA → Staging |
| Human approval / CAB | Pipeline tool gate or PR review | Staging → Production |

**DevOps Center does not provide custom quality gate configuration, code scanning, or test threshold enforcement.** These must be layered via GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, or a specialist DevOps tool. DevOps Center's built-in promotion check is limited to conflict detection and merge status.

### 3. Validation-Only Deployments as CI Gates

`sf project deploy validate` (or the legacy `sfdx force:source:deploy --checkonly`) deploys metadata and runs Apex tests against the target org without persisting any changes. It consumes a deployment ID that can later be used for a quick deploy (fast promotion). This makes it the correct mechanism for:

- CI gate checks on shared sandboxes that must not be modified mid-sprint
- Pre-production validation against a production-equivalent Full Sandbox
- SOX evidence of tested deployment packages before the change window

The validation job runs within the same Apex test timeout constraints as a real deployment. A single Apex test class that exceeds **10 minutes** will cause the validation to fail with a timeout error, not a test failure — the distinction matters for error handling in pipeline scripts.

### 4. Rollback Strategy

Salesforce does **not** provide a native rollback mechanism for declarative metadata (Flows, Page Layouts, Custom Objects, Profiles). Once a destructive change is deployed, it cannot be undone via the platform. The only rollback mechanisms are:

- **Git revert + re-deploy:** Revert the offending commit and deploy the reverted state. Valid for additive metadata changes.
- **Destructive changes package:** Manually construct a `destructiveChanges.xml` to remove the bad component. Required when the bad change added metadata that must now be removed.
- **Forward fix:** For Apex classes and LWC where a partial rollback would break dependent components, a forward fix commit is often faster and safer than a destructive rollback.
- **Sandbox restore (Full Sandbox only):** Salesforce allows a Full Sandbox to be refreshed from production, effectively rolling back to the production state. This is destructive to all sandbox-only changes and should be a last resort.

For unlocked packages, rollback is a package version install of the previous released version — cleaner but still requires a deployment window.

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Linear 5-Stage Enterprise Pipeline

**When to use:** Mid-to-large enterprise teams with 5–50 developers, weekly or biweekly releases, and a Full Sandbox available for UAT.

**How it works:**

```
Stage 1: CI Validation (Developer Sandbox or scratch org)
  Gate: PMD scan (zero critical violations), validation-only deploy, RunLocalTests ≥ 75% org coverage
Stage 2: Integration / QA (Developer Pro or Partial Copy Sandbox)
  Gate: Full deploy, smoke test suite passes, no open P1 defects
Stage 3: UAT (Full Sandbox — production data copy)
  Gate: Business sign-off, regression suite passes, performance benchmark passes
Stage 4: Staging (Full Sandbox configured as production mirror)
  Gate: Validation-only deploy to production confirms no last-minute conflicts; CAB approval
Stage 5: Production
  Gate: Scheduled change window; quick deploy using previously validated deployment ID
```

Each stage has exactly one promotion owner: an automated CI job for stages 1–2, a QA lead for stage 3, a release manager for stages 4–5.

**Why not fewer stages:** Collapsing QA and UAT onto one sandbox means business stakeholders are testing on an environment that changes under them mid-sprint. Separate sandboxes isolate risk.

### Pattern 2: Lightweight 3-Stage Pipeline (Small Team or Admin-Led)

**When to use:** Small teams (1–5 contributors), admin-led delivery, no dedicated QA sandbox budget, Agile sprints with low change volume.

**How it works:**

```
Stage 1: CI Validation (shared Developer Sandbox or scratch org)
  Gate: Validation-only deploy, RunLocalTests pass, basic Code Analyzer scan
Stage 2: QA/UAT (Partial Copy or Developer Sandbox)
  Gate: Human tester sign-off, full deploy passes
Stage 3: Production
  Gate: CAB approval or PR approval; deploy in change window
```

This pattern sacrifices performance testing and staging but is appropriate when the risk profile is low and sandbox cost is a constraint.

**Why not go to 2 stages:** Deploying directly from CI to production without a human-tested environment is appropriate only for non-customer-facing configuration with complete automated test coverage. Most Salesforce orgs do not meet this bar.

### Pattern 3: Package-Based (Unlocked Package) Pipeline

**When to use:** ISV or enterprise teams adopting modular packaging, multiple independently releasable components, or teams that need atomic rollback.

**How it works:**

```
Stage 1: Scratch Org Build + Unit Tests
  Gate: Package version build succeeds, all unit tests pass, PMD scan clean
Stage 2: QA Package Install (Developer Sandbox)
  Gate: Package installs cleanly, integration tests pass
Stage 3: Staging Package Install (Full Sandbox)
  Gate: All managed dependencies resolve, regression suite passes
Stage 4: Production Install
  Gate: Scheduled window, installation script tested in staging
```

Promotion artifact is a package version (04t ID), not a metadata zip. This makes the promotion immutable and auditable. The tradeoff is that package dependency management adds complexity — circular dependencies and namespace conflicts must be caught at Stage 1.

## Decision Guidance

| Situation | Recommended Approach | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Team has no Full Sandbox | 3-stage pipeline with Partial Copy for QA | Full Sandbox refresh cost is high; Partial Copy covers most regression risk |
| SOX or CAB requirement | 5-stage with mandatory human gate at Staging → Production | Automated pipelines cannot satisfy change control evidence requirements without a documented approval step |
| ISV / managed package release | Package-based pipeline with scratch org as Stage 1 | Managed packages require namespace isolation; scratch orgs provide clean slate for each build |
| Declarative-only changes (admin team) | 3-stage pipeline, DevOps Center for promotion | DevOps Center's GUI-driven promotion is appropriate for metadata-only change management; no code scanning needed |
| Multiple release trains (feature teams) | Separate pipelines per train converging at a shared staging sandbox | Prevents long-lived feature branches from blocking each other; converge at staging for integration |
| High-frequency releases (> 2/week) | Trunk-based development with automated CI gate; validation-only deploys on every PR | Long-lived branches with infrequent merges create integration debt; trunk-based development with quick deploys reduces the integration risk per release |

---

## Recommended Workflow

Step-by-step instructions for an AI agent or practitioner designing a Salesforce CI/CD pipeline:

1. **Establish the deployment model.** Confirm whether the project uses org-based deployment (Metadata API / SFDX), unlocked packages, or managed packages. The stage sequence and rollback options differ fundamentally. If the model is undecided, use decision guidance above and the `devops/devops-center-pipeline` skill for DevOps Center-specific implementation.

2. **Map environments to stages.** List all available sandbox types. Assign each sandbox a stage and a single promotion owner. Confirm that the Full Sandbox (if any) is reserved for staging or UAT — not used as a developer integration point. Document which orgs are shared vs. dedicated.

3. **Define quality gates per stage transition.** For each stage boundary, specify: (a) the automated checks that must pass (test level, coverage threshold, static analysis rule set), (b) the artifact produced (validation deployment ID, test result JUnit XML, scan report), and (c) whether a human approval gate is required. Align with any regulatory requirements before finalizing.

4. **Design the rollback and forward-fix strategy.** For each stage, document: what happens if a deployment fails mid-promotion, what the recovery procedure is, and who is responsible. Confirm whether a quick deploy (reusing a validation ID) is in the runbook for the Production stage. Document that declarative metadata has no native rollback and that git revert + redeploy is the recovery mechanism.

5. **Identify CI tool responsibilities.** Separate what the pipeline architecture requires (gates, thresholds, promotion rules) from what a specific CI tool will implement. Use `devops/github-actions-for-salesforce`, `devops/gitlab-ci-for-salesforce`, or `devops/continuous-integration-testing` for tool-specific implementation. If DevOps Center is in use, document its limitations (no custom quality gates, no code scanning) and layer external tooling as needed.

6. **Validate the pipeline design against platform limits.** Check: DevOps Center pipeline stage count ≤ 15; Apex test classes do not individually exceed 10 minutes (or document the timeout handling); destructive changes are tested on a staging sandbox before production; metadata coverage includes all component types in the release.

7. **Document and socialize the pipeline contract.** Record the stage sequence, gate definitions, and promotion owners in a runbook or ADR. Ensure all team members understand what can and cannot be automated. Review the pipeline design against the Well-Architected Operational Excellence pillar before finalizing.

## Review Checklist

Run through these before marking pipeline design work complete:

- [ ] Each stage has exactly one promotion owner and one unambiguous gate definition
- [ ] Validation-only deploy is used for CI gate checks (not a full deploy to shared sandboxes)
- [ ] Apex test coverage threshold is specified explicitly (recommend ≥ 75% org-wide, ≥ 85% per class for new code)
- [ ] Static analysis (Code Analyzer / PMD) is configured as a gate at the feature branch → CI transition
- [ ] Rollback strategy for declarative metadata is documented (git revert + redeploy or destructive changes package)
- [ ] DevOps Center stage count confirmed ≤ 15 if DevOps Center is the promotion tool
- [ ] Human approval gate is present before Production for SOX/CAB environments
- [ ] Unlocked package pipeline uses a scratch org for Stage 1 (not a shared sandbox)
- [ ] Quick deploy runbook exists for the Production stage (reuses validated deployment ID)
- [ ] Pipeline design has been reviewed against Well-Architected Operational Excellence pillar

## Salesforce-Specific Gotchas

Non-obvious platform behaviors that cause real production problems:

1. **No native rollback for declarative metadata** — Once a Flow, Page Layout, or Custom Object change is deployed to production, Salesforce has no "undo deployment" function. A rollback requires a git revert followed by a fresh deployment, which itself consumes a deployment slot and test run time. Teams that discover this mid-incident waste hours looking for a rollback button that does not exist. Include explicit rollback runbooks in every pipeline design.

2. **Apex test 10-minute timeout causes misleading pipeline failures** — A single Apex test class that runs longer than 10 minutes causes the deployment (or validation-only deploy) to fail with a timeout error, not a test failure assertion. CI scripts that parse test results looking for `<testsuites>` failures will miss this and may incorrectly mark the gate as passed. Add explicit timeout monitoring in pipeline scripts and split large test classes before the pipeline matures.

3. **DevOps Center max 15 pipeline stages** — DevOps Center enforces a hard limit of 15 stages per pipeline (per the DevOps Center Setup and Administration Guide). Orgs that grow beyond this (e.g., regulated orgs with 4+ UAT sandboxes, regional staging environments, a shared services stage) must either consolidate stages or move overflow stages to a CLI-based pipeline. Plan the stage topology within this limit from the start; retrofitting is costly.

4. **Quick deploy window expires after 4 days** — A validation-only deployment produces a deployment ID that can be used for a quick deploy (skipping test re-execution), but this ID expires after **96 hours**. If a CAB approval or release window falls outside that window, the full validation must be re-run. Pipeline runbooks must account for this when scheduling change windows relative to the last validation job.

5. **Partial Copy sandbox data is not production-equivalent** — Integration and regression tests that pass on a Partial Copy sandbox may fail on a Full Sandbox or production because Partial Copy only contains a representative data sample, not full data volume. Governor limit failures (SOQL rows, heap size) caused by data volume will not surface until the Full Sandbox stage. Never use a Partial Copy sandbox as the sole pre-production gate for data-intensive changes.
