# Connect REST API Patterns

Connect REST API exposes Chatter feeds, CMS content, Experience Cloud, and moderation APIs with richer shapes and side-effects than raw SObject access. Use it when the business operation is 'post a feed item with mentions' or 'publish CMS content' rather than 'insert FeedItem row'.

## Adoption Signals

Chatter posts with mentions / rich text, CMS content authoring, community moderation, reports filters at scale.

- Required when the standard REST/SOAP APIs would force the consumer to assemble Chatter feed elements by hand.
- Required for Experience Cloud surfaces where the same payload feeds both UI rendering and external clients.

## Recommended Workflow

1. Identify the Connect resource (`/connect/communities/{id}/chatter/feed-elements`).
2. Prefer `ConnectApi` Apex namespace over REST when inside Apex — same capability, better typing.
3. Pagination via `nextPageUrl` — don't compute offsets manually.
4. Authenticate with Named Credential + OAuth for external callers.
5. Test with low-privilege users to catch perm gaps before go-live.

## Key Considerations

- Connect API respects sharing; raw SObject queries as System Admin can mask issues.
- Response payloads are verbose; request only the fields you need via `?include` where supported.
- CMS endpoints require Experience Cloud license.
- Chatter posts via Connect create notifications — posting from a trigger can cascade.

## Worked Examples (see `references/examples.md`)

- *Post feed item with mention* — Notify record owner
- *CMS content publish* — Publish a Knowledge article

## Common Gotchas (see `references/gotchas.md`)

- **Missing community context** — Post appears in wrong feed.
- **Sharing mismatch** — Integration user can't post on behalf of another.
- **Verbose payload bloat** — Response 500kB.

## Top LLM Anti-Patterns (full list in `references/llm-anti-patterns.md`)

- Inserting FeedItem directly when mentions matter
- Manual pagination math
- Missing community context
