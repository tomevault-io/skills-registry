╰─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

## When to Use

This skill activates when:
- "search for information about"
- "find documentation on"
- "what's the best practice for"
- "look up how to"
- Need current/modern information not in training data
- Need official documentation or tutorials
- Need to compare technologies or find benchmarks

## Core Responsibilities

When you receive a research query:

1. **Analyze the Query**: Break down the request to identify:
   - Key search terms and concepts
   - Types of sources likely to have answers (documentation, blogs, forums, papers)
   - Multiple search angles to ensure comprehensive coverage
   - Temporal requirements (recent vs evergreen)

2. **Execute Strategic Searches**:
   - Start with broad searches to understand the landscape
   - Refine with specific technical terms and phrases
   - Use multiple search variations to capture different perspectives
   - Include site-specific searches for known authoritative sources
   - Use the cheapest method that fits (curl markdown.new/Google first, AI search when synthesis is needed)

3. **Fetch and Analyze Content**:
   - Retrieve full content from promising search results
   - Prioritize official documentation, reputable technical blogs, and authoritative sources
   - Extract specific quotes and sections relevant to the query
   - Note publication dates to ensure currency of information

4. **Synthesize Findings**:
   - Organize information by relevance and authority
   - Include exact quotes with proper attribution
   - Provide direct links to sources
   - Highlight any conflicting information or version-specific details
   - Note any gaps in available information

## Method 2: Google Search (Free)

Use Google for broad, keyword-based, and domain-specific web searches.

### Via `surf` browser automation
```
surf go https://www.google.com/search?q=your+search+query+here
surf read --compact
```

### Via `WebFetch` tool
```
WebFetch url="https://www.google.com/search?q=your+search+query+here"
```

### Tips for Google queries
- Use quotes for exact phrases: `"error message here"`
- Use `site:` for domain-specific: `site:docs.python.org asyncio`
- Use `-` to exclude: `python web framework -django`
- Use `after:YYYY-MM-DD` for recency: `kubernetes security after:2025-01-01`
- Use `filetype:` for specific formats: `filetype:pdf machine learning survey`

### Domain-specific searches
```
# Stack Overflow
surf go https://www.google.com/search?q=site:stackoverflow.com+your+query

# GitHub
surf go https://www.google.com/search?q=site:github.com+your+query

# Official docs
surf go https://www.google.com/search?q=site:docs.python.org+asyncio+best+practices
```

### Read search results, then fetch promising pages
```
# After reading Google results, fetch individual pages:
WebFetch url="https://promising-result-url.com"

# Or use surf for JS-heavy pages:
surf go https://promising-result-url.com
surf read --compact
```

---

## Method 3: ChatGPT Search (AI-Synthesized Answers)

Use ChatGPT's web search for synthesized, up-to-date answers with citations. Best when you need a quick, comprehensive summary with sources.

### Via `surf` browser automation
```
surf go https://chatgpt.com
surf type "your research question here" --submit
surf wait 10
surf read --compact
```

### When to use ChatGPT search
- Need a synthesized overview of a topic with citations
- Want multiple perspectives compared and summarized
- Looking for recent news or developments
- Need a starting point before deep-diving into specific sources

### Tips
- Be specific in your query for better results
- Ask follow-up questions in the same tab for deeper research
- ChatGPT provides source links — follow up on the most relevant ones with `WebFetch`

---

## Method 4: Claude Web Search (AI-Synthesized Answers)

Use Claude's web search for another AI-synthesized perspective. Good for cross-referencing ChatGPT results.

### Via `surf` browser automation
```
surf go https://claude.ai
surf type "search the web for: your research question here" --submit
surf wait 15
surf read --compact
```

### When to use Claude search
- Cross-reference findings from Google and ChatGPT
- Need a different analytical perspective
- Complex technical questions requiring deep reasoning
- When ChatGPT results seem incomplete or uncertain

---

## Method 1: Direct Fetch via curl (Primary — Markdown.new)

Use curl against markdown.new for clean, direct text retrieval.

### Fetch a webpage directly
```bash
curl -sL "https://markdown.new/https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html" | head -500
curl -sL "https://markdown.new/https://example.com" | head -500
```

### Fetch GitHub content
```bash
curl -sL "https://markdown.new/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owner/repo/main/README.md" | head -500
```

### Fetch JSON APIs (no markdown.new)
```bash
curl -sL "https://api.github.com/repos/astral-sh/uv" | head -200
curl -sL "https://pypi.org/pypi/requests/json" | head -200
curl -sL "https://registry.npmjs.org/typescript" | head -200
```

## Method 5: Exa.ai API (Semantic Search — Budget-Conscious)

Exa provides semantic/neural search with content retrieval. Use when you need intelligent, context-aware searching beyond what keyword search offers.

**Important**: Always load the API key with sops-nix fallback:
```bash
EXA_API_KEY="${EXA_API_KEY:-$(cat ~/.config/sops-nix/secrets/exa/api-key 2>/dev/null)}"
```

### Search with Content
```bash
EXA_API_KEY="${EXA_API_KEY:-$(cat ~/.config/sops-nix/secrets/exa/api-key 2>/dev/null)}"
curl -s "https://api.exa.ai/search" \
  -H "x-api-key: ${EXA_API_KEY}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "your search query here",
    "numResults": 5,
    "type": "auto",
    "contents": {
      "text": {"maxCharacters": 1000}
    }
  }' | jq '.results[] | {title, url, text}'
```

### Filter by Domain and Recency
```bash
EXA_API_KEY="${EXA_API_KEY:-$(cat ~/.config/sops-nix/secrets/exa/api-key 2>/dev/null)}"
curl -s "https://api.exa.ai/search" \
  -H "x-api-key: ${EXA_API_KEY}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "kubernetes security best practices",
    "numResults": 5,
    "type": "auto",
    "includeDomains": ["kubernetes.io", "github.com"],
    "maxAgeHours": 8760,
    "contents": {
      "text": {"maxCharacters": 800}
    }
  }' | jq '.results[] | {title, url, publishedDate, text}'
```

> ⚠️ **Budget**: ~$1/day max. Prefer Google/ChatGPT/Claude first. Use Exa only when semantic search adds clear value.

## Search Strategies

### For API/Library Documentation
- **Google**: `site:docs.python.org asyncio` or fetch docs URLs directly
- **Markdown.new**: `curl -sL "https://markdown.new/https://docs.python.org/3/..." | head -500`
- **GitHub**: `curl -sL "https://markdown.new/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/..." | head -500`
- Search for changelog or release notes for version-specific information

### For Best Practices
- **ChatGPT**: Ask for synthesized best practices with citations
- **Google**: Search for recent articles with `after:` date filter
- Cross-reference multiple sources to identify consensus
- Search for both "best practices" and "anti-patterns" to get full picture

### For Technical Solutions
- **Google**: Use specific error messages in quotes
- **ChatGPT/Claude**: Describe the problem for AI-synthesized solutions
- Search Stack Overflow: `site:stackoverflow.com` via Google
- Look for GitHub issues and discussions in relevant repositories

### For Comparisons
- **ChatGPT**: "Compare X vs Y for [use case]" — gets synthesized comparison
- **Google**: Search "X vs Y" for benchmark articles and blog posts
- **Claude**: Cross-reference for a different analytical perspective
- Find migration guides between technologies

## Quality Guidelines

- **Accuracy**: Always quote sources accurately and provide direct links
- **Relevance**: Focus on information that directly addresses the user's query
- **Currency**: Note publication dates and version information when relevant
- **Authority**: Prioritize official sources, recognized experts, and peer-reviewed content
- **Completeness**: Search from multiple angles to ensure comprehensive coverage
- **Transparency**: Clearly indicate when information is outdated, conflicting, or uncertain
- **Dynamic Dates**: NEVER hardcode years in queries — use Google's `after:` filter or Exa's `maxAgeHours`

## Search Efficiency

- **Cheapest method first**: Check if a direct URL fetch via curl + markdown.new answers the question
- **Google before AI search**: Use Google when you need specific links or domain-specific results
- **AI search for synthesis**: Use ChatGPT/Claude when you need summarized, multi-source answers
- **Start with 2-3 well-crafted searches** before fetching content
- **Fetch only the most promising 3-5 pages** initially
- If initial results are insufficient, refine search terms and try again
- **Batch related questions** into single searches when possible
