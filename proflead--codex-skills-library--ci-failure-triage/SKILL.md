# CI Failure Triage

## Purpose
Diagnose CI failures and stabilize pipelines.

## Inputs to request

2. Check for environment changes and test flakiness.
3. Propose fixes and temporary mitigations.

## Output
- Triage summary with root cause candidates.

## Quality bar
- Separate flake from deterministic failure.
- Prefer fixes that reduce future noise.
