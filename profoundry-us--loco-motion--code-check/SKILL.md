# Code Check

Reviews code changes for adherence to LocoMotion conventions before committing
or opening a PR.

## Instructions

### Step 1: See what changed

```bash
git diff
git diff --staged
```

Read every modified file. Do not skip files.

### Step 2: Check against each rule category

Work through the checklist below. Flag every violation with the file path and
line number.

#### Branch safety

- [ ] Not on `main` branch — run `python .claude/skills/shared-scripts/check_branch.py`

#### Component Ruby class

- [ ] Uses `define_part` (not `define_parts`) for each part.
- [ ] Does NOT include `part(:component)` — handled by `BaseComponent`.
- [ ] Does NOT define `_css` or `_html` properties for parts.
- [ ] DaisyUI variants (size, color, etc.) are applied via `css:` kwarg, NOT
      added as parameters.
- [ ] `setup_component` uses `add_css` / `add_html` correctly.
- [ ] No methods longer than ~20 lines without explanation.

#### YARD documentation

- [ ] Class-level comment follows order: description → notes → parts → slots
      → examples.
- [ ] Uses `@loco_example` (NOT `@example`).
- [ ] All `@param` / `@option` tags are on `initialize`, NOT on the class.
- [ ] Blank lines between each `@param` / `@option` entry.
- [ ] `@part` tags document every `define_part` call.
- [ ] `@slot` tags document every `renders_one` / `renders_many` call.
- [ ] Lines wrapped at 80 characters.
- [ ] No positional `@param` docs if `initialize` doesn't use them.

#### HAML template

- [ ] Template contains `= part(:component) do` — typically the root element,
      but components using `LabelableComponent` (or similar concerns) may wrap
      the root with additional markup. Verify against the component's base class.
- [ ] Logic is minimal — belongs in the Ruby class.

#### Spec file

- [ ] Test file mirrors the component path under `spec/components/`.
- [ ] At least one basic "renders" test exists.
- [ ] New behavior added in the class has corresponding spec coverage.

#### Example view

- [ ] Uses `doc_title` and `doc_example` helpers.
- [ ] Each `doc_example` has a `doc.with_description` block.
- [ ] Demonstrates new behavior introduced in this change.

#### helpers.rb (if modified)

- [ ] New component entry uses exact class name string.
- [ ] All required keys present: `names`, `group`, `title`, `example`.

### Step 3: Run the test suite

```bash
just loco-test
```

All tests must pass.

### Step 4: Report findings

List every violation with:

- File path and line number
- Which rule is violated
- A specific fix suggestion

If no violations are found, report "All checks passed" and note the test
result.

## Examples

**Example 1 — clean code check**

Output: "All checks passed. 142 examples, 0 failures."

**Example 2 — violation found**

Output:

```
Violations found:

1. app/components/daisy/actions/button_component.rb:12
   Rule: @loco_example required (not @example)
   Fix: Replace `@example Basic button` with `@loco_example Basic button`

2. app/components/daisy/actions/button_component.rb:8
   Rule: DaisyUI size/color variants must not be added as parameters
   Fix: Remove the `size:` parameter. Users should pass `css: "btn-lg"`.

Tests: 142 examples, 0 failures.
```

## Troubleshooting

**Unsure about a rule** — Check `.windsurf/rules/` for the authoritative source.
Files: `coding.md`, `component_implementation.md`, `documenting_code.md`.

**Test suite cannot run** — Verify Docker containers are running:
`docker compose ps`. Start with `docker compose up -d` if needed.

**Large diff with many files** — Work file by file. Check component files first,
then specs, then views.
