# Fine-Tuning Pipeline

Train language models with SFT, KTO, and GRPO locally or on supported cloud providers. This skill also covers the Karpathy-style experiment loop, checkpoint evaluation, LoRA surgery, and the current HF Jobs operational path.

## Training Methods at a Glance

| Method | Purpose | LR | Epochs | Dataset | When to Use |
|--------|---------|----|--------|---------|-------------|
| **SFT** | Teach format and behavior | 2e-4 | 3 | Positive examples only | First stage |
| **KTO** | Refine with preferences | 1e-6 | 1 | Interleaved True/False | Second stage |
| **GRPO** | Optimize against rewards | 5e-6 | 1 | Prompts + ground truth | Final online stage |

**Recommended pipeline:** SFT → KTO → GRPO

## Complexity Tiers

Use `--tier` on the local SFT and KTO trainers when you want a preset instead of hand-tuning LoRA rank and LR.

| Tier | LoRA Rank | LR | Time | Use Case |
|------|-----------|----|------|----------|
| `quick` | r=8 | 5e-4 | ~5 min | Prototyping and smoke runs |
| `standard` | r=64 | 2e-4 | ~30-60 min | Normal training |
| `thorough` | r=128 | 1e-4 | ~2-4 hrs | Quality-focused final runs |

## Key Directories

- `Trainers/rtx3090_sft/` — SFT trainer
- `Trainers/rtx3090_kto/` — KTO trainer
- `Trainers/grpo/` — GRPO and env-GRPO trainer
- `Trainers/cloud/jobs/` — checked-in HF Jobs configs
- `Datasets/` — JSONL training datasets
- `SynthChat/scenarios/` — synthetic data and environment-backed scenarios
- `shared/flywheel/` — autonomous experiment-loop logic and LightGBM surrogate search
- `Trainers/ml/` — traditional ML / LightGBM training for tabular experiment analysis
- `shared/experiment_tracking/` — unified run and experiment tracking

## CLI Discipline

- Never cancel a job, delete bucket artifacts, remove files, or relaunch a cost-incurring cloud run unless the user has explicitly approved that exact action in the current conversation.
- Treat cancel/delete/relaunch as irreversible or materially destructive operator actions. Do not infer permission from surrounding context or from a user's broader goal.
- Do not guess command names or flags from memory.
- Before giving command guidance, check `tuner/cli/parser.py`, `tuner/cli/router.py`, or the real `--help` output.
- Prefer repo CLIs and checked-in scripts over ad hoc Python snippets.
- After benchmark runs complete, treat the checked-in benchmark ledger as part of the workflow:
  - [model_hardware_benchmark_ledger.md](/Users/jrosenbaum/Documents/Code/Synthetic%20Conversations/docs/benchmarks/model_hardware_benchmark_ledger.md)
  - [model_hardware_benchmark_ledger.csv](/Users/jrosenbaum/Documents/Code/Synthetic%20Conversations/docs/benchmarks/model_hardware_benchmark_ledger.csv)
- Treat stage lineage as the source of truth for automation:
  - training: `training_lineage.json`
  - evaluation: `evaluation_lineage.json`
  - exact loss: `loss_lineage.json`
- Treat `loss_summary.json` as a supporting artifact, not the canonical final loss metadata file.
- The ledger should accumulate real model-size / hardware / timing / cost data so future hardware planning can optimize against observed evidence instead of memory.
- For local trainer iteration, use the checked-in `train_sft.py`, `train_kto.py`, and `train_grpo.py` entrypoints.
- For canonical HF experiments, prefer `python tuner.py cloud-pipeline ...` over `cloud-run`.
- For full train → eval → exact loss → analysis → recommendation runs, prefer `python tuner.py run-experiment ...`.
- Evolutionary SFT is experimental but now first-class in the cloud experiment path. Prefer a checked-in experiment spec or `cloud-pipeline --train-evolutionary-*` overrides over editing trainer YAMLs by hand.
- Use evolutionary training for technical validation or targeted experiments first. It adds significant per-step compute overhead, so smoke tests should usually cap `max_steps` before you commit to a long run.
- For multi-spec benchmark launches, prefer `python3 scripts/launch_experiment_batch.py ...` over back-to-back manual submissions. It defaults to a 5-second stagger.
- For blind stage hardware selection before launch, use `python tuner.py plan-hardware ...`.
- For live HF status and traceback inspection, use `python tuner.py cloud-jobs ...`.
- For finished experiment bundles and next-run suggestions, use `python tuner.py analyze-experiment ...`.
- For loss-driven dataset cleanup, start with `python3 scripts/prune_dataset_from_loss.py ... --analyze-only`; only apply a pruning rule after checking which families are actually enriched in the high-loss slice.
- Prefer the generic pruning strategies first (`loss_threshold`, `top_percent`). Use repo-specific presets only when the analysis output shows that exact family is genuinely overrepresented.
- For in-flight cloud-run health checks, inspect the bucket-backed artifacts first (`training_latest.jsonl`, `stage_summary.json`, `training_lineage.json`, eval/loss partials). Use raw HF logs only as a fallback when the bucket prefix has not started writing yet.
- For quick bucket spot checks, use `python tuner.py bucket read ...` or `python tuner.py bucket list ...` instead of manual `hf buckets cp` commands.
- For local inspection or offline diffing, use `python tuner.py bucket pull ...` to sync a bucket-relative path into the current workspace while preserving its relative path.
- For one-off uploads back into the HF artifact bucket, use `python tuner.py bucket push ...` instead of ad hoc `sync_bucket` snippets.
- For `a100-large` or larger tiers, bias toward aggressive packing. Do not lower batch just because the adapter recipe changed. Start from the highest known-good packed shape for the same model family and only back off after a real OOM or clear instability signal.
- Treat large unused VRAM on `a100-large` as a mistake, not a comfort margin. If `training_lineage.json` shows tens of GB of reserved headroom, the run is underpacked and the next iteration should push batch size harder even if that risks OOM.
- For vLLM eval on multi-GPU hardware, prequantized BitsAndBytes base models (for example `*-bnb-4bit`) cannot use tensor parallelism. Do not assume `x4` means vLLM will shard generation across all GPUs; in this path, eval may need to fall back to single-GPU while exact loss still fans out across all visible GPUs afterward.
- For experiment specs in this repo, set `evaluation.runtime: vllm` and `evaluation.image_profile: fast_vllm` by default. Do not silently switch an experiment to `unsloth` eval just because the model family is new. If vLLM compatibility is uncertain, verify current official support and ask the user before deviating from the vLLM path.
- When the user says "latest run" or "latest experiment", distinguish `latest attempt` from `latest completed baseline`. Check `.tracking/experiments/*/experiment.json` sorted by `created_at` first, then state explicitly which interpretation you are using before copying hyperparameters forward.
- When choosing an A100 packed shape, prefer the nearest latest attempt that actually exercised the hardware over an older completed baseline that clearly underpacked the card.
- If `run-experiment` refuses to launch because the tracked worktree is dirty, prefer creating a clean temporary git worktree and launching from there over asking the user to stash or cleaning their checkout.
- If a cloud run fails before bucket artifacts appear, treat it as a bootstrap/runtime problem first. Inspect `cloud-jobs logs` before changing training hyperparameters.
- For newly released architectures or day-zero model launches, verify official Docker Hub tags for `unsloth/unsloth` and `vllm/vllm-openai` before trusting the repo's pinned image profiles. As of 2026-04-02, Docker Hub shows `unsloth/unsloth:latest` updated 1 day ago and `vllm/vllm-openai:latest` / `v0.17.1` updated about 17 hours ago.
- If a named training image profile is broken, prefer an explicit `training.cloud_image` override to a currently verified official image tag over changing unrelated parts of the experiment such as evaluation backend.
- If a run needs newer package versions but the right base image is otherwise close, use stage-local experiment-spec `pip_packages` pins under `training:`, `evaluation:`, or `loss:` instead of a one-off helper script or a repo-global image pin.
- For hyperparameter search, use `python tuner.py experiment-loop ...`; this is the built-in LLM + LightGBM surrogate path.
- For tabular post-hoc models, use `python tuner.py ml ...` and the configs under `Trainers/ml/configs/templates/`.

## Research Note Lifecycle

Use [`.skills/research-reporting/SKILL.md`](/Users/jrosenbaum/Documents/Code/Synthetic%20Conversations/.skills/research-reporting/SKILL.md) alongside this skill whenever the user wants experiment tracking, research summaries, or reusable post-run analysis.

- When a training run or experiment is launched, create the research note immediately rather than waiting for all stages to finish.
- The initial note should capture config intent from `experiment.json` and `spec_path`, with `stage_statuses` set from the current known state and metrics left `null` or empty where evidence does not exist yet.
- After training finishes, update the same note with training provenance from `training_lineage.json` or `stage_details.training`.
- After evaluation finishes, update the same note with evaluation metrics and observed failure patterns.
- After loss finishes, update the same note with loss metrics, high-loss hashes, and any dataset-review signals.
- After analysis/recommendation finishes, update the same note with hypotheses, selected candidate rank, and recommended next action.
- Do not fork separate notes per stage unless the user explicitly asks for per-stage notes. Default is one note per experiment, updated over time.
- Treat the note as a living artifact for the run: launch state, in-flight updates, and final postmortem should all land in the same document.
- If a stage has not run yet or failed, preserve the section and leave missing values explicit instead of inventing placeholders.

## Common Patterns

**Quick SFT test run:**
```bash
cd Trainers/rtx3090_sft
python train_sft.py --model-size 3b --tier quick --dry-run
```

**KTO with local dataset:**
```bash
cd Trainers/rtx3090_kto
python train_kto.py --model-size 7b --local-file ../../Datasets/my_kto_data.jsonl
```

**GRPO continuing from SFT checkpoint:**
```bash
# Edit configs/config.yaml to set model.lora_path to SFT checkpoint
cd Trainers/grpo
python train_grpo.py
```

**Autonomous hyperparameter search:**
```bash
python tuner.py experiment-loop \
  --experiment-config configs/flywheel/experiment_loop.yaml \
  --max-experiments 10
```

**Post-training LoRA surgery:**
```bash
python tuner.py surgery --surgery-config configs/lora_surgery.yaml
```

**Inspect live HF jobs:**
```bash
python tuner.py cloud-jobs list --limit 20
python tuner.py cloud-jobs show --job professorsynapse/<job-id>
python tuner.py cloud-jobs logs --job professorsynapse/<job-id> --tail 200
```
Gotcha:
- `cloud-jobs show` is useful, but for real progress checks prefer the bucket-backed artifacts once they exist. Early raw logs are often just bootstrap noise; the bucket tells you when training/eval/loss has actually started producing useful state.

**Read the latest training record from a bucket-backed run:**
```bash
python tuner.py bucket read \
  --path runs/hf_jobs/sft/<run-prefix>/logs/training_latest.jsonl \
  --jsonl-latest \
  --pretty
```

**Tail the structured progress log or summary artifact directly from the bucket:**
```bash
python tuner.py bucket analyze \
  --path runs/hf_jobs/sft/<run-prefix>/

python tuner.py bucket read \
  --path runs/hf_jobs/sft/<run-prefix>/logs/training_latest.jsonl \
  --tail 5

python tuner.py bucket read \
  --path runs/hf_jobs/sft/<run-prefix>/logs/stage_summary.json \
  --pretty

python tuner.py bucket list \
  --path runs/hf_jobs/sft/<run-prefix>/ \
  --limit 20

python tuner.py bucket pull \
  --path runs/hf_jobs/sft/<run-prefix>/analysis/loss/ \
  --dest .

python tuner.py bucket push \
  --path local/analysis/notes.json \
  --dest runs/manual_uploads/
```

Gotcha:
- Use `bucket analyze` first when a run has finished. It summarizes `training_lineage.json`, the newest `evaluation_lineage.json`, and `loss_lineage.json` in one pass.
- If the same training run has multiple eval reruns or alternate loss prefixes, pass `--eval-path` and/or `--loss-path` explicitly so the summary cannot attach to the wrong post-training artifacts.
- If schema pass rate is strong but behavior pass rate is still weak, do not assume you need more tool-call syntax SFT. That pattern usually means the next bottleneck is text-only restraint, clarification, or verify-before-action behavior.

**Canonical one-off HF experiment with direct overrides:**
```bash
python tuner.py cloud-pipeline --method sft --preset full \
  --train-model-name Qwen/Qwen3.5-2B \
  --train-image-profile next \
  --train-gpu a10g-small \
  --train-batch-size 8 \
  --train-gradient-accumulation 4 \
  --train-lora-r 128 \
  --train-lora-alpha 256 \
  --train-use-rslora \
  --train-use-dora \
  --train-no-load-in-4bit \
  --train-lora-target-modules q_proj,k_proj,v_proj,o_proj,gate_proj,up_proj,down_proj \
  --yes

python tuner.py cloud-pipeline --method sft \
  --train-model-name Qwen/Qwen3-4B \
  --train-gpu a100-large \
  --train-batch-size 24 \
  --train-gradient-accumulation 2 \
  --train-learning-rate 1e-4 \
  --train-max-steps 60 \
  --train-evolutionary-enabled \
  --train-evolutionary-candidates 4 \
  --train-evolutionary-eval-batch-size 2 \
  --train-evolutionary-validation-config configs/fitness/tool_calling.yaml \
  --train-evolutionary-strategy gradient_noise \
  --train-evolutionary-noise-scale 0.03 \
  --train-evolutionary-max-grad-norm 1.0 \
  --train-evolutionary-selection-method best \
  --train-evolutionary-min-improvement 0.01 \
  --train-evolutionary-eval-frequency 5 \
  --train-evolutionary-warmup-steps 200 \
  --yes
```
For SFT experiments, the cloud and experiment surfaces now accept:
- `--train-save-steps` — Override checkpoint save frequency (steps)
- `--train-save-total-limit` — Override max checkpoints kept
- `--train-lora-r`
- `--train-lora-alpha`
- `--train-lora-dropout`
- `--train-use-dora`
- `--train-use-rslora`
- `--train-init-lora-weights`
- `--train-lora-target-modules`

Gotcha:
- `init_lora_weights=loftq` is the only research-style init currently wired for the stable Unsloth SFT path. EVA, PiSSA, and OLoRA still need a separate PEFT-first path.
- `lora_target_modules: all-linear` is forwarded now, but the legacy Unsloth path is still the riskier runtime. Use an explicit module list for the stable baseline.

**Cloud training + eval in one flow:**
```bash
python tuner.py cloud-pipeline --method sft --preset full
```

**Full experiment with train → eval → exact loss → analysis:**
```bash
python tuner.py run-experiment \
  --experiment-spec Trainers/cloud/experiments/qwen3_4b_full_cycle_full.yaml \
  --yes
```

**Blind hardware planning before launch:**
```bash
python tuner.py plan-hardware \
  --experiment-spec Trainers/cloud/experiments/qwen3_4b_full_cycle_full.yaml \
  --optimize-for balanced
```

**Run experiment with auto hardware selection:**
```bash
python tuner.py run-experiment \
  --experiment-spec Trainers/cloud/experiments/qwen3_4b_full_cycle_full.yaml \
  --auto-hardware \
  --optimize-for cost \
  --yes
```

**Prepare a fixed-tier GPU benchmark matrix for the same model:**
```bash
python tuner.py plan-hardware --experiment-spec Trainers/cloud/experiments/qwen3_4b_full_cycle_benchmark_l4x1.yaml --optimize-for cost
python tuner.py plan-hardware --experiment-spec Trainers/cloud/experiments/qwen3_4b_full_cycle_benchmark_a10g_small.yaml --optimize-for cost
python tuner.py plan-hardware --experiment-spec Trainers/cloud/experiments/qwen3_4b_full_cycle_benchmark_a100_large.yaml --optimize-for cost
```
Use this when you want three comparable full-pipeline runs of the same model across increasing GPU tiers. Keep the GPU pinned in the spec, leave training batch/grad accumulation unset, and let `run-experiment --auto-hardware` fill the batch shape for that tier.
Gotcha:
- `--auto-hardware` can change `batch_size` and `gradient_accumulation` per hardware tier. When comparing speed/cost, always record the resolved training shape alongside the GPU flavor. Otherwise you can misread a faster run as “better hardware” when part of the gain came from a larger planner-selected batch.
- `run-experiment` analysis now appends or updates the checked-in benchmark ledger automatically when analysis runs. If you are comparing ad hoc runs outside experiment orchestration, add or backfill the ledger deliberately.
- When launching several experiment specs in one sweep, do not submit them back-to-back by hand. Use `python3 scripts/launch_experiment_batch.py ... --stagger-seconds 5`. That avoids same-second job submission races and keeps artifact prefixes easier to track.

**Launch a staggered experiment-spec benchmark batch:**
```bash
python3 scripts/launch_experiment_batch.py \
  Trainers/cloud/experiments/qwen3_4b_full_cycle_benchmark_l40sx1_pruned.yaml \
  Trainers/cloud/experiments/qwen3_4b_full_cycle_benchmark_a100_large_pruned.yaml \
  --auto-hardware \
  --optimize-for cost \
  --yes
```

**Resume or slice the experiment pipeline:**
```bash
python tuner.py run-experiment --experiment-spec Trainers/cloud/experiments/qwen3_4b_full_cycle_full.yaml --from-stage evaluation --yes
python tuner.py run-experiment --experiment-spec Trainers/cloud/experiments/qwen3_4b_full_cycle_full.yaml --only-stage loss --yes
python tuner.py run-experiment --experiment-spec Trainers/cloud/experiments/qwen3_4b_full_cycle_full.yaml --skip-stage analysis --skip-stage recommendation --yes
```

**Inspect the finished experiment bundle and next-run candidates:**
```bash
python tuner.py analyze-experiment --experiment-id latest
python tuner.py analyze-experiment --experiment-id exp_20260321_221651 --json
```

**Analyze a dataset against finished per-example loss before pruning:**
```bash
python3 scripts/prune_dataset_from_loss.py \
  --dataset-path Datasets/synthchat/my_dataset.jsonl \
  --experiment-id exp_20260322_103122 \
  --analyze-only
```

**Apply a generic pruning rule:**
```bash
python3 scripts/prune_dataset_from_loss.py \
  --dataset-path Datasets/synthchat/my_dataset.jsonl \
  --experiment-id exp_20260322_103122 \
  --strategy loss_threshold \
  --min-loss 2.0
```

**Apply a capped generic prune budget instead of a hard loss threshold:**
```bash
python3 scripts/prune_dataset_from_loss.py \
  --dataset-path Datasets/synthchat/my_dataset.jsonl \
  --experiment-id exp_20260322_103122 \
  --strategy top_percent \
  --top-percent 0.02
```

**Apply the current repo-specific result-echo preset and publish in one step:**
```bash
python3 scripts/prune_dataset_from_loss.py \
  --dataset-path Datasets/synthchat/my_dataset.jsonl \
  --experiment-id exp_20260322_103122 \
  --strategy result_echo_linesdelta_recommendations \
  --publish-repo professorsynapse/claudesidian-synthetic-dataset
```
Use this only when the analysis report shows that `text_only` result-echo recap rows are genuinely overrepresented in the high-loss slice. Do not assume that family is always the right prune target.

**Environment-backed gym against latest trained adapter on HF:**
```bash
python tuner.py cloud-gym --run latest --method sft
```

**Tabular LightGBM experiment:**
```bash
python tuner.py ml train --config Trainers/ml/configs/templates/regression.yaml
```

## Environment Variables

```bash
HF_TOKEN=hf_...
WANDB_API_KEY=...
MODAL_TOKEN_ID=...
MODAL_TOKEN_SECRET=...
RUNPOD_API_KEY=...
```

## Output Structure

Local trainers produce timestamped run directories:
```
{method}_output_rtx3090/YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/
├── checkpoints/
├── logs/
├── final_model/
└── training_lineage.json
```

Cloud runs use the canonical provider-native layout:
```
runs/{provider}/{method}/{timestamp}-{shortsha}/
├── checkpoints/
├── capacity_features.json
├── logs/
├── final_model/
├── training_lineage.json
└── manifest.json
```

Provider-native storage defaults:
- `hf_jobs` → Hugging Face Bucket
- `modal` → Modal Volume
- `runpod` → RunPod Network Volume

## HF Jobs Notes

- Launch from a clean tracked worktree and a pushed commit only; the remote container checks out that exact SHA.
- Keep the main training interpreter compatible with Unsloth and Transformers; any Buckets-only `huggingface_hub` upgrade must stay isolated from the trainer runtime.
- Pass `HF_TOKEN` into the cloud job explicitly; do not assume HF Jobs injects it automatically.
- Treat blank `HF_TOKEN` / `HF_API_KEY` values as unset, otherwise bucket sync can fail with `Authorization: Bearer `.
- For post-training cloud evaluation, prefer `python tuner.py cloud-eval --run latest --preset full`.
- `run-experiment` now supports stage controls: `--only-stage`, `--from-stage`, and repeated `--skip-stage`.
- `run-experiment --auto-hardware` uses a blind planner: model size, method, seq length, quantization, and live HF flavor pricing. It does not require prior telemetry.
- `plan-hardware` is the inspection surface for that same planner.
- When using `--auto-hardware`, treat the resolved `batch_size` / `gradient_accumulation` as part of the experiment definition. Compare wall-clock and cost only after checking those resolved values.
- After training finishes, read `training_lineage.json` before declaring the hardware/batch shape “good enough.” If peak reserved VRAM is still far below device capacity, the run is underpacked and the next iteration should push batch utilization harder.
- On `a100-large`, the default posture should be: push it until it breaks, then back off one notch. A large A100 headroom cushion is usually wasted iteration speed.
- Finished experiments now write `.tracking/experiments/<id>/analysis/` with:
  `experiment_summary.json`, `run_matrix.csv`, `feature_dataset.{jsonl,csv}`, `next_run_candidates.json`, `draft_next_spec.yaml`.
- For the common train-then-evaluate flow, prefer `python tuner.py cloud-pipeline --method sft --preset full`.
- `cloud-pipeline` is currently a two-job orchestration on HF Jobs, not a single remote composite job.
- `run-experiment` is the higher-level experiment loop: training stays provider-native, then evaluation and exact dataset loss run as separate sibling post-training jobs by default.
- Use `evaluation.runtime: vllm` in experiment specs when you want the fast eval server path. The exact loss stage still uses a post-eval `transformers` forward pass.
- If you explicitly want the older embedded path for a smoke run, set `post_training.mode: same_job` in the experiment spec. Default is `parallel`.
- For `cloud-eval --with-loss` or `post_training.mode: same_job`, stage-local overlay packages such as `peft` must be on the evaluator process `PYTHONPATH`, not only the bucket-sync helper path. If exact loss says a package is "required" even though the command installed it into `/tmp/hf-eval-site`, inspect the runtime `PYTHONPATH` export first.
- Checkpoint-vs-checkpoint comparison is not automatic in smoke runs; you only get that if the trainer emitted multiple checkpoints and you intentionally run checkpoint evaluation / experiment-loop workflows.
- For SFT model-comparison experiments, use `cloud-pipeline` with `--train-*` overrides so the experiment lands in canonical HF training storage instead of `runs/hf_jobs/custom/...`.
- When testing newer upstream Unsloth runtimes, switch images with `--train-image-profile next` instead of upgrading packages in the old stable image.
- To inspect a finished HF cloud evaluation run from the bucket, use `python tuner.py cloud-inspect --run latest --eval-run latest --method sft`.
- Completed SFT/KTO runs save a flat `capacity_features.json` artifact designed for tabular modeling or capacity prediction.

## Tips

- Always `--dry-run` first to verify setup without training.
- Use `--tier quick` for fast prototyping and `--tier thorough` for final quality runs.
- Use `--model-size 3b` for fast iteration and `7b` for production-style runs.
- SFT with `packing: true` is much faster.
- KTO datasets must be interleaved True/False.
- GRPO rewards are YAML-driven; edit `configs/rewards/`, not Python.
- `fitness.yaml` uses `FitnessEvaluator` for structural validation.
- After training, use surgery only after you have a stable baseline and evaluation scenario.
- `training_lineage.json` tracks full provenance for reproducibility.
