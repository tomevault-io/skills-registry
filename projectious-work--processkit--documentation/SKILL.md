# Documentation

## Intro

Good documentation answers the questions a reader actually has:
what is this, how do I use it, why does it work this way. Identify
the audience first, then write the smallest doc that serves them.
Doc comments live with the code; READMEs live with the project.

## Overview

### Identify the audience

Decide before writing whether the reader is a developer integrating
the API, an end-user running the tool, or a future maintainer
reading the source. Each gets a different doc.

### README structure

For a project README:

1. **What it is** — one sentence
2. **Quick start** — install command and the first useful command
3. **Usage examples** — the 2-3 most common cases
4. **Configuration reference** — flags, env vars, config files
5. **Contributing guide** — only if open source

### API documentation

Every public function gets a doc comment. Include:

- What it does (one sentence)
- Parameters
- Return value
- Errors or panics
- A short usage example for non-obvious APIs

### Inline comments

Use inline comments sparingly:

- Comment **why**, not **what** — the code shows the what.
- Document non-obvious business rules.
- Explain workarounds with links to issues or specs.
- Never comment out code — delete it. Git remembers.

### Locality

Keep docs close to code. Doc comments beat wiki pages beat
external sites. The further docs travel from the code, the faster
they go stale.

## Gotchas

Agent-specific failure modes — provider-neutral pause-and-self-check items:

- **Writing docs before identifying the audience.** Documentation for a developer integrating an API is completely different from documentation for a user running a tool. Write the wrong one and it helps nobody. Identify the reader before writing the first word.
- **Restating the code in comments.** `# increments i` next to `i += 1` adds noise, not signal. Comments explain why — the business rule, the workaround, the non-obvious constraint — not what, which the code already shows.
- **Tutorial-as-README.** A README is a map, not a textbook. A 3,000-word introductory walkthrough in the README buries the quick start. Link to a tutorial; don't inline it.
- **TODO comments without owners or dates.** A TODO without an owner and a deadline becomes permanent infrastructure. Either fix it immediately, file a ticket and link it, or delete the TODO.
- **Stale comments that contradict the code.** A comment that says one thing while the code does another is actively harmful — it misdirects the reader. Update or delete comments on every change that touches the relevant code.
- **Undocumented public API.** Every exported symbol is a promise. If a function is worth exporting, it's worth a doc comment that explains what it does, its parameters, its return value, and any surprising behavior.
- **Docs stored far from the code.** Wiki pages and external sites go stale because the friction of updating them is higher than the friction of updating the code. Keep docs close to code; doc comments beat wikis.

## Full reference

### Example doc comment

```rust
/// Calculates the shipping cost based on weight and destination zone.
///
/// Returns `None` if the destination zone is not serviceable.
/// Weights over 30kg use freight pricing instead.
```

The example is short, names the inputs and outputs, and surfaces
the two non-obvious rules (unservicable zones return `None`,
heavy items switch to freight).

### Anti-patterns

- **Restating the code** — `// increments i` next to `i += 1`.
- **Stale comments** — comments that contradict the code are
  worse than no comments. Delete or update them on every change.
- **Tutorial-as-README** — a README is a map, not a textbook.
  Link to the tutorial; don't inline it.
- **Undocumented public API** — every exported symbol is a
  promise. If it's worth exporting, it's worth a doc comment.
- **TODO comments without owners or dates** — they rot. Either
  fix it or file a ticket and link the ticket id.

### When to write less

A function with a self-evident name and a short body usually
needs no doc comment. Save the words for the parts where the
reader might be surprised.
