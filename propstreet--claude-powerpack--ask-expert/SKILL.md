# Expert Consultation Document Creator

Create comprehensive technical consultation documents by extracting code, diffs, and architectural context within LLM token limits (125KB).

## Document Structure

### Part 1: Problem Context (~15-25 KB)
1. **Problem** — Issue, errors, test failures
2. **Our Solution** — What was implemented and why
3. **Concerns** — Code smells, coupling, architectural questions
4. **Alternatives** — Other approaches, trade-offs

### Part 2: Complete Architecture (~60-90 KB)
5. **Architecture Overview** — ASCII diagram, data flow, patterns
6. **Components** — Frontend, tests, controllers
7. **Services** — Implementation and interfaces
8. **Models** — Domain entities with relationships

### Part 3: Expert Request (~5-10 KB)
9. **Questions** — Specific technical questions
10. **Success Criteria** — Requirements and priorities

## Workflow

### Step 1: Write Problem Context

Create a descriptive file like `{topic}-consultation.md` with the problem context, your solution, concerns, alternatives, and an architecture overview.

### Step 2: Extract Code

Use the bundled extraction script with size tracking. The script accepts multiple files in one call — batch for efficiency.

```bash
node scripts/extract-code.js \
  --track-size --output=doc.md \
  --section="Core Files" \
  file1.ts file2.ts file3.ts \
  --section="Tests" \
  test1.ts test2.ts
```

**File format options:**
- Full file: `src/Service.cs`
- Line ranges: `src/Service.cs:100-200` or `src/Service.cs:1-30,100-150`
- Git diff (per-file): `src/Service.cs:diff` or `src/Service.cs:diff=master..HEAD`

**Git diff options (all changes):**
- Staged changes: `--staged`
- Commit changes: `--commit=abc123` or `--commit=HEAD~1`

**Branch-level options (PR consultations):**
- All branch changes: `--branch-diff=master` (auto-resolves merge base)
- Full source of new files: `--new-files-from=master` (syntax-highlighted, not diff format)

**Prefer FULL files over chunks** for better expert analysis. Use chunks only for very large files.

### Step 3: Add Expert Request

Append an "Expert Guidance Request" section to the end of the document with:

- **Questions** — Numbered list of specific technical questions derived from the user's concerns
- **Success Criteria** — Bullet list of requirements and priorities
- **"Please answer in English"** — Always include as the final line

This section is critical — without it, the expert has no actionable request.

### Step 4: Verify Size

Check the file size — it should be 100-125 KB. DO NOT read the full file back (exceeds context).

## Code Extraction Examples

See [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md) for detailed usage patterns.

**With sections:**
```bash
node scripts/extract-code.js \
  --track-size --output=doc.md \
  --section="What Changed" \
  src/Service.cs:diff \
  --section="Implementation" \
  src/Service.cs src/Model.cs
```

**Using config file:**
```bash
node scripts/extract-code.js \
  --config=extraction-plan.json
```

**Staged or commit changes:**
```bash
node scripts/extract-code.js \
  --staged --track-size --output=doc.md

node scripts/extract-code.js \
  --commit=abc123 --track-size --output=doc.md
```

**PR consultation (single command for all branch changes):**
```bash
node scripts/extract-code.js \
  --branch-diff=master --track-size --output=consultation.md

# With full source of new files (syntax-highlighted, not diff format)
node scripts/extract-code.js \
  --branch-diff=master --new-files-from=master \
  --track-size --output=consultation.md
```

## Config File Format

```json
{
  "output": "consultation.md",
  "trackSize": true,
  "sections": [
    {
      "header": "What Changed",
      "files": ["src/Service.cs:diff"]
    },
    {
      "header": "Core Implementation",
      "files": ["src/Service.cs", "src/Model.cs"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Code Inclusion Priority

**Must include:**
- Core interfaces/abstractions
- Modified/bug-fix code
- Domain models
- Key service methods
- Test examples

**Skip if tight on space:**
- Boilerplate
- Simple DTOs
- Repetitive test setups

## Gotchas

- The 125KB limit is enforced by the extraction script — it warns at 100KB and 115KB, then exits at 125KB
- Always use `--track-size` to stay within the limit
- Don't read the completed document back into context — it's too large
- The script appends to existing files, so you can build incrementally
- Shell constructs like `$()` and variable assignments in Bash calls can trigger permission prompts. Prefer simple, single-command calls when possible.
