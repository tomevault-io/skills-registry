description: Teach and apply Effect-TS practices (effect, @effect/schema, @effect/platform) for architecture, typed errors, Layers, dependency injection, resource safety, testing, and migration from async/await/Promise. Use when a user asks how to use Effect, requests best practices, wants to refactor to Effect, or needs mapping from platform modules to Node/Bun/Browser APIs. Use when this capability is needed.

# Effect TS Guide

## Overview

Use this skill to teach Effect-TS fundamentals and best practices, then apply them to user code and architecture questions.

## Teaching workflow

1. Clarify context: runtime (node/bun/browser), goal (new app, refactor, review), and constraints.
2. Separate core vs shell: identify pure domain logic vs effects and boundaries.
3. Model errors and dependencies: define tagged error types and Context.Tag service interfaces.
4. Compose with Effect: use pipe/Effect.gen, typed errors, and Layer provisioning.
5. Validate inputs at boundaries with @effect/schema before entering core.
6. Explain resource safety: acquireRelease, scoped lifetimes, and clean finalizers.
7. Provide minimal, runnable examples tailored to the user context.
8. If the user asks for version-specific or "latest" details, verify with official docs before answering.

## Core practices (short list)

- Use Effect for all side effects; keep core functions pure and total.
- Avoid async/await, raw Promise chains, and try/catch in application logic.
- Use Context.Tag + Layer for dependency injection and testability.
- Use tagged error unions and Match.exhaustive for total handling.
- Decode unknown at the boundary with @effect/schema; never leak unknown into core.
- Use Effect.acquireRelease/Effect.scoped for resource safety.
- Use @effect/platform services instead of host APIs (fetch, fs, child_process, etc.).

## References

- Read `references/best-practices.md` for the extended checklist and examples.
- Read `references/platform-map.md` when comparing @effect/platform to Node/Bun/Browser APIs.
