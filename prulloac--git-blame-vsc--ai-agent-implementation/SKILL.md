# AI Agent Implementation Skill

**Answers the question: How do I execute this feature with AI agents? What's done? What's next? What's blocking?**

This skill manages the **practical execution of feature tasks by AI agents**, handling task batching, progress tracking, and blocker identification without calendar overhead.

## When to Use

Use this skill when you:
- Have an execution sequence (from feature-planning skill)
- Are using AI agents to build features
- Need to track which tasks are done vs. in progress
- Have blockers to identify and manage
- Need to coordinate work between batches

**Key indicator**: You're asking "What should the agent build next?" or "What's the status of this feature?"

**Do NOT use this skill if**: 
- You don't have an execution sequence yet (use feature-planning first)
- You're not using AI agents (this is agent-specific)

## Prerequisites

⚠️ **CRITICAL**: This skill requires an execution sequence as input.

Before using this skill:

1. **Verify you have an execution sequence first**
   - If you don't have `docs/features/[feature-name]/implementation-sequence.md` → Use `feature-planning` first
   - If you have the sequence → Continue below

2. **Expected inputs from feature-planning**:
   - `docs/features/[feature-name]/implementation-sequence.md` file exists
   - Contains complete task list with dependencies
   - Batch groupings identified
   - Critical path marked

**If you don't have an execution sequence**:
- Load the `feature-planning` skill first
- Follow its workflow to sequence your tasks
- Once you have the sequence file, return here

## Inputs

- Execution sequence document (required): `docs/features/[feature-name]/implementation-sequence.md`
- Agent session logs (optional): What agents have completed so far

## Outputs

**MANDATORY FILE ORGANIZATION**: All feature files must be in `docs/features/<feature-name>/` subdirectory.

When this skill is used during execution, it creates/updates:

1. **Execution Progress** (`docs/features/[feature-name]/implementation-progress.md`)
   - Current status of all tasks
   - What's been completed
   - What's in progress
   - What's ready to start next
   - Any blockers or issues
   - **Example**: `docs/features/user-authentication/implementation-progress.md`

2. **Blocker Log** (`docs/features/[feature-name]/blockers.md`)
   - Current blockers preventing progress
   - Root cause analysis
   - Resolution status
   - **Example**: `docs/features/user-authentication/blockers.md`

3. **Session Summary** (`docs/features/[feature-name]/session-summary-[batch-num].md`)
   - What this agent batch completed
   - Test results and verification status
   - What to hand off to next agent/batch
   - Any issues discovered
   - **Example**: `docs/features/user-authentication/session-summary-1.md`

## Workflow Overview

The AI agent execution process:

```
Execution Sequence Input
    ↓
Agent Session 1: Execute Batch 1
    ↓
Track Completion & Verify
    ↓
Identify Blockers
    ↓
Next Agent Session: Execute Batch 2
    ↓
Repeat until all tasks complete
    ↓
Feature Complete
```

## Core Workflow

### Phase 1: Prepare for Agent Execution

**Input**: Execution sequence document

1. **Select batch for agent execution**:
   - Identify next uncompleted batch
   - Confirm all dependencies are met
   - Check for any blockers from previous batches
   - If blockers exist, resolve before proceeding

2. **Prepare batch context**:
   - Extract all tasks in this batch
   - Include acceptance criteria for each task
   - Document any integration points
   - List dependencies and what tasks feed into this batch

3. **Create agent prompt**:
   - Clear objective: "Execute these N tasks"
   - Task list with descriptions and acceptance criteria
   - Integration points and expected outputs
   - Success criteria for this batch
   - Known risks or technical complexity

### Phase 2: Agent Executes Batch

**Agent actions**:
- Receive batch with clear task list
- Execute tasks in sequence or parallel (as specified)
- Verify each task meets acceptance criteria
- Test integration with previous work
- Document completion and any issues

**You monitor**:
- Agent progress during execution
- Any failures or unexpected issues
- Blockers that emerge
- Quality of implementation

### Phase 3: Verify Batch Completion

1. **Check task completion**:
   - Does each task meet its acceptance criteria?
   - Are integration points working?
   - Any test failures?
   - Code quality acceptable?

2. **Identify issues**:
   - What didn't work as expected?
   - What needs rework?
   - What assumptions were wrong?

3. **Update progress**:
   - Mark completed tasks as ✅
   - Mark tasks needing rework as 🔄
   - Mark any new blockers as 🔴
   - Document what worked well

### Phase 4: Identify and Track Blockers

1. **Classify blockers**:
   - **Technical**: Feature doesn't work as designed
   - **Integration**: Task output doesn't match what next task needs
   - **Design**: Requirements were unclear or wrong
   - **External**: Waiting on something outside the feature (dependency, library, API)

2. **Document blocker**:
   - What's preventing progress?
   - Which tasks are blocked?
   - Root cause (if known)?
   - How long to resolve?

3. **Resolution path**:
   - Can it be fixed immediately? (do it)
   - Does it need design change? (clarify then rework)
   - Is it external? (document and wait, or work around)

### Phase 5: Plan Next Batch

1. **Review current state**:
   - What's completed ✅
   - What's in progress 🔄
   - What's blocked 🔴
   - What's ready to start ⏭️

2. **Select next batch**:
   - Find next batch with all dependencies met
   - Check for any blockers from previous work
   - Prepare batch context (same as Phase 1)

3. **Brief next agent**:
   - Pass execution progress
   - Identify any issues from previous batch
   - Provide clear task list for next batch
   - Highlight integration expectations

### Phase 6: Track Overall Progress

Maintain live progress document showing:

- **Completed batches**: Which are done ✅
- **Current batch**: What agent is working on now 🔄
- **Ready batches**: What's queued next ⏭️
- **Blocked**: What can't proceed and why 🔴
- **Overall %**: How close to done

## Handoff for Next Agent

[Copy what next agent needs to know]
- What these tasks built
- Any quirks or gotchas
- Integration requirements
- Files/paths that matter
```

## Guidelines

### Task Completion Criteria

A task is ✅ COMPLETE when:
- All acceptance criteria are met
- Code is in repository (merged or staged)
- Tests pass (if applicable)
- Integration with previous work verified
- No known issues

A task is 🔄 IN PROGRESS when:
- Agent is actively building it
- Some work is done but not all acceptance criteria met
- Waiting on integration testing

A task is ⏭️ READY when:
- All dependencies are complete
- No blockers exist
- Agent can start immediately

A task is 🔴 BLOCKED when:
- Cannot proceed due to external dependency
- Depends on incomplete task
- Needs clarification or decision

### Batch Sizing

- **Too small**: 1 task per batch (too granular)
- **Good size**: 1-3 related tasks per batch (can complete in one session)
- **Too large**: 4+ tasks (too much context, may not complete)

### Blocker Resolution

**Immediate fixes**:
- Rework task: Have agent fix it
- Clarify requirements: Get clear spec, agent redoes task
- Code quality: Agent improves, retests

**Wait & Proceed**:
- External dependency: Work on other batches, revisit later
- Design decision: Move to next batch while waiting
- Known limitation: Document and proceed

**Cannot Proceed**:
- Critical blocker with no workaround: Stop, resolve, continue

## Common Patterns

### Pattern: Task Fails Tests
1. Agent reports: "Test X failed"
2. You: Review failure, identify cause
3. Either: Rework task, or clarify requirements
4. Agent: Re-executes task
5. Update progress when fixed

### Pattern: Dependencies Not Met
1. Agent reports: "Can't start because Task X not done"
2. You: Verify Task X completion
3. If complete: Task needs output from Task X (integration issue)
4. If incomplete: Move this batch down, work on different batch
5. Return to blocked task when dependency ready

### Pattern: Integration Breaks
1. Agent reports: "Task works alone, breaks when integrated"
2. You: Review what task outputs vs. what next task expects
3. Either: Fix task implementation, or fix integration point
4. Agent: Tests integration again
5. Mark complete only when integrated successfully
