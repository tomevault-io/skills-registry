# Git Commit Workflow

## Overview

This skill provides a structured workflow for committing git changes that respects repository-specific guidelines and falls back to conventional commits when no guidelines exist. It ensures commits are logical, well-grouped, and follow established standards.

## Workflow

Follow these steps to commit changes:

### 1. Read Repository Guidelines
- Look for CONTRIBUTING, CONTRIBUTING.md, or similar files in the repository root
- Extract commit message standards, guidelines, and any specific requirements
- If no guidelines found, prepare to use conventional commits as fallback

### 2. Assess Current Changes
- Run `git status` to see all modified, added, and untracked files
- Note staged vs unstaged changes

### 3. Analyze Changes in Detail
- Run `git diff` (and `git diff --staged` if needed) to understand what changes were made
- Review the nature of changes: bug fixes, features, refactoring, documentation, etc.

### 4. Group Related Changes
- Logically group files by related changes
- See [references/grouping_changes.md](references/grouping_changes.md) for guidance on grouping strategies
- Avoid mixing unrelated changes in the same commit

### 5. Perform Commits
- If CONTRIBUTING guidelines exist, follow their commit message format and grouping requirements
- If no guidelines, use conventional commits standard: See [references/conventional_commits.md](references/conventional_commits.md)
- Stage appropriate files for each commit
- Write descriptive commit messages
- Run `git commit` with proper messages
