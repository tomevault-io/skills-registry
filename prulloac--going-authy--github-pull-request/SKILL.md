# GitHub Pull Request Skill

## When to use this skill
Use this skill when you need to create a pull request for current changes in a repository. It provides a structured workflow for gathering PR details, filling templates, and executing the creation via available tools.

## Workflow

1.  **Identify Base Branch**: Determine the target base branch for the pull request (usually `main`, `master`, or as specified by the user or repository settings).
2.  **Analyze Changes**: Compare the current `HEAD` commit against the base branch to understand the scope of changes.
    -   Use `git diff base...HEAD --stat` and `git log base...HEAD` to gather information.
3.  **Check for Templates**: Check if there's a pull request template in the repository.
    -   Common locations: `pull_request_template.md`, `.github/pull_request_template.md`, or inside `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/`.
4.  **Fill the Template**:
    -   Automatically populate the template using information from the commit logs and diff.
    -   If any required information cannot be confidently filled (e.g., "Related Issue Number", "Testing Steps" if not obvious), mark these as "PENDING" and inform the user.
5.  **Review with User**:
    -   **ALWAYS** show the filled template to the user for review.
    -   Explicitly mention any sections that need manual filling.
6.  **Create Pull Request**:
    -   ONLY after the user approves the description, proceed to create the PR.
    -   Use tools in this order of precedence:
        1.  **GitHub MCP Server**: Use `github.create_pull_request` tool if available.
        2.  **GitHub CLI (gh)**: Run `gh pr create --title "..." --body "..." --base <base> --head <head>`.
        3.  **GitHub REST API (curl)**: Use `curl` to POST to `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls`.

## Tools and Commands

### GitHub CLI (gh)
```bash
# Get default branch
gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef -q .defaultBranchRef.name

# Create PR
gh pr create --title "PR Title" --body-file pr_body.md --base main
```

### GitHub REST API (curl)
If using `curl`, ensure you have a `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable.
```bash
curl -L \
  -X POST \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer \$GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  -H "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls \
  -d '{"title":"Title","body":"Body","head":"head-branch","base":"base-branch"}'
```

## Examples

### Pull Request Preview and Approval Request
The agent should present the filled template to the user like this:

> I have prepared the following pull request description based on your changes and the repository's template.
> 
> **Title:** feat: add user authentication module
> 
> **Body:**
> ## Summary
> This PR adds a new authentication module using JWT.
> 
> ## Changes
> - Added `src/auth/` directory
> - Implemented login and logout endpoints
> - Updated `README.md` with setup instructions
> 
> ## Pending Information
> - [ ] **Related Issue Number**: Please provide the issue number this PR addresses.
> - [ ] **Testing Steps**: I have listed basic steps, but please verify if additional scenarios are needed.
> 
> **Do you approve this description? Once approved, I will create the pull request.**

## Validation Steps
1.  **Template Check**: Verify that `pull_request_template.md` (or equivalent) was searched for and loaded if present.
2.  **Content Analysis**: Confirm that the PR description includes a summary of changes based on git logs/diffs.
3.  **User Approval**: Confirm the agent displayed the filled template and received explicit approval before PR creation.
4.  **Success Confirmation**: Verify the PR was successfully created by checking tool output or PR list.
