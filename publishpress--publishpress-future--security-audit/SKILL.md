# WP Plugin Security & Code Quality Auditor

Use these instructions when the user requests a security audit, code quality review, or acquisition evaluation of a WordPress plugin. This generates both detailed security findings (GHSA format) and spreadsheet-compatible metrics for acquisition decisions.

## Mission

Conduct a comprehensive technical due diligence audit covering security, code quality, and maintainability. Generate both:
1. **Spreadsheet metrics** - Tab-separated data for Plugin Acquisition Evaluation Spreadsheet
2. **Security advisories** - Detailed vulnerability reports in GHSA format (when issues found)

The output is formatted for direct paste into evaluation spreadsheets with scores aligned to acquisition decision criteria.

## Directories to Exclude

NEVER analyze code in these directories (applies to all searches, greps, and phpmetrics):
- `/vendor/`
- `/lib/vendor/`
- `/dist/`
- `/.git/` and all hidden folders (`.*`)
- `/dev-workspace/`
- `/node_modules/`
- `/tests/`

## Audit Methodology

### Phase 1: Security Assessment (CRITICAL PRIORITY)

#### Search for Critical Vulnerabilities

Use Grep tool to search for these patterns (exclude vendor, lib, tests, dist, dev-workspace):

**SQL Injection:**
- Pattern: `\$wpdb->get_results.*\$` or `\$wpdb->query.*\$` without `prepare()`
- Look for: Direct string interpolation in SQL queries
- Example: `$wpdb->get_results("SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = $id")`

**XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):**
- Pattern: `echo \$_(POST|GET|REQUEST)` without escaping
- Look for: Unescaped output, missing `esc_html()`, `esc_attr()`, `esc_url()`
- Check: React `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with user input

**CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):**
- Pattern: Form submissions and AJAX handlers without `wp_verify_nonce()`
- Look for: POST handlers missing nonce verification
- Check: Admin forms without nonce fields

**Authentication & Authorization:**
- Pattern: Missing `current_user_can()` checks before privileged operations
- Look for: Weak API keys, insecure REST endpoints, missing capability checks
- Check: REST API routes without proper `permission_callback`

**Dangerous Functions:**
- Pattern: `eval\(|exec\(|system\(|shell_exec\(|passthru\(|base64_decode\(`
- Look for: Remote code execution risks
- Check: `unserialize()` with user input, `create_function()`

**File Operations:**
- Pattern: File upload handlers, `move_uploaded_file()`, `file_put_contents()`
- Look for: Insufficient validation, path traversal (`../`), missing extension checks
- Check: Directory traversal risks in file paths

#### WordPress-Specific Security Checks

- Verify all user input is sanitized using appropriate functions (`sanitize_text_field`, `sanitize_email`, `absint`, etc.)
- Verify all output is escaped using appropriate functions (`esc_html`, `esc_attr`, `esc_url`, `wp_kses`, etc.)
- Check that `$wpdb->prepare()` is used for all dynamic SQL queries
- Verify nonce implementation on all form submissions and AJAX handlers
- Check capability verification (`current_user_can`) before privileged operations
- Analyze REST API `permission_callback` implementations
- Review hooks and filters for potential injection points
- Check for proper use of `wp_remote_*` functions vs. curl

#### Security Scoring (0-5.0, one decimal)

**Score Guidelines:**
- **4.5-5.0 (Excellent):** No significant issues, follows security best practices
- **3.5-4.4 (Good):** Minor issues only, easily fixable
- **2.5-3.4 (Fair):** Some security concerns, patchable (outdated dependencies, weak validation)
- **1.5-2.4 (Poor):** Serious issues (outdated payment SDKs, weak auth, no CSRF)
- **0.0-1.4 (Critical):** Active vulnerabilities (SQL injection, auth bypass, XSS)

Grade each finding: CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW with file:line references

### Phase 2: Code Quality Assessment

#### 2.1 Architecture & Design (0-5.0 score)

**Analyze:**
- God classes: Find files >1000 lines using: `find . -name "*.php" -not -path "*/vendor/*" -not -path "*/tests/*" -exec wc -l {} \;`
- Code organization: SOLID principles, separation of concerns, design patterns
- Coupling: Tight dependencies between classes/modules
- Cohesion: Single responsibility principle adherence

**Scoring:**
- **4.5-5.0 (Excellent):** Clean architecture, SOLID principles, well-organized
- **3.5-4.4 (Good):** Solid structure, minor improvements needed
- **2.5-3.4 (Fair):** Functional but needs refactoring, some anti-patterns
- **1.5-2.4 (Poor):** Spaghetti code, tight coupling, hard to modify
- **0.0-1.4 (Critical):** Chaotic structure, no clear patterns

#### 2.2 Code Maintainability (0-5.0 score)

**Identify:**
- Global variables: Count `global $` usage with Grep
- Large functions: Functions >100 lines
- SQL queries: Count direct `$wpdb` calls
- TODOs: Count `TODO|FIXME|HACK|XXX` comments (exclude vendor/tests)
- Error handling: Consistency and completeness
- Code duplication: Repeated logic patterns

**Scoring:**
- **4.5-5.0 (Excellent):** Clean code, self-documenting, easy to understand
- **3.5-4.4 (Good):** Readable, consistent style, minor issues
- **2.5-3.4 (Fair):** Understandable with effort, inconsistent patterns
- **1.5-2.4 (Poor):** Hard to read, cryptic logic, poor naming
- **0.0-1.4 (Critical):** Unmaintainable, impossible to understand

#### 2.3 Documentation (0-5.0 score)

**Check:**
- PHPDoc blocks on classes and methods
- Inline comments for complex logic
- README.md existence and quality
- Code examples and usage documentation

**Scoring:**
- **4.5-5.0 (Excellent):** Comprehensive docs, well-commented code, examples
- **3.5-4.4 (Good):** Good coverage, key areas documented
- **2.5-3.4 (Fair):** Basic documentation, some gaps
- **1.5-2.4 (Poor):** Minimal docs, mostly undocumented
- **0.0-1.4 (Critical):** No documentation at all

**Calculate Code Quality Score:** `(Architecture + Maintainability + Documentation) ÷ 3`

### Phase 3: Dependencies Analysis

**Check composer.json files for:**
- Outdated packages (3+ years old = HIGH RISK)
- Payment SDKs: Stripe (current: v13+), PayPal (current versions)
- Unmaintained libraries (no updates in 2+ years)
- PHP version requirements (min 7.4)
- WordPress version requirements

**Payment Security (if applicable):**
- Stripe: SDK version, API version, PCI compliance patterns, webhook verification
- PayPal: IPN/webhook handling, payment verification
- API key storage (should use wp_options or constants, NOT plaintext in code)
- Card data handling (should NOT exist - PCI compliance violation)

### Phase 4: Performance & Architecture

**Analyze:**
- N+1 query patterns (loops with database queries)
- Caching implementation (transients, object cache)
- WordPress coding standards compliance
- PSR-12 compliance (preferred standard)
- Test suite existence (PHPUnit, Codeception, WP_UnitTestCase)

### Phase 5: PHPMetrics Analysis

**Run PHPMetrics** (after manual analysis):
```bash
phpmetrics --report-html=metrics --exclude=vendor,lib/vendor,tests,dist,dev-workspace .
```

**Extract these metrics from the report:**
- Violations count
- Lines of Code (LOC)
- Classes count
- Average Cyclomatic Complexity
- Average Bugs by Class

### Phase 6: Fix Cost Estimation

**Estimate developer days needed (1-10+):**
- **1-3 days:** Minor fixes (small bugs, simple updates, documentation)
- **4-6 days:** Moderate work (security patches, dependency updates, refactoring small modules)
- **7-9 days:** Major overhaul (significant refactoring, multiple security issues, architectural changes)
- **10+ days:** Critical rebuild (fundamental architecture changes, complete rewrite needed)

## Recommendation Logic

**Apply these decision rules:**
- **ACQUIRE:** Security ≥4.0 AND Code Quality ≥3.5 AND Fix Days ≤6
- **CAUTION:** Security 2.5-3.9 OR Code Quality 2.5-3.4 OR Fix Days 7-9
- **REJECT:** Security <2.5 OR Code Quality <2.5 OR Fix Days ≥10

## Output Format

Generate TWO types of outputs:

### Output 1: AUDIT_REPORT.md (Primary Report)

Create a file named `AUDIT_REPORT.md` in the plugin root with this exact structure:

```markdown
# [PLUGIN_NAME] Security & Code Quality Audit

## Quality Assurance Checklist

### Accuracy Requirements
1. ✅ All numeric scores use exactly one decimal place (e.g., 3.7, not 3 or 3.70)
2. ✅ Code Quality Score is calculated: (Architecture + Maintainability + Documentation) ÷ 3
3. ✅ Spreadsheet data uses actual TAB characters (not spaces) between columns
4. ✅ All file:line references are accurate and verifiable
5. ✅ Security vulnerabilities are exploitable, not just theoretical
6. ✅ Code path to vulnerability is reachable by users
7. ✅ WordPress core sanitization doesn't already prevent exploitation
8. ✅ CVSS scores accurately reflect impact
9. ✅ Fix cost estimates are realistic based on complexity
10. ✅ Recommendation follows decision rules strictly

### False Positive Avoidance
- Check if data is sanitized before the vulnerable function
- Verify capability checks aren't performed earlier in the call stack
- Confirm nonces aren't verified in parent functions
- Check for output escaping before assuming XSS
- Trace data flow through multiple files if necessary

### Reporting Standards
- Be objective and concise: 1-2 sentences max in spreadsheet Notes column
- Provide code snippets as evidence with file:line references
- Brief descriptions in main report, detailed in individual GHSA files
- Answer the key question: "Is this code maintainable by a new team?"

## Execution Workflow

Follow this sequence for comprehensive audit:

1. **Start with searches** (use Grep tool):
   - SQL injection patterns
   - XSS patterns
   - CSRF patterns
   - Dangerous functions
   - TODO/FIXME comments
   - Global variable usage

2. **Analyze architecture** (use Read/Glob tools):
   - Find large files (>1000 lines)
   - Identify god classes
   - Check dependency files (composer.json)
   - Review main plugin structure

3. **Run PHPMetrics** (use Shell tool):
   ```bash
   phpmetrics --report-html=metrics --exclude=vendor,lib/vendor,tests,dist,dev-workspace .
   ```
   - Extract metrics from generated report

4. **Calculate scores:**
   - Security: 0-5.0 (based on findings)
   - Architecture & Design: 0-5.0
   - Code Maintainability: 0-5.0
   - Documentation: 0-5.0
   - Code Quality: (Architecture + Maintainability + Documentation) ÷ 3

5. **Estimate fix cost** (1-10+ days)

6. **Apply recommendation logic:**
   - ACQUIRE: Security ≥4.0 AND Code Quality ≥3.5 AND Fix Days ≤6
   - CAUTION: Security 2.5-3.9 OR Code Quality 2.5-3.4 OR Fix Days 7-9
   - REJECT: Security <2.5 OR Code Quality <2.5 OR Fix Days ≥10

7. **Generate outputs:**
   - Create AUDIT_REPORT.md with spreadsheet data
   - Create individual GHSA files for each vulnerability (if any)

## Interaction Protocol

- Request additional files if needed to trace data flow
- Explain severity reasoning if unclear
- Highlight systemic issues when patterns emerge
- Provide actionable remediation, not just problem identification
- When uncertain about exploitability, report with caveats
- If PHPMetrics fails to run, estimate metrics from manual analysis
- Always complete the full audit workflow before generating final report
