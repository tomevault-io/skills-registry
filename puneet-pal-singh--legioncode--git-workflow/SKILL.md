# Git Workflow Skill

Execute safe git operations with proper safety checks and Shadowbox protocols.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:

- Creating feature branches
- Making commits (single or grouped)
- Checking repository status
- Viewing commit history
- Staging changes
- Switching branches (only when explicitly requested)

## Safety Rules (CRITICAL)

1. **Never run destructive commands without explicit confirmation**:
   - `git reset --hard`
   - `git clean -fd`
   - `git push --force`
   - Branch deletion with unmerged changes

2. **Always check status before operations**:

   ```bash
   git status
   git branch -a
   git log --oneline -5
   ```

3. **Never switch branches if**:
   - There are uncommitted changes (unless explicitly told to stash)
   - The target branch is ambiguous
   - You're in the middle of a merge/rebase

4. **NEVER use `git add -A` or `git add .`**:
   - Always add specific files/paths explicitly
   - Ensures intentional, auditable commits
   - Pattern: `git add path/to/file` or `git add path/to/dir/`
   - ✅ `git add packages/planning-engine/src/types.ts` (specific file)
   - ✅ `git add packages/planning-engine/src/` (specific directory)
   - ❌ `git add -A` (too risky, unintentional files)
   - ❌ `git add .` (same risk as -A)

5. **Multi-agent safety**:
   - Do NOT create/apply/drop `git stash` unless explicitly requested
   - Do NOT switch branches unless explicitly requested
   - Do NOT create/remove/modify `git worktree` checkouts unless explicitly requested
   - On shared/reviewed branches, sync with `git pull --ff-only` (default)
   - Rebase is allowed only on private in-progress branches before first PR
   - When user says "commit", scope to your changes only

6. **Rule documents are mandatory**:
   - Follow `local/Rules/GIT-RULES.md`
   - Follow `local/Rules/pr-strategy-checklist.md`

## Conflict Prevention Protocol (MANDATORY)

Run this protocol before commit/push/PR:

1. **Fresh base check**:

   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git status -sb
   if git rev-parse --abbrev-ref --symbolic-full-name @{upstream} >/dev/null 2>&1; then
     git rev-list --left-right --count @{upstream}...HEAD
   else
     echo "No upstream tracking branch yet; skipping divergence count."
   fi
   ```

2. **Divergence rule**:
   - If ahead/behind on a shared/reviewed branch, sync using `git pull --ff-only`.
   - If `--ff-only` fails, stop and use an explicit merge flow (do not auto-rebase shared history).

3. **Overlap risk check**:

   ```bash
   git diff --name-only origin/main...HEAD
   ```

   - If high-conflict files are shared across active PRs (runtime/core/router/policy), coordinate and sequence merges instead of parallel edits.

4. **PR size rule**:
   - Keep PR scope narrow (single boundary/topic).
   - Do not combine rename/moves with behavior changes in the same PR.

5. **No silent conflict resolution**:
   - Never use blanket `-X ours`/`-X theirs` for runtime/business logic files.
   - Resolve per file and re-run tests.

## PR Train Mode (for multi-PR milestones)

When a milestone has multiple tightly-coupled PRs, use train mode:

1. Create train branch: `codex/train-<milestone>`.
2. Create checkpoint branches from train branch.
3. Open checkpoint PRs to train branch only.
4. Open one final PR from train branch to `main`.

Hard rules:

1. Do not merge sibling checkpoint branches into each other.
2. Sync only from train branch or explicit `main` cut-point.

## Branch Operations

### Create Feature Branch (Explicit Request Required)

```bash
# Execute this flow only after explicit user request to create/switch branch.

# Check current status first
git status

# Pull latest from main
git checkout main
git pull --ff-only origin main

# Create and switch to feature branch
git checkout -b feat/descriptive-name

# Verify branch creation
git branch -v
```

**Naming conventions**:

- Features: `feat/feature-name`
- Fixes: `fix/bug-description`
- Refactoring: `refactor/description`
- Documentation: `docs/description`
- Chores: `chore/task-description`
- Tests: `test/test-scope`

### Safe Branch Switching

```bash
# Execute this flow only after explicit user request to switch branch.

# Check for uncommitted changes
git status

# If clean, switch branch
git checkout branch-name

# If uncommitted changes exist, ask user:
# "You have uncommitted changes. Should I:
#   1. Commit them first
#   2. Stash them (only if explicitly requested)
#   3. Cancel the switch"
```

## Commit Operations

### Atomic Commits

Make one logical change per commit:

```bash
# Stage specific files
git add src/specific/file.ts

# Or stage by pattern
git add src/services/

# Commit with conventional format
git commit -m "feat: add user authentication"
git commit -m "fix: resolve null pointer in cache"
git commit -m "refactor: extract validation logic"
git commit -m "docs: update API documentation"
```

**Conventional commit prefixes**:

- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation only
- `style:` - Formatting, no code change
- `refactor:` - Code restructuring
- `perf:` - Performance improvement
- `test:` - Adding tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

### Grouped Commits

When multiple related changes exist:

```bash
# Check what files changed
git status

# Stage logical groups separately
git add src/auth/
git commit -m "feat: implement JWT authentication"

git add tests/auth/
git commit -m "test: add auth service tests"

git add docs/auth.md
git commit -m "docs: document auth API"
```

## Status and History

### Check Repository State

```bash
# Current status
git status

# Short status
git status -sb

# Recent commits
git log --oneline -10

# Branch information
git branch -v

# Remote tracking
git branch -vv
```

### View Changes

```bash
# Staged changes
git diff --staged

# Unstaged changes
git diff

# Specific file
git diff src/file.ts

# Changes in last commit
git show HEAD
```

## Pre-Commit Checklist

Before every commit, verify:

1. **Scope**: Only your intended changes are staged

   ```bash
   git diff --staged --stat
   ```

2. **No secrets**: Check for accidental inclusion of:
   - API keys
   - Passwords
   - `.env` files
   - Private configuration

3. **Tests pass**: Run relevant tests

   ```bash
   npm test
   # or
   npm run test:related
   ```

4. **Lint clean**: Code follows style guidelines

   ```bash
   npm run lint
   # or
   npm run lint:fix
   ```

5. **Type check**: TypeScript compiles
   ```bash
   npm run typecheck
   ```

## Common Workflows

### Start New Feature

```bash
# Save current work
git status

# Update main
git checkout main
git pull --ff-only origin main

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feat/my-feature

# Do work...

# Commit when ready (NEVER use git add -A)
git add src/services/MyService.ts
git commit -m "feat: implement my feature"
```

### Wrap Up Work Session

```bash
# Check what needs committing
git status

# Stage and commit your changes (by specific paths)
git add packages/my-package/src/
git commit -m "WIP: current progress on feature"

# Or if incomplete, note what's left:
git add src/
git commit -m "feat: partial implementation

TODO:
- Add error handling
- Write tests
- Update documentation"
```

## Error Handling

### Merge Conflicts

If `git pull --ff-only` or `git merge` fails:

```bash
# Check status
git status

# See conflicting files
git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U

# After manual resolution, mark as resolved
git add resolved-file.ts
git merge --continue
# If conflict happened during rebase on a private branch:
# git rebase --continue
```

### Failed Operations

Always check exit codes:

```bash
if ! git checkout main; then
    echo "Failed to checkout main. Current status:"
    git status
    exit 1
fi
```

## Integration with AGENTS.md

This skill implements the Git & Workflow Protocol from AGENTS.md:

- Section 17: Common commands

Always reference AGENTS.md for the complete workflow specifications.
