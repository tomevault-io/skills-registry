### Technologies
- Use the following tech to implement the UI:
    - React 18+
    - Next.js 16+
    - Tailwind CSS
    - Shadcn UI
    - Framer Motion
    - Lucide Icons

## Workflow

1. Planing
- Thoroughly understand the requirements
- Investigate the codebase for existing components and patterns that can be reused
- Locate where to implement the new UI following the project [Page, Layout and Component Structure](./PAGE_LAYOUT_COMPONENT_STRUCTURE.md)
- Identify shadcn components and/or blocks that can be used directly or as bases for new components following the [Shadcn UI Components exploration and selection workflow](#shadcn-ui-components-exploration-and-selection-workflow)
- Suggest user with at least 2 design options refereing the design best practices.

2. Implement the pieces
- Install any shadcn components that has been selected in the planning phase following the [Shadcn UI Components installation and usage workflow](#shadcn-ui-components-installation-and-usage-workflow)
- Create new components if needed.

4. Building the UI
- Implement the final UI by composing the selected shadcn components and/or newly created components.


## Server and Client Components

### Default Behavior
- All components in `app/` are React Server Components by default
- Server Components render on the server and can be cached
- Client Components execute in the browser and enable interactivity

### When to Use Client Components
Use the `"use client"` directive at the top of a file when you need:
- State management (`useState`, `useReducer`)
- Event handlers (`onClick`, `onChange`, etc.)
- Lifecycle hooks (`useEffect`, `useLayoutEffect`)
- Browser-only APIs (`window`, `localStorage`, geolocation)
- Custom React hooks that depend on state/effects

### When to Use Server Components (default)
Keep components as Server Components when:
- Fetching data from databases or APIs
- Accessing backend resources directly
- Keeping sensitive information secure (API keys, tokens)
- Reducing JavaScript bundle size

### Best Practices
- **Minimize Client Components** - Only mark components that need interactivity as Client Components
- **Push "use client" Deep** - Add the directive to the lowest component that needs it, not parent containers
- **Composition Pattern** - Pass Server Components as `children` props to Client Components to keep server-rendered content
- **Data Passing** - Server Components can pass serializable data as props to Client Components
- **Context Providers** - Wrap providers in Client Components and import into Server Components
- **Third-Party Libraries** - If a library requires browser APIs, wrap it in your own Client Component

### Security
- Only environment variables prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` are exposed to the browser
- Use the `server-only` package to prevent accidental server code imports in Client Components


## Shadcn UI Components exploration and selection workflow

Notes: The registry name is ALWAYS @shadcn when using shadcn tools.

1. Use the mcp__shadcn__list_items_in_registries tool to list components in the @shadcn registry
2. Use the mcp__shadcn__search_items_in_registries to fuzzy search for components in the @shadcn registry using keywords

### Shadcn UI Components installation and usage workflow

3. Check if the component has already been installed by running `ls components/ui/' in the project root/
4. For components that is not installed install them using `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add [component]` e.g. pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add button card
5. Before using the component read docuemntion:
      - Use the mcp__shadcn__get_item_examples_from_registries tool to get usage examples for the component from the @shadcn registry
      - Check the component source code in the `components/ui/[component]` folder


## Page, Layout and Component Structure

### Layout
- Layouts are used for shared UI, logic and data fetching that is common across multiple pages.
- Try to make the layout as static as possible, avoid adding dynamic content or data fetching in the layout.
- Make the higher order layout be shared across the most pages possible.
- Create new nested layouts when needed to avoid making the higher order layout dynamic.


### Page
- Pages are used for specific routes and can contain dynamic content and data fetching.


### Components
- Components are used for reusable UI pieces that can be shared across pages and layouts.
- ONLY create components for UI pieces that are reused in at least 2 places or you expect to reuse them in the future.
- For pieces of code that will not be reused, create them directly in the page or layout file.
- **Keep Server Components by default** - Only add `"use client"` to components that need interactivity
- **Push interactivity deep** - Add the `"use client"` directive to the lowest component that needs it (e.g., a button), not the parent container
- **Example**: A card with a clickable button → Card is Server Component, Button is Client Component


### Styling
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes for styling.
- ALWAYS reach for shadcn token variables when styling e.g. bg-primary, text-secondary, etc. first before using raw Tailwind CSS classes.
- If variation of the shadcn token variables is needed use bg-primary/50, text-secondary/80, etc. to adjust opacity.
