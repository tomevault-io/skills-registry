description: Plan and rank Arctic Cloud Developer Challenge (ACDC) badges and judge categories based on a team's current build and constraints. Use when asked to map a project to ACDC badges/awards, choose high-ROI targets, produce time-boxed action plans, evidence checklists, dependency/risk flags, and short judge-pitch scripts; must fetch the current badge/category requirements from the official ACDC site. Use when this capability is needed.

# ACDC Badge Sniper

## Beginner help

This skill turns the ACDC badge list into an action plan for your team.

What it does:
- Pulls the latest ACDC data (badges, teams, claims, rankings) into local cache files.
- Matches your project to the best badges and judge categories.
- Gives a short, time-boxed checklist plus evidence to collect.

What you need to provide:
- Your team name (pick from the list during onboarding).
- What you have built so far (2-6 bullets).
- How much time you have left.
- Any constraints (no admin, no external APIs, no server changes, etc.).

Output you will get:
- Top 5 badge targets and top 1-2 judge categories.
- For each target: why it fits, what is missing, checklist, evidence, risks, judge pitch.
- A single “Next 60 minutes” action list.

## Quick intake

Ask for missing inputs before producing a plan:
- Team stack (M365, Power Platform, Azure, Fabric, AI/agents, DevOps, Minecraft, etc.)
- What is built now (bullets) and what is feasible next
- Time left or time-box (next 1-3 hours, today, rest of hackathon)
- Constraints (no admin, no internet, no server changes, etc.)

## Onboarding flow (team selection)

When the user has not specified a team name yet:
1. Load `data/teams.json` and present the full list of team names.
2. Ask the user to confirm the team name to avoid typos.
3. Ask whether to save the selection to `data/team_profile.json`.
4. If the user declines saving, keep the team name in the current response context only.

## CRITICAL: Data Source URL

```
ACDC_BASE_URL = https://stacdc2026.blob.core.windows.net/acdc/
```

**IMPORTANT**: Use this URL exactly as written - do not modify the subdomain `stacdc2026`.

## Required data sync (hackathon mode)

At the start of each run, fetch the latest data from the base URL above and save into the matching cache files:
- `{ACDC_BASE_URL}metadata.json` → `data/metadata.json`
- `{ACDC_BASE_URL}claims.json` → `data/claims.json`
- `{ACDC_BASE_URL}teams.json` → `data/teams.json`
- `{ACDC_BASE_URL}rankings.json` → `data/rankings.json`

If live fetch fails, ask whether to proceed with the cached copies. If requirements are ambiguous, quote the exact wording (short quotes) and explain a safe interpretation.

## Blob cache format

These files use the blob service envelope: `{ "meta": {...}, "type": "...", "data": {...} }`.
Key fields to use:
- metadata.json: `data.badges[]` with `id`, `title`, `description`, `category`, `score`, `visible`
- claims.json: `data.claims[]` with `badgeId`, `teamId`, `status`, `timestamp`
- teams.json: `data.teams[]` with `id`, `name`, `shortName`
- rankings.json: `data.rankings[]` with `badgeId`, `teamId`, `rank`, `isDraft`, `timestamp`

## Team state (persistent)

Track team identity and claimed badges using these files:
- `data/team_profile.json` for team metadata (name, members, stack, constraints, notes).
- `data/badges_acquired.json` for badges already claimed.
- `data/teams.json` for the official team list (name lookup/validation).

If the files are missing, ask the user for the minimal fields and create them on request. Only update these files when the user explicitly asks to save changes.
`badges_acquired.json` can be regenerated from rankings/metadata at any time.

Suggested shapes:
- team_profile.json: `{ "team_id": "<string>", "team_name": "<string>", "members": ["<string>"], "stack": ["<string>"], "constraints": ["<string>"], "notes": "<string>" }`
- badges_acquired.json: `{ "team_id": "<string>", "badge_ids": [<number>], "badge_titles": ["<string>"], "updated_at": "<iso8601>" }`

When `data/teams.json` exists, use it to validate or suggest the team name and avoid typos.

## Scoring and ranking

- If `config.yml` exists, use its weights to rank targets.
- Default formula: `score = fit*w_fit + speed*w_speed + impact*w_impact - risk*w_risk`.
- Prefer fast wins early, but always include at least one "judge-magnet" category aligned to the project's strongest theme.

## Workflow

1. Sync blob cache files (metadata/claims/teams/rankings) and parse badges/categories.
2. Load team state and already-claimed badges (if available); ask for missing fields.
3. Map project features to badges/categories and note gaps or missing evidence.
4. Determine already-claimed badges for the selected team by joining:
   - rankings.json (`data.rankings[]`) filtered by `teamId` and `isDraft == false`
   - metadata.json (`data.badges[]`) by `id == badgeId`
   - Optionally note pending claims from claims.json (`data.claims[]`) by `teamId` and `status`
5. Exclude already-claimed badges/categories from recommendations unless the user asks to revisit them.
6. Rank top 5 badge targets and top 1-2 judge categories.
4. For each target, provide:
   - Why it matches
   - What is missing (if anything)
   - Step-by-step checklist
   - Evidence to collect (demo steps, screenshots, repo notes, links, write-up bullets)
   - Dependencies and risks (admin access, approvals, data, settings)
   - 30-60 second judge pitch script
5. Provide a single "Next 60 minutes" task list.

## Output template

Use this structure in responses:

1) Snapshot
- Stack, built now, time left, constraints
- Team name (if known)
- Already claimed badges/categories (from rankings)
- Pending claims (if any)

2) Top badge targets (ranked)
- Badge: <name>
  - Why match
  - Missing
  - Checklist (time-boxed)
  - Evidence to collect
  - Dependencies/risks
  - Judge pitch (30-60 sec)

3) Top judge categories (ranked)
- Category: <name>
  - Why match
  - Missing
  - Checklist (time-boxed)
  - Evidence to collect
  - Dependencies/risks
  - Judge pitch (30-60 sec)

4) Next 60 minutes
- Bullet list of concrete actions

## Guardrails

- Do not suggest cheating or misleading evidence.
- Do not auto-submit or auto-post to social media.
- Keep guidance aligned with hackathon spirit and rules.

## Cross-platform compatibility
