## Before Implementing an Issue (Mandatory Read)

Before writing any code, read the full issue — body **and** comments:

```bash
gh issue view <N>            # title + body + acceptance criteria
gh issue view <N> --comments # full comment thread
```

Design decisions, option selections, and structural clarifications are often in the comments, not the body. An implementer who reads only the body may implement the wrong option.

**If delegating to a subagent:** pass both outputs verbatim. Do not paraphrase, summarize, or "translate" the issue into your own prompt. The issue body IS the delegation prompt. If you feel you need to explain it, that means the issue is underspecified — file a comment on the issue to clarify, then delegate.

**If the acceptance criteria are abstract** (e.g., "make function A consistent with function B" without specifying which structural property to match): do not implement. File a comment on the issue describing the specific structural change required — diff the two functions, identify the exact divergence, state which lines must match — then proceed.

## Before Creating a PR (Mandatory Gate)

Run this checklist **before every `gh pr create`**, without exception.

### Step 1: Run @architect-reviewer

Invoke `@architect-reviewer` with:
- The **design document sections** relevant to the changed code (search `docs/` for specs, ADRs, design docs — if none exist, note that in the PR body)
- The **changed files** (`git diff origin/main --name-only`)
- The **issue being fixed**, if one exists (`gh issue view <N>` — pass the full body)

`@architect-reviewer` will produce a conformance table with CONFORMANT / PARTIAL / MISSING / DEAD per requirement.

### Step 2: Act on the Findings

| Finding | Action |
|---------|--------|
| All CONFORMANT | Proceed to Step 3 |
| Any PARTIAL | Fix the gap, re-run `@architect-reviewer` |
| Any MISSING | Fix before opening the PR — no exceptions |
| Any DEAD | Fix the broken producer→consumer chain before opening the PR |

Do not open the PR with unresolved MISSING or DEAD findings. There is no "I'll fix it in a follow-up" for items the design requires.

### Step 3: Paste the Conformance Table into the PR Body

The PR body **must** contain the `@architect-reviewer` conformance table. A PR body without it signals the gate was skipped.

```markdown
## Design Conformance

| # | Requirement | Source | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | ... | ADR-0003, §2 | CONFORMANT | src/pipeline.py:142 |
...

Reviewed by @architect-reviewer — all requirements CONFORMANT.
```

If the repo has no design documents, write: `No design documents found — conformance review not applicable.`

### Step 4: Open the PR

```bash
gh pr create --fill
```

For stacked PRs and parallel work across multiple stacks, load the `stacked-prs` skill.

---

## gh CLI Recipes

```bash
# Issues
gh issue create -t "Title" -b "Body" -l bug
gh issue list --state open --label "priority:high"
gh issue close 42 -c "Fixed in #45"
gh issue edit 42 --add-label "in-progress"

# PRs
gh pr create --fill                     # From current branch, auto-fill
gh pr list --state open --author @me
gh pr checks 45                         # CI status
gh pr review 45 --approve
gh pr merge 45 --squash --delete-branch # For non-stacked PRs only

# CI/CD
gh run list --workflow=ci.yml
gh run view <id> --log-failed
gh run rerun <id> --failed
gh workflow run release.yml -f force=minor

# Searching
gh search code "pattern" --repo owner/repo
gh search issues "label:bug is:open" --repo owner/repo
```

## Issue Discipline

For full issue writing guidance — templates, removal discipline, design doc references,
test requirements, epic sizing — load the `issue-writing` skill.

### NEVER defer work without an issue
If a reviewer says "you could also..." or "consider adding..." and it's out of scope:
1. Create an issue immediately: `gh issue create -t "Follow-up: ..." -b "From PR #N"`
2. Link it in the PR comment
3. Move on

### Issue Triage Labels
- `bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`
- `priority:high`, `priority:low`
- `good-first-issue` for onboarding

## PR Review Handling

- Address every comment before re-requesting review.
- If you disagree, explain reasoning — don't ignore.
- Fix issues in the same PR, don't defer to follow-ups (unless truly out of scope).
- Self-review with `git diff origin/main` before every push.

## Commit Message Format

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer: BREAKING CHANGE, Refs #issue]
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `ci`, `perf`
