# Task Creation Skill

Converts conversational task descriptions into structured work items (beads) with automatic categorization, priority assignment, and dependency tracking.

## When to Use

Activate this skill when users ask to:
- Create or add a new task or issue
- Track work that needs to be done
- Convert conversational descriptions into structured work items
- Document something to remember or do later
- Set up tasks with blocking relationships
- Categorize and prioritize work

## Required Information

Gather from conversation:

| Field | Type | Example | Notes |
|-------|------|---------|-------|
| **Title** | String | "Fix blog pagination bug" | Clear, specific task name |
| **Description** | String | "The blog archive page shows 404 on pages 2+ after deployment" | Detailed context and acceptance criteria |

## Optional Information

| Field | Type | Example | Notes |
|-------|------|---------|-------|
| **Tags** | Array | ["bug", "urgent", "frontend"] | For categorization and filtering |
| **Blocking** | Array | ["task-id-123"] | Task IDs this blocks (dependent tasks) |
| **BlockedBy** | Array | ["task-id-456"] | Task IDs that block this one |
| **Priority** | Number | 1-5 | 1=critical, 5=low (inferred if not provided) |

## Auto-Categorization Rules

The system automatically determines task type and priority from natural language patterns:

### Task Type Detection

| Pattern | Type | Emoji |
|---------|------|-------|
| "fix", "resolve", "patch", "bug" | bug | 🐛 |
| "add", "create", "implement", "build" | feature | ✨ |
| "improve", "enhance", "optimize", "refactor" | enhancement | 🔧 |
| "update", "upgrade", "bump", "patch version" | chore | ⚙️ |
| "document", "write", "add docs", "update README" | documentation | 📝 |
| "investigate", "research", "explore", "investigate" | research | 🔍 |

### Priority Inference

| Pattern | Priority | Rationale |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| "critical", "urgent", "blocking", "ASAP", "now" | 1 (P0) | Immediate action needed |
| "important", "high", "soon", "before release" | 2 (P1) | Next cycle priority |
| "normal", "should", "eventually" | 3 (P2) | Standard priority |
| "nice-to-have", "consider", "backlog" | 4 (P3) | Lower priority |
| "someday", "maybe", "if time" | 5 (P4) | Lowest priority |

## Generation Process

### Step 1: Gather Task Information

Collect through conversation:

1. "What needs to be done?" (Title)
2. "Can you describe more details?" (Description)
3. "Any context on why or when?" (Optional tags/priority hints)

If user provides conversational description like "The blog is broken on mobile", extract and clarify:
- Title: "Fix mobile layout on blog pages"
- Description: Expanded context about the issue

### Step 2: Auto-Detect Category and Priority

Parse the description and title for keywords:
- Identify task type from verb patterns
- Infer priority from urgency keywords
- Extract dependencies if mentioned

### Step 3: Invoke Task Agent

Run the TypeScript agent to create the task:

```bash
bun run packages/agents/src/cli/agent-cli.ts task-create \
  --title "{{title}}" \
  --description "{{description}}" \
  --type {{type}} \
  --priority {{priority}} \
  --tags "{{tags}}" \
  --blocking "{{blocking}}" \
  --blocked-by "{{blocked_by}}"
```

The agent will:
1. Parse natural language input
2. Create a structured bead in `.beads/issues.jsonl`
3. Assign a unique task ID
4. Set up blocking relationships if provided
5. Return task details and confirmation

**Example output:**
```
--- Task Agent ---

Creating task from description...

[SUCCESS] Task created

Task ID: PROJ-123
Title: Fix blog pagination bug
Type: bug (🐛)
Priority: P1 (High)
Status: pending

Description:
The blog archive page shows 404 on pages 2+ after deployment.
Root cause appears to be missing pagination handler in router.

URL: [task details URL]
```

### Step 4: Display and Confirm

Show the user:
- Generated task ID
- Auto-detected category and priority
- Full description as it was stored
- Any blocking relationships
- Next steps for the task (assignment, workflow)

## Task Type Definitions

### Bug (🐛)
Something is broken or not working as expected.
- **Markers:** "fix", "broken", "bug", "error", "issue", "not working"
- **Default Priority:** P1 or P2 depending on urgency keywords

### Feature (✨)
New functionality to add.
- **Markers:** "add", "create", "implement", "build", "new"
- **Default Priority:** P2 or P3 (features are typically planned)

### Enhancement (🔧)
Improving existing functionality.
- **Markers:** "improve", "enhance", "optimize", "refactor", "speed up", "better"
- **Default Priority:** P2 or P3

### Chore (⚙️)
Maintenance, dependency updates, configuration changes.
- **Markers:** "update", "upgrade", "bump", "version", "dependencies"
- **Default Priority:** P3 (non-blocking)

### Documentation (📝)
Writing or updating documentation.
- **Markers:** "document", "write docs", "add README", "update guide"
- **Default Priority:** P3 (can document in parallel)

### Research (🔍)
Investigation or evaluation needed.
- **Markers:** "investigate", "research", "explore", "evaluate", "compare"
- **Default Priority:** P3 or P4 (time-bounded research)

## Dependency Management

### Setting Up Blocking Relationships

If a task depends on another or blocks others, express as:

**User:** "I need to refactor the API before we can optimize the cache layer"

**Response:** Extract two tasks:
- Task A: "Refactor the API" → Type: enhancement, Priority: P1
- Task B: "Optimize cache layer" → Type: enhancement, Priority: P2
- Set: Task B is blocked by Task A

```bash
bun run packages/agents/src/cli/agent-cli.ts task-create \
  --title "Optimize cache layer" \
  --description "..." \
  --type enhancement \
  --blocked-by "{{task-a-id}}"
```

### Querying Blockers

After creating tasks, show dependencies:
```
Task PROJ-124 (Optimize cache) is blocked by:
  └─ PROJ-123 (Refactor API) - pending

Cannot start until PROJ-123 is completed.
```

## Writing Task Descriptions

### Do:
- Be specific about what needs to happen
- Include context: why, where, what problem it solves
- Add acceptance criteria if applicable ("The page should load in < 1s")
- Mention any related tasks or tickets
- Include error messages or reproduction steps for bugs

### Avoid:
- Generic descriptions like "fix stuff"
- Assumptions about implementation details (let the executor decide)
- Combining multiple unrelated tasks in one item
- Vague impact statements ("make it better")

## Example Interactions

### Example 1: Simple Bug Report

**User:** "The checkout button on the homepage is broken"

**Response:**
1. Clarify: "Can you describe what's broken? Is it not clickable, hidden, or showing an error?"
2. Gather details about browser, reproduction steps
3. Create task:
   ```
   Task ID: PROJ-201
   Title: Fix checkout button functionality on homepage
   Type: bug (🐛)
   Priority: P1 (Critical - affects conversions)
   ```

### Example 2: Feature Request with Dependencies

**User:** "I want to add an analytics dashboard, but first we need to set up event tracking"

**Response:**
1. Create two tasks:
   ```
   Task ID: PROJ-301
   Title: Implement event tracking infrastructure
   Type: feature (✨)
   Priority: P1

   Task ID: PROJ-302
   Title: Build analytics dashboard
   Type: feature (✨)
   Priority: P2
   Blocked By: PROJ-301
   ```
2. Show the dependency chain
3. Explain that PROJ-302 cannot start until PROJ-301 is completed

### Example 3: Enhancement with Optimization Context

**User:** "We should optimize the blog query performance, it's getting slow with more posts"

**Response:**
1. Gather: "How slow? Do you have metrics? Which queries are slow?"
2. Create task:
   ```
   Task ID: PROJ-401
   Title: Optimize blog query performance
   Type: enhancement (🔧)
   Priority: P2

   Description:
   Blog queries are getting slower as post count increases.
   Goal: Sub-100ms response time for archive pages.
   Consider indexing strategy, caching layer, and query optimization.
   ```

## File Locations

| Purpose | Path |
|---------|------|
| Task tracking | `.beads/issues.jsonl` |
| Task agent | `packages/agents/src/task/task-agent.ts` |
| CLI handler | `packages/agents/src/cli/agent-cli.ts` |
| Type definitions | `packages/agents/src/types/index.ts` |

## Task Lifecycle

Tasks created with this skill start in `pending` status:

```
pending → in_progress → completed
            ↓
        (if issues)
          resolved
```

Use beads commands to manage lifecycle:
```bash
bd update <task-id> --status in_progress
bd update <task-id> --status completed
bd close <task-id>
```

## Common Patterns

### Multi-step Breakdown

If user describes complex work, offer to break into subtasks:

**User:** "Redesign the checkout flow"

**Suggest:**
- Task 1: "Design checkout wireframes"
- Task 2: "Implement checkout form component"
- Task 3: "Integrate payment processing"
- Task 4: "Add order confirmation page"

Set dependencies so they work in sequence.

### Adding Context from Errors

For bug reports, include error messages and logs in description:

```
Task: Fix authentication redirect loop

Description:
Users report infinite redirect when accessing /dashboard after login.

Error log:
  [ERROR] /auth/callback → /dashboard → /login → /auth/callback

Environment: Production
Affected users: ~15% of login attempts
First reported: 2026-01-24
```

## Voice Learning

Record feedback on task creation for improvement:

```
Location: .cody/project/library/style-docs/task-style.json

Track:
- Effective task titles (what works)
- Common categorization errors (what to fix)
- Useful description patterns (what to encourage)
```

## Integration with Workflows

After task creation, users can:

1. **Assign** - `bd update <task-id> --owner <name>`
2. **Add labels** - `bd label add <task-id> bug frontend`
3. **Link dependencies** - `bd dep add <task-a> --blocks <task-b>`
4. **Start working** - `bd update <task-id> --status in_progress`
