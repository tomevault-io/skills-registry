description: Regression test the OpenClaw Codex App Server plugin against a live local OpenClaw instance in Telegram or Discord. Use when the user wants an end-to-end OCAS manual test pass, wants to verify binding, `/cas_resume` or `/cas_status` flags for model/fast/yolo, approvals, plan mode, review, compact, status-card controls, split default-vs-full-access permission behavior, stop-button interrupt handling, rename, or other slash-command behavior, or wants reproducible bug notes from a live chat integration run. Use when this capability is needed.

# Test OCAS OpenClaw

Use this skill for manual regression passes of this plugin against a real local OpenClaw instance.

## Preconditions

- Confirm the plugin branch under test is linked into the local OpenClaw checkout and OpenClaw is running.
- Prefer Playwright MCP or Chrome MCP for Telegram Web. It was more reliable than `agent-browser` in recent passes.
- Use [$agent-browser](https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-browser) only as fallback. Read [references/agent-browser.md](references/agent-browser.md) only if you intentionally choose that path.
- If Telegram Web or Discord is not logged in, stop and ask the user to complete login.
- Prefer a low-risk Codex thread unless the user asks otherwise. In this repo, `discrawl` and `dupcanon` are safe defaults for resume tests.
- Treat `Permissions: toggle` as switching between `Default` and `Full Access`. If Full Access is unavailable in the current Codex Desktop session, expect the status card to stay in Default mode with an explanatory note.

## Canonical State Files

Use these when the UI and the plugin disagree:

- Core chat binding store: `~/.openclaw/telegram/thread-bindings-default.json`
- Plugin state: `~/.openclaw/openclaw-codex-app-server/state.json`

Read them when:

- a topic looks bound but `/cas_status` disagrees
- plan mode appears stuck
- a questionnaire should exist but Telegram Web does not render it
- slash replies appear in the wrong chat or topic
- answer buttons appear but the active pending request does not advance
- the status card claims a pending permissions migration that never applies after the run finishes

Treat the state files as diagnostic evidence, not as a thing to hand-edit.

## Preferred Browser Path

- Keep the browser anchored to the requested topic or channel for the full pass.
- For Telegram topics, keep the topic fragment in the URL when possible.
- If the UI looks stale but local state shows the expected pending request or callbacks, refresh Telegram Web with `Cmd+R` before calling it a backend bug.
- Separate browser-navigation failures from OCAS failures. A browser can drift to `General` or the chat list without proving an OCAS routing bug.

## Regression Flow

1. Establish the target conversation.

- Stay in the requested group, DM, channel, or topic for the entire pass.
- If the expected Telegram topic is missing, check whether `/cas_resume --sync` renamed it. Rename it back or create a fresh test topic if needed.
- If slash-command routing leaks into `General`, log that separately and move the browser back to the intended topic before continuing.

2. Baseline the conversation.

- Run `/cas_status`.
- If the topic is already bound, run `/cas_detach` first, then confirm the unbound state with `/cas_status`.
- For Telegram topics, the reply must appear in the same topic. If it lands in `General`, record a routing bug.

3. Resume a thread.

- Prefer `/cas_resume` or `/cas_resume --all` with the normal picker flow.
- Avoid `/cas_resume --all <thread-id>` for now. It is a known regression path and may not surface the expected approval UX.
- Cover at least one flag-driven bind path with `/cas_resume --model <name>`, `/cas_resume --fast` or `/cas_resume --no-fast`, and `/cas_resume --yolo` or `/cas_resume --no-yolo`.
- If the bind path falls back into project or thread pickers, verify the requested model, fast, and yolo settings still apply after the picker choice and final bind approval.
- When approval appears, use Allow Once unless the user asks otherwise.
- After binding, send `who are you`.
- Expect a Codex response. If the reply sounds like OpenClaw persona text instead of Codex, the bind failed.
- Run `/cas_status` again and verify:
  - `Binding: active`
  - the expected thread id or thread title
  - the expected model
  - `Plugin version: 0.0.0` for local dev branch testing when that is the expected version

4. Verify status-card controls.

- Use the interactive `/cas_status` message as the primary control surface.
- Expect one status message that edits in place rather than a stream of follow-up bot messages.
- Verify the card includes:
  - `Select Model`
  - `Reasoning: ...`
  - `Permissions: toggle`
  - `Compact`
  - `Stop`
- Verify `Fast: toggle` only appears when the current model supports fast mode. If the current model does not support fast mode, expect no fast button.
- Click `Select Model`.
- Expect the same message to switch into a model picker.
- Choose a different model.
- Expect the same message to return to the status card and show the new model on the `Model:` line.
- Run `/cas_status` again and confirm the new model is still shown.
- Click the reasoning button.
- Expect the same message to switch into a reasoning picker.
- Choose a different reasoning level.
- Expect the same message to return to the status card and show the new reasoning on the `Model:` line.
- Run `/cas_status` again and confirm the reasoning state persisted independently of the current model.
- If the current model supports fast mode:
  - click `Fast: toggle`
  - expect the same message to update `Fast mode:` immediately
  - run `/cas_status` again and confirm the fast-mode state persisted
- If the current model does not support fast mode:
  - use `Select Model` to switch to a fast-capable model before testing the fast toggle
- Click `Permissions: toggle`.
- If Full Access is available and no turn is active:
  - expect the same message to update `Permissions:` between `Default` and `Full Access`
  - run `/cas_status` again and confirm the new permissions mode persisted
- If a turn is active:
  - expect the same message to stay on the current mode and add a note that the requested permissions mode will apply after the current turn ends
  - after the run finishes, run `/cas_status` again and confirm the pending profile migration actually applied
- If Full Access is unavailable in the current session:
  - expect the status message to remain on `Permissions: Default`
  - expect an explanatory note that Full Access is unavailable for the current session

5. Verify approval rendering in Default mode.

- Put the conversation back into `Permissions: Default` before this step.
- Send this exact prompt as plain text in the bound conversation:

```text
I want you to run `npm view dive` and make sure to ask to exit the sandbox as it needs network access.
```

- Expect a real execution approval dialog, not a plain text question about whether the user wants approval.
- Expect approval buttons such as `Approve` or the platform-equivalent action controls.
- Expect a code-formatted command area that shows `npm view dive`.
- Verify the displayed command is trimmed for presentation and does not leak a shell-launcher wrapper like `/bin/zsh -lc ...`.
- After verifying the dialog, approve the command with `Approve Once` or the platform-equivalent approval button so later tests are not blocked by a stale pending approval.
- If the model only asks a conversational question like `Do you want to allow...` without rendering execution approval controls, treat that test as invalid and rerun with the exact prompt above.

6. Verify full-access execution path when enabled.

- Use the status card to switch into `Permissions: Full Access` when it is available in the current session.
- Send this exact prompt as plain text:

```text
Run `npm view dive version` and reply with only the version string.
```

- Expect the command to run without an approval dialog.
- Expect a direct result after a short delay rather than an approval request.
- After the command completes, switch the status card back to `Permissions: Default`.
- Run `/cas_status` again and confirm the card shows Default mode.

7. Verify long-running review behavior before plan mode.

- Run `/cas_review` before `/cas_plan`.
- Treat `/cas_review` as a long-running request. It may take several minutes.
- Do not interrupt `/cas_review` by starting `/cas_plan`, `/cas_compact`, or other long-running flows while review is active.
- After starting review, wait 30 seconds at a time and check for output again.
- Record whether review immediately skips expected desktop-style base and branch questions. That is a behavior gap, but not the same thing as a review failure.

8. Verify Stop-button behavior on a long-running run.

- Start a long-running Codex action such as `/cas_review`, `/cas_plan`, or a prompt likely to wait on approvals or take more than a few seconds.
- While the run is active, press `Stop` on the status card.
- Expect the active run to interrupt.
- Expect the same status message to refresh in place after the interrupt.
- Run `/cas_status` again and confirm there is no active-run note left behind.
- If you also want to verify deferred permission migration, start a long-running run, press `Permissions: toggle` during the run, confirm the pending note, then press `Stop` and confirm the requested mode applies only after the run ends.

9. Verify plan mode only after review has finished.

- Use `/cas_plan <prompt>`. Do not test plan mode by sending the raw prompt without the command.
- Use a short questionnaire prompt first. A breakfast-choice prompt is good because it exercises question rendering and answer submission.
- Expect:
  - questionnaire text
  - answer buttons
  - question progression when answering
  - final `Implement this plan` controls
- If question 1 renders but button clicks or plain-text answers do not advance the active pending request in `state.json`, record that as a real failure.
- If plan mode gets stuck, `/cas_plan off` should exit it.

10. Verify long-plan truncation.

- Ask for a final plan longer than 4000 characters.
- Expect the Telegram preview to truncate and the plugin to attach the full Markdown plan when needed.

11. Cover other control commands as needed.

- `/cas_resume`
  - Verify `--model`, `--fast` or `--no-fast`, and `--yolo` or `--no-yolo` paths on direct bind, picker bind, and `--new` flows.
  - Expect the chosen settings to show up immediately in `/cas_status` after the bind completes.
- `/cas_mcp`
  - Expect a list of configured MCP servers.
- `/cas_skills`
  - Expect installed skills.
  - If the response shows both a full text list and buttons for the same skills, record a display bug rather than a blocker.
- `/cas_status`
  - Verify in-place message edits for model, reasoning, fast when supported, permissions, compact, and stop controls.
  - Verify the card does not post extra bot messages for each button press unless the platform requires it.
  - Verify `/cas_status --model`, `/cas_status --fast` or `/cas_status --no-fast`, and `/cas_status --yolo` or `/cas_status --no-yolo` update the bound conversation settings and refresh the shown status.
- `/cas_compact`
  - Expect progress keepalives and a final context-usage report.
- `/cas_rename`
  - Verify thread rename and, if requested, `--sync` topic rename behavior.
- `/cas_diff`, `/cas_init`
  - Verify current forward-or-placeholder behavior instead of assuming full implementation.
  - Treat known-placeholder behavior as neutral, not as a regression, unless the user says the command should already work.
- Do not look for `/cas_model`, `/cas_fast`, or `/cas_permissions`.
  - Those controls were folded into `/cas_resume`, `/cas_status`, and the status card.

12. Clean up.

- End by running `/cas_detach`.
- Confirm the conversation is no longer bound.
- Confirm the topic has no lingering pending request in `state.json` if plan mode, stop, or approvals were exercised.

## Result Legend

- `✅` Pass. Behavior matched what should work now.
- `❌` Fail. Behavior should work now and did not.
- `➖` Neutral. The command is known to be unimplemented, placeholder-only, intentionally incomplete, or not configured in this environment.

Use a flat results table while testing:

| Area | Status | Observed | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/cas_status` | `✅` | Bound topic reply in-topic | Include thread, model, and plugin version |
| `/cas_resume` flags | `✅` or `❌` | `--model`, `--fast` or `--no-fast`, `--yolo` or `--no-yolo` survive bind flow | Include whether a picker path preserved the settings |
| Status controls | `✅` or `❌` | Same message edits in place for model, reasoning, fast when supported, permissions, compact, and stop | Record extra messages as a bug |
| `/cas_status` flags | `✅` or `❌` | `--model`, `--fast` or `--no-fast`, `--yolo` or `--no-yolo` refresh the binding and status card | Note unsupported fast-model cases separately |
| Approval dialog | `✅` | Real execution approval with trimmed `npm view dive` | Approve after verifying |
| Full Access execution | `✅`, `❌`, or `➖` | `npm view dive version` runs without approval | Use `➖` if Full Access is unavailable in the current session |
| Permission migration | `✅` or `❌` | Default vs Full Access persists across `/cas_status` | Note pending migration if toggled mid-run |
| Stop button | `✅` or `❌` | Active run interrupts and status refreshes | Record whether refresh was in-place |
| `/cas_review` | `✅` or `❌` | Long-running review | Wait 30s between checks |
| `/cas_plan` render | `✅` or `❌` | Question text and buttons | Separate render from answer submission |
| `/cas_plan` answer submission | `✅` or `❌` | Active request advances or stays stuck | Compare against `pendingRequests` |
| `/cas_diff` | `➖` or `❌` | Placeholder or real command | Use `➖` if still knowingly unimplemented |

## Gotchas

- Telegram Web can go stale. If a simple request appears hung for more than about one minute, and the local state file already shows the pending questionnaire or callbacks, refresh Telegram Web with `Cmd+R` before calling it a backend bug.
- Plain text can still route correctly even when slash commands from a topic leak to `General`. Record both facts separately.
- A core binding can exist in `thread-bindings-default.json` while plugin-local state is stale or missing. Compare both files before concluding which side is wrong.
- Telegram can leave stale questionnaire buttons visible in the DOM. If a click produces `No active Codex run is waiting for input.` but `pendingRequests` still shows the active questionnaire unchanged, record that the visible button press did not reach the active request.
- Starting `/cas_plan` while `/cas_review` is still running can interrupt the review. Avoid that sequence during normal regression passes.
- Permissions migration is edge-triggered on turn completion. If you toggle permissions during an active run, do not expect the profile switch to apply until the run ends or is stopped.
- A full-access test only proves the split-profile path when the command runs without approval and later Default-mode commands still trigger approval again.

## Evidence To Capture

- Exact command sent
- Exact chat or topic where the reply appeared
- Whether the reply was plain text, buttons, or an attachment
- Whether the status card edited in place or created a new bot message
- Which permissions mode was selected before the command under test
- Relevant snippets from `state.json` and `thread-bindings-default.json` when UI behavior is suspicious
- Known-good versus observed behavior
- The result-table row for each command or flow tested
