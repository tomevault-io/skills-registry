# Ralph Wiggum Interactive Setup

You are setting up the Ralph Wiggum autonomous development loop for a project. Interview the user to configure everything, then generate the files.

## Interview Flow

Use AskUserQuestion to walk through each step. Ask one question at a time. Use the answers to generate all configuration files at the end.

### Step 1: AI Harness

Ask which AI coding CLI they'll use:
- **Claude Code** (recommended) - Best agentic capabilities, native subagents, fine-grained permissions
- **OpenCode** - Multi-model (xAI, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google), good for model flexibility. Uses server mode for loops.
- **Codex CLI** - OpenAI's agent, good with o1 for reasoning-heavy tasks
- **Custom** - Any CLI that accepts a prompt file (aider, continue, custom wrapper)

If they pick OpenCode:
- Ask which model in `provider/model` format (e.g. `xai/grok-code-fast-1`, `openai/gpt-4o`). Run `opencode models` to list available.
- Explain that Ralph uses **server mode** (`opencode serve`): the server starts once and stays running across iterations. `loop.sh` handles starting it; the user just needs opencode installed.
- Note: `opencode serve` must be started from the project root (no path argument).

If they pick Codex, ask which model. If custom, ask for the command template (explain `{PROMPT_FILE}` placeholder).

### Step 2: Permission Model

Ask about their comfort level with autonomous permissions:
- **Guarded** - Separate plan/build permissions. Plan mode: read-only. Build mode: Edit, Write, Bash only.
- **Subtasks enabled** - Same as guarded, but adds Task tool in build mode for parallel subagent execution
- **Full auto** - Skip all permission prompts (`--dangerously-skip-permissions` / `--approval-mode full-auto`)

### Step 3: Backpressure / Validation

Ask what language/framework the project uses. Then ask for their specific commands:
- **Build command** (e.g., `npm run build`, `cargo build`, `go build ./...`)
- **Test command** (e.g., `npm run test`, `cargo test`, `pytest`)
- **Lint command** (e.g., `npm run lint`, `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`, `ruff check .`)
- **Type check command** if applicable (e.g., `tsc --noEmit`, `mypy .`)
- **Full check command** - combined command that runs all of the above

If they're unsure, suggest defaults from [references/backpressure.md](references/backpressure.md) based on their language.

### Step 4: Project Conventions

Ask about:
- Brief project description (one sentence)
- Source directory layout (e.g., `src/`, `lib/`, `pkg/`)
- Test file conventions (e.g., `*.test.ts` next to source, `tests/` directory)
- Any guardrails - files Ralph must never touch, patterns to avoid

### Step 5: Subagent Limits

Ask how aggressively to parallelize:
- **Conservative** - Up to 10 search subagents, 2 implementation, 1 validation
- **Standard** - Up to 50 search, 5 implementation, 1 validation
- **Aggressive** - Up to 200 search, 10 implementation, 1 validation

Validation is always 1 subagent (serialized backpressure).

### Step 6: Stream Display

Ask if they want a stream display TUI for monitoring iterations:
- **Yes (recommended)** - Pipe CLI output through `stream_display.py` for readable tool calls, text toggle, and git diffs
- **No** - Raw CLI output (or non-streaming harness like opencode/codex)

If yes, the display will be included and `loop.sh` will pipe through it automatically (Claude Code harness only — other harnesses don't support `--output-format stream-json`).

See [references/stream-display.md](references/stream-display.md) for architecture details.

## File Generation

After the interview, generate all files in the project directory ($ARGUMENTS or current directory):

### Files to generate:

1. **`ralph.conf`** - Configuration from Steps 1-2
2. **`loop.sh`** - Outer loop script (from [templates/loop.sh](templates/loop.sh), customized)
3. **`stream_display.py`** - Stream display TUI (from [templates/stream_display.py](templates/stream_display.py), copy as-is if Step 6 = yes)
4. **`PROMPT_plan.md`** - Planning prompt (from [templates/PROMPT_plan.md](templates/PROMPT_plan.md), with subagent limits from Step 5)
5. **`PROMPT_build.md`** - Building prompt (from [templates/PROMPT_build.md](templates/PROMPT_build.md), with subagent limits from Step 5)
6. **`AGENTS.md`** - Populated with answers from Steps 3-4 (use [templates/AGENTS.md](templates/AGENTS.md) as base)
7. **`specs/`** directory (create empty, with a note to add JTBD specs)

Read each template file, customize it with the user's answers, and write the result.

### Customization rules:

- **AGENTS.md**: Fill in all `[placeholder]` sections with real values from the interview
- **PROMPT_plan.md**: Update subagent limits to match Step 5 answers. Must include "Stopping the Loop" section with `.stop` file instructions.
- **PROMPT_build.md**: Update subagent limits and validation commands to match answers. Must include "Stopping the Loop" section with `.stop` file instructions.
- **ralph.conf**: Set HARNESS, MODEL, ALLOW_SUBTASKS from Steps 1-2
- **loop.sh**: Copy from template as-is (it reads ralph.conf at runtime)
- **stream_display.py**: Copy from template as-is (no customization needed)

## After Generation

Show the user:
1. Summary of what was generated
2. How to run: `./loop.sh --plan` then `./loop.sh --build`
3. Remind them to write JTBD specs in `specs/*.md` (link to [references/specs.md](references/specs.md) format)
4. Explain the stop file: the agent writes `.stop` when the task queue is empty, and the loop stops cleanly
5. If stream display is enabled: press `[v]` during streaming to toggle text visibility

## Architecture Context (for your reference, don't dump on user)

Ralph uses an outer bash loop that runs the AI agent repeatedly with fresh context. Each iteration reads PROMPT.md + AGENTS.md + specs/*, picks a task from IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md, implements it, validates via backpressure (tests/build/lint), updates the plan, commits, and exits. The plan file is persistent shared state between isolated executions.

The loop has two hard stop conditions that always apply:
1. **Max iterations** (always enforced) — a hard cap so the loop never runs forever
2. **Stop file** (`.stop`) — the agent writes this file when nothing is left to do. The loop checks before each iteration, reads contents as a reason, logs it, deletes it, and breaks. Also cleaned up on startup so stale files don't block fresh runs.

Every prompt must include a "Stopping the Loop" section that tells the agent exactly when to write `.stop`. Without this, the loop restarts iterations that immediately exit — burning API calls.

For Claude Code harness, output is piped through `stream_display.py` which renders streaming JSON as readable tool calls + text. Other harnesses don't support `--output-format stream-json` and skip the display.

Key phrases to embed in generated prompts: "study" (not read), "don't assume not implemented", "up to N parallel subagents", "Ultrathink", "capture the why", "keep it up to date".

Plan mode is read-only analysis. Build mode modifies code. Validation always uses exactly 1 subagent for serialized backpressure.
