# Book Latex Skill

## Purpose

Write structured book projects with parts, chapters, sections, and appendices with the Latex typewriting langauge.

## Initialize Project

If you are reading this section, it means that the book yes YET NOT initiated and you need to run the initialization workflow:

### Workflow

#### Step 1: Install the book CLI

##### Prerequisites

Check if the user has uv installed, if not, install it:

Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (Python package manager):

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

##### Installation command

Run the following command to install the book CLI:

```bash
uv tool install .claude/skills/book-latex/cli/windows/
```

make sure the installation is successful by running the following command:

```bash
book --help
```

if the command is not found, try running the following command:

```bash
uv tool install .claude/skills/book-latex/cli/windows/
```

#### Step 2: Initialize the book

Ask the user for the follwing information with the AskUserQuestion tool:

- Book title
- Book subtitle
- Book description
- Book authors
- Book year
- Book edition
- Book publisher
- Book city
- Book state
- Book zip
- Book country
- Book language
- Book type
- Book theme

NB: The user should be able to not answer some of the variables.

Create a table under the heading "Book metadata" in SKILL.md (this file) with the following information:

| Key              | Value |
| ---------------- | ----- |
| Book title       |       |
| Book subtitle    |       |
| Book description |       |
| Book authors     |       |
| Book year        |       |
| Book edition     |       |

| Book publisher | |
| Book city | |
| Book state | |
| Book zip | |
| Book country | |
| Book language | |
| Book type | |
| Book theme | |

#### Step 3: Initialize the book

Run the following command to initialize the book with the following arguments (skip the ones the user skipped in step 2):

- --title `<Book title>`
- --subtitle `<Book subtitle>`
- --description `<Book description>`
- --author <Book author(s)>
- --year `<Book year>`
- --edition `<Book edition>`
- --publisher `<Book publisher>`
- --city `<Book city>`
- --state `<Book state>`
- --zip `<Book zip>`
- --country `<Book country>`
- --language `<Book language>`
- --type `<Book type>`
- --theme `<Book theme>`

```bash
book init --title <Book title> --subtitle <Book subtitle> --description <Book description> --author <Book authors> --year <Book year> --edition <Book edition> --publisher <Book publisher> --city <Book city> --state <Book state> --zip <Book zip> --country <Book country> --language <Book language> --type <Book type> --theme <Book theme>
```

#### Step 4: Compile the book

Run the following command to compile the book:

```bash
book compile --bib
```

#### Step 5: Remove the `Initialize project` section from the SKILL.md file

Remove the `Initialize project` section from the SKILL.md file (this file and this section).

#### Step 6: Quit the workflow

Give the user a message that the book has been initialized and compiled successfully.
Then exit the request and tell the user that they can now start writing the book.

## Book metadata


## General latex rules

### Preamble

1. ALWAYS use the latex/localsetting.tex file to:

   1. Add new latex packages
   2. Define new/redefine commands or environments

### Figures

1. ALWAYS use `figures/name-of-image.png` when refering to an image
2. ALWAYS us the `book image` command to create
   1. Any figure used in the book
   2. Diagrams
   3. Graphs
   4. Flowcharts
   5. ETc
3. ALWAYS read @docs/images/image-prompts.md before creating the prompt to the `book image` command.
4. ALWAYS add captions to a figure in latex

### Mathematics

1. ALWAYS prefer `\begin{equation}...\end{equation}` for `$$...$$` or `\[...\]`
2. ALWAYS prefer `$...$` for `\(...\)`

### Tables

1. Follow the instructions in @.claude/skill/docs/latex/tables.md to write tables in latex

## Workflow

For the given prompt:

1. Read necessary background files (if not already read)
   1. @docs/book-structure-guide.md to learn about the general bookstructure
   2. @docs/latex-code-style.md to learn about the preferred Latex code style
   3. @docs/subfile.md to learn about the subfile latex package and how its used in this book
   4. 
2. Locate which tex files to change
   1. Locate which chapter the change belongs to, for instance ch02, or by the `<title>` of the chapter.
   2. Locate which section of this chapter the change belongs to, for instance sec04, or by the `<title>` of the section
3. 
4. Make the changes following best practice for latex
5. When DONE

## CLI Commands

There are TWO types of commands the user can call for these commands:

1. book CLI commands - the book CLI is a python click application that is already installed and ready to use
2. structure commands - strucutral commands where you change the outline of the book and where you execute a workflow instead of running a CLI command

### Compile Commands

All commands must be run from the **project root directory**.

| Task                                  | CLI                    | Description                                                        |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Compile full book                     | `book compile`       | compiles the entire book, that is, compiles main.tex               |
| Compile chapter 1 of part 1           | `book compile 1.1`   | compiles the chapter ch01 belonging to part part01                 |
| Compile chapter ii of part 1          | `book compile 1.ii`  | in general, chapter can be indexed differently, with patterns chXX |
| Compile section 1 of part 2 chapter 4 | `book compile 2.4.1` | compiles the chapter sec01 within part04 and ch4                   |
| Compile appendix 3                    | `book compile A.3`   | compiles the cppendix app03                                        |
| Outline structure                     | `book outline`       | generates latex/ tree to outline.md                                |

**Examples:**

```bash
book compile              # Compile main.tex (full book)
book compile ch01         # Compile ch01-ettersporselprognoser.tex
book compile chii         # Compile chii-arbeidsflyt-og-ki.tex
book compile sec01        # Compile first matching sec01-*.tex
```

### Target Notation

Use numeric dot notation for precise targeting when files have duplicate indices across parts/chapters.

**Bodymatter:** `x.x.x` (part.chapter.section)

| Notation   | Meaning                | Example Path                         |
| ---------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `3`      | Part 3                 | part03-name/part03.tex               |
| `3.5`    | Part 3, Chapter 5      | part03-name/ch05-name/ch05-name.tex  |
| `3.5.13` | Part 3, Ch 5, Sec 13   | part03-name/ch05-name/sec13-name.tex |
| `0.5`    | Chapter 5 (no part)    | ch05-name/ch05-name.tex              |
| `0.5.13` | Ch 5, Sec 13 (no part) | ch05-name/sec13-name.tex             |

**Backmatter (Appendices):** `A.x.x` (appendix.section)

| Notation  | Meaning           | Example Path                             |
| --------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `A.1`   | Appendix 1        | 300-backmatter/app01-name/app01-name.tex |
| `A.2.5` | Appendix 2, Sec 5 | 300-backmatter/app02-name/sec05-name.tex |

**Examples:**

```bash
book compile 3.5.13    # Part 03, Chapter 05, Section 13
book compile 3.5       # Part 03, Chapter 05
book compile 3         # Part 03
book compile 0.5.13    # Chapter 05, Section 13 (no part structure)
book compile 0.5       # Chapter 05 (no part structure)
book compile A.1       # Appendix 01
book compile A.2.5     # Appendix 02, Section 05
book compile main      # Still works (slug match)
```

Slug-based matching still works: `book compile main`, `book compile ettersporselprognoser`

When ambiguous targets are detected, the CLI will suggest numeric notation alternatives.

### Image Commands

Generate and edit images using AI (requires GEMINI_API_KEY in .env).

Read @.claude\skills\book-latex\docs\images\image-prompts.md to learn about how to make the "prompt":

| Task           | CLI (after install)                            | Standalone (no install)                                           |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Generate image | `book image new --path "path.png" "prompt"`  | generates a new image according to prompt, and saves it to --path |
| Edit image     | `book image edit --path "path.png" "prompt"` | edits an existing image at --path and overwrites it               |

**Examples:**

```bash
book image new --path "figures/flowchart.png" "A process diagram showing order fulfillment"
book image new -p "charts/sales.png" -r 4K "Bar chart comparing Q1-Q4 sales"
book image edit --path "figures/logo.png" "Change background to blue"
```

**Resolution options:** 1K (default), 2K, 4K

**Note:** `edit` overwrites the original image file.

**Note**: A new image must be saved in the figures folder belonging to the .tex file that has the image.

## Structure Commands

For structural operations, load the corresponding command file from `commands/`:

| Command         | Description                      | File                          |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| New Part        | Append a new part at the end     | @/commands/new-part.md        |
| Insert Part     | Insert part at specific position | @/commands/insert-part.md     |
| Rename Part     | Change part slug/title           | @/commands/rename-part.md     |
| Delete Part     | Remove part and contents         | @/commands/delete-part.md     |
| Swap Parts      | Exchange two parts               | @/commands/swap-part.md       |
| New Chapter     | Append chapter to a part         | @/commands/new-chapter.md     |
| Insert Chapter  | Insert chapter at position       | @/commands/insert-chapter.md  |
| Rename Chapter  | Change chapter slug/title        | @/commands/rename-chapter.md  |
| Delete Chapter  | Remove chapter and contents      | @/commands/delete-chapter.md  |
| Move Chapter    | Move chapter between parts       | @/commands/move-chapter.md    |
| Swap Chapters   | Exchange two chapters            | @/commands/swap-chapters.md   |
| New Section     | Append section to a chapter      | @/commands/new-section.md     |
| Insert Section  | Insert section at position       | @/commands/insert-section.md  |
| Rename Section  | Change section slug/title        | @/commands/rename-section.md  |
| Delete Section  | Remove section                   | @/commands/delete-section.md  |
| Move Section    | Move section between chapters    | @/commands/move-section.md    |
| Swap Sections   | Exchange two sections            | @/commands/swap-sections.md   |
| New Appendix    | Append new appendix              | @/commands/new-appendix.md    |
| Insert Appendix | Insert appendix at position      | @/commands/insert-appendix.md |
| Rename Appendix | Change appendix slug/title       | @/commands/rename-appendix.md |
| Delete Appendix | Remove appendix                  | @/commands/delete-appendix.md |

Each command file contains the complete workflow including LaTeX-specific implementation details.

## Missing Arguments Rule

**Always use `AskUserQuestion`** when required information is missing:

- **Part/Chapter/Section/Appendix operations**: Ask for slug and title if not provided
- **Insert operations**: Ask for position if not specified
- **Move operations**: Ask for target location if not provided
