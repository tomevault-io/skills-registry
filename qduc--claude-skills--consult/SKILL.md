# Consult Skill

This skill enables Claude to consult other AI models and specialized agents when facing challenging problems that benefit from an outside perspective.

## When to Use This Skill

Use the consult skill when:

- **Stuck on a problem** - Exhausted obvious approaches and need fresh ideas
- **Complex architectural decisions** - Need validation or alternative perspectives on design choices
- **Technical uncertainty** - Unclear about the best approach among multiple options
- **Debugging challenging issues** - Standard debugging hasn't revealed the root cause
- **Validating assumptions** - Want to verify an approach before implementing
- **Need specialized expertise** - Problem involves domains where another perspective helps

## Available Consultants

### Strategist Agent
**Best for:** Unbiased, objective advice on complex problems and strategic decisions

**How to use:**
Use the `Task` tool with `subagent_type` name "advisor-skills:strategist".

**Use when:**
- Need objective perspective free from existing code/implementation bias
- Complex architectural or strategic decisions requiring fresh eyes
- Team is too close to the problem to see clearly
- Multiple viable options and need help evaluating trade-offs
- Challenging assumptions or exploring alternative approaches
- Want devil's advocate perspective on a proposed solution

### Codex
**Best for:** Deep reasoning problems, complex logical challenges, multi-step analysis

**Command:**
```bash
codex e "your query here" 2>/dev/null
```

**Use when:**
- Complex reasoning or planning problems requiring deep thought
- Multi-faceted analysis with many interconnected factors
- Evaluating trade-offs between approaches
- Difficult algorithmic or logical challenges
- Need step-by-step reasoning through complex scenarios

### Gemini
**Best for:** Online research, current information, real-world data, web-based queries

**Command:**
```bash
gemini "your query here" 2>/dev/null
```

**Use when:**
- Need current information or recent developments
- Looking up documentation, APIs, or libraries
- Research on tools, frameworks, or best practices
- Finding examples or solutions from the web
- Checking current status of technologies or standards

## Usage Pattern

### 1. Identify the Need

Before consulting external AI models, clearly identify:
- What problem you're facing
- What you've already tried
- What specific insight you need

### 2. Formulate the Query

Craft a clear, focused query that:
- Provides necessary context
- States the specific question or problem
- Mentions constraints or requirements
- Avoids unnecessary details

### 3. Consult the AI Model

Use the Bash tool with appropriate timeout (10 minutes = 600000ms):

```bash
codex e "How can I efficiently find duplicate entries in a large dataset with 100M+ records while minimizing memory usage?" 2>/dev/null
```

or

```bash
gemini "I'm deciding between microservices and monolith architecture for a medium-sized team. What factors should guide this decision?" 2>/dev/null
```

### 4. Integrate the Response

After receiving advice:
- Evaluate its applicability to your specific context
- Combine it with your own knowledge
- Adapt recommendations to fit the actual requirements
- Make the final decision based on all available information

## Best Practices

**DO:**
- Use external consultants when genuinely stuck or uncertain
- Provide clear, focused queries with relevant context
- Allow the full 10-minute timeout for complex queries (Codex/Gemini)
- Consider the consultant's perspective alongside your own analysis
- Choose the right consultant for the problem type:
  - **Strategist** for objective, unbiased strategic advice
  - **Codex** for deep reasoning and complex analysis
  - **Gemini** for online research and current information

**DON'T:**
- Consult external consultants for straightforward problems you can solve directly
- Use external consultants as a substitute for your own analysis
- Include sensitive or proprietary information in queries
- Accept advice blindly without evaluating its fit for your context
- Make excessive queries - reserve for genuinely challenging situations

## Command Template

Always use the Bash tool with these parameters:

```
Bash tool parameters:
- command: codex e "query" 2>/dev/null  OR  gemini "query" 2>/dev/null
- description: "Consulting [Codex/Gemini] about [brief problem description]"
- timeout: 600000  (10 minutes in milliseconds)
- dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true  (REQUIRED - see note below)
```

### Important: Sandbox Requirement

**You MUST set `dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true` when calling codex or gemini.**

These tools need to write session files outside the default sandbox-allowed directories. Without this parameter, they'll fail with:
```
Read-only file system (os error 30)
```

This is safe because these are user-installed, whitelisted tools that require filesystem access for session management.

## Example Scenarios

### Example 1: Strategic Advice - Architecture Decision

**Situation:** Need unbiased, objective perspective on a complex architectural decision.

**Use Strategist Agent:**
```
runSubagent tool with:
- agentName: "strategist"
- description: "Architectural decision consultation"
- prompt: "I'm deciding between microservices and monolith architecture for a new project. Our team has 5 developers, the product is still finding product-market fit, and we expect high growth if successful. However, our team is excited about microservices and has been pushing for it. I'm worried we might be choosing it for the wrong reasons. Can you provide an unbiased analysis of this decision?"
```

### Example 2: Deep Reasoning - Architecture Trade-offs

**Situation:** Need to deeply analyze trade-offs between multiple architectural approaches.

**Query to Codex:**
```bash
codex e "I need to design a notification system that handles 100K notifications/day with delivery guarantees. Compare event-driven (Kafka), queue-based (RabbitMQ), and polling approaches. Consider: failure handling, scaling, operational complexity, latency requirements, and team expertise (3 backend devs, no DevOps). What would you recommend and why?" 2>/dev/null
```

### Example 3: Online Research - Current Best Practices

**Situation:** Need to know current best practices for a technology or framework.

**Query to Gemini:**
```bash
gemini "What are the current best practices for implementing authentication in Next.js 14 apps in 2024? I need to understand popular libraries, session vs JWT trade-offs, and security considerations." 2>/dev/null
```

### Example 4: Deep Reasoning - Complex Algorithm Design

**Situation:** Complex algorithmic problem requiring multi-step reasoning.

**Query to Codex:**
```bash
codex e "I need to implement a job scheduler that: 1) respects dependencies between jobs, 2) handles priority levels, 3) supports job cancellation mid-execution, 4) distributes across multiple workers. Walk through the data structures and algorithm design. What are the edge cases and how would you handle them?" 2>/dev/null
```

### Example 5: Online Research - Library/Tool Investigation

**Situation:** Need current information about tools, libraries, or frameworks.

**Query to Gemini:**
```bash
gemini "I need a Python library for parsing PDFs with table extraction. Research current options (2024), compare their accuracy, performance, and ease of use. What do developers recommend?" 2>/dev/null
```

### Example 6: Deep Reasoning - Debugging Complex Logic

**Situation:** Complex bug requiring careful logical reasoning through multiple possibilities.

**Query to Codex:**
```bash
codex e "I have a distributed transaction that occasionally commits on service A but fails on service B, leaving inconsistent state. The retry logic sometimes creates duplicates. Given: idempotency keys, 2PC is not an option, compensation logic exists but races with retries. Reason through the failure scenarios and design a robust solution." 2>/dev/null
```

### Example 7: Online Research - Documentation Lookup

**Situation:** Need to find specific API documentation or examples.

**Query to Gemini:**
```bash
gemini "Find documentation and examples for using PostgreSQL's LISTEN/NOTIFY feature with connection pooling (pgbouncer). What are the gotchas and how do production systems handle this?" 2>/dev/null
```

## Integration with Regular Workflow

The consult skill complements Claude's normal problem-solving:

1. **Attempt direct solution** - Use your knowledge and available tools first
2. **Identify complexity** - Recognize when a problem is particularly challenging
3. **Choose the right consultant**:
   - **Strategist** for objective strategic advice
   - **Codex** for deep reasoning
   - **Gemini** for current information
4. **Consult** - Get outside perspective on the challenging aspects
5. **Synthesize solution** - Combine external input with your analysis
6. **Implement** - Execute the solution using all available information

Remember: External consultants provide valuable perspectives, but you remain responsible for the final implementation and ensuring it fits the specific context and requirements.
