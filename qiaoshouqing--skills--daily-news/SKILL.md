# Design Daily - Design Inspiration & Novel Things

Generate daily design inspiration reports by aggregating from top design platforms, award sites, and design influencers on Twitter/X.

## When to Use

- User asks for design news, design inspiration, or design trends
- User says "design daily", "design news", "设计日报", "设计灵感", "デザインニュース"
- User wants to see what's trending in design today
- User asks for novel/interesting new products or creative tools
- User says "新奇事物", "有什么好玩的", "what's new"

## Language Detection

**CRITICAL: Detect user's language and respond in the EXACT SAME language.**

The skill supports ALL languages. Simply detect what language the user is using and generate the entire report in that language.

**Rule: User's language = Output language. No exceptions.**

Examples:
- User speaks English → Report in English
- 用户说中文 → 报告用中文
- ユーザーが日本語 → レポートは日本語
- Usuario habla español → Informe en español
- ...and ANY other language

## Error Handling

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| WebFetch 403 | Try Chrome MCP for that source |
| Cloudflare CAPTCHA | Use WebSearch as fallback (Kickstarter, Dezeen) |
| Source timeout | Skip and note in stats |
| No content | Mark as failed in stats |
| Chrome MCP unavailable | Use WebFetch-only sources |
| Twitter login wall | Try scrolling, if blocked skip |

## Response Guidelines

1. Always confirm language detection at start
2. Show progress as sources are collected
3. Present final report in user's language
4. Include collection statistics
5. Save report to file and confirm path
6. Prioritize visual and inspiring content over text-heavy articles
7. **CRITICAL: Every item MUST include a clickable link to the original source.** No item should be listed without a URL. Use markdown link format: `[Title](URL)`
8. **Include images when available.** For Dribbble, use the CDN thumbnail URLs (`cdn.dribbble.com/userupload/...?resize=400x0`). For other visual platforms, extract image URLs from page data. Use markdown image format: `![alt](image_url)`
