# Project Memory System

This skill creates a **project memory system** stored in the Git repo so that:
- AI Agents (Claude Code, Codex CLI) immediately get context in every new session
- All local developers share the same context via `git pull` / `git push`
- Token usage is minimized — no need to re-read the entire codebase
- No extra infrastructure required — everything lives in the repo

---

## Core Philosophy: Keep It Simple

The most valuable part of this system is **human-readable markdown files** committed to Git.
They work immediately, require no server, survive `git pull`, and can be reviewed in PRs.

**MCP Memory Server is optional** — see the decision guide below before adding it.

---

## Agent Support Matrix

| AI Agent | Entry Point File | Config Location | Auto-loaded? |
|----------|-----------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Claude Code | `.claude/CLAUDE.md` | `.claude/mcp.json` (if using MCP) | ✅ Yes |
| OpenAI Codex CLI | `.codex/AGENTS.md` | `.codex/config.toml` (if using MCP) | ✅ Yes |
| Both (recommended) | Both files in their folders | Both configs, shared `.project-memory/` | ✅ Yes |

---

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Interview the Project

Ask the user (if not already in the conversation):

1. **Tech stack** — language, framework, database, queue, etc.
2. **Project type** — monolith / microservice / API only / fullstack
3. **Team size** — solo / small (2-3) / medium (4-6) / large (7+)
4. **AI agents in use** — Claude Code only / Codex CLI only / both
5. **Main folder structure** — entry points, architecture layers
6. **Key conventions** — naming, patterns, mandatory rules
7. **Active tasks** — any features currently being worked on?

If the user has already described their project, extract from there directly.

---

### Step 2 — Generate the Folder Structure

**Default setup (no MCP — recommended for most teams):**

```
project-root/
├── .claude/
│   └── CLAUDE.md                      ← Entry point for Claude Code (auto-read)
├── .codex/
│   └── AGENTS.md                      ← Entry point for Codex CLI (auto-read)
├── .gitattributes                     ← Merge strategy for memory files
├── Makefile                           ← `make setup` installs Git hooks
├── scripts/
│   └── hooks/
│       └── pre-commit                 ← Hook script (committed, installed by make setup)
└── .project-memory/
    ├── memory/                        ← Stable project context (rarely changes)
    │   ├── architecture.md
    │   ├── modules.md
    │   ├── conventions.md
    │   └── decisions.md
    └── tasks/
        ├── active/                    ← One file per developer/task (zero conflict)
        │   └── .gitkeep
        └── done.md                    ← Append-only completed task log
```

**With MCP Memory (optional — only add if needed):**

```
project-root/
├── .claude/
│   ├── CLAUDE.md
│   └── mcp.json                       ← Claude Code MCP config
├── .codex/
│   ├── AGENTS.md
│   └── config.toml                    ← Codex CLI MCP config
└── .project-memory/
    ├── memory/
    ├── tasks/
    └── mcp/
        └── memory.json                ← MCP knowledge graph (agent-managed)
```

> Generate the MCP config files only if the user explicitly wants MCP Memory.
> For most teams, the default setup without MCP is sufficient and easier to maintain.

---

### Step 3 — Generate All Files

Use the templates in `assets/templates/` and fill in project-specific info.

**Always generate (default setup):**

| Template | Output file | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| `CLAUDE.md.template` | `.claude/CLAUDE.md` | Entry point for Claude Code |
| `AGENTS.md.template` | `.codex/AGENTS.md` | Entry point for Codex CLI |
| `gitattributes.template` | `.gitattributes` | Anti-conflict merge strategy |
| `Makefile.template` | `Makefile` | `make setup` installs Git hooks |
| `pre-commit.template` | `scripts/hooks/pre-commit` | Hook script committed to repo |
| `modules.md.template` | `.project-memory/memory/modules.md` | Module/domain map |
| `active-task.md.template` | `.project-memory/tasks/active/[name]-[task].md` | Per-developer task |
| `done.md.template` | `.project-memory/tasks/done.md` | Append-only task log |

**Only generate if user wants MCP Memory:**

| Template | Output file | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| `mcp.json.template` | `.claude/mcp.json` | Claude Code MCP config |
| `codex-config.toml.template` | `.codex/config.toml` | Codex CLI MCP config |

**Priority order:**
1. `.claude/CLAUDE.md` and/or `.codex/AGENTS.md` — required, most important
2. `.gitattributes` — critical for teams with 4+ developers
3. `Makefile` + `scripts/hooks/pre-commit` — recommended for teams with 4+ developers
4. `.project-memory/memory/modules.md` — strongly recommended for monoliths
5. MCP config files — only if user explicitly needs MCP Memory

---

### Step 4 — Explain the Daily Workflow

Always explain this to the user so the team understands how to use the system:

```
Morning — start of day:
  git pull
  → .claude/CLAUDE.md / .codex/AGENTS.md updated with latest team context
  → .project-memory/ has latest task status and architecture notes from team

During work:
  Developer creates/updates .project-memory/tasks/active/[name]-[task].md
  Agent reads memory files automatically at session start

End of task:
  Append one-line summary to .project-memory/tasks/done.md
  Delete the active task file
  git add .project-memory/ && git commit && git push
```

---

### Step 5 — Add First-time Setup Instruction

Add this to both `.claude/CLAUDE.md` and `.codex/AGENTS.md`:

```markdown
## First-time Setup

After cloning the repo, run:
```bash
make setup
```
This installs the pre-commit hook that reminds you to update AI memory when committing code.
```

---

### Step 6 — Verify .gitignore

Make sure `.project-memory/`, `.claude/`, and `.codex/` are NOT in `.gitignore`.
These must be committed so the whole team shares the same setup.

For local-only overrides, use `.project-memory/local/` and add it to `.gitignore`.

---

## Should You Use MCP Memory?

Ask these questions before adding MCP Memory:

| Question | If YES | If NO |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Is your project context too large for a single CLAUDE.md? | Consider MCP | Skip MCP |
| Do you need semantic query across hundreds of entities? | Consider MCP | Skip MCP |
| Do you have someone to maintain a server? | Self-hosted MCP | Skip MCP |
| Is your team okay with non-human-readable memory files? | File-based MCP | Skip MCP |
| Are merge conflicts on memory.json acceptable? | File-based MCP | Skip MCP |

**For most teams (including large ones): skip MCP. The markdown files are enough.**

See `references/mcp-memory.md` for full MCP setup guide if needed.

---

## Key Design Decisions

### Why one file per active task?

With 7+ developers committing simultaneously, a single `active.md` causes frequent merge
conflicts. One file per task means each developer only touches their own file — zero conflicts.

### Why `merge=union` on done.md?

`done.md` is append-only. When two developers push simultaneously, Git's union merge
automatically combines both versions without conflict or data loss.

### Why entry point files in `.claude/` and `.codex/`?

Keeps all agent-specific files in their respective config folders. Claude Code reads
`.claude/CLAUDE.md` automatically; Codex CLI reads `.codex/AGENTS.md` automatically.
Separation makes it clear which files belong to which agent.

### Why commit the pre-commit hook script (not the hook itself)?

`.git/hooks/` is never committed to Git. By committing `scripts/hooks/pre-commit` and
using `make setup` to install it, the hook is version-controlled and shared — but each
developer installs it once on their own machine.

---

## Scaling Guidance

| Team Size | Recommended Setup |
|-----------|------------------|
| 1–3 developers | Default setup, single `active.md` is fine |
| 4–6 developers | Split `active/` per developer, add `.gitattributes` + Makefile |
| 7+ developers | Full default setup as above |
| Any size needing semantic memory | Add MCP Memory on top of default setup |
