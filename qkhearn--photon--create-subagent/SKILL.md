# Skill: Photon Subagent Creator

This skill guides you through creating custom subagents for Photon. Subagents are specialized AI assistants that run in isolated contexts with custom system prompts.

## When to Use Subagents
Subagents help you:
- **Preserve context** by isolating exploration from your main conversation.
- **Specialize behavior** with focused system prompts for specific domains.
- **Reuse configurations** across projects.

## Subagent Locations
| Location | Scope | Priority |
|----------|-------|----------|
| `.photon/agents/` | Current project | Higher |
| `~/.photon/agents/` | All your projects | Lower |

## Subagent File Format
Create a `.md` file with YAML frontmatter:
```markdown
