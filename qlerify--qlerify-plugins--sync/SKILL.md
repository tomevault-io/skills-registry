# Sync Domain Model with Qlerify

Sync the local codebase's domain model with Qlerify. Detect entities, commands, and read models in code and ensure they
match Qlerify.

## Step 1: Identify the workflow

1. Call `list_workflows` to get all accessible workflows.
2. Match by project name or ask the user which workflow to sync with.
3. Call `get_workflow` to understand current state (events, entities, commands, read models, bounded contexts).

## Step 2: Scan codebase for domain objects

Scan for the following:

- **Entities**: Classes, interfaces, or schemas representing persistent domain objects (database models, ORM entities,
  TypeScript interfaces).
- **Commands**: Functions or DTOs for state-changing operations (`CreateOrder`, `UpdateCustomer`, POST/PUT/DELETE
  endpoints).
- **Read Models**: Query handlers or GET endpoints (`GetOrderById`, `ListProducts`).

Search patterns:
- Models: `src/domain/`, `src/models/`, `src/entities/`, `**/entity.ts`, `**/model.ts`
- Commands: `src/commands/`, `src/handlers/`, `**/command.ts`
- Queries: `src/queries/`, `src/read-models/`, `**/query.ts`
- API routes: `src/routes/`, `src/api/`, `src/controllers/`
- Schemas: `prisma/schema.prisma`, `**/schema.graphql`, `**/migrations/`

Also check git diff for recently changed schema files to detect field-level changes.

## Step 3: Compare and sync

1. Call `get_workflow` to get all entities, commands, and read models from Qlerify.
2. Compare code vs Qlerify.
3. For differences:
    - **New in code**: Create in Qlerify with proper fields and example data.
    - **Changed fields**: Update Qlerify definition using `addFields`, `updateFields`, `removeFields`.
    - **Removed from code**: Ask user before deleting from Qlerify.

## Step 4: Report changes

Summarize:
- Entities created/updated/deleted
- Commands created/updated/deleted
- Read models created/updated/deleted
- Fields added/modified/removed
- Conflicts needing manual resolution

## Field type mapping

| Code Type                                     | Qlerify Type                          |
|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `string`, `varchar`, `text`, `char`           | `string`                              |
| `number`, `int`, `float`, `decimal`, `bigint` | `number`                              |
| `boolean`, `bool`                             | `boolean`                             |
| Foreign key, relation, `@relation`            | Set `relatedEntity` + `cardinality`   |
| Nested object, JSON, `jsonb`                  | `object`                              |

## Guidelines

When creating/updating entities:
- Include 3 realistic example data values per field
- Set `isRequired: true` for non-nullable fields
- Use `relatedEntity` ($ref path) and `cardinality` to express entity relationships from the owning entity's perspective

When creating commands:
- Name with verbs: Create, Update, Delete, Submit, Cancel
- Fields should correspond to fields on the aggregate root entity they modify
- Mark auto-generated fields with `hideInForm: true`
- Use nested `fields` with `relatedEntity` ($ref path) to reference related entities

When creating read models:
- Name with Get/List/Search prefixes
- Link to entity via `entity` ($ref path)
- Fields represent both inputs and outputs: set `isFilter: true` for query parameters, omit for returned data fields
- Use nested `fields` with `relatedEntity` ($ref path) for return fields that reference other entities
