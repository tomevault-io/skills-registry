# GitHub CLI (gh) Operations

Interact with GitHub using the `gh` command-line tool for comprehensive repository and project management.

## Prerequisites and Authentication

**IMPORTANT:** The GitHub CLI requires authentication before use. The user must authenticate themselves.

### Check Authentication Status

Always verify authentication before attempting GitHub operations:

```bash
gh auth status
```

If not authenticated, the output will indicate login is required.

### User Authentication Required

If `gh auth status` shows the user is not logged in, inform them they need to authenticate:

**Tell the user:**
> "You need to authenticate with GitHub CLI first. Please run: `gh auth login` and follow the prompts to authenticate. I cannot handle authentication for security reasons - you'll need to complete this step yourself."

**Do not attempt to:**
- Run `gh auth login` directly
- Handle credentials or tokens
- Store authentication information

The user must complete authentication in their own terminal session.

### Verifying Repository Context

Many `gh` commands work in repository context. Verify you're in a git repository:

```bash
# Check if in a git repository
git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree 2>/dev/null
```

If not in a repository and repo context is needed, either:
- Navigate to the repository directory, or
- Use `--repo owner/repo` flag to specify the target repository

## Available Operations

The GitHub CLI provides commands for six main domains:

1. **Repository Operations** - Clone, create, view, fork, list repositories
2. **Issue Management** - Create, list, view, edit, comment on issues
3. **Pull Requests** - Create, review, merge, manage PRs
4. **GitHub Actions** - View workflows, trigger runs, check status
5. **Release Management** - Create, publish, manage releases
6. **Gist Operations** - Create, share, manage code snippets

- List workflows: `gh workflow list`
- Run workflow: `gh workflow run <workflow>`
- View runs: `gh run list`
- Watch run: `gh run watch <run-id>`
- View checks: `gh pr checks`

Use for: Triggering workflows, monitoring CI/CD, viewing build status, downloading artifacts.

Common commands:
- Create: `gh release create <tag> --title "Title" --notes "Notes"`
- List: `gh release list`
- View: `gh release view <tag>`
- Download: `gh release download <tag>`

Use for: Creating releases, publishing versions, managing release assets, downloading binaries.

### Gist Operations
**See [references/gists.md](references/gists.md)**

Common commands:
- Create: `gh gist create <file>`
- List: `gh gist list`
- View: `gh gist view <gist-id>`
- Edit: `gh gist edit <gist-id>`

Use for: Sharing code snippets, creating quick pastes, managing gists.

## Common Workflows

### Creating an Issue from Bug Report

```bash
gh issue create \
  --title "Bug: Description" \
  --body "Steps to reproduce..." \
  --label bug \
  --assignee @me
```

### Creating a Pull Request

```bash
# From current branch
gh pr create \
  --title "Feature: Add new capability" \
  --body "This PR adds..." \
  --reviewer username

# Or use commit messages
gh pr create --fill
```

### Checking CI/CD Status

```bash
# For current PR
gh pr checks

# Watch workflow run
gh run watch <run-id>
```

### Creating a Release

```bash
# Create release with auto-generated notes
gh release create v1.0.0 \
  --title "Version 1.0.0" \
  --generate-notes \
  dist/*.zip
```

### Quick Code Sharing

```bash
# Create public gist from file
gh gist create script.sh --public --desc "Useful script"
```

## Getting Help

For any `gh` command, use the `--help` flag:

```bash
gh --help
gh repo --help
gh issue create --help
```

## Working with JSON Output

Many commands support `--json` for programmatic use:

```bash
# Get specific fields
gh repo view --json name,url,stargazerCount

# Parse with jq
gh issue list --json number,title | jq '.[] | select(.title | contains("bug"))'

# Use in scripts
REPO_URL=$(gh repo view --json url --jq '.url')
```

## Repository Context

Some commands require repository context:

```bash
# Explicitly specify repository
gh issue list --repo owner/repo
gh pr create --repo owner/repo

# Or run from within the repository directory
cd /path/to/repo
gh issue list  # Uses current repo
```

## Error Handling

If a `gh` command fails:

1. Check authentication: `gh auth status`
2. Verify repository context: `git remote -v`
3. Check permissions: Ensure you have access to the repository
4. Review error message for specific issues
5. Use `--help` to verify command syntax

Common errors:
- **Not authenticated**: User needs to run `gh auth login`
- **Not in a repository**: Navigate to repo or use `--repo` flag
- **No permission**: User lacks access to the repository or organization
- **Resource not found**: Issue/PR/Release doesn't exist or wrong repository

## Best Practices

1. **Always verify authentication** before attempting operations
2. **Use `--json` output** for scripting and automation
3. **Specify `--repo`** when working with multiple repositories
4. **Use `--help`** to discover command options
5. **Check status first** with commands like `gh pr status` or `gh issue status`
6. **Use `--web`** flag to open resources in browser when needed
7. **Leverage `--fill`** for PR creation to use commit messages
8. **Use `--draft`** for PRs/releases that aren't ready for review

## Advanced Usage

### Working with Multiple Accounts

```bash
# Check which account is active
gh auth status

# Switch accounts
gh auth switch
```

### Using GitHub API Directly

```bash
# For operations not covered by gh commands
gh api repos/owner/repo/issues

# With POST data
gh api repos/owner/repo/issues --method POST \
  --field title="Issue title" \
  --field body="Issue body"
```

### Automation and Scripting

Combine `gh` with other tools for powerful workflows:

```bash
# Create issue for each failed test
while read test; do
  gh issue create --title "Fix: $test" --label "test-failure"
done < failed-tests.txt

# Auto-merge PRs that pass CI
for pr in $(gh pr list --json number --jq '.[].number'); do
  if gh pr checks $pr | grep -q "All checks"; then
    gh pr merge $pr --auto --squash
  fi
done
```
