# Prism Report Manager

Deploy AI-generated research reports as interactive web documents.

## When to use this skill

- You need to publish research findings as a web report
- You want to read or reference a previously deployed report
- You need to list, search, or manage existing reports

## Content Composition

The A2UI format gives you a rich palette of components — charts, tables, statcards, timelines, callouts, accordions — to present structured data. **Text sections are where you write the actual article.** They should read as connected prose: paragraphs that explain, analyze, and narrate.

### Think article, not outline

A text section should typically contain 2–5 paragraphs of prose. If you find yourself writing a one-sentence text section, it probably belongs as part of a larger section. Bullet lists and Markdown subheadings are tools for occasional emphasis within prose — not replacements for it.

### Let components do the structuring

Charts, tables, statcards, and timelines exist to present structured data visually. Text sections exist to provide narrative context, analysis, and transitions between them. Don't replicate what a component does with Markdown formatting inside text (e.g., don't use a Markdown table when a `table` section works better).

### Flow and transitions

Sections should connect to each other. A text section after a chart should interpret the data, not just restate it. A text section before a table should set up why the comparison matters.

### CJK text tips

When writing in Chinese, Japanese, or Korean, use fullwidth quotation marks `「」`（single）and `『』`（double）instead of `""`. Curly/straight double quotes inside a JSON string value require escaping (`\"`), which is error-prone and hard to read. CJK brackets are unambiguous, need no escaping, and are typographically correct.

### Example

**Fragmented (avoid):**

```json
{ "type": "text", "heading": "Overview", "content": "## Key Points\n\n- Revenue grew 15%\n- APAC led growth\n- North America stable" }
{ "type": "text", "heading": "Revenue", "content": "Revenue was $200M in March." }
```

**Article-style (preferred):**

```json
{
  "type": "text",
  "heading": "Overview",
  "content": "The first quarter of 2026 marked a turning point for the global market. Revenue climbed steadily from $100M in January to $200M by March, driven largely by accelerating demand in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nThis growth didn't happen in a vacuum. A combination of regulatory tailwinds in Southeast Asia and aggressive pricing strategies from regional players created conditions for rapid expansion — conditions that North American incumbents have been slow to match."
}
```

## Prerequisites

This skill operates on the local filesystem. Ensure:

- Working directory: `~/Projects/prism-a2report`
- Dependencies installed: `pnpm install`
- Git configured with push access to the repo

## Deploying a Report

### Step 1: Create Report JSON

Write a JSON file following the A2UI format. See `references/A2UI_FORMAT.md`
for the full specification, or `assets/example-simple-report.json` for a
minimal example.

### Step 2: Validate

```bash
cd ~/Projects/prism-a2report
node scripts/validate-report.js /path/to/report.json
```

Fix any validation errors before proceeding.

### Step 3: Deploy via Git

```bash
cp /path/to/report.json reports/<slug>.json
git add reports/<slug>.json
git commit -m "feat: add <slug> report"
git push origin main
```

GitHub Actions will automatically:

1. Validate all report JSON files
2. Generate MDX and Markdown from each report
3. Build the Astro site
4. Copy AI-readable Markdown into the dist output
5. Deploy to Cloudflare Pages

The report will be available at `https://prism.qnury.es/reports/<slug>` once
the workflow completes.

## Reading Reports

```bash
# List all deployed reports
./scripts/list-reports.sh

# Read a specific report (returns Markdown)
curl https://prism.qnury.es/reports/<slug>
```

## Report Format Reference

See `references/A2UI_FORMAT.md` for supported section types:

- `text` — Markdown content with optional heading
- `chart` — Chart.js chart (line, bar, pie, doughnut)
- `table` — Responsive data table
- `code` — Syntax-highlighted code block
- `callout` — Info/warning/success/error callout box
- `statcard` — Metric display with trend indicator
- `tabs` — Tabbed content panels
- `timeline` — Chronological event display
- `figure` — Image with optional caption
- `quote` — Blockquote with author attribution
- `accordion` — Expandable/collapsible sections
