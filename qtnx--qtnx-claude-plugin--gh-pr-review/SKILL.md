# GitHub PR Review CLI Extension

## Overview

The `gh-pr-review` extension brings **inline PR review comments** to the terminal. GitHub's built-in `gh` tool does not show inline comments or review threads - this extension fills that gap.

## Prerequisites

Ensure the extension is installed:

```bash
gh extension install agynio/gh-pr-review
# Update existing installation
gh extension upgrade agynio/gh-pr-review
```

## Core Capabilities

### 1. View Review Threads

To view all reviews and inline comments for a PR:

```bash
gh pr-review review view -R owner/repo --pr <number>
```

Common filters:
- `--reviewer <login>` - Filter by reviewer
- `--states APPROVED,CHANGES_REQUESTED,COMMENTED,DISMISSED` - Filter by state
- `--unresolved` - Show only unresolved threads
- `--not_outdated` - Exclude outdated threads
- `--tail <n>` - Keep only last n replies per thread
- `--include-comment-node-id` - Include GraphQL comment IDs

Example - View unresolved threads from a specific reviewer:
```bash
gh pr-review review view -R owner/repo --pr 42 --reviewer alice --unresolved
```

### 2. Start a Pending Review

To start a new pending review and get the review ID:

```bash
gh pr-review review --start -R owner/repo <pr-number>
```

Output includes `"id": "PRR_..."` - save this for adding comments.

### 3. Add Inline Comments

To add comments to a pending review (requires `PRR_...` review ID):

```bash
gh pr-review review --add-comment \
  --review-id PRR_kwDOAAABbcdEFG12 \
  --path path/to/file.go \
  --line 42 \
  --body "Your comment here" \
  -R owner/repo <pr-number>
```

### 4. Reply to Thread

To reply to an existing review thread:

```bash
gh pr-review comments reply \
  --thread-id PRRT_kwDOAAABbcdEFG12 \
  --body "Your reply" \
  -R owner/repo <pr-number>
```

To reply from a pending review, add `--review-id`:
```bash
gh pr-review comments reply \
  --thread-id PRRT_kwDOAAABbcdEFG12 \
  --review-id PRR_kwDOAAABbcdEFG12 \
  --body "Reply from pending review" \
  -R owner/repo <pr-number>
```

### 5. Submit Review

To finalize and submit a pending review:

```bash
gh pr-review review --submit \
  --review-id PRR_kwDOAAABbcdEFG12 \
  --event APPROVE|COMMENT|REQUEST_CHANGES \
  --body "Review summary" \
  -R owner/repo <pr-number>
```

### 6. Manage Threads

List threads:
```bash
gh pr-review threads list -R owner/repo <pr-number>
gh pr-review threads list --unresolved --mine -R owner/repo <pr-number>
```

Resolve/unresolve threads:
```bash
gh pr-review threads resolve --thread-id PRRT_... -R owner/repo <pr-number>
gh pr-review threads unresolve --thread-id PRRT_... -R owner/repo <pr-number>
```

## Workflow: Complete Review Cycle

1. **Start review**: `gh pr-review review --start ...` -> save `PRR_...` ID
2. **Add comments**: `gh pr-review review --add-comment --review-id PRR_... ...`
3. **View current state**: `gh pr-review review view ...`
4. **Submit review**: `gh pr-review review --submit --review-id PRR_... --event REQUEST_CHANGES ...`
5. **After fixes, resolve threads**: `gh pr-review threads resolve --thread-id PRRT_... ...`

## ID Types

| ID Prefix | Type | Usage |
|-----------|------|-------|
| `PRR_...` | Review ID | For `--review-id` in add-comment, submit, reply |
| `PRRT_...` | Thread ID | For `--thread-id` in reply, resolve, unresolve |
| `PRRC_...` | Comment ID | Returned with `--include-comment-node-id` |

## JSON Output Structure

All commands output structured JSON. For detailed schemas, see `references/schemas.md`.
