# claude-md-audit

Audit a repository's `CLAUDE.md` (or other agent MD file, such as `AGENTS.md` or `GEMINI.md`) and reduce it to only the information that prevents real, repeated agent mistakes. Remove everything the model can discover on its own from the codebase.

**Why this skill exists.** Recent research on coding-agent context files reports that large agent MD files consistently hurt performance:

- LLM-generated context files decreased task completion by ~3%.
- Developer-written context files improved task completion by only ~4%.
- Both raised cost by 20%+ as the model expanded its exploration and reasoning.
- Freshly generated files performed worse than no file at all.

The methodology in this skill was applied by hand to one real `CLAUDE.md` and reduced it from 180 lines to 49 lines (~73% reduction) with no loss of useful steering. The skill codifies that approach so any agent can apply the same reduction to any repository.

These research numbers are reproduced as user-attested from the source the team relied on; a future maintainer should re-check them rather than treat them as canon.

<overview>

## Overview

The core principle:

> **If the model can find it in the codebase, it does not belong in the agent MD file.**

Three secondary principles follow from it:

- **Bias is real.** Mentioning a technology, framework, or architectural pattern biases the model toward it even when the current task is unrelated. ("Pink elephant" effect.)
- **Stale entries actively mislead.** File paths, directory layouts, technology lists, and pattern guides go stale silently as code evolves; the agent can no longer tell whether a stale claim still holds.
- **Discoverable noise costs context.** Anything restating what `glob`, `grep`, or reading project files would reveal is pure overhead on every prompt.

The methodology applies four steps: categorize each section (KEEP / REMOVE / REDUCE), apply the Pink Elephant Test, apply the Staleness Test, then draft the reduced file in a four-section structure.

**Safety net.** Before applying any reduction, create a backup of the original file at `CLAUDE.md.bak` (or `AGENTS.md.bak`, etc.) adjacent to the original. This is non-negotiable — see Methodology Step 0 and Success Criteria.

<methodology>

## Audit Methodology

### Step 0: Locate the file and back it up

Find the target agent MD file before any work begins. Use `glob` to locate `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `GEMINI.md`, or the specific filename the user provided, starting from the repository root. If multiple matches exist — for example, a top-level `CLAUDE.md` alongside one under `.claude/` or a sub-package — surface all paths and ask the user to confirm which file to audit before continuing.

Then copy the chosen file to `<original-name>.bak` in the same directory.

- For `CLAUDE.md` → `CLAUDE.md.bak`.
- For `AGENTS.md` → `AGENTS.md.bak`.
- For other agent MD names, follow the same pattern.

The backup must exist before any edits land. A user who later realizes they removed something they wanted to keep can restore from the backup without rerunning the audit.

### Step 1: Categorize every section

Read the file and classify each section into exactly one of three buckets:

#### KEEP — Steers away from real mistakes the model cannot self-correct

Examples of content that earns its place:

- **Environment gotchas** the model would otherwise get wrong (e.g., "this repo uses SVN, not Git"; "Python is not in PATH").
- **Tool paths the model cannot discover** (e.g., a full path to a non-standard compiler or interpreter).
- **Behavioral rules the model would consistently violate** without the prompt (e.g., "when adding a user-facing string, update *all* locale resource files, not just the base").
- **Workflow pointers for custom tooling** the model cannot infer (e.g., a slash command name, a project-specific settings file).

#### REMOVE — Discoverable from the codebase

Examples that do not earn their place:

- **Directory structure descriptions** — the model finds these by exploring with `glob` and `ls`.
- **Technology lists** — the model reads `package.json`, `*.csproj`, imports, lock files.
- **Architecture overviews** — the model traces code paths.
- **Dependency lists** — the model reads lock files and project configs.
- **Installation requirements** — these serve human onboarding, not agent steering.
- **Code pattern guides** — the model finds patterns by reading existing code.

#### REDUCE — Partially useful, trim to essentials

Examples that need editing rather than removal:

- **Build commands**: keep the command; remove the explanation of what it does.
- **Configuration details**: keep only what cannot be found in config files.
- **Links to detailed docs**: keep the link; remove any prose summary of the linked content.

### Step 2: Apply the Pink Elephant Test

For each section that survived Step 1, ask:

> Does mentioning this bias the model toward it when the current task is unrelated?

If yes, remove it — even if it is otherwise true and accurate. The model that reads "this project uses TRPC" is more likely to reach for TRPC when the current task uses a completely different stack. The model that reads "the adapter architecture uses X" considers adapters even for unrelated UI changes. Mentioning a CLI option pattern biases the model toward that pattern when editing unrelated code.

The bar: if mentioning something could steer the model wrong in unrelated tasks, it must go.

### Step 3: Apply the Staleness Test

For each remaining section, ask:

> Will this go out of date, and would stale info cause harm?

Stable over time (good candidates to keep):

- Environment paths and tool paths.
- Behavioral rules about how to handle a category of change.
- Version-control system (SVN vs. Git rarely flips back and forth).

Goes stale fast (prefer to remove or link out instead):

- File paths and directory structures — they move when code is reorganized.
- Technology descriptions — they drift as dependencies change.
- Pattern guides — they age as conventions evolve.

Prefer entries that are stable. Remove entries that will silently rot.

### Step 4: Draft the reduced file

Use this four-section structure. **Omit any section that is empty** — do not leave a placeholder.

1. **Environment** — gotchas, tool paths, version-control system.
2. **Build Commands** — just the commands, plus links to detailed docs.
3. **Behavioral Rules** — only rules the model consistently violates without them.
4. **Configuration** — settings, credentials, setup instructions for tooling the model interacts with directly.

The four-section structure is empirical, not derived from first principles. If a real audit suggests a fifth durable section (for example, "Workflow pointers" or "Slash commands"), capture it as a follow-up refinement to this skill rather than inventing per-repo section names.
</methodology>

<examples>

## Before/After Examples

### REMOVE: Architecture overview

```markdown
<!-- BEFORE (remove this) -->
## Architecture Overview
### Directory Structure
- **builds/**: Centralized build scripts
- **dev/source/**: Main functional code
- **files/**: Static files copied to installers
- **products/**: Installer projects
- **thirdparty/**: External dependencies
```

The model discovers directory structure by exploring. This block adds ten-plus lines of noise to every prompt without preventing any mistake.

### REMOVE: Technology list

```markdown
<!-- BEFORE (remove this) -->
### Key Technologies
- Languages: C#, C++, VBA, Python, XSLT, JavaScript
- Build System: MSBuild with custom Python scripts
- Installers: NSIS for Windows installers
```

The model reads project files and knows what technologies are in use. Worse, listing technologies invokes the Pink Elephant Test — the model will reach for `NSIS` or `MSBuild` even when the current task has nothing to do with installers or builds.

### KEEP: Environment gotcha

```markdown
<!-- AFTER (keep this) -->
## Environment
- **Version Control**: This repository uses **SVN**, not Git.
- **Python**: Not in PATH. Always invoke the full interpreter path.
```

Without these lines the model would try `git status` and a bare `python` command. Both fail. The lines are short, stable over time, and prevent a real, repeated failure mode.

### KEEP: Behavioral rule

```markdown
<!-- AFTER (keep this) -->
### Localization
When adding user-facing strings, update **all** locale resource files:
- Base (English) resource file
- Each per-language variant (French, German, Japanese, etc.)
```

Without this rule the model updates only the base resource file. The mistake is consistent and the fix is hard to discover from a single locale file — the model has no reason to even look at the others. This is the canonical "the model would consistently get it wrong without it" case.

### REDUCE: Build commands

```markdown
<!-- BEFORE -->
### Debug Builds (Day-to-Day Development)
For building and debugging during development, use the product solutions
directly. The solutions include adapter projects as project references and
a copy-native-dependencies target that handles native runtime dependencies
automatically after Debug builds.
[full build command]
Full guide: docs/guides/setup-dev-build.md

<!-- AFTER -->
### Debug Builds
[full build command]
Full guide: docs/guides/setup-dev-build.md
```

Keep the command and the link. Remove the explanation — the model reads the project file to understand what the build target actually does, and the linked guide carries the authoritative narrative.
</examples>

<success_criteria>

## Success Criteria

- A backup of the original file exists adjacent to it *before* any reduction is applied (see Step 0).
- The reduced file is **under 60 lines** for a typical repository. This is a guideline informed by one real reduction (180 → 49 lines), not a hard fail threshold.
- Every remaining line fails at least one test: the model could not discover it on its own, *or* the model consistently gets it wrong without it.
- No directory structure descriptions remain.
- No technology or dependency lists remain.
- No architecture overviews remain.
- No installation or onboarding instructions written for humans remain.
- Build commands are present as bare commands plus doc links — no prose summary of what the build does.
- The reduced file uses the section structure defined in Step 4, omitting any section that is empty.
</success_criteria>
