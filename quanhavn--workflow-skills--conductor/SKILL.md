# Conductor: Context-Driven Development

Measure twice, code once.

## Overview

Conductor enables context-driven development by:
1. Establishing project context (product vision, tech stack, workflow)
2. Organizing work into "tracks" (features, bugs, improvements)
3. Creating specs and phased implementation plans
4. Executing with TDD practices and progress tracking
5. **Parallel execution** of independent tasks using sub-agents

## Parallel Execution (New Feature)

Conductor now supports parallel task execution for eligible phases:

### How It Works
- During `/conductor-newtrack`, tasks are analyzed for parallelization potential
- Tasks with no file conflicts and no dependencies can run in parallel
- Parallel phases use `<!-- execution: parallel -->` annotation
- Each task has `<!-- files: ... -->` for exclusive file ownership
- Dependencies use `<!-- depends: ... -->` annotation

### Plan.md Format for Parallel Phases
```markdown
## Phase 1: Core Setup
<!-- execution: parallel -->

- [ ] Task 1: Create auth module
  <!-- files: src/auth/index.ts, src/auth/index.test.ts -->
  
- [ ] Task 2: Create config module
  <!-- files: src/config/index.ts -->
  
- [ ] Task 3: Create utilities
  <!-- files: src/utils/index.ts -->
  <!-- depends: task1 -->
```

### Execution Flow
1. **Coordinator** parses parallel annotations
2. Detects file conflicts (fails safe if found)
3. Spawns sub-agents via `Task()` for independent tasks
4. Monitors `parallel_state.json` for completion
5. Aggregates results and updates plan.md

### When to Use Parallel Execution
- ✅ Tasks modifying different files
- ✅ Independent components (auth, config, utils)
- ✅ Multiple test file creation
- ❌ Tasks with shared state
- ❌ Tasks with sequential dependencies

## Context Loading

When this skill activates, load these files to understand the project:
1. `conductor/product.md` - Product vision and goals
2. `conductor/tech-stack.md` - Technology constraints
3. `conductor/workflow.md` - Development methodology (TDD, commits)
4. `conductor/tracks.md` - Current work status
5. `conductor/patterns.md` - **Codebase patterns (read before starting work)**

**Important**: Conductor commits locally but never pushes. Users decide when to push to remote.

For active tracks, also load:
- `conductor/tracks/<track_id>/spec.md`
- `conductor/tracks/<track_id>/solution.md` - **Research findings and implementation approach**
- `conductor/tracks/<track_id>/plan.md`
- `conductor/tracks/<track_id>/learnings.md` - **Patterns/gotchas from this track**

## Learnings System (Ralph-style)

Conductor captures and consolidates learnings across tracks, inspired by [Ralph](https://github.com/snarktank/ralph).

### Key Files
- `conductor/patterns.md` - Project-level consolidated patterns
- `conductor/tracks/<id>/learnings.md` - Per-track discoveries

### Templates
Templates are bundled in the skill's `references/` folder:
- [references/patterns-template.md](references/patterns-template.md) - Full patterns.md template
- [references/learnings-template.md](references/learnings-template.md) - Full learnings.md template
- [references/solution-template.md](references/solution-template.md) - Full solution.md template

### Knowledge Flywheel
1. **Capture** - After each task, append to track's `learnings.md`
2. **Elevate** - At phase/track completion, promote reusable patterns to `patterns.md`
3. **Archive** - Extract remaining patterns before archiving
4. **Inherit** - New tracks read `patterns.md` to prime context

### Learnings Entry Format
```markdown
## [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] - Phase N Task M: <task_name>
Thread: $AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- **Implemented:** <brief description>
- **Files changed:** <list>
- **Commit:** <sha_7chars>
- **Learnings:**
  - Patterns: <reusable patterns discovered>
  - Gotchas: <things to watch out for>
  - Context: <useful context for future>
---
```

### Proactive Behaviors for Learnings
- **On implement start**: Read `patterns.md` and announce pattern count
- **On task complete**: Prompt for learnings capture
- **On phase complete**: Offer pattern elevation to `patterns.md`
- **On archive**: Extract remaining patterns before archiving
- **On refresh**: Consolidate learnings across all tracks

## Beads Integration

Beads integration is **always attempted** for persistent task memory. If `bd` CLI is unavailable or fails, the user can choose to continue without it.

### Detection (MUST check before using bd commands)

Before using ANY `bd` command, you MUST verify:
1. `bd` CLI is installed: `which bd` returns a path
2. `conductor/beads.json` exists AND has `"enabled": true`

```bash
# Check availability - run this before any bd command
if which bd > /dev/null 2>&1 && [ -f conductor/beads.json ]; then
  BEADS_ENABLED=$(cat conductor/beads.json | grep -o '"enabled"[[:space:]]*:[[:space:]]*true' || echo "")
  if [ -n "$BEADS_ENABLED" ]; then
    # Beads is available and enabled - use bd commands
  fi
fi
```

### If Beads is NOT available:
- **DO NOT** run any `bd` commands
- Use only plan.md markers for task tracking
- All conductor commands work normally without Beads

### If Beads IS available:
- Tracks become Beads epics
- Tasks sync to Beads for persistent memory
- Use `bd ready` instead of manual task selection
- Notes survive context compaction

### Beads CLI Commands (`bd`)
