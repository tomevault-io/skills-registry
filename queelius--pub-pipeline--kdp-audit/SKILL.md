# KDP Manuscript Audit

Audit a book manuscript against Amazon KDP (Kindle Direct Publishing) requirements and produce a structured gap report. This skill evaluates interior formatting, cover specs, metadata completeness, and genre-specific requirements (technical vs. fiction).

## Workflow

### 1. Detect Manuscript Type

Identify manuscript files and format. Look for these file types in the current directory or specified path:

**Primary manuscript formats** (Glob tool):
- `.tex` files (LaTeX manuscripts, common for technical books)
- `.docx` files (Microsoft Word, common for fiction/nonfiction)
- `.epub` files (eBook source)
- `.md` files (Markdown manuscripts)
- `.pdf` files (final output)
- `.kpf` files (Kindle Create project)

**Manuscript type classification**:
- **Technical**: LaTeX source, math equations, code listings, index/bibliography
- **Fiction**: Structured chapters, scene breaks, dialog formatting
- **General nonfiction**: Standard chapters, images, minimal equations

If no manuscript is found, ask the user which file to audit.

### 1b. Load User Config

Read `.claude/pub-pipeline.local.md` if it exists (Read tool). Extract the `kdp` configuration section and `author` metadata from YAML frontmatter. The config may include:

```yaml
kdp:
  trim_size: "6x9"
  paper_type: "white"
  binding: "paperback"
  genre: "technical"
  target_page_count: 300
author:
  name: "Author Name"
  bio: "Brief author bio"
```

If the file is missing, inform the user and offer to create one from the template at `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/docs/user-config-template.md`.

### 2. Check Interior Formatting

**Trim size validation**:
- Common sizes for nonfiction: 6×9 inches
- Common sizes for fiction: 5.5×8.5 inches (also 5×8, 5.25×8)
- Common sizes for textbooks: 7×10, 7.5×9.25, 8×10, 8.25×11, 8.5×11 inches
- Verify manuscript trim size matches KDP supported sizes

**Margin requirements** (varies by page count):
- Inside margin formula: 0.375" + (page_count / 1000) * 0.125"
- Outside margin: 0.25" minimum
- Top/bottom margins: 0.25" minimum
- Gutter (spine side) must accommodate binding: 0.5"+ for 150+ pages
- Check if LaTeX geometry package or Word margins are set correctly

**Font requirements**:
- Fonts must be embedded (verify in PDF metadata)
- Standard fonts preferred: Times New Roman, Garamond, Arial, Courier
- Minimum 7pt font size (10-12pt body text recommended)
- Check LaTeX preamble or Word styles for font declarations

**Page numbers and headers/footers**:
- Page numbers should start after front matter (after TOC)
- Headers/footers optional but should be consistent
- Verify no page numbers on blank pages or chapter openers (style preference)

**Table of Contents** (Read/Grep tools):
- TOC must be present and functional (hyperlinked in eBook)
- Verify chapter titles match TOC entries
- Check depth (typically 2-3 levels)

### 3. Check Cover Specifications

**Kindle eBook cover** (file check via Glob tool):
- Minimum resolution: 2560×1600 pixels
- Aspect ratio: 1.6:1 (portrait)
- Color mode: RGB
- Format: JPEG or TIFF
- File size: <50MB
- Look for files matching: `cover*.jpg`, `cover*.jpeg`, `cover*.tiff`, `ebook-cover.*`

**Paperback cover** (if applicable):
- Resolution: 300 DPI minimum
- Color mode: CMYK for print, RGB for PDF preview
- Format: PDF preferred (flattened layers)
- Spine width calculation: page_count × 0.002252 inches (for white paper)
- Spine width calculation: page_count × 0.0025 inches (for cream paper)
- Full cover width: (trim_width × 2) + spine_width + 0.25" bleed
- Full cover height: trim_height + 0.25" bleed
- Look for files matching: `paperback-cover.pdf`, `full-cover.pdf`, `cover-print.*`

**Actual dimension verification** (Bash tool):
- If `identify` (ImageMagick) is available: `identify -format "%wx%h" cover.jpg`
- Otherwise fall back to `file cover.jpg` which often reports dimensions
- For eBook cover: verify dimensions are at least 2560x1600, verify aspect ratio is approximately 1.6:1
- For paperback cover PDF: verify resolution is at least 300 DPI
- Report actual vs required dimensions in the audit output

**Cover content requirements**:
- Title must be clearly readable at thumbnail size
- Author name present
- High contrast, professional design
- No prohibited content (pornographic, violent, misleading)

If cover files don't exist, note as a critical gap.

### 4. Check Metadata Readiness

**Required metadata**:
- **Title**: Descriptive, not misleading (max 200 chars)
- **Subtitle**: Optional but recommended (max 200 chars)
- **Series info**: Series name and number if applicable
- **Description/blurb**: Up to 4000 characters, HTML formatting allowed
- **Categories**: Up to 3 BISAC codes (Browse Subject Headings)
- **Keywords**: Up to 7 keywords/phrases for discoverability
- **Author bio**: Brief professional bio (100-200 words recommended)
- **Language**: Primary language of manuscript

**Pricing and rights**:
- ISBN: Optional (KDP provides free ASIN for eBooks, offers free ISBN for paperback)
- Publication date: Can be set to auto-publish or scheduled
- Territories: Where distribution rights are held
- DRM: Recommended to enable for eBooks

Grep for metadata in manuscript front matter or config. If missing, list what needs to be provided via KDP dashboard.

### 5. Technical Books Only

If manuscript is technical (LaTeX, math-heavy, code listings):

**LaTeX compilation** (Bash tool):
```bash
cd /path/to/manuscript && pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode manuscript.tex
```
Verify compilation succeeds with no critical errors.

**Math rendering**:
- Check for `\usepackage{amsmath}` or equivalent
- Verify math symbols render correctly (sample PDF pages)
- KDP supports PDF with embedded fonts; math must be rasterized

**Code listings**:
- Check for `listings` or `minted` package usage
- Verify syntax highlighting, line numbers, proper formatting
- Ensure code fits within margins (line wrapping or font scaling)

**Index and bibliography**:
- Verify `\printindex` and `\bibliography{}` commands present
- Check that index entries are defined (`\index{}`)
- Verify `.bib` file exists and is referenced
- Run `makeindex` and `bibtex` successfully

### 5b. eBook Validation

Check for eBook-specific issues that affect Kindle rendering and KDP acceptance.

**EPUB validation** (Glob tool, Bash tool):
- Check if `.epub` files exist in the project
- If `epubcheck` is available (`which epubcheck`), run it on the EPUB file and report results
- If `epubcheck` is not installed, note it as a recommendation and list common EPUB issues to manually check:
  - Broken NCX/nav table of contents
  - Missing cover image reference in OPF manifest
  - Invalid HTML entities in content
  - CSS that won't render on Kindle (floats, absolute positioning, complex grid/flexbox)
- If no EPUB exists but `.md` or `.docx` source files do, recommend conversion via Pandoc before audit:
  ```bash
  pandoc manuscript.md -o manuscript.epub --toc --metadata title="Book Title"
  ```
- Note: Kindle Direct Publishing accepts EPUB, DOCX, and PDF. EPUB gives the most control over eBook formatting.

### 5c. Kindle Format Checks

Check for issues that specifically break on Kindle devices:

**Footnotes** (Grep tool):
- Search for `\footnote` in LaTeX source, or footnote markers in DOCX/HTML
- Kindle handles footnotes poorly — recommend converting to endnotes for eBooks

**Wide tables** (Grep tool):
- Flag tables with more than 3 columns — Kindle screens are narrow and tables don't reflow well
- Recommend converting wide tables to lists or simplifying

**Complex CSS** (Grep tool):
- If CSS files exist, flag advanced layout rules: absolute positioning, floats, flexbox, grid, fixed widths in pixels
- Kindle's CSS support is limited — flag any rules that won't render correctly

**Large images** (Bash tool):
- Flag individual images over 5MB — they slow loading on Kindle
- Check with `ls -la` on image files or `identify` if ImageMagick is available

### 6. Fiction Only

If manuscript is fiction or narrative nonfiction:

**Chapter structure** (Grep tool):
- Body: Chapters with consistent heading styles
- Verify chapter numbering is sequential with no gaps
- Check for consistent chapter title formatting (all caps, title case, etc.)

**Front matter order validation** (Grep/Read tools):
- Expected order for fiction: title page -> copyright page -> dedication (optional) -> epigraph (optional) -> table of contents
- Flag if critical elements are missing (title page, copyright page)
- Flag if elements are out of standard order

**Back matter order validation** (Grep/Read tools):
- Expected order: acknowledgments (optional) -> about the author -> also by this author (optional) -> preview of next book (optional)
- Flag if "About the Author" section is missing entirely — this is expected by KDP and readers

**Scene breaks and formatting**:
- Scene breaks marked with `* * *` or similar (not just blank lines)
- Dialog formatting: Consistent use of em-dashes vs. quotation marks
- Paragraph indentation: First line indent (0.25-0.5") except after scene breaks
- No widows/orphans (single lines at top/bottom of page)

**Scene break consistency** (Grep tool):
- Check that scene breaks use a consistent marker throughout (all `* * *`, all `---`, all `###`, etc.)
- Flag if multiple different scene break styles are used in the same manuscript
- Flag if bare blank lines (no marker) are used as scene breaks — these can be lost in eBook conversion

**Special elements**:
- Epigraphs formatted consistently
- Letters, emails, or other narrative devices clearly distinguished
- No footnotes (not well-supported in eBooks; use endnotes or inline)
