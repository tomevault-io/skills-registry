# PyPI Package Publication

Guide the complete workflow for publishing a Python package to the Python Package Index (PyPI). This skill audits package metadata, verifies tests pass, builds distributions, tests on TestPyPI, and handles the final publication.

## Workflow

### 1. Locate the Package

Identify the Python package to publish. Use Glob tool to search for:
- `pyproject.toml` (modern standard)
- `setup.py` (legacy)
- `setup.cfg` (legacy configuration)

If multiple build configuration files exist, prefer `pyproject.toml`. If no package configuration is found, ask the user which package to publish.

### 2. Load User Config

Read `.claude/pub-pipeline.local.md` if it exists (Read tool). Extract `python.pypi_username` from YAML frontmatter. If the file is missing, inform the user and offer to create one from the template at `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/docs/user-config-template.md`.

### 3. Audit Package Metadata

Read the package configuration file(s) and verify all required metadata fields are present and properly formatted.

**Required fields** (Read tool):

| Field | Check |
|-------|-------|
| `name` | Present, follows PyPI naming rules (lowercase, hyphens/underscores only) |
| `version` | Present, follows PEP 440 (e.g., "1.0.0", "0.1.0a1") |
| `description` | Present, concise one-line summary |
| `readme` | Points to existing README file (README.md, README.rst) |
| `license` | Specified via SPDX identifier or license file |
| `authors` or `maintainers` | At least one with name and email |
| `urls` | Homepage, documentation, repository, bug tracker |
| `classifiers` | Development status, intended audience, license, Python versions |
| `python_requires` | Minimum Python version (e.g., ">=3.8") |

**Recommended fields**:
- `keywords` — searchability on PyPI
- `dependencies` — runtime requirements
- `optional-dependencies` — extras like `dev`, `test`, `docs`

### 4. Check README Renders Correctly

Verify the README file renders as valid Markdown or reStructuredText and will display correctly on PyPI.

**Build and validate** (Bash tool):
```bash
cd /path/to/package && python -m build && twine check dist/*
```

This creates source distribution and wheel, then validates that PyPI will accept the long description. Any rendering errors must be fixed before proceeding.

### 5. Verify Tests Exist and Pass

Confirm the package has a test suite and all tests pass.

**Run tests** (Bash tool):
```bash
cd /path/to/package && python -m pytest
```

If pytest is not the test runner, try:
```bash
cd /path/to/package && python -m unittest discover
```

If tests fail, stop and report the failures. Do not proceed with publishing.

### 6. Check Version Not Already Published

Verify the version number has been bumped and does not conflict with an existing PyPI release.

**Check PyPI** (Bash tool):
```bash
pip index versions package-name
```

If the current version already exists on PyPI, inform the user. PyPI does not allow re-uploading the same version number. The version must be incremented.

### 7. Build Distributions

Build source distribution (sdist) and wheel (bdist_wheel).

**Clean and build** (Bash tool):
```bash
cd /path/to/package && rm -rf dist/* && python -m build
```

Important: Always clean `dist/` before building to avoid uploading stale artifacts from previous builds.

Verify that `dist/` now contains:
- `package-name-X.Y.Z.tar.gz` (source distribution)
- `package_name-X.Y.Z-py3-none-any.whl` (wheel)

### 8. Test Upload to TestPyPI

Upload to TestPyPI (test.pypi.org) to verify the upload process and package metadata before publishing to production PyPI.

**Upload to TestPyPI** (Bash tool):
```bash
cd /path/to/package && twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
```

User will be prompted for TestPyPI credentials:
- Username: `__token__`
- Password: TestPyPI API token (starts with `pypi-`)

If the user does not have a TestPyPI account or token, provide instructions:
1. Create account at https://test.pypi.org/account/register/
2. Generate API token at https://test.pypi.org/manage/account/token/
3. Store token in `~/.pypirc` or enter when prompted

### 9. Test Install from TestPyPI

Verify the package installs correctly from TestPyPI.

**Install from TestPyPI** (Bash tool):
```bash
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple/ package-name
```

The `--extra-index-url` flag allows dependencies to be installed from production PyPI while the target package comes from TestPyPI.

**Verify installation**:
```bash
python -c "import package_name; print(package_name.__version__)"
```

If import fails or version is incorrect, investigate and fix before publishing to production PyPI.

### 10. Publish to PyPI

Upload to production PyPI.

**Final upload** (Bash tool):
```bash
cd /path/to/package && twine upload dist/*
```

User will be prompted for PyPI credentials:
- Username: `__token__`
- Password: PyPI API token (starts with `pypi-`)

If the user does not have a PyPI account or token, provide instructions:
1. Create account at https://pypi.org/account/register/
2. Generate API token at https://pypi.org/manage/account/token/
3. Scope the token to this specific project (recommended) or use account-wide token
4. Store token in `~/.pypirc` for future uploads

### 11. Post-Publication Tasks

After successful publication, verify the package is installable and complete post-release tasks.

**Verify installation** (Bash tool):
```bash
pip install package-name
python -c "import package_name; print(package_name.__version__)"
```

**Create GitHub release** (Bash tool):
```bash
git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release vX.Y.Z"
git push origin vX.Y.Z
gh release create vX.Y.Z --title "vX.Y.Z" --notes "PyPI release: https://pypi.org/project/package-name/X.Y.Z/"
```

**Additional recommendations**:
- Update project documentation with installation instructions
- Announce release on relevant channels (blog, social media, mailing lists)
- Monitor PyPI project page for download statistics
- Set up GitHub Actions for automated publishing (see Trusted Publishers below)

### 12. Produce Audit Report

Format the pre-publication audit as a structured markdown report:

```markdown
# PyPI Audit Report: {package name} v{version}

## Summary
- **Status**: READY / NEEDS WORK / NOT READY
- **PyPI URL**: https://pypi.org/project/{package-name}/
- **TestPyPI**: Tested / Not tested
- **Checks**: X/Y passed

## Reference Files

For complete PyPI requirements, metadata specifications, and publishing best practices, consult:
- **`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/docs/pypi-reference.md`** — Full PyPI metadata requirements, TestPyPI workflow, trusted publisher setup, and common rejection reasons

## Important Notes

- **Version immutability**: Once a version is published to PyPI, it cannot be deleted or re-uploaded. Increment the version for any changes. Use `X.Y.Z.postN` for post-release fixes or `X.Y.Z+1` for new features.

- **Clean dist/ before building**: Always `rm -rf dist/*` before running `python -m build`. Stale artifacts from previous builds can cause confusion or upload wrong files.

- **Authentication with `__token__`**: When prompted for username, always use `__token__` (literal string). The password is the API token. Never commit tokens to version control.

- **Trusted Publishers (GitHub Actions OIDC)**: For automated publishing from GitHub Actions, set up a Trusted Publisher at https://pypi.org/manage/account/publishing/. This eliminates the need for long-lived API tokens. The workflow uses OIDC authentication.

- **TestPyPI is not a staging environment**: TestPyPI is for testing the upload and installation process. It is not a full mirror of PyPI and may not have all dependencies. Always test with `--extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple/` to allow dependencies from production PyPI.

- **Classifiers matter**: PyPI classifiers affect discoverability. Include classifiers for development status (Alpha/Beta/Stable), license, intended audience, and all supported Python versions (e.g., "Programming Language :: Python :: 3.8").

- **README is the PyPI homepage**: The README file becomes the project description page on PyPI. Ensure it includes installation instructions, quick start examples, and links to documentation.

- **Build tool requirements**: Ensure `build` and `twine` are installed before running this workflow:
  ```bash
  pip install build twine
  ```
