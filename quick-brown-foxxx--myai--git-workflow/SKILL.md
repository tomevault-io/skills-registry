# Git Workflow

Git is the safety net for agentic development: branches isolate work, commits are
save points, and history explains why changes happened.

For coding-related git work, load `engineering-principles` before this skill so
atomic commits and hooks preserve the local engineering standards.

Default posture:

```text
main/master/dev branch -> stays clean and stable
feature/fix work       -> happens in a branch or worktree when non-trivial
commits                -> small, verified, atomic, and descriptive
```

This skill gives defaults. User instructions, project conventions, host rules,
and repository-specific workflows override them.

---

## Operating Principles

| Principle | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Never fight the harness | Prefer platform-native worktree/workspace tools before manual git worktrees |
| Detect before creating | Check whether you are already isolated before creating branches/worktrees |
| Main stays boring | Keep main/master/dev clean; do real work in short-lived branches/worktrees |
| Commit atomically | One logical change per commit; separate behavior, refactor, docs, and formatting |
| History explains why | Commit messages and summaries should explain intent, not just file movement |
| Destructive operations need confirmation | No force delete/reset/cleanup without explicit approval |

---

## Repository Setup Policy

Before serious edits, understand where you are.

```text
Is this a git repo?
│
├─ yes
│  └─ continue with branch/worktree/commit policy
│
└─ no
   ├─ project directory?        -> initialize git, then set hooks/ignore if current scope fits
   └─ generic user location?    -> do NOT init; warn user that edits are not versioned
```

Project-shaped locations:

```text
/home/user/projects/my-app/
/home/user/Desktop/my-tool/
/repo/customer-api/
```

Generic or personal locations:

```text
~
~/Desktop
~/Downloads
~/.config/something
/tmp/random-edit
```

If editing a generic location, do not initialize git by surprise. Say that the
files are outside a project repo and changes will not have normal versioned
rollback unless the user chooses a repo location.

---

## Branch And Worktree Decision Map

```text
Need isolation?
│
├─ tiny fast edit / one obvious file
│  └─ work in place, inspect diff carefully
│
├─ medium/big edit, risky refactor, feature, or multi-agent work
│  └─ prefer branch/worktree isolation
│
├─ already in branch or worktree?
│  └─ do not create another one unless explicitly needed
│
└─ platform has native workspace/worktree support?
   └─ use native tool first; manual git worktree only as fallback
```

Worktrees are preferred for medium/big work when isolation matters. They can be
skipped for small fast edits or when the prompt/context clearly asks to work in
place.

Parallel agents do not always need distinct worktrees. Use separate worktrees
only when agents need isolation from each other: overlapping files, risky
experiments, or clean fresh state. If agents are read-only or working on
non-overlapping checks, separate worktrees may be unnecessary overhead.

---

## Detect Existing Isolation

Before creating a worktree, check whether the current workspace is already a
linked worktree.

```bash
git rev-parse --show-toplevel
git rev-parse --git-dir
git rev-parse --git-common-dir
git branch --show-current
```

Interpretation:

```text
git-dir == git-common-dir
  -> normal checkout

git-dir != git-common-dir
  -> likely linked worktree
```

Submodule guard:

```bash
git rev-parse --show-superproject-working-tree 2>/dev/null
```

If this returns a path, you are inside a submodule, not simply a worktree. Treat
it according to the submodule/project context.

Never create a nested worktree just because a plan says "use worktree." Detect
first.

---

## Worktree Location Policy

Prefer existing project conventions over inventing a new layout.

```text
1. User/project instructions
2. Existing project-local .worktrees/ or worktrees/
3. Mature project with no worktree config -> external hidden location
4. Small/new/greenfield project -> create project-local .worktrees/ carefully
```

### Small Or Greenfield Projects

For small/new projects, a hidden project-local worktree directory is often best:

```text
proj_root/
  src/
  .worktrees/
    feat1/
    feat2/
  .gitignore
```

If creating `.worktrees/`, also update ignore/configuration so tooling does not
scan it.

Check likely files:

```text
.gitignore
package.json
eslint.config.js / eslint.config.mjs / .eslintrc*
tsconfig.json
pyproject.toml
ruff.toml
.vscode/settings.json
tool-specific config files
```

After adding ignores, run the appropriate build/lint/typecheck health check and
confirm the project is not worse than before.

### Mature Projects

For mature projects with no worktree convention, avoid adding new project-local
tooling noise. Use an external hidden location such as:

```text
~/.config/myai/worktrees/<project>/<branch>/
```

This avoids breaking build, lint, search, test discovery, and editor tooling in
large repositories.

---

## Baseline Health Check

Running tests/lint/typecheck before work in new worktree can be useful, but it is a health check,
not always a gate.

```text
Baseline check passes
  -> good, proceed with a known-clean starting point

Baseline check fails
  -> record existing failure; decide whether it blocks this work
```

Baseline failures may already exist on `main`. Do not treat every baseline
failure as caused by the current work. Record the command and failure summary so
future verification can distinguish new regressions from existing problems.

---

## Commit Policy

Default workflow: commit meaningful verified increments.

Exceptions and overrides:

- User, project, or platform instructions may override commit behavior.
- If current runtime says not to commit without explicit request, make the work
  commit-ready and report that instead of committing.
- Do not commit edits in generic locations such as `~`, `~/Desktop`,
  `~/Downloads`, or random `~/.config/...` directories; warn the user instead.

```text
Work in real project repo
  -> commit meaningful verified increments

Work in generic location
  -> no commits; warn user edits are outside normal project history
```

---

## Atomic Commits

Each commit should do one logical thing.

```text
Good history:
  feat: add task creation endpoint
  test: cover task validation errors
  refactor: extract task validation helper

Bad history:
  update stuff
  fix
  add task feature and refactor auth and update prettier
```

Separate these concerns when practical:

| Concern | Usually separate? | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Behavior change | yes | should be reviewable and revertable alone |
| Refactor | yes | behavior-preserving changes need different review |
| Formatting-only change | yes | hides real diffs if mixed |
| Tests for a feature | often with feature | if they prove the same behavior |
| Config/tooling change | yes unless it is required by the feature | affects the whole project |

---

## Commit Messages

Default format, unless user/project conventions say otherwise:

```text
<type>: <short imperative summary>

<optional body explaining why>
```

Common types:

```text
feat      new behavior
fix       bug fix
refactor  behavior-preserving code change
test      tests only or test infrastructure
docs      documentation only
chore     tooling, dependencies, maintenance
```

Before choosing a message style, check recent commits and match the repository.

```bash
git log --oneline -10
```

Good message:

```text
fix: validate emails before persisting users

Prevents invalid email formats from reaching the database and keeps API error
semantics consistent with existing auth validation.
```

Weak message:

```text
update user stuff
```

---

## Pre-Commit Hygiene

Before committing, inspect what will be committed.

```text
1. Check status and diff
2. Confirm no unrelated files are staged
3. Confirm no secrets or local env files are included
4. Run right-sized verification
5. Commit with repository-style message
```

Reference skills:

| Concern | Use |
| --- | --- |
| Success claims or test/build claims | `verification-before-completion` |
| CI and automated quality gates | `ci-cd-and-automation` |

---

## Generated Files, Ignores, And Hooks

Generated-file and hook setup should happen when it naturally fits your current task
scope.

Good times to update gitignore/hooks/config:

- bootstrapping a project
- editing project configuration
- adding generated outputs or build tooling
- setting up CI/lint/typecheck/test workflows
- creating project-local `.worktrees/`

Bad time:

- fixing a backend bug in a mature monorepo where ignore/hook changes are
  unrelated to the task

Commit generated files only if the project expects them, such as lockfiles,
migrations, generated clients, or checked-in schemas. Do not commit build output,
local env files, secret material, or editor-local noise unless the project has an
explicit convention.

Create git hooks when the project language/environment supports them and the
task scope includes project setup or quality gates. Keep hooks fast and aligned
with the project's toolchain.

---

## Change Summaries

After meaningful work, provide a summary that helps review and catches scope
drift.

```text
CHANGES MADE
  - src/routes/tasks.ts: added validation to POST /tasks
  - src/lib/task-schema.ts: introduced TaskCreateSchema

VERIFICATION
  - npm run lint: passed
  - npm run typecheck: passed
  - npm test -- tasks: passed

INTENTIONALLY NOT TOUCHED
  - auth routes have similar validation gaps, but are out of scope

CONCERNS / FOLLOW-UPS
  - schema rejects extra fields; confirm this matches API policy
```

---

## Git For Debugging

Git is also a diagnostic tool.

```bash
# See recent changes
git log --oneline -20

# Inspect a range
git diff HEAD~5..HEAD -- src/

# Find when a bug appeared
git bisect start
git bisect bad HEAD
git bisect good <known-good-commit>

# Check line history
git blame path/to/file
```

Use this with `systematic-debugging` when the introducing change is not obvious.

---

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why it hurts | Better move |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Creating manual worktrees when the harness already isolates work | Hidden state and cleanup problems | Prefer native harness tools |
| Creating project-local worktrees without ignore/tool config | Build/lint/search may scan worktrees | Update `.gitignore` and relevant tool configs |
| Treating fresh worktree baseline test failures as new regressions | False positives waste time | Record baseline and compare later |
| Giant uncommitted changes | Hard to review, debug, or revert | Commit meaningful verified increments |
| Mixed behavior/refactor/formatting commits | Diffs become opaque | Split concerns |
| Force-pushing or deleting branches casually | Can destroy shared work | Confirm explicitly first |
| Committing from generic user locations | Creates confusing repo history or no repo at all | Warn and ask for project location |

---

## Handoff

Use related skills depending on where the work goes next:

```text
Need incremental execution discipline -> incremental-implementation
Need independent parallel work         -> when-and-how-to-run-parallel-agents
Need diff/PR readiness review          -> doing-code-review
Need verification before commit/PR     -> verification-before-completion
Need CI hooks or quality gates         -> ci-cd-and-automation
```

This skill sets up sane git discipline and isolation. Use platform git safety
rules, `doing-code-review`, and `verification-before-completion` for final
handoff readiness.
