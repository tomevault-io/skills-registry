# Process Emails Skill

**Purpose:** Automatically process emails detected by Gmail Watcher, categorize them by priority, draft appropriate responses, and manage approval workflow for sending replies.

**Dependencies:**
- Gmail Watcher (creates EMAIL_*.md files in `Vault/Needs_Action`)
- handle-approval skill (for sending email responses)
- Email MCP Server (for actual email sending)
- `Vault/Company_Handbook.md` (for response guidelines)

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "process emails"
- "check my inbox"
- "check emails"
- "handle emails"
- "respond to emails"
- "what emails need attention"
- "process gmail"

---

## Overview

This skill implements a complete email processing workflow:

1. **Detection:** Scan `Vault/Needs_Action` for EMAIL_* files created by Gmail Watcher
2. **Analysis:** Extract and categorize email metadata
3. **Prioritization:** Classify emails as urgent/normal/low priority
4. **Response:** Draft appropriate replies using templates
5. **Approval:** Create approval requests for email responses
6. **Logging:** Update Dashboard with all email activities

---

## Workflow Phases

### Phase 1: Scan for New Emails

**Objective:** Identify unprocessed email files in the `Vault/Needs_Action` folder.

**Steps:**
1. Use Glob tool to find all EMAIL_*.md files in `Vault/Needs_Action`
2. Filter out files already processed (check Dashboard log)
3. Sort by priority metadata if available
4. Process in order: urgent → normal → low

**Output:** List of email files to process

---

### Phase 2: Extract Email Metadata

**Objective:** Parse email file to extract sender, subject, body, and metadata.

**Steps:**
1. Read the EMAIL_*.md file using Read tool
2. Extract YAML frontmatter:
   - `type: email`
   - `from: sender@example.com`
   - `subject: Email subject line`
   - `received: timestamp`
   - `priority: high/normal/low`
   - `message_id: unique_id`
3. Extract email body content
4. Optionally use parse_email_metadata.py script for complex parsing

**Reference:** See [Email File Format](#email-file-format) below

---

### Phase 3: Categorize Email

**Objective:** Classify email into appropriate category and priority level.

**Categorization Process:**
1. Load categorization rules from [reference/categorization.md](./reference/categorization.md)
2. Analyze email content for:
   - Sender domain (client, internal, vendor)
   - Subject keywords (invoice, urgent, meeting, etc.)
   - Body content patterns
3. Assign category:
   - Client Communications
   - Sales/Leads
   - Administrative
   - Internal Team
   - Spam/Low Priority

**Priority Assessment:**
1. Load priority rules from [reference/priority-rules.md](./reference/priority-rules.md)
2. Check for urgency indicators:
   - Keywords: "urgent", "asap", "immediate", "deadline"
   - VIP sender list
   - Subject line patterns
   - Time-sensitive content
3. Assign priority: urgent / normal / low

**Output:** Category and priority classification

---

### Phase 4: Draft Response

**Objective:** Generate appropriate email response based on category and content.

**Response Generation:**
1. Load email templates from [reference/email-templates.md](./reference/email-templates.md)
2. Select template based on:
   - Email category
   - Request type (inquiry, invoice, meeting, support)
   - Priority level
3. Personalize template with:
   - Sender name
   - Specific details from original email
   - `Vault/Company_Handbook.md` tone and style
   - `Vault/Business_Goals.md` context (if relevant)
4. Draft response following professional standards

**Quality Checks:**
- Appropriate greeting and closing
- Addresses all questions from original email
- Professional tone consistent with Company_Handbook
- No typos or formatting issues
- Includes relevant information/attachments

**Reference:** See [email-templates.md](./reference/email-templates.md) for all templates

---

### Phase 5: Create Approval Request

**Objective:** Generate approval request for email response following safety protocols.

**Approval Logic:**
1. Check approval thresholds (from handle-approval skill):
   - **Auto-approve:** Replies to known contacts < 200 words (NOT IMPLEMENTED - all require approval for safety)
   - **Require approval:** New contacts, bulk sends, attachments, sensitive content
2. For Silver Tier: **ALL EMAIL SENDS REQUIRE APPROVAL**

**Create Approval File:**
1. Use approval-template from handle-approval skill
2. Create file: `Vault/Pending_Approval/EMAIL_[recipient-name]_[date].md`
3. Include:
   ```yaml
   ---
   type: approval_request
   action: send_email
   to: recipient@example.com
   subject: Response subject line
   created: [timestamp]
   expires: [48 hours from creation]
   priority: [based on email priority]
   status: pending
   original_email_file: EMAIL_xxx.md
   ---
   ```
4. Include full email body in approval request
5. Add context from original email
6. Note any risks or considerations

**Reference:** Use handle-approval skill's approval-template.md

---

### Phase 6: Handle Special Cases

**Urgent Emails:**
- Flag in Dashboard with 🚨 indicator
- Set approval expiration to 24 hours (not 48)
- Add "URGENT" tag to approval filename
- Log with high priority in Dashboard

**Spam/Low Priority:**
- Move directly to `Vault/Done` with "SPAM" or "LOW_PRIORITY" tag
- No response needed
- Log in Dashboard as filtered

**Automated Notifications:**
- Service alerts, newsletters, automated receipts
- Archive to `Vault/Done` with "AUTO_NOTIFICATION" tag
- No action required
- Brief log entry in Dashboard

**Errors/Parsing Issues:**
- If email file is malformed or unreadable
- Create error log in `Vault/Logs`
- Move problematic file to `Vault/Needs_Action/ERROR_*`
- Alert in Dashboard for manual review

---

### Phase 7: Dashboard Logging

**Objective:** Maintain comprehensive audit trail of all email processing.

**Log Entry Format:**
```markdown
## [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] Email Processing

**Email:** [Subject line]
**From:** [Sender name/email]
**Category:** [Category]
**Priority:** [urgent/normal/low]
**Action:** [Response drafted / Archived as spam / Flagged for manual review]
**Approval Status:** [Created approval request / Auto-archived]
**File:** [Original EMAIL_*.md filename]
**Approval File:** [APPROVAL_EMAIL_*.md filename if created]

---
```

**Dashboard Update:**
1. Read current `Vault/Dashboard.md`
2. Append new entry under "Recent Activity" section
3. Update email processing statistics if tracked
4. Save `Vault/Dashboard.md`

---

## Email File Format

Email files created by Gmail Watcher follow this standard format:

- **Workflow:** process-emails → draft response → handle-approval → create APPROVAL_EMAIL_*.md

### create-plan Skill

- **Example:** "Please update our website and send me a proposal"
- **How:** Create plan for complex request, email response confirms plan creation

---

## Error Handling

**File Not Found:**
- Log error to Dashboard
- Continue processing other emails
- Do not stop workflow

**Malformed Email File:**
- Move to `Vault/Needs_Action/ERROR_EMAIL_[filename]`
- Log to Dashboard with error details
- Create manual review task

**Template Not Found:**
- Use generic professional response template
- Log warning to Dashboard
- Email still gets processed

**Approval Creation Fails:**
- Log error to `Vault/Logs`
- Do not send email (safety first)
- Alert in Dashboard for manual intervention

---

## Security & Safety

**Never Auto-Send:**
- All email sends require human approval (Silver Tier standard)
- No exceptions for "trusted" contacts yet (implement in Gold Tier)

**PII Protection:**
- Never include passwords, API keys, credit card numbers in email
- Validate email addresses before creating approval
- Check for typos in recipient address

**Content Validation:**
- Ensure response is professional and appropriate
- No offensive language
- Factually accurate based on Company_Handbook
- Addresses recipient's actual questions

**Rate Limiting:**
- Process maximum 20 emails per batch
- Prevent overwhelming approval queue
- Prevent accidental mass sends

---

## Testing & Validation

**Test with Dummy Email:**
1. Create test email file in `Vault/Needs_Action`
2. Run skill with `/process-emails`
3. Verify categorization is correct
4. Check response draft quality
5. Confirm approval request created properly
6. Validate Dashboard logging

**Test Cases:**
- Urgent client email
- Normal inquiry email
- Spam email
- Automated notification
- Malformed email file

---

## Performance Optimization

**For Large Email Volumes:**
- Process in batches of 10-20
- Prioritize urgent emails first
- Archive spam immediately
- Defer low-priority processing

**For Quick Responses:**
- Use haiku model for categorization (faster, cheaper)
- Cache email templates in memory
- Reuse approval template structure

---
