# OpenGrid OpenSCAD Code Generation

Generates OpenSCAD code for wall-mounted storage items compatible with OpenGrid boards (28mm grid) and MultiConnect mounting system.

## Required Reading Before Generating Code

**Official specifications:**

- **OpenGrid Spec**: 28mm grid spacing standard
- **MultiConnect Mounting**: Slotted backplate system using `multiconnectBack()` module (see ./common_items/backplate_mount.md)

**Pattern references** (read as needed):

- ./common_items/\*.md - Full OpenSCAD modules for each pattern
- ./enhancements.md - Optional feature modules

## Core Understanding (Critical Architecture)

### What Makes OpenGrid Different From Generic 3D Modeling

**Grid constraint**: All items must align to 28mm grid. This affects:

- Mounting backplate width (multiples of 28mm via `distanceBetweenSlots=28`)
- Horizontal dimensions should consider grid alignment for aesthetic consistency
- Vertical dimensions are unconstrained

**MultiConnect mounting system**: Items don't attach directly to wall. They:

1. Have slotted backplate created by `multiconnectBack(width, height, 28)`
2. Slide onto MultiConnect connectors mounted to OpenGrid board
3. Can be repositioned without tools

**Critical parameter relationships**:

```openscad
// These are interdependent:
backWidth = internal_width + wall_thickness*2;  // Total object width
slotCount = floor(backWidth/28);                // Number of connectors
actual_slots = max(1, slotCount);               // Minimum 1 slot
```

**Why this matters**: User requests "50mm wide bin" but code must account for walls, ensure at least one mounting slot, and ideally align to grid aesthetically.

## Pattern Selection Framework (Decision Layer)

### When User Requests Storage

Use this decision tree to select pattern:

| User wants to store               | Primary pattern        | Alternative                               | Read module                                      |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Small hardware (screws, bits)     | Basic Bin              | Shallow Tray (if flat)                    | basic_bin.md                                     |
| Writing tools (pens, markers)     | Vertical Holder        | Angled Storage Row (if visibility needed) | vertical_holder.md, angled_storage_row.md        |
| Hand tools (screwdrivers, pliers) | Tool Holder with Hooks | Angled Storage Row                        | tool_holder_with_hooks.md, angled_storage_row.md |
| Bottles, spray cans               | Round Item Holder      | Advanced Bin (if accessibility needed)    | round_item_holder.md, advanced_bin.md            |
| Mixed items in sections           | Divided Bin            | Multiple basic bins                       | divided_bin.md                                   |
| Light shelving needs              | Shelf Bracket          | N/A                                       | shelf_bracket.md                                 |
| Easy-access items (cables, tape)  | Open Basket            | Multi-Access Holder                       | open_basket.md, multi_access_holder.md           |
| Keys, lightweight hangables       | Hook Array             | Curved Hook (for smooth finish)           | hook_array.md, curved_hook.md                    |
| Phone/charger/electronics         | Multi-Access Holder    | Advanced Bin                              | multi_access_holder.md, advanced_bin.md          |
| Items needing angled visibility   | Angled Storage Row     | Basic Bin                                 | angled_storage_row.md                            |
| Professional-quality bins         | Advanced Bin           | Basic Bin                                 | advanced_bin.md                                  |

### When Pattern Is Unclear

**Ask these questions:**

1. **Access pattern**: Top access (bin), side access (basket), or hanging (hooks)?
2. **Item orientation**: Vertical storage or horizontal?
3. **Item count**: Single type or mixed organization?
4. **Visibility**: Need to see contents from front?
5. **Quality level**: Quick prototype (basic patterns) or production quality (advanced patterns with BOSL2)?

**Default**: When unclear, use Basic Bin - most versatile, user can refine.

## Tolerance Tuning (Printer Calibration)

QuackWorks patterns provide calibration parameters for perfect fit across different printers:

| Parameter                | Range        | Default | Purpose                            |
| ------------------------ | ------------ | ------- | ---------------------------------- |
| slotTolerance            | 0.925-1.075  | 1.00    | Scale slot width (tight/loose fit) |
| dimpleScale              | 0.5-1.5      | 1.0     | Scale dimple size (snap strength)  |
| slotDepthMicroadjustment | -0.5 to +0.5 | 0       | Fine-tune slot depth               |

**Calibration Process:**

1. Print test piece with default values (`slotTolerance=1.00`)
2. If slots too loose (item slides off): decrease by 0.01-0.02
3. If slots too tight (hard to mount): increase by 0.01-0.02
4. Adjust `dimpleScale` for snap strength (v1) or triangle lock (v2)
5. Use `slotDepthMicroadjustment` for final fine-tuning

**When to tune:**

- New printer or filament type
- Temperature changes affecting dimensional accuracy
- Switching between PLA/PETG/ABS
- First print on a new OpenGrid system

## On-Ramp System

On-ramps are conical guides that ease mounting of heavy or tall items onto MultiConnect slots:

| Parameter             | Default | Purpose                                           |
| --------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| onRampEnabled         | true    | Add guide cones to slots                          |
| On_Ramp_Every_X_Slots | 2       | Frequency (1=every slot, 2=every 2nd slot)        |
| onRampHalfOffset      | false   | Stagger ramps between grid points for better grip |

**When to enable:**

- Large/heavy items needing positioning help
- Tall items that are hard to align while lifting
- Items mounted high on wall (harder to see slots)

**When to disable:**

- Small, lightweight items
- Frequently repositioned items (ramps add friction)
- Minimal profile needed (ramps add material)

**Visual:**

```text
Without ramps:     With ramps:
    ║                  ║▲
    ║                  ║ ▲
────╫────         ────╫──▲────
    ║                  ║   ▲
```

Ramps guide item onto slots, especially helpful when you can't see the back of the item.

## Mounting Options Beyond Basic MultiConnect

QuackWorks supports multiple mounting systems. Choose based on your wall setup:

| Option          | Back Thickness | Grid    | Use Case                           |
| --------------- | -------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Multiconnect V1 | 6.5mm          | 25/28mm | Standard, dimple-based hold        |
| Multiconnect V2 | 6.5mm          | 25/28mm | Triangle snap, stronger hold       |
| Multipoint      | 4.8mm          | 25mm    | Thinner profile, Multiboard system |
| GOEWS           | 7mm            | Custom  | Alternative slot design            |
| Command Strip   | N/A            | N/A     | Adhesive mount, rental-friendly    |

### Multiconnect V2 vs V1

**V2 advantages:**

- Triangle cutouts in slots create mechanical lock
- Stronger hold for heavier items
- More positive "snap" feedback when mounted

**V2 parameter:**

```openscad
multiConnectVersion = "v2";  // or "v1"
slotQuickRelease = false;    // Set true to disable triangle locks
```

**When to use V2:**

- Heavy items (>500g)
- Items that vibrate or move (power tools, fans)
- Production designs (better user experience)

**When to use V1:**

- Existing V1 connector infrastructure
- Frequently repositioned items (easier release)
- Prototyping (simpler geometry)

## Code Generation Best Practices

### Parameter Organization

**Always declare these parameters** at top of file:

```openscad
// User-facing dimensions (what they care about)
internal_width = 80;    // Interior space for items
internal_depth = 60;
internal_height = 60;

// Structural parameters (print quality)
wall_thickness = 2.5;   // 2.5-3mm for PETG/PLA
base_thickness = 2.5;

// Mounting parameters (OpenGrid specific)
distanceBetweenSlots = 28;  // ALWAYS 28 for OpenGrid
```

**Why this order**: User dimensions first (what they specified), then structural (printer constraints), then ecosystem constants.

### Mounting Integration Pattern

**Every item needs mounting**. Standard integration:

```openscad
union() {
    // Your item (bin, holder, etc.)
    basic_bin();  // or other pattern

    // MultiConnect backplate
    translate([0, 0, 0])
        multiconnectBack(
            backWidth = internal_width + wall_thickness*2,
            backHeight = internal_height + 20,  // Extend above for strength
            distanceBetweenSlots = 28           // Always 28
        );
}
```

**Common mistake**: Forgetting to extend backplate above item for structural strength. Backplate should be ~20mm taller than internal_height.

### Dimensional Reasoning

**When user says "I need a bin for X"**:

1. **Estimate internal dimensions** for their items:

   - Small screws/bits: 50×40×40mm internal
   - Markers/pens vertical: 15mm diameter × 70mm deep
   - Screwdrivers horizontal: 60mm hook length
   - Spray cans: 80×80×120mm internal

2. **Calculate total dimensions**:

   ```openscad
   total_width = internal_width + wall_thickness*2;
   total_depth = internal_depth + wall_thickness;
   total_height = internal_height;  // No top wall on bins
   ```

3. **Check grid alignment** (optional but aesthetic):

   - Is total_width close to 28mm multiple? (28, 56, 84, 112mm)
   - If yes, mention to user as "this will align nicely to grid"
   - If no, not critical - mounting still works

### Pattern Module Integration

**Read the module file, don't reinvent**. Each pattern has complete module in ./common_items/:

```openscad
// DON'T write basic_bin() from scratch
// DO read ./common_items/basic_bin.md and use/adapt the module

include <path/to/modules.scad>  // If organized
// OR paste module directly (user preference)

basic_bin();  // Call the module
```

**When to adapt vs use as-is**:

- **Use as-is**: Pattern matches user need exactly
- **Adapt dimensions**: User needs different size (pass parameters)
- **Enhance**: User wants label recess, drainage, etc. (use ./enhancements.md)
- **Hybrid**: Combine patterns (divided_bin calls basic_bin)

## BOSL2 Integration (Advanced Patterns)

QuackWorks uses BOSL2 library heavily for advanced geometry. Key patterns:

### rect_tube() for bins (vs manual cube subtraction)

**Instead of manual operations:**

```openscad
// Old way (basic_bin.md)
difference() {
    cube([width, depth, height]);
    translate([wall, wall, base])
        cube([width-wall*2, depth-wall, height]);
}
```

**Use BOSL2:**

```openscad
include <BOSL2/std.scad>

rect_tube(
    size = [width, depth],
    h = height,
    wall = 2,
    chamfer = [5, 0, 0, 0],    // Front, back, left, right
    ichamfer = [2, 0, 0, 0]    // Interior chamfers
)
```

**Benefits**: Cleaner code, automatic chamfering, consistent wall thickness, better performance.

### hull() for curved supports

Creates smooth transitions between shapes:

```openscad
hull() {
    // Item rim (curved holder)
    cylinder(d=30, h=10);

    // Back anchor (mounting plate)
    translate([0, -20, 0])
        cube([30, 5, 10]);
}
```

Generates smooth curve connecting rim to backplate.

### offset3d() for edge rounding

**Instead of manual chamfers:**

```openscad
offset3d(r = 0.5)  // Rounds ALL edges by 0.5mm
    cube([100, 50, 60]);
```

Used in `multi_access_holder.md` for professional finish.

### When to use BOSL2 patterns

**Use BOSL2 (advanced_bin, multi_access_holder, curved_hook) when:**

- User requests production-quality design
- Need professional finish (chamfers, rounded edges)
- Complex geometry (curved hooks, angled bins)
- BOSL2 already installed in environment

**Use basic patterns (basic_bin, vertical_holder) when:**

- Quick prototyping
- User unfamiliar with BOSL2
- Simple geometry sufficient
- Minimal dependencies preferred

**Installing BOSL2:**

```openscad
// Add to top of file:
include <BOSL2/std.scad>
```

User must have BOSL2 library installed. Provide link: <https://github.com/BelfrySCAD/BOSL2>

## Enhancement Integration (When Requested)

**Only add enhancements if**:

1. User explicitly requests (e.g., "with drainage holes")
2. Use case clearly requires (e.g., spray bottle storage → drainage likely helpful)
3. You ask and confirm

**Available enhancements** (see ./enhancements.md for modules):

- **Label recess**: Angled cutout on front for labels (no support needed)
- **Drainage holes**: Grid of holes in floor for wet items
- **Rounded corners**: Hull-based smoothing for cleaning ease
- **Finger scoop**: Cylindrical cutout in front wall for access

**Integration pattern**:

```openscad
difference() {
    basic_bin();           // Base pattern

    // Enhancement as subtraction
    translate([...])
        label_recess(width=40, height=10);
}
```

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall #1: Insufficient Mounting Slots

**Problem**: User requests 40mm wide bin, code generates backWidth=45mm (40 + 2.5×2), results in floor(45/28)=1 slot. Bin is wider than one grid space but only has one connector - looks odd and may be unstable.

**Why it fails**: Didn't consider aesthetic/structural mismatch between item width and mounting points.

**Better approach**:

```openscad
// Either: Adjust dimensions to align to grid
internal_width = 51;  // 51 + 5 = 56mm = 2 grid spaces = 2 slots

// Or: Accept 1 slot but mention to user
echo("Note: 45mm width uses 1 mounting slot. For 2 slots, increase width to ~51mm");
```

### Pitfall #2: Forgetting Clearances

**Problem**: User wants vertical holder for 12mm pens, code uses `cylinder(d=12)`, pens don't fit.

**Why it fails**: No clearance for print tolerance and item variation.

**Better approach**:

```openscad
item_diameter = 12;
clearance = 1;  // 0.5mm per side
cylinder(d = item_diameter + clearance, $fn=40);
```

### Pitfall #3: Hardcoding Instead of Parameterizing

**Problem**: Module has magic numbers scattered throughout instead of calculated values.

**Why it fails**: User can't easily adjust; values get out of sync.

**Better approach**:

```openscad
// DON'T:
cube([82.5, 62.5, 60]);  // What are these numbers?

// DO:
cube([
    internal_width + wall_thickness*2,
    internal_depth + wall_thickness,
    internal_height
]);
```

### Pitfall #4: Overcomplicating Simple Requests

**Problem**: User wants basic bin, code generates elaborate parametric system with 15 parameters.

**Why it fails**: User just wanted a bin. Over-engineering delays delivery.

**Better approach**: Start simple, add complexity only when requested:

```openscad
// First iteration: Basic bin with hardcoded dimensions
internal_width = 80;
// ...

// Later if user wants variants: Parameterize
module customizable_bin(width=80, depth=60, height=60) { ... }
```

### Pitfall #5: Wrong Pattern for Use Case

**Problem**: User wants angled storage for screwdrivers, code generates basic vertical_holder.

**Why it fails**: Missed opportunity to suggest better pattern (angled_storage_row provides visibility).

**Better approach**: Use decision framework, suggest alternatives:

```text
"I'll create an angled_storage_row for your screwdrivers - this tilts them 30° for better visibility.
If you prefer vertical storage (more compact), I can use vertical_holder instead."
```

## Quality Checklist

**Before delivering OpenSCAD code:**

**Required elements:**

- ✓ Parameters clearly defined (internal dimensions, wall thickness, mounting parameters)
- ✓ MultiConnect backplate integrated via `multiconnectBack()`
- ✓ `distanceBetweenSlots = 28` (never other value for OpenGrid)
- ✓ Clearances added where items fit into holes/slots
- ✓ Comments explain key calculations (slot count, dimensions)

**Pattern compliance:**

- ✓ Used appropriate pattern from decision framework
- ✓ Read module from ./common_items/ (didn't reinvent from scratch)
- ✓ Enhancements only included if requested/clearly needed
- ✓ BOSL2 patterns used when appropriate (production quality, complex geometry)

**Dimensional sanity:**

- ✓ Internal dimensions match user's items
- ✓ Total width accounts for walls: `internal + wall_thickness*2`
- ✓ Backplate height extends ~20mm above item for strength
- ✓ At least 1 mounting slot: `floor(backWidth/28) >= 1`

**Code quality:**

- ✓ Parameterized (no magic numbers)
- ✓ Clear variable names (internal_width not iw)
- ✓ Module structure (reusable components)
- ✓ `$fn` specified for cylinders/curves (e.g., `$fn=40`)

**User communication:**

- ✓ Explained pattern choice
- ✓ Stated assumed dimensions if user was vague
- ✓ Noted grid alignment if relevant
- ✓ Mentioned enhancements if applicable to use case
- ✓ Suggested QuackWorks advanced features if production quality needed
