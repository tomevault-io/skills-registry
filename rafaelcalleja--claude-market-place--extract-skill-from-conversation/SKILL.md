# Extract Skill from Conversation

Transform Claude Code conversations into reusable skills by extracting wisdom, instructions, problems, and solutions using Fabric AI patterns.

## Core Concept

Conversations contain valuable workflows buried in noise (trial & error, exploration, backtracking). This skill extracts the **reusable essence** and converts it into a well-structured SKILL.md.

## When to Use

- Convert a debugging session into a reusable debugging skill
- Extract a feature implementation workflow
- Create skills from research/learning conversations
- Document tribal knowledge from past sessions

## Extraction Pipeline

### Step 1: Obtain the Conversation

Conversations are stored as JSONL in Claude Code project directories:

```
~/.claude/projects/{project-path-encoded}/{session-id}.jsonl
```

To find conversations:

```bash
# List recent conversations for a project
ls -lht ~/.claude/projects/{project-path}/*.jsonl | head -10

# Find today's conversations
find ~/.claude/projects/{project-path} -name "*.jsonl" -newermt "today"
```

### Step 2: Parse Conversation to Text

Convert JSONL to readable text using the parse script:

```bash
bash scripts/parse_conversation.sh /path/to/conversation.jsonl > /tmp/conversation.txt
```

The script extracts:
- User messages
- Assistant responses (truncated for context)
- Tool calls and results
- Summaries

### Step 3: Extract Value with Fabric Patterns

Apply multiple Fabric patterns in parallel to extract different aspects:

```bash
# Extract insights and wisdom
cat /tmp/conversation.txt | fabric -p extract_wisdom --stream > /tmp/wisdom.md

# Extract actionable steps
cat /tmp/conversation.txt | fabric -p extract_instructions --stream > /tmp/instructions.md

# Extract the core problem
cat /tmp/conversation.txt | fabric -p extract_primary_problem --stream > /tmp/problem.md

# Extract the solution that worked
cat /tmp/conversation.txt | fabric -p extract_primary_solution --stream > /tmp/solution.md
```

Run in parallel for speed:

```bash
cat /tmp/conversation.txt | fabric -p extract_wisdom > /tmp/wisdom.md &
cat /tmp/conversation.txt | fabric -p extract_instructions > /tmp/instructions.md &
cat /tmp/conversation.txt | fabric -p extract_primary_problem > /tmp/problem.md &
cat /tmp/conversation.txt | fabric -p extract_primary_solution > /tmp/solution.md &
wait
```

### Step 4: Combine into Skill Structure

Merge extractions into a SKILL.md template. The skill should include:

```markdown
---
name: [skill-name-from-problem]
description: "[One-line description of what this skill solves]"
---

# [Skill Title]

[Brief summary from extract_primary_problem]

## Problem Pattern

[When to use this skill - extracted from problem analysis]

## Steps

[Numbered steps from extract_instructions - filtered to critical path only]

## Key Insights

[Bullet points from extract_wisdom]

## Common Mistakes

[Gotchas identified during conversation]

## References

[Any URLs or files that were useful]
```

### Step 5: Refine and Validate

After generating the skill:

1. Remove trial-and-error content
2. Keep only the "recipe that worked"
3. Add imperative language (do X, not "I did X")
4. Verify all referenced files/commands exist
5. Test the skill on a similar problem

## Fabric Patterns Reference

| Pattern | Extracts | Use For |
|---------|----------|---------|
| `extract_wisdom` | Insights, learnings | Key Insights section |
| `extract_instructions` | Step-by-step procedures | Steps section |
| `extract_primary_problem` | Core problem statement | Problem Pattern section |
| `extract_primary_solution` | What actually worked | Solution summary |
| `create_recursive_outline` | Hierarchical breakdown | Complex workflows |
| `summarize` | Brief overview | Skill description |

## What to Include vs Exclude

### Include in Skill

- Commands that worked
- Decisions and why they were made
- Key insights discovered
- Pattern recognition (e.g., "this type of error usually means X")
- Useful references (URLs, files)
- Prerequisites not obvious

### Exclude from Skill

- Trial and error attempts
- Dead ends and backtracking
- Exploratory reads that didn't help
- Typos and corrections
- Social conversation ("thanks", "great")
- Verbose explanations (distill to essence)

## Quick Reference

Full extraction pipeline:

```bash
# 1. Parse conversation
bash scripts/parse_conversation.sh /path/to/session.jsonl > /tmp/conv.txt

# 2. Extract in parallel
cat /tmp/conv.txt | fabric -p extract_wisdom > /tmp/wisdom.md &
cat /tmp/conv.txt | fabric -p extract_instructions > /tmp/steps.md &
cat /tmp/conv.txt | fabric -p extract_primary_problem > /tmp/problem.md &
cat /tmp/conv.txt | fabric -p extract_primary_solution > /tmp/solution.md &
wait

# 3. Review extractions
cat /tmp/problem.md
cat /tmp/solution.md
cat /tmp/steps.md
cat /tmp/wisdom.md

# 4. Generate skill (manually combine or use template)
```
