# Identify Core Need

Extract the fundamental requirement from user requests before any research or implementation.

## Purpose

Transform ambiguous or complex user requests into clear, actionable core needs with validated distinctions. Filter noise before it reaches the user.

## Flow

```
User Request
    │
    ├─ If ambiguous → AskUserQuestion to clarify
    │
    ▼
Apply Behavioral Principles + Validation Log
    │
    ▼
Core Need Output: action + target + triggers + validated distinctions
```

## When to Use

- Before any research phase
- Before generating configurations or code
- When user request has multiple interpretations
- When starting analysis that could go in multiple directions

## Process

**Read and follow `references/process.md` for the complete workflow.**

The process includes:

1. **Clarify User Request**: Use AskUserQuestion if ambiguous
2. **Apply Behavioral Principles**: Focus on practical, no artificial distinctions
3. **Validate Distinctions**: Ask "If I omit this, does it change what user must DO?"
4. **Document in Validation Log**: All evaluations must be logged
5. **Extract Core Need**: action + target + triggers + success criteria

## Key Behavioral Principles

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| FOCUS ON PRACTICAL | Address real objective directly |
| VALIDATE COMPARISONS | Each distinction must be relevant and correct |
| NO ARTIFICIAL DISTINCTIONS | Omit implementation details that don't change action |
| SIMPLICITY > COMPLEXITY | Simple solution without elaboration |
| VALIDATION QUESTION | "Does this change what user must DO?" |

## Output Structure

The mandatory output includes:
- Core Need (action, target, triggers, success criteria)
- Validation Log (minimum 3 evaluations)
- Actionable Distinctions (≤3 items)
- Context Discarded (minimum 2 items)
- Clarifications Made

## Validation Checkpoints

Before proceeding, verify:
- User request is clear
- Minimum 3 distinctions evaluated
- Each included distinction has justification
- Context Discarded has minimum 2 items
- Actionable Distinctions has ≤3 items
