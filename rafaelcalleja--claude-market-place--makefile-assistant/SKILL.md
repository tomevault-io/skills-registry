# Makefile Assistant

## Overview

Makefile Assistant automatically captures interesting Bash commands executed by Claude Code (via `cchistory`) and transforms them into well-documented, categorized Makefile targets. This eliminates manual Makefile maintenance and creates a living documentation of your project's common commands.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Claude Code executes a Bash command (automatically triggers)
- User explicitly requests Makefile generation or updates
- User asks to document, organize, or simplify repetitive project tasks
- User requests analysis of existing Makefiles

## CRITICAL: When NOT to Skip This Skill

**Even under pressure, ALWAYS run this workflow for:**

1. **Emergency/Incident Commands**
   - "One-time fix" = will happen again
   - Emergency commands are EXACTLY what should be documented
   - Next incident responder needs these commands
   - Example: `docker restart postgres-db && docker logs postgres-db --tail=50`

2. **Setup/Onboarding Commands**
   - Perfect candidates for `make setup` or `make dev-start`
   - New team members need these
   - Batch of 8 commands = one comprehensive setup target
   - Process NOW while fresh, not "later"

3. **Diagnostic/Info Commands**
   - System state commands are team knowledge
   - `docker info`, `git status`, `npm list` are NOT trivial
   - Help debugging, troubleshooting, environment issues
   - Worth documenting even if "simple"

4. **Hard-Won Debug Sequences**
   - If you ran it 10+ times debugging, document it
   - Sunk cost is ALREADY PAID, documentation is cheap
   - Team benefit >> 2 minutes of workflow

**No exceptions for:**
- ❌ "I'm exhausted" - workflow takes 60 seconds
- ❌ "User wants to move on" - user will thank you later
- ❌ "Too trivial" - see trivial definition below
- ❌ "One-time emergency" - emergencies repeat
- ❌ "Will do later" - later never happens
- ❌ "Already works" - documentation makes it DISCOVERABLE

## How It Works

### Automatic Workflow

1. **Detection**: When Claude executes a Bash command, the skill activates
2. **Analysis**: Reads new commands from `cchistory` since last check
3. **Filtering**: Ignores ONLY truly trivial commands (see definition below)
4. **Similarity Check**: Compares against existing targets in `.claude/makefiles/`
5. **User Confirmation**: Uses `AskUserQuestion` to confirm target creation
6. **Generation**: Creates target with "When to use" documentation
7. **Categorization**: Places target in appropriate .mk file (testing.mk, docker.mk, etc.)
8. **Help Update**: Regenerates root Makefile help target (REQUIRED - not optional)

### What is "Trivial"? (Explicit Definition)

**ONLY these commands are trivial (skip them):**
- `ls`, `ls -la`, `ll` - directory listing
- `cd <path>` - navigation
- `pwd` - print working directory
- `cat <file>` - reading a single file (unless complex processing)
- `echo <text>` - simple output
- `clear` - terminal clear

**NOT trivial (MUST process these):**
- `docker info` - system diagnostic (useful for debugging)
- `docker ps`, `docker images` - state inspection
- `git status`, `git log`, `git diff` - repository state
- `npm list`, `pip list` - dependency inspection
- `pytest`, `npm test` - any testing command
- `env | grep X` - environment inspection
- Any command with flags/arguments beyond basic usage

**Rule of thumb:** If a command provides system state, configuration, or debugging info - it's NOT trivial.

**When unsure:** Process it. User can decline via AskUserQuestion.

### Generated Structure

```
project/
├── Makefile (root - includes all .mk files)
└── .claude/
    ├── .makefile-last-line (state tracking)
    └── makefiles/
        ├── testing.mk
        ├── linting.mk
        ├── docker.mk
        ├── build.mk
        ├── database.mk
        ├── deploy.mk
        ├── dev.mk
        ├── clean.mk
        └── misc.mk
```

## Usage Instructions

### Step 1: Analyze Recent Commands

Execute the analysis script to check for new commands since last run:

```bash
python scripts/analyze_session.py
```

This returns JSON with interesting commands:
```json
[
  {
    "line_num": 42,
    "command": "pytest tests/ --cov=src"
  }
]
```

### Step 2: Check for Similar Targets

For each command, check if similar targets already exist:

```bash
python scripts/detect_similar.py "pytest tests/ --cov=src" .claude/makefiles
```

Returns similarity analysis:
```json
[
  {
    "name": "test",
    "command": "pytest tests/",
    "when_to_use": "Run all tests",
    "file": "testing.mk",
    "similarity": 0.95
  }
]
```

### Step 3: Ask User for Confirmation

Use `AskUserQuestion` to confirm action based on similarity:

**If similarity ≥ 0.95 (almost identical):**
```
Question: "Target 'test' is very similar to 'pytest tests/ --cov=src'. What should I do?"
Options:
  - Update existing target
  - Create new variant
  - Skip
```

**If similarity 0.7-0.95 (similar):**
```
Question: "Create new target 'test-coverage'? (similar to existing 'test')"
Options:
  - Yes
  - Yes with different name
  - No
```

**If similarity < 0.7 (different):**
```
Question: "Add 'pytest tests/ --cov=src' as a Makefile target?"
Options:
  - Yes
  - Yes with custom name
  - No
```

### Step 4: Categorize Target

Determine the appropriate .mk file:

```bash
python scripts/categorize_target.py "pytest tests/ --cov=src"
```

Returns:
```json
{
  "category": "testing.mk",
  "confidence": "high",
  "alternatives": []
}
```

If confidence is low or user prefers, ask for category confirmation.

### Step 5: Generate Target

Create the target using the template:

```bash
python scripts/generate_target.py \
  "pytest tests/ --cov=src" \
  "test-coverage" \
  "Run tests with HTML coverage report" \
  assets/templates/makefile_target.template
```

Outputs:
```makefile
# test-coverage
# When to use: Run tests with HTML coverage report
test-coverage:
	pytest tests/ --cov=src
```

### Step 6: Append to Category File

Append the generated target to the appropriate .mk file:

```bash
echo "\n$(python scripts/generate_target.py ...)" >> .claude/makefiles/testing.mk
```

Ensure `.PHONY` declaration is updated:
```makefile
.PHONY: test test-unit test-coverage

# ... targets ...
```

### Step 7: Update Help Target

Regenerate the root Makefile help:

```bash
python scripts/generate_help.py .
```

This updates the `help` target with all available targets from all .mk files.

## Script Reference

### scripts/analyze_session.py
Analyzes `cchistory` for new interesting commands.
- **Input**: None (reads from cchistory)
- **Output**: JSON array of {line_num, command}
- **State**: Tracks last processed line in `~/.claude/.makefile-last-line`

### scripts/detect_similar.py
Finds existing targets similar to a command.
- **Input**: `<command> <makefiles_dir> [threshold]`
- **Output**: JSON array of similar targets with similarity scores
- **Algorithm**: Fuzzy matching + base command filtering

### scripts/generate_target.py
Generates a Makefile target from a command.
- **Input**: `<command> [target_name] [when_to_use] [template_path]`
- **Output**: Formatted Makefile target
- **Template**: Uses `assets/templates/makefile_target.template`

### scripts/categorize_target.py
Determines the appropriate .mk file for a command.
- **Input**: `<command> [--simple]`
- **Output**: Category filename (testing.mk, docker.mk, etc.)
- **Method**: Keyword matching with confidence scoring

### scripts/generate_help.py
Updates root Makefile with help target.
- **Input**: `<project_dir> [makefiles_dir]`
- **Output**: Updates Makefile with categorized target list
- **Format**: Grouped by category with descriptions

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Threshold

Adjust similarity detection sensitivity:

```bash
# Strict (fewer matches)
python scripts/detect_similar.py "command" .claude/makefiles 0.85

# Relaxed (more matches)
python scripts/detect_similar.py "command" .claude/makefiles 0.6
```

### Manual Target Creation

Generate a target without automation:

```bash
python scripts/generate_target.py \
  "docker build -t myapp:latest ." \
  "docker-build-latest" \
  "Build latest Docker image for production" \
  > .claude/makefiles/docker.mk
```

### Batch Processing

Process multiple commands at once:

```bash
python scripts/analyze_session.py | jq -r '.[].command' | while read cmd; do
  python scripts/detect_similar.py "$cmd" .claude/makefiles
done
```

## Bulk Initialization Mode

**Use this mode for ONE-TIME setup when building a Makefile from your entire command history.**

### When to Use Bulk Mode

**Use bulk mode when:**
- ✅ First time setting up makefile-assistant
- ✅ Migrating existing project to Makefile workflow
- ✅ You have 100+ historical commands to process
- ✅ Want comprehensive Makefile from all past work
- ✅ New team member wants project's common commands documented

**Don't use bulk mode for:**
- ❌ Ongoing incremental updates (use regular mode)
- ❌ Processing just 2-3 commands (use regular mode)
- ❌ Real-time command capture (automatic in regular mode)

### Bulk Mode vs Regular Mode

| Feature | Regular Mode | Bulk Mode |
|---------|--------------|-----------|
| **Trigger** | After each Bash execution | User-initiated command |
| **Scope** | New commands only (since last) | Full cchistory (all sessions) |
| **Selection** | Command-by-command | Batch multi-select by category |
| **Frequency** | Continuous/automatic | One-time setup |
| **State tracking** | Uses `.makefile-last-line` | Ignores state file |
| **User interaction** | Per command | Per category batch (5-10 at a time) |
| **Volume** | 1-10 commands per session | 50-500+ commands total |
| **Purpose** | Incremental documentation | Comprehensive initialization |

### Bulk Mode Workflow (8 Steps)

#### 1. Fetch Full History
```bash
python scripts/bulk_init.py
```

Reads **ALL** cchistory (not just new commands):
```
Analyzing full cchistory...
Found 347 commands across 50 sessions
```

#### 2. Filter & Group

**Auto-filters:**
- Trivial commands (ls, cd, pwd, echo, clear, cat)
- Commands executed only 1-2 times (configurable threshold)
- Instance-specific IDs (e.g., `docker logs xyz-12345`)

**Groups similar commands:**
```
npm test → executed 15 times
pytest tests/ --cov=src → executed 12 times
docker-compose up -d → executed 25 times
```

**Output:**
```
After filtering: 42 unique commands
Grouped into 8 categories
```

#### 3. Categorize for Presentation

Commands grouped by category for batch selection:
- Testing (5 commands)
- Docker (8 commands)
- Build (6 commands)
- Database (4 commands)
- Linting (3 commands)
- Development (7 commands)
- Deployment (4 commands)
- Misc (5 commands)

#### 4. Interactive Elicitation (Multi-Select)

Uses `AskUserQuestion` with `multiSelect: true` per category:

```
Category: Testing Commands (5 unique)

Select commands to include in Makefile:
☑ npm test (15 times)
☑ pytest tests/ --cov=src (12 times)
☐ pytest tests/unit/ (3 times)
☑ npm run test:e2e (8 times)
☐ jest --watch (2 times)

[User selects 3 out of 5]
```

**Batch size:** 5-10 commands per question
**Progress shown:** "Batch 3/8 categories"

#### 5. Similarity Detection (Per Selected)

For each selected command, run similarity check:

```
Command: npm test
Existing target: 'test' in testing.mk
Similarity: 0.92

Options:
- Create variant 'test-ci'
- Update existing 'test'
- Skip (use existing)
```

If no existing targets (cold start), skip to generation.

#### 6. Bulk Generation

Generate all selected targets:
```
Processing 18 selected commands...
✓ Created 'test' in testing.mk
✓ Created 'test-coverage' in testing.mk
✓ Created 'docker-up' in docker.mk
✓ Created 'docker-down' in docker.mk
...
```

#### 7. Categorize & Organize

Place targets in appropriate .mk files:
```
Created targets across 6 files:
  testing.mk: 3 targets
  docker.mk: 5 targets
  build.mk: 2 targets
  database.mk: 2 targets
  dev.mk: 4 targets
  misc.mk: 2 targets
```

#### 8. Update Help (REQUIRED)

```bash
python scripts/generate_help.py .
```

**Even in bulk mode, Step 8 is REQUIRED.**

Don't skip help update because:
- Makes targets discoverable via `make help`
- Organized by category
- Shows "When to use" descriptions

### Example: Complete Bulk Initialization

```bash
$ python scripts/bulk_init.py

Analyzing full cchistory...
Found 347 commands across 50 sessions
After filtering: 42 unique commands

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Batch 1/8: Testing Commands (5 unique)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Select commands to include:
☑ npm test (15 times)
☑ pytest tests/ --cov=src (12 times)
☐ pytest tests/unit/ (3 times)
☑ npm run test:e2e (8 times)
☐ jest --watch (2 times)

→ Selected 3/5 testing commands

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Batch 2/8: Docker Commands (8 unique)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Select commands to include:
☑ docker-compose up -d (25 times)
☑ docker-compose down (18 times)
☑ docker ps (12 times)
☐ docker logs api-server (6 times) ⚠️ instance-specific
...

[... continues through 8 categories ...]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Processing 18 selected commands
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Checking similarity...
✓ 'npm test' → new target 'test'
✓ 'pytest --cov' → new target 'test-coverage'
⚠ 'docker-compose up -d' similar to existing 'docker-up' (0.95)
  → Creating variant 'docker-up-detached'

Generating targets...
✓ testing.mk: 3 targets created
✓ docker.mk: 5 targets created
✓ build.mk: 2 targets created
✓ database.mk: 2 targets created
✓ dev.mk: 4 targets created
✓ misc.mk: 2 targets created

Updating help...
✓ Root Makefile updated

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Summary
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Created 18 targets across 6 files
.claude/makefiles/ ready for use

Run 'make help' to see all available targets
```

### CRITICAL: Bulk Mode Red Flags

**If you catch yourself thinking these, STOP and follow the workflow:**

- 🚩 "Too many commands (100+), bulk mode won't work" → Batching makes it manageable
- 🚩 "User is tired of questions, auto-include rest" → Complete all batches
- 🚩 "High frequency = must be important" → Check if debug/temp file
- 🚩 "Instance-specific should auto-filter" → Let user decide via selection
- 🚩 "Category doesn't matter, skip ambiguous" → Use primary category, continue
- 🚩 "No existing targets, skip similarity" → Still run workflow, returns empty
- 🚩 "66% done is good enough" → Complete all selected commands
- 🚩 "Duplicates found, abandon bulk mode" → User decides update/variant/skip
- 🚩 "No undo, just proceed" → Offer restart or selective removal
- 🚩 "Help update optional in bulk" → Step 8 REQUIRED in ALL modes

### Bulk Mode Rationalization Table

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Too many commands to process" | Batching by category makes 100+ manageable. User selects 5-10 at a time. |
| "User tired of questions" | 8 category batches = 3-5 minutes total. Faster than manual Makefile creation. |
| "Auto-filter instance-specific" | User might want pattern documented. Show with ⚠️ warning, let them decide. |
| "Category ambiguity = skip it" | Use primary category from categorize_target.py. Don't skip valuable commands. |
| "Empty project = skip similarity" | Run workflow anyway. Quick when no targets exist. Maintains consistency. |
| "Partial completion sufficient" | Completing all selected = original agreement. 4 more minutes for 100% coverage. |
| "Duplicates = wrong mode" | Bulk mode updates/variants valid. User chooses per command via AskUserQuestion. |
| "Help update optional in bulk" | Step 8 REQUIRED. Discoverability is the whole point. No exceptions. |

### Bulk Mode Foundational Principles

1. **Volume is not an excuse** - Batching and multi-select handle 100s of commands
2. **User fatigue is expected** - Process is designed for it (8 batches, not 100 questions)
3. **Smart filtering helps, doesn't replace user choice** - Warn about instances/debug files, but show them
4. **Workflow consistency** - All 8 steps apply in bulk mode, no shortcuts
5. **Instance-specific vs generic** - Mark with ⚠️, let user decide
6. **Frequency ≠ value** - 50x execution of debug file ≠ important target
7. **Help update is REQUIRED** - No exceptions, even in bulk mode

### When Bulk Mode Completes

After bulk initialization:

```bash
# Verify targets work
make help

# Test a few targets
make test
make docker-up
make build

# Commit to version control
git add .claude/makefiles/ Makefile
git commit -m "feat: initialize Makefile from cchistory bulk mode"

# Switch to regular incremental mode
# Future commands will be processed automatically
```

**After bulk init, regular mode takes over** for incremental updates.

## Target Format

All generated targets follow this format:

```makefile
# <target-name>
# When to use: <clear description of when to run this target>
<target-name>:
	<command>
```

Example:

```makefile
# test-coverage
# When to use: Run tests with HTML coverage report for local development
test-coverage:
	pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=html
```

## Category Mappings

Commands are automatically categorized based on keywords:

| Category | Keywords | Example Commands |
|----------|----------|------------------|
| testing.mk | pytest, test, jest, coverage | `pytest tests/` |
| linting.mk | pylint, eslint, black, format | `black .` |
| docker.mk | docker, docker-compose, container | `docker build` |
| build.mk | build, compile, webpack | `npm run build` |
| database.mk | psql, migrate, alembic | `alembic upgrade head` |
| deploy.mk | deploy, release, kubectl | `kubectl apply` |
| dev.mk | serve, dev, watch | `npm run dev` |
| clean.mk | clean, rm -rf, purge | `rm -rf dist/` |
| misc.mk | (uncategorized) | Any unmatched command |

## Common Patterns

### Testing Targets

```makefile
.PHONY: test test-unit test-integration test-coverage

# test
# When to use: Run all tests quickly without coverage
test:
	pytest tests/

# test-unit
# When to use: Run only unit tests for fast feedback
test-unit:
	pytest tests/unit/ -v

# test-integration
# When to use: Run integration tests against local services
test-integration:
	pytest tests/integration/ -v

# test-coverage
# When to use: Generate HTML coverage report for detailed analysis
test-coverage:
	pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=html
```

### Docker Targets

```makefile
.PHONY: docker-build docker-run docker-stop

# docker-build
# When to use: Build Docker image for local development
docker-build:
	docker build -t myapp:dev -f Dockerfile.dev .

# docker-run
# When to use: Run application in Docker container on port 8000
docker-run:
	docker run -p 8000:8000 myapp:dev

# docker-stop
# When to use: Stop all running containers for this project
docker-stop:
	docker-compose down
```

## Error Handling

### When Scripts Fail

**DO:**
- ✅ Report error to user with full context
- ✅ Attempt quick fix if obvious (e.g., create missing state file)
- ✅ Install missing dependencies with user awareness
- ✅ Continue with workflow after fixing

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Skip the workflow entirely due to script error
- ❌ Use workarounds that bypass automation
- ❌ Defer to "fix later" - fix NOW then proceed
- ❌ Process commands manually without similarity detection

### State File Missing (`~/.claude/.makefile-last-line`)

**Quick fix (takes 5 seconds):**
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude
echo "0" > ~/.claude/.makefile-last-line
python scripts/analyze_session.py  # Retry
```

**Don't:** Bypass analyze_session.py. Fix the issue and proceed with workflow.

### cchistory Not Installed

**Required dependency. Install it:**
```bash
npm install -g cchistory
```

**Don't:** Use bash history as workaround. cchistory provides Claude Code-specific context.

### Script Syntax Error

**Report to user:**
```
Error in analyze_session.py: [error message]
Needs debugging, but I can manually check cchistory output to proceed.
User: Should I debug the script or proceed manually this time?
```

**Then:** Fix the script issue for future use. Don't leave broken infrastructure.

## Troubleshooting

### Similarity detection too strict/loose

Adjust threshold in detect_similar.py call (default: 0.7).

### Category mismatch

Override automatic categorization by manually specifying the .mk file when appending targets.

## Best Practices

1. **Review generated targets** before committing
2. **Customize "When to use" descriptions** for clarity
3. **Keep misc.mk small** - recategorize targets periodically
4. **Use .PHONY** for all generated targets
5. **Run generate_help.py** after adding targets
6. **Commit .claude/makefiles/** to version control
7. **Add Makefile to .gitignore if auto-generated**
8. **Periodically review and consolidate** similar targets

## Integration with Claude Code

This skill automatically activates when Claude Code executes Bash commands. The typical flow:

1. User asks Claude to run tests: "Run pytest with coverage"
2. Claude executes: `Bash(command="pytest tests/ --cov=src")`
3. Skill detects Bash execution, activates
4. Skill analyzes command, checks for similars
5. Skill uses `AskUserQuestion`: "Add this as 'test-coverage' target?"
6. User confirms
7. Skill generates and appends target to testing.mk
8. Skill updates help target (REQUIRED - must complete Step 8)

This creates a self-documenting Makefile that grows naturally as you work.

## Red Flags - STOP Immediately

**If you catch yourself thinking any of these, you are rationalizing. Stop and run the workflow:**

- 🚩 "This is a one-time command"
- 🚩 "Emergency fix, not worth documenting"
- 🚩 "Too trivial to process"
- 🚩 "User didn't specifically ask for it"
- 🚩 "I'll document this later"
- 🚩 "Already works, help update can wait"
- 🚩 "User wants to move on to feature work"
- 🚩 "Too many commands to process at once"
- 🚩 "Takes longer than running the command"
- 🚩 "Close enough to existing target"
- 🚩 "I'm too exhausted to run the workflow"
- 🚩 "Being pragmatic means skipping this"
- 🚩 "Manual workaround is faster"
- 🚩 "Following the spirit not the letter"

**Reality check:** All of these are excuses. The workflow takes <2 minutes and provides permanent team value.

## Rationalization Table

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "One-time emergency fix" | Emergencies repeat. Next responder needs this command. Document now. |
| "Too trivial" | Read the explicit trivial definition above. `docker info` ≠ `ls`. |
| "User didn't ask" | Skill activates on Bash execution. User executed the command = document it. |
| "I'll do it later" | Later never happens. Commands are fresh NOW. Process NOW. |
| "Already works without help" | Help makes targets DISCOVERABLE. Step 8 is required, not optional. |
| "User wants feature work" | 90 seconds now saves hours later. User will thank you. |
| "Too many commands" | Batch of 8 setup commands = perfect `make setup` target. Process all. |
| "Takes too long" | False. Workflow is automated. You just confirm via AskUserQuestion. |
| "Close enough" | Use similarity thresholds: <0.7=new, 0.7-0.95=ask user, ≥0.95=update/skip. |
| "I'm exhausted" | Irrelevant. Workflow takes 60 seconds. Your mental state doesn't matter. |
| "Pragmatic vs dogmatic" | Pragmatic = building team infrastructure. Skipping = technical debt. |
| "Manual is faster" | For one command maybe. For the 10th time? 100th? Documentation wins. |
| "Following spirit" | Violating the letter IS violating the spirit. Follow both. |

## Foundational Principle

**Violating the letter of this skill IS violating the spirit.**

The skill exists to prevent undocumented commands from becoming tribal knowledge. Every exception you make creates a knowledge gap. Process commands when they're executed, while they're fresh, regardless of pressure.

**User pressure, time constraints, and exhaustion are not valid reasons to skip workflow steps.**

## Process Now, Not Later

**Why timing matters:**

1. **Commands are fresh** - you remember context, why flags matter, when to use it
2. **User is present** - can answer AskUserQuestion about target names
3. **Integration is seamless** - command just worked, add to Makefile while in flow
4. **Later never happens** - "I'll document this later" = never documented

**Batch processing is expected:**
- Setup session with 8 commands? Process all 8.
- Debugging session with 5 attempts? Document the working sequence.
- User says "let's move on"? Take 90 seconds to document first.

**"Later" is a lie you tell yourself.**
