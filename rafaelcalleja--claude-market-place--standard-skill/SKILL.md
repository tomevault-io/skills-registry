# Code Analyzer

Analyze code structure and patterns without making modifications.

## Capabilities

- Analyze code organization and architecture
- Find patterns and anti-patterns
- Check naming conventions
- Identify potential issues
- Review documentation quality

## Workflow

### Step 1: Discover Files

Use Glob to find relevant source files:

```bash
# Find all TypeScript files
*.ts, **/*.ts

# Find all Python files
*.py, **/*.py
```

### Step 2: Analyze Structure

Use Read to examine file contents and understand:
- Module organization
- Class hierarchies
- Function signatures
- Import patterns

### Step 3: Search Patterns

Use Grep to find specific patterns:
- Error handling patterns
- Logging practices
- API usage
- Configuration access

### Step 4: Report Findings

Provide analysis covering:
- Code organization
- Naming conventions
- Potential issues
- Improvement suggestions
