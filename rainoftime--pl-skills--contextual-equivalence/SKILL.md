# Contextual Equivalence

**Domain**: Program Verification / Programming Languages

## Overview

A skill for proving contextual equivalence between programs using operational semantics, bisimulation, and related techniques.

## Capabilities

- Prove that two programs are contextually equivalent
- Build bisimulation relations for behavioral equivalence
- Use operational semantics to reason about program behavior
- Apply contextual equivalence in compiler verification

## Techniques

- **Operational Semantics**: Small-step and big-step semantics
- **Bisimulation**: Trace equivalence, bisimilarity proofs
- **Contextual Equivalence**: Observation-based equivalence
- **Game Semantics**: Interactive models of computation

## Use Cases

- Compiler correctness proofs
- Program transformation verification
- Optimization validation
- Language meta-theory development

## Implementation Pitfalls

Common equivalence proof bugs:

| Pitfall | Real Example | Prevention |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| **Incomplete contexts** | Missing context forms | Prove completeness |
| **Bisimulation too strong** | Fails for equivalent programs | Use weak bisimulation |
| **Recursive types** | Fixed-point handling | Use step-indexing |
| **Non-termination** | Divergence not handled | Use contextual equivalence |
| **State** | State in language | Relational reasoning |
