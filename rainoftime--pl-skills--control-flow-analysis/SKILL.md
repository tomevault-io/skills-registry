# Control Flow Analysis

**Domain**: Static Analysis / Programming Languages

## Overview

A skill for performing control flow analysis on programs to understand execution paths, loop structures, and program structure.

## Capabilities

- Build control flow graphs (CFGs) from source code
- Identify basic blocks and control flow transitions
- Detect loops, branches, and jumps
- Perform reachability analysis
- Find dominators and post-dominators

## Techniques

- **Control Flow Graph Construction**: Nodes for statements, edges for jumps
- **Dominator Analysis**: Find control dependencies
- **Loop Detection**: Natural loops, back edges
- **Data Flow Analysis**: Forward/backward analysis frameworks

## Use Cases

- Compiler optimization
- Program understanding
- Bug detection (unreachable code, infinite loops)
- Security analysis

## References

## Research Tools & Artifacts

Real-world control flow analysis tools:

| Tool | Why It Matters |
|------|----------------|
| **LLVM pass infrastructure** | Production CFG construction |
| **Soot** | Java bytecode CFG analysis |
| **WALA** | Java analysis framework |
| **Frama-C** | C CFG construction |
| **GCC GIMPLE** | GCC intermediate CFG |

### Key Systems

- **LLVM**: Dominator tree, loop analysis
- **Spark (Apache)**: Program analysis infrastructure

## Research Frontiers

Current CFA research:

| Direction | Key Papers | Challenge |
|-----------|------------|-----------|
| **Interprocedural** | "Interprocedural CFA" (1990) | Call site sensitivity |
| **Context-sensitive** | "k-CFA" (1998) | Precision vs cost |
| **Object-oriented** | "Object-sensitive CFA" (2009) | Virtual dispatch |
| **Binary analysis** | "Control Flow in Binaries" (2015) | No source |

### Hot Topics

1. **AI for CFA**: Learning flow analysis
2. **Quantum CFG**: Control flow for quantum programs

## Implementation Pitfalls

Common CFA bugs:

| Pitfall | Real Example | Prevention |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| **Missing edges** | Indirect jumps | Handle computed gotos |
| **Exception paths** | Java exception edges | Model exceptional flow |
| **Callbacks** | Function pointers | Points-to analysis |
| **Virtual dispatch** | VTable calls | Devirtualization |
