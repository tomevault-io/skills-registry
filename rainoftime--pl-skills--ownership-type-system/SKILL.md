# Ownership Type System

Implements ownership types with borrowing and lifetimes.

## When to Use

- Verifying memory safety
- Preventing data races
- Lifetime analysis
- Resource management

## What This Skill Does

1. **Implements ownership** - Each value has single owner
2. **Handles borrowing** - Mutable and immutable references
3. **Verifies lifetimes** - Lexical lifetimes
4. **Checks borrowing rules** - Aliasing XOR mutability

## Core Rules

```
Ownership Rules:
  - Each value has exactly one owner
  - When owner goes out of scope, value is dropped
  - Ownership can be transferred (move)
  - Ownership can be borrowed (reference)

Borrowing Rules:
  - Either OR many immutable references
  - OR exactly one mutable reference
  - References must not outlive borrowed data
```

## Implementation

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass, field
from typing import Dict, List, Set, Optional
from enum import Enum

class Ownership(Enum):
    OWNED = "owned"
    BORROWED_MUT = "borrowed_mut"
    BORROWED_IMMUT = "borrowed_immut"

@dataclass
class Type:
    """Ownership type"""
    base: str
    ownership: Ownership
    lifetime: Optional['Lifetime'] = None

@dataclass
class Lifetime:
    """Lifetime region"""
    name: str
    upper_bound: Optional['Lifetime'] = None

@dataclass
class Variable:
    """Variable with ownership info"""
    name: str
    typ: Type
    is_mutable: bool

@dataclass

    """Borrow expression"""

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Ownership** | Single owner per value |
| **Borrow** | Temporary reference |
| **Move** | Transfer ownership |
| **Lifetime** | Region of validity |
| **Borrow checking** | Aliasing XOR mutability |

## Rust Borrowing Rules

```
Rules:
1. &T: Multiple immutable references OK
2. &mut T: Only one mutable reference
3. No references to references (directly)
4. &mut only from owned or &mut
5. Lifetime: borrow must not outlive lender
```

## Tips

- Track active borrows
- Handle drops correctly
- Check lifetime relationships
- Consider interior mutability

## Tradeoffs and Limitations

### Ownership Approach Tradeoffs

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| **Rust-style** | Safe, no GC | Complexity |
| **Regions** | Fast | Complex regions |
| **Unique pointers** | Simple | Limited |
| **Capabilities** | Flexible | Hard to use |

### When NOT to Use Ownership Types

- **For simple programs**: GC is simpler
- **For rapid prototyping**: Ownership adds overhead
- **For shared state**: Use Arc/Rc instead

### Complexity Considerations

- **Borrow checking**: O(n) per borrow
- **Lifetimes**: Can require annotations
- **Error messages**: Complex to explain

### Limitations

- **Learning curve**: Complex rules to learn
- **Error messages**: Can be cryptic
- **Interior mutability**: Requires special handling (Cell, RefCell)
- **Lifetimes**: Must be explicit or inferred
- **Async**: Lifetimes with async complex
- **Interoperability**: FFI complexity
- **Shared ownership**: Not zero-cost

## Research Tools & Artifacts

Ownership systems:

| System | What to Learn |

| **Rust** | Ownership/borrowing |
| **PyOxygen** | Ownership in Python |
