# Property-Based Tester

Implements property-based testing frameworks that generate random test inputs and verify properties hold, finding edge cases that manual testing misses.

## When to Use This Skill

- Testing algebraic laws (monoid, functor, monad)
- Verifying compiler transformations preserve semantics
- Finding bugs in data structures
- Fuzzing APIs with type-aware generation

## What This Skill Does

1. **Generators**: Builds random generators for types via combinators
2. **Property Definition**: Defines properties as functions returning Boolean
3. **Shrinking**: Implements minimal counterexample finding
4. **Statistics**: Reports distribution of test inputs

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Generator | Produces random values of a type |
| Shrinker | Reduces failing inputs to minimal examples |
| Property | Invariant that should hold for all inputs |
| Coverage | Distribution of generated inputs |

## Tips

- Write properties that should always hold, not just examples
- Use shrinking to get minimal failing cases
- Cover edge cases: empty, single element, large inputs
- Combine with type-based generation for better coverage

## Canonical References

| Reference | Why It Matters |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Claessen & Hughes, "QuickCheck: Lightweight Automatic Testing" (ICFP 2000)** | Original Haskell property-based testing library |
| **MacIver, "Hypothesis: Property-Based Testing in Python" (2015+)** | Python ecosystem standard with sophisticated coverage guidance |
| **Claessen & Hughes, "Testing the Hard Stuff and Staying Sane" (ICFP 2002)** | Advanced random testing techniques for critical software |

## Tradeoffs and Limitations

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| Random generation | Finds edge cases | May miss specific bugs |
| Enumeration | Complete coverage | State space explosion |
| Symbolic execution | Targeted testing | Slower, complex |

## Assessment Criteria

| Criterion | What to Look For |
|-----------|------------------|
| Generator coverage | All interesting cases covered |
| Shrinking effectiveness | Minimal failing examples |
| Property correctness | Properties capture true invariants |

### Quality Indicators

✅ **Good**: Good coverage, effective shrinking, correct properties
⚠️ **Warning**: Limited coverage, slow shrinking
❌ **Bad**: Wrong properties, no shrinking
