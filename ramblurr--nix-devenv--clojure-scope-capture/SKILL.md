# scope-capture

Capture local scope at runtime and recreate it in the REPL for debugging.

## Quick Start

```clojure
(require 'sc.api)

;; 1. Add spy to capture scope
(defn my-fn [x y]
  (let [result (+ x y)]
    (sc.api/spy result)))  ; Captures x, y, result

;; 2. Call the function - spy logs EP id
(my-fn 3 4)
; SPY [1 -1] ... saved scope with locals [x y result]
; => 7

;; 3. Recreate scope with defsc (defs all locals as vars)
(sc.api/defsc 1)
; => [#'user/x #'user/y #'user/result]

;; 4. Now evaluate expressions using captured values
x        ; => 3
y        ; => 4
result   ; => 7
(* x y)  ; => 12

;; 5. Clean up when done
(sc.api/dispose! 1)
```

## Core Concepts

**Code Site (CS)** - A location in code where `spy` or `brk` is placed. Has a negative ID like `-1`, `-2`.

**Execution Point (EP)** - A specific execution of a Code Site. Has a positive ID like `1`, `2`, `3`.

**Log format:** `SPY [EP CS]` e.g., `SPY [7 -3]` means Execution Point 7 at Code Site -3.

## Recording Scope

### spy - Capture and continue

```clojure
;; Wrap an expression - captures scope AND the expression value
(sc.api/spy (some-expression))

;; Without expression - just capture scope at this point
(sc.api/spy)

;; With options
(sc.api/spy {:sc/dynamic-vars [*out* *my-var*]}
  (some-expression))
```

### brk - Capture and block (breakpoint)

```clojure
(defn process [data]
  (let [transformed (transform data)]
    (sc.api/brk transformed)))  ; Blocks here until released

;; In another thread, call the function
(future (process my-data))
; BRK [2 -1] ... saved scope, use sc.api/loose to resume

;; Release the breakpoint
(sc.api/loose 2)              ; Continue normally
(sc.api/loose-with 2 value)   ; Continue with replacement value
(sc.api/loose-with-err 2 ex)  ; Continue by throwing exception
```

## Recreating Scope

### defsc - Define vars (preferred for editor eval)

```clojure
(sc.api/defsc 1)
; Defines vars for all captured locals in current namespace
; Now you can evaluate sub-expressions directly in your editor

x        ; works
(+ x y)  ; works
```

### letsc - Let bindings

```clojure
(sc.api/letsc 1
  (+ x y))  ; x and y bound from captured scope
; => 7

;; Useful for one-off evaluations without polluting namespace
```

### ep-repl - Sub-REPL (JVM only)

```clojure
(sc.repl/ep-repl 1)
; SC[1 -1]=> x
; => 3
; SC[1 -1]=> :repl/quit
```

## Common Patterns

### Spy without wrapping expression

```clojure
(let [x (foo)
      y (bar x)]
  (sc.api/spy)  ; Just capture x and y here
  (something x y))
```

### Spy only on errors

```clojure
(try
  (my-fallible-code)
  (catch Throwable err
    (sc.api/spy err)  ; Capture scope when error occurs
    (throw err)))
```

### Disable in loops

```clojure
;; If spy/brk is in a loop, disable after first capture
(sc.api/disable! -1)  ; Use the Code Site ID (negative)
```

### Combine multiple scopes

```clojure
;; Capture from different places, then combine
(sc.api/defsc 1)  ; Defines a, b from first spy
(sc.api/defsc 2)  ; Defines x, y from second spy
;; Now all four vars available
```

### Restore last execution point

```clojure
(eval `(sc.api/defsc ~(sc.api/last-ep-id)))
```

## Utility Functions

```clojure
;; Get info about execution point
(sc.api/ep-info 1)
; => {:sc.ep/id 1
;     :sc.ep/local-bindings {x 3, y 4, ...}
;     :sc.ep/value 7
;     :sc.ep/code-site {...}}

;; Get info about code site
(sc.api/cs-info -1)

;; Get last execution point ID
(sc.api/last-ep-id)

;; Quiet versions (only log types, not values)
(sc.api/spyqt expr)
(sc.api/brkqt expr)

;; Clean up vars created by defsc
(sc.api/undefsc 1)

;; Free memory from execution point
(sc.api/dispose! 1)
```

## Caveats

**Memory leak warning:** Remove `spy`/`brk` before production - they accumulate captured data.

**Dynamic vars:** Must be explicitly declared:
```clojure
(sc.api/spy {:sc/dynamic-vars [*out* *my-var*]} expr)
```

**defsc overwrites vars:** If a var with same name exists (especially `defonce`), `defsc` will fail or overwrite it.

**ClojureScript:** Must use `[ep-id cs-id]` vector syntax:
```clojure
;; ClojureScript requires both IDs
(sc.api/defsc [1 -1])
(sc.api/letsc [1 -1] expr)
```

## Workflow Summary

1. **Add spy** where you want to capture: `(sc.api/spy expr)` or just `(sc.api/spy)`
2. **Execute** the code path (call the function, run the test, etc.)
3. **Note the EP ID** from the log: `SPY [1 -1]`
4. **Recreate scope:** `(sc.api/defsc 1)`
5. **Debug** by evaluating sub-expressions in your editor
6. **Clean up:** `(sc.api/dispose! 1)` and remove the spy call

## Quick Reference

| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `(spy expr)` | Capture scope + evaluate expr |
| `(spy)` | Capture scope only |
| `(brk expr)` | Capture scope + block execution |
| `(defsc ep)` | Def vars from captured scope |
| `(letsc ep body)` | Let-bind captured scope |
| `(loose ep)` | Resume blocked brk |
| `(loose-with ep val)` | Resume with replacement value |
| `(dispose! ep)` | Free captured data |
| `(disable! cs)` | Disable a code site |
| `(ep-info ep)` | Get execution point info |
| `(last-ep-id)` | Get most recent EP id |
