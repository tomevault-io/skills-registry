# Planning Documents

All workflow documents live in `prompts/` with a structured naming scheme.

## Primary Documents (PRDs)

Pattern: `prompts/NNN-concept.md`

| Component | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `NNN` | Three-digit sequence number | 025 |
| `concept` | Kebab-case description | compositor, event-parsing |

No underscores in the primary document name.

Examples:
- `prompts/025-compositor.md`
- `prompts/010-event-parsing.md`

## Supporting Documents

| Pattern | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `NNN-concept_report.md` | Research findings | `025-compositor_report.md` |
| `NNN-concept_library_report.md` | Library-specific research | `025-compositor_textual_report.md` |
| `NNN-concept_idea.md` | Some idea/brainstorm capture | `011-cli-api_idea2.md` |

## Determining Next Sequence Number

Check existing documents:

```bash
ls prompts/*.md | sort -t- -k1 -n | tail -5
```

Use the next available three-digit number.
