# AWS Well-Architected Framework

Expert guidance for designing, reviewing, and improving AWS architectures using the six pillars of the Well-Architected Framework.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:

- Reviewing existing AWS architecture for best practices
- Designing new cloud systems or applications
- Troubleshooting operational issues, security vulnerabilities, or reliability problems
- Optimizing costs or improving performance
- Preparing for architecture reviews or audits
- Migrating workloads to AWS
- Addressing compliance or sustainability requirements
- User asks "is my architecture good?" or "how can I improve my AWS setup?"

## Core Principle

**Systematic architecture evaluation across 6 pillars ensures balanced, well-designed systems that meet business objectives.**

The AWS Well-Architected Framework provides a consistent approach for evaluating cloud architectures and implementing scalable designs.

## The Six Pillars

| Pillar | Focus | Key Question |
|--------|-------|--------------|
| **Operational Excellence** | Run and monitor systems | How do we operate effectively? |
| **Security** | Protect information and systems | How do we protect data and resources? |
| **Reliability** | Recover from failures | How do we ensure workload availability? |
| **Performance Efficiency** | Use resources effectively | How do we meet performance requirements? |
| **Cost Optimization** | Avoid unnecessary costs | How do we achieve cost-effective outcomes? |
| **Sustainability** | Minimize environmental impact | How do we reduce carbon footprint? |

## Architecture Review Workflow

**CRITICAL: You MUST review ALL 6 pillars systematically. Never skip a pillar because it "seems not applicable" - every workload has considerations across all pillars.**

```dot
digraph review_flow {
    "Architecture review needed" [shape=doublecircle];
    "Identify workload scope" [shape=box];
    "Review each pillar systematically" [shape=box];
    "Document findings per pillar" [shape=box];
    "Prioritize improvements" [shape=box];
    "Create action plan" [shape=box];
    "All pillars reviewed?" [shape=diamond];
    "Complete" [shape=doublecircle];

    "Architecture review needed" -> "Identify workload scope";
    "Identify workload scope" -> "Review each pillar systematically";
    "Review each pillar systematically" -> "Document findings per pillar";
    "Document findings per pillar" -> "All pillars reviewed?";
    "All pillars reviewed?" -> "Review each pillar systematically" [label="no"];
    "All pillars reviewed?" -> "Prioritize improvements" [label="yes"];
    "Prioritize improvements" -> "Create action plan";
    "Create action plan" -> "Complete";
}
```

**Red Flags - You're Skipping the Framework:**
- "This pillar doesn't apply to this workload" - WRONG, every pillar applies
- Jumping straight to recommendations without documenting current state
- Only reviewing 3-4 pillars instead of all 6
- Providing generic advice instead of workload-specific assessment

## Pillar 1: Operational Excellence

**Goal:** Support development and run workloads effectively, gain insight into operations, and continuously improve processes.

### Design Principles

- Perform operations as code (IaC)
- Make frequent, small, reversible changes
- Refine operations procedures frequently
- Anticipate failure
- Learn from operational events and failures

### Key Areas

**Organization:**
- How do teams share architecture knowledge?
- Are there clear ownership and accountability models?

**Prepare:**
- How do you design workloads for observability?
- Infrastructure as code implementation?
- Deployment practices (CI/CD)?

**Operate:**
- What's the runbook for common operations?
- How do you understand workload health?
- How do you respond to events?

**Evolve:**
- How do you learn from operational events?
- Process for continuous improvement?

### Common Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Manual deployments | Implement CI/CD with CloudFormation/CDK/Terraform |
| No visibility into system health | Add CloudWatch dashboards, metrics, alarms |
| Operational procedures outdated | Regular runbook reviews, post-incident learning |
| Slow incident response | Create automated remediation with Lambda/Systems Manager |

### Quick Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Infrastructure defined as code (CloudFormation/CDK/Terraform)
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline implemented
- [ ] CloudWatch dashboards for key metrics
- [ ] Alarms for critical thresholds
- [ ] Runbooks documented and accessible

- Enable traceability
- Apply security at all layers
- Automate security best practices
- Protect data in transit and at rest
- Keep people away from data
- Prepare for security events

### Key Areas

**Security Foundations:**

### Critical Security Patterns

**Never Do:**
```typescript
// ❌ DANGEROUS: Hardcoded credentials
const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
const s3 = new AWS.S3({
  accessKeyId: 'AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE',
  secretAccessKey: 'wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY'
});
```

**Always Do:**
```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT: Use IAM roles
const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
const s3 = new AWS.S3(); // Credentials from IAM role

// Lambda function with IAM role
const lambda = new lambda.Function(this, 'MyFunction', {
  // IAM role with least privilege
  role: myRole,
  // ...
});
```

### Security Checklist

## Review Process

### 1. Scoping Phase

**Questions to ask:**
- What is the workload scope? (entire system vs specific component)
- What are the business objectives?
- What are the compliance requirements?
- What are the current pain points?

### 2. Review Each Pillar

For each pillar, use this template:

**Current State:**
- Document what exists today

**Gaps:**
- What's missing or needs improvement?

**Risks:**
- What are the high/medium/low priority risks?

**Recommendations:**
- Specific, actionable improvements

### 3. Prioritization Matrix

| Priority | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **High** | Security vulnerabilities, critical availability risks, major cost waste |
| **Medium** | Performance issues, moderate cost optimization, operational improvements |
| **Low** | Nice-to-haves, future considerations, minor optimizations |

### 4. Action Plan Template

```markdown
## Pillar: [Name]

### Issue: [Description]
- **Risk Level:** High/Medium/Low
- **Impact:** [Business impact]
- **Effort:** Low/Medium/High

### Recommendation:
[Specific actions]

### Implementation Steps:
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3]

### Success Criteria:
- [Measurable outcome 1]
- [Measurable outcome 2]

### Resources:
- [AWS documentation links]
- [Blog posts or examples]
```

## Common Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Issue | Better Approach |
|--------------|-------|-----------------|
| **Single AZ deployment** | No fault tolerance | Multi-AZ architecture |
| **No IaC** | Manual config, drift | CloudFormation/CDK/Terraform |
| **Hardcoded secrets** | Security vulnerability | Secrets Manager/Parameter Store |
| **No monitoring** | Blind operation | CloudWatch dashboards + alarms |
| **No backups** | Data loss risk | Automated backup strategy |
| **Over-provisioning** | Cost waste | Right-sizing + Auto Scaling |
| **No cost tracking** | Budget overruns | Tags + Budgets + Cost Explorer |
| **Monolithic architecture** | Hard to scale | Microservices or serverless |

## Real-World Example

**Scenario:** Serverless API with authentication

**Architecture Review:**

**Operational Excellence:**
- ✅ Lambda functions deployed via CDK
- ✅ CloudWatch logs enabled
- ❌ Missing: Distributed tracing (X-Ray), dashboards

**Security:**
- ❌ CRITICAL: Hardcoded API keys in Lambda environment variables
- ✅ API Gateway with IAM authorization
- ❌ Missing: Secrets Manager, encryption at rest

**Reliability:**
- ✅ Multi-AZ DynamoDB table
- ❌ Single region deployment
- ❌ Missing: Backup strategy, DR plan

**Performance:**
- ✅ CloudFront for static assets
- ❌ No caching for API responses
- ❌ Lambda cold starts not optimized

**Cost:**
- ❌ DynamoDB provisioned capacity, but traffic is spiky
- ✅ Lambda usage-based pricing
- ❌ Missing: Budget alerts, cost allocation tags

**Sustainability:**
- ✅ Serverless architecture (good utilization)
- ❌ Unused dev/test resources running 24/7

**Priority Actions:**
1. **HIGH**: Move API keys to Secrets Manager (Security)
2. **HIGH**: Implement DynamoDB backups (Reliability)
3. **MEDIUM**: Add X-Ray tracing (Operational Excellence)
4. **MEDIUM**: Switch DynamoDB to on-demand (Cost)

## Common Mistakes When Using This Framework

| Mistake | Why It's Wrong | Correct Approach |
|---------|---------------|------------------|
| "Sustainability doesn't apply to this workload" | Every workload consumes resources and energy | Review all 6 pillars, even if findings are minimal |
| Skipping current state documentation | Can't measure improvement without baseline | Always document "Current State" before recommendations |
| Generic recommendations | Not actionable or specific to this workload | Provide specific AWS services, code examples, priorities |
| No prioritization | Everything seems equally important | Use HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW risk levels, create phased plan |
| Forgetting about trade-offs | Optimizing one pillar at expense of others | Explicitly call out trade-offs (e.g., multi-region cost vs reliability) |

## Using This Skill

When conducting architecture reviews:

1. **Start with context** - understand business objectives and constraints
2. **Review systematically** - go through all 6 pillars, don't skip ANY
3. **Document findings** - use consistent format per pillar (Current State → Gaps → Recommendations)
4. **Prioritize ruthlessly** - security and availability issues first
5. **Be specific** - actionable recommendations with examples and AWS service names
6. **Provide resources** - link to AWS docs and examples
7. **Create action plan** - clear next steps with success criteria and effort estimates
8. **Call out trade-offs** - be explicit about costs and benefits of each recommendation

**Remember:** Architecture is about trade-offs. A perfect architecture doesn't exist - aim for a well-balanced one that meets business needs.

**No exceptions to reviewing all 6 pillars** - even if a pillar seems "not applicable", document why and what the current state is.
