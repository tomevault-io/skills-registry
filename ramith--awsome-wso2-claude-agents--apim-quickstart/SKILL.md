Deploy WSO2 API Manager 4.6.0 and print the portal URLs. Ask the user which deployment mode they want if not specified.

## Deployment Modes

Ask: **"How do you want to deploy APIM?"**

| Mode | When to use |
|------|-------------|
| **local-zip** | User has downloaded the APIM zip, wants to run on bare metal |
| **local-docker** | Quick single-container setup on localhost |
| **docker-compose** | Part of a multi-service stack, or standalone compose |
| **remote-vm** | Deploy to a remote machine via SSH |

---

## Mode A: Local Zip

### Prerequisites
1. Detect and export `JAVA_HOME` for JDK 21. **`java -version` is unreliable on macOS** — it shows whichever JDK is first on `PATH`, which may not be 21 even if 21 is installed. Branch on OS:

   ```bash
   if [ "$(uname)" = "Darwin" ]; then
     # macOS: use the canonical Apple-supplied probe
     JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 21 2>/dev/null) || { echo "JDK 21 not installed"; exit 1; }
   else
     # Linux: derive from java on PATH (must already be JDK 21)
     java -version 2>&1 | grep -q 'version "21' || { echo "JDK 21 not on PATH"; exit 1; }
     JAVA_HOME=$(dirname $(dirname $(readlink -f $(which java))))
   fi
   export JAVA_HOME
   ```

   If JDK 21 is missing, stop and tell the user to install it.

2. Check `unzip` is available:
   ```bash
   which unzip
   ```
   If missing, tell the user to install it (`sudo apt install -y unzip` on Debian/Ubuntu). On macOS, `unzip` is preinstalled and this check should always pass.

3. Check ports 9443, 8243, 8280 are free. Note: `lsof` exits with status 1 when nothing matches, which is the *good* case — wrap the check explicitly:
   ```bash
   PORTS_IN_USE=$(lsof -i :9443 -i :8243 -i :8280 -sTCP:LISTEN 2>/dev/null)
   if [ -n "$PORTS_IN_USE" ]; then
     echo "ERROR: ports in use:"
     echo "$PORTS_IN_USE"
     exit 1
   fi
   ```
   See **Error Handling** for recovery options when a port is occupied.

### Deploy
1. Ask the user for the path to the APIM zip. Accept both naming conventions:
   - Open source: `wso2am-4.6.0.zip` — `https://github.com/wso2/product-apim/releases`
   - WSO2 with updates: `wso2am-4.6.0.<N>.zip` (e.g., `wso2am-4.6.0.8.zip`) — `https://wso2.com/api-manager/`

   When resolving the path, glob `wso2am-4.6.0*.zip` rather than assuming the exact filename.

2. Extract into the current working directory (the user's project folder, not `/tmp`) and start:
   ```bash
   EXTRACT_DIR="$(pwd)/wso2apim-quickstart"
   unzip <path-to-zip> -d "$EXTRACT_DIR"
   APIM_HOME=$(find "$EXTRACT_DIR" -maxdepth 1 -type d -name 'wso2am-*' | head -1)
   # Re-export JAVA_HOME (use the OS-branched detection from Prerequisites step 1)
   sh "$APIM_HOME/bin/api-manager.sh" &
   ```

   Note: the extracted folder is always `wso2am-4.6.0/` regardless of the zip's update suffix — derive `APIM_HOME` from `find`, never from the zip filename.

3. Wait for readiness (see **Readiness Check** below).

### Cleanup
`JAVA_HOME` must be set for the stop script too — re-export it (using the same OS-branched detection above) before stopping:
```bash
export JAVA_HOME=...   # see Prerequisites step 1
sh "$APIM_HOME/bin/api-manager.sh" --stop
rm -rf "$EXTRACT_DIR"
```

---

## Mode B: Local Docker

### Prerequisites
1. Check Docker is running:
   ```
   docker info > /dev/null 2>&1
   ```
   If it fails, tell the user to start their Docker runtime (Docker Desktop, Colima via `colima start`, OrbStack, etc. — the right command depends on which one they use).

2. **Check VM memory.** APIM needs ~4 GiB. Default Colima/Docker Desktop installs ship with 2 GiB, which causes silent OOM kills on startup (the only signal is `Killed` at the end of `docker logs`). Recommended: 8 GiB / 4 CPU.
   ```bash
   MEM_BYTES=$(docker info --format '{{.MemTotal}}')
   MEM_GIB=$((MEM_BYTES / 1024 / 1024 / 1024))
   if [ "$MEM_GIB" -lt 4 ]; then
     echo "ERROR: Docker VM has ${MEM_GIB} GiB. APIM needs ~4 GiB minimum."
     echo "  Colima:  colima stop && edit ~/.colima/default/colima.yaml (memory: 6+) && colima start"
     echo "  Desktop: Settings -> Resources -> Memory"
     exit 1
   fi
   ```

3. Check for existing containers already publishing the APIM ports (a stale `wso2apim-quickstart` from a prior run, or another APIM stack the user has running):
   ```bash
   CONFLICT=$(docker ps --filter "publish=9443" --filter "publish=8243" --filter "publish=8280" \
     --format '{{.Names}} ({{.Image}})')
   if [ -n "$CONFLICT" ]; then
     echo "Existing container(s) already bound to APIM ports:"
     echo "$CONFLICT"
     # Offer: (a) reuse it, (b) stop+remove it, (c) run on an offset
   fi
   ```

4. Check ports 9443, 8243, 8280 are free at the host level (same wrapped `lsof` as zip mode). On macOS+Colima with `portForwarder: ssh`, the host listener for forwarded ports may show as an `ssh` PID — that doesn't mean APIM is involved; correlate with the `docker ps` check above.

### Docker Image Selection
Ask: **"Do you have WSO2 subscription credentials for updated Docker images?"**

- **Yes** → WSO2 runs a Harbor registry at `registry.wso2.com`. Guide them to login and pull:
  ```bash
  docker login registry.wso2.com
  # Username/password: WSO2 subscription credentials
  docker pull registry.wso2.com/wso2-apim/am:4.6.0
  ```
  Use image `registry.wso2.com/wso2-apim/am:4.6.0` in the run command.
  Available tags: `4.6.0`, `4.6.0.21`, `4.6.0.0`, `latest`. Use `4.6.0` for stability.

- **No** → Use the open-source image from Docker Hub:
  ```
  wso2/wso2am:4.6.0
  ```

### Deploy
Clean up any stale container with the same name first (idempotent re-run):
```bash
docker rm -f wso2apim-quickstart 2>/dev/null || true

docker run -d \
  --name wso2apim-quickstart \
  -p 9443:9443 \
  -p 8243:8243 \
  -p 8280:8280 \
  <IMAGE>
```

Wait for readiness (see **Readiness Check** below).

### Cleanup
```bash
# Pause (keep container + in-memory H2 state for next session):
docker stop wso2apim-quickstart

# Resume:
docker start wso2apim-quickstart

# Remove entirely (discards H2 state):
docker rm -f wso2apim-quickstart
```

---

## Mode C: Docker Compose

### Prerequisites
Run all four Mode B prerequisite checks: (1) Docker runtime is up, (2) Docker VM has ≥ 4 GiB memory, (3) no existing container is publishing 9443/8243/8280, (4) host ports are free. Skipping the memory check is the most common cause of silent OOM kills in compose deployments.

### Deploy

**Standalone (no existing compose file):** Generate a `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  apim:
    image: <IMAGE>
    container_name: wso2apim-quickstart
    ports:
      - "9443:9443"
      - "8243:8243"
      - "8280:8280"
    healthcheck:
      # /services/Version is served only after the Carbon server has fully started.
      # Do NOT use /carbon/admin/login.jsp — it returns 200 well before apps are deployed.
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-skf", "--max-time", "5", "https://localhost:9443/services/Version"]
      interval: 15s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 12
      start_period: 60s
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Use the same image selection logic as Mode B (subscription vs open-source).

**Adding to an existing compose file:** Read the user's existing `docker-compose.yml`, add the `apim` service block above, preserve all existing services unchanged. Do NOT add a `version` key — it is obsolete in modern Docker Compose.

Then start:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Wait for readiness (see **Readiness Check** below).

### Cleanup
```bash
# Pause (keep container + in-memory H2 state):
docker compose stop

# Resume:
docker compose start

# Remove entirely (discards H2 state, removes network):
docker compose down
```

---

## Mode D: Remote VM

### Gather Info
Ask the user for:
- **Hostname or IP** of the remote machine
- **SSH user** (e.g., `ubuntu`, `ec2-user`, `azureuser`)
- **Deploy method on remote**: zip or Docker
- **Install path** on remote — suggest:
  - `/opt/wso2` — standard for third-party server software (needs sudo)
  - `/home/<user>/wso2` — user home directory (no sudo needed)
  - `/usr/local/wso2` — locally installed software

### Prerequisites (run via SSH)
1. Check SSH connectivity:
   ```bash
   ssh <user>@<host> 'echo ok'
   ```
   If this fails, stop and tell the user to configure SSH access (key-based auth recommended).

2. If zip mode — check JDK 21 on remote:
   ```bash
   ssh <user>@<host> 'java -version'
   ```
   Must show version 21. If missing, tell the user to install it — do NOT install it yourself.

3. If zip mode — check `unzip` on remote:
   ```bash
   ssh <user>@<host> 'which unzip'
   ```
   If missing, tell the user to install it (`sudo apt install -y unzip`).

4. If zip mode — detect and export `JAVA_HOME` on remote (assumes Linux target, which is nearly always the case for cloud VMs):
   ```bash
   ssh <user>@<host> 'export JAVA_HOME=$(dirname $(dirname $(readlink -f $(which java)))) && echo JAVA_HOME=$JAVA_HOME'
   ```

5. If Docker mode — check Docker on remote and verify VM memory ≥ 4 GiB (same rationale as Mode B step 2):
   ```bash
   ssh <user>@<host> 'docker info > /dev/null 2>&1 && echo ok'
   ssh <user>@<host> 'MEM_BYTES=$(docker info --format "{{.MemTotal}}") && echo "Docker MemTotal: $((MEM_BYTES / 1024 / 1024 / 1024)) GiB"'
   ```
   If under 4 GiB, stop and tell the user to resize the Docker VM.

6. If Docker mode — check for existing containers publishing the APIM ports on the remote:
   ```bash
   ssh <user>@<host> 'docker ps --filter "publish=9443" --filter "publish=8243" --filter "publish=8280" --format "{{.Names}} ({{.Image}})"'
   ```
   If non-empty, ask the user how to handle the conflict (reuse, remove, or use offset).

7. Check host-level ports on remote. `ss` exits 0 even when the grep pipeline is empty, so check the captured output explicitly:
   ```bash
   PORTS_IN_USE=$(ssh <user>@<host> 'ss -tlnp 2>/dev/null | awk "/:(9443|8243|8280) /"')
   if [ -n "$PORTS_IN_USE" ]; then
     echo "ERROR: ports in use on remote:"
     echo "$PORTS_IN_USE"
     exit 1
   fi
   ```

### Deploy (zip on remote)

**CRITICAL: All `deployment.toml` changes MUST be applied BEFORE the first startup.** APIM initializes its H2 database on first boot using values from `deployment.toml`. If started with `localhost` defaults, the DB will contain wrong URLs for OAuth callbacks, service providers, and gateway endpoints. These cannot be fixed by editing config later — the only recovery is a full re-extract.

```bash
# Copy zip to remote
scp <path-to-zip> <user>@<host>:/tmp/

# Extract to chosen install path. The zip filename may be wso2am-4.6.0.zip (OSS)
# or wso2am-4.6.0.<N>.zip (subscription) — derive ZIP_NAME from the actual file.
ssh <user>@<host> 'ZIP_NAME=$(basename /tmp/wso2am-4.6.0*.zip) && unzip /tmp/$ZIP_NAME -d <INSTALL_PATH>'
```

The extracted directory is always `wso2am-4.6.0/` regardless of update suffix.

**Apply deployment.toml changes** (replace `<IP_OR_DOMAIN>` with the remote host's IP or domain):

```bash
APIM_HOME="<INSTALL_PATH>/wso2am-4.6.0"
ssh <user>@<host> "cat > /tmp/apim-config-patch.sh << 'SCRIPT'
CONF=\"${APIM_HOME}/repository/conf/deployment.toml\"
HOST=\"<IP_OR_DOMAIN>\"

# a) Server hostname
sed -i 's/^hostname = .*/hostname = \"'\"$HOST\"'\"/' \"\$CONF\"

# b) Gateway environment endpoints
sed -i 's|service_url = .*|service_url = \"https://'\"$HOST\"':\${mgt.transport.https.port}/services/\"|' \"\$CONF\"
sed -i 's|ws_endpoint = .*|ws_endpoint = \"ws://'\"$HOST\"':9099\"|' \"\$CONF\"
sed -i 's|wss_endpoint = .*|wss_endpoint = \"wss://'\"$HOST\"':8099\"|' \"\$CONF\"
sed -i 's|http_endpoint = .*|http_endpoint = \"http://'\"$HOST\"':\${http.nio.port}\"|' \"\$CONF\"
sed -i 's|https_endpoint = .*|https_endpoint = \"https://'\"$HOST\"':\${https.nio.port}\"|' \"\$CONF\"
sed -i 's|websub_event_receiver_http_endpoint = .*|websub_event_receiver_http_endpoint = \"http://'\"$HOST\"':9021\"|' \"\$CONF\"
sed -i 's|websub_event_receiver_https_endpoint = .*|websub_event_receiver_https_endpoint = \"https://'\"$HOST\"':8021\"|' \"\$CONF\"

# c) OAuth revoke endpoint (uncomment and set)
sed -i 's|^#.*revoke_endpoint = .*|revoke_endpoint = \"https://'\"$HOST\"':\${https.nio.port}/revoke\"|' \"\$CONF\"

# d) DevPortal URL (uncomment and set)
sed -i 's|^#.*\[apim.devportal\]|[apim.devportal]|' \"\$CONF\"
sed -i 's|^#.*url = .*/devportal.*|url = \"https://'\"$HOST\"':\${mgt.transport.https.port}/devportal\"|' \"\$CONF\"

# e) OAuth endpoints (append — not in default config)
cat >> \"\$CONF\" << EOF

[oauth.endpoints]
oauth2_token_url = \"https://${HOST}:9443/oauth2/token\"
oauth2_revoke_url = \"https://${HOST}:9443/oauth2/revoke\"
oauth2_authz_url = \"https://${HOST}:9443/oauth2/authorize\"
EOF

echo \"deployment.toml configured for \$HOST\"
SCRIPT
chmod +x /tmp/apim-config-patch.sh && bash /tmp/apim-config-patch.sh"
```

**Start APIM** (only after config is applied):
```bash
ssh <user>@<host> "export JAVA_HOME=\$(dirname \$(dirname \$(readlink -f \$(which java)))) && sh ${APIM_HOME}/bin/api-manager.sh &"
```

### Deploy (Docker on remote)
Idempotent re-run: remove any stale container with the same name first.
```bash
ssh <user>@<host> 'docker rm -f wso2apim-quickstart 2>/dev/null || true'
ssh <user>@<host> 'docker run -d --name wso2apim-quickstart -p 9443:9443 -p 8243:8243 -p 8280:8280 <IMAGE>'
```

Wait for readiness using the **remote host** (see below).

### Firewall / Security Group Ports

After deployment, remind the user to open these ports in their cloud provider's firewall, security group, or NSG:

| Port | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| 9443 | Management console, Publisher, DevPortal, Admin, Carbon |
| 8243 | HTTPS Gateway (API traffic) |
| 8280 | HTTP Gateway (API traffic) |

Example for Azure NSG:
```bash
az network nsg rule create --resource-group <rg> --nsg-name <nsg> \
  --name AllowAPIM --priority 110 \
  --destination-port-ranges 9443 8243 8280 \
  --protocol Tcp --access Allow
```

For AWS Security Groups, GCP Firewall Rules, etc., the user should open the same ports in their respective console or CLI.

### Cleanup (remote)
```bash
# Zip — JAVA_HOME must be set for the stop script too
ssh <user>@<host> "export JAVA_HOME=\$(dirname \$(dirname \$(readlink -f \$(which java)))) && sh <INSTALL_PATH>/wso2am-4.6.0/bin/api-manager.sh --stop && rm -rf <INSTALL_PATH>/wso2am-4.6.0"

# Docker — pause/resume/remove
ssh <user>@<host> 'docker stop wso2apim-quickstart'    # pause
ssh <user>@<host> 'docker start wso2apim-quickstart'   # resume
ssh <user>@<host> 'docker rm -f wso2apim-quickstart'   # remove entirely
```

---

## Readiness Check

**Do not use `/carbon/admin/login.jsp` returning 200 as the readiness signal** — Carbon serves login.jsp very early in boot, well before the Publisher/DevPortal apps are deployed. A user who acts on that signal will hit partial 500s from the Publisher API.

The authoritative signal is the log line `WSO2 Carbon started in <N> sec`. Wait for that, then do a short HTTP probe to confirm the port is reachable.

### Docker mode
```bash
MAX_WAIT=180
ELAPSED=0
until docker logs wso2apim-quickstart 2>&1 | grep -q "WSO2 Carbon started in"; do
  sleep 2
  ELAPSED=$((ELAPSED + 2))
  if [ $ELAPSED -ge $MAX_WAIT ]; then
    echo "ERROR: APIM did not start within ${MAX_WAIT}s. Check 'docker logs wso2apim-quickstart'."
    exit 1
  fi
done
curl -skf --max-time 5 "https://localhost:9443/services/Version" >/dev/null \
  && echo "APIM is ready (took ~${ELAPSED}s)."
```

### Zip mode (local or remote)
```bash
LOG="$APIM_HOME/repository/logs/wso2carbon.log"   # remote: prefix with: ssh <user>@<host>
MAX_WAIT=180
ELAPSED=0
until grep -q "WSO2 Carbon started in" "$LOG" 2>/dev/null; do
  sleep 2
  ELAPSED=$((ELAPSED + 2))
  if [ $ELAPSED -ge $MAX_WAIT ]; then
    echo "ERROR: APIM did not start within ${MAX_WAIT}s. Check $LOG."
    exit 1
  fi
done
curl -skf --max-time 5 "https://${APIM_HOST}:9443/services/Version" >/dev/null \
  && echo "APIM is ready (took ~${ELAPSED}s)."
```

For remote VM, run the curl probe from the local machine (not over SSH) — it confirms the remote portals are reachable from the user's network. Always use `--max-time` on curl to avoid hangs.

---

## Output

Once APIM is ready, print:

```
WSO2 API Manager 4.6.0 is running.

Portal URLs:
  Publisher:  https://<HOST>:9443/publisher
  DevPortal:  https://<HOST>:9443/devportal
  Admin:      https://<HOST>:9443/admin
  Carbon:     https://<HOST>:9443/carbon

Credentials: admin / admin

Logs:    docker logs -f wso2apim-quickstart                    (Docker mode)
         tail -f <APIM_HOME>/repository/logs/wso2carbon.log    (zip mode)
Stop:    docker stop wso2apim-quickstart                       (Docker mode)
         sh <APIM_HOME>/bin/api-manager.sh --stop              (zip mode)

Note: You will see a browser security warning for the self-signed certificate — accept it to proceed.

Note: After opening the Publisher/DevPortal in a browser you'll see log lines like
  ERROR - PostAuthenticationInterceptor Authentication failed: Bearer/Basic authentication header is missing
These are benign — the UI makes unauthenticated probes before login. Not a startup failure.
```

Substitute placeholders before printing:
- `<HOST>` → `localhost` for local modes, or the remote hostname/IP for VM mode
- `<APIM_HOME>` → the actual extract path from the deploy step (zip mode only)

## Error Handling

| Error | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Port 9443/8243/8280 in use | Diagnose with BOTH `lsof -i :9443 -P` (host-level owner — may show an `ssh` PID for Colima-forwarded ports) AND `docker ps --filter "publish=9443"` (any container already publishing it). Recovery options: (1) kill/remove the offender if it's a stale APIM instance, or (2) set `[server] offset = 1` in `deployment.toml` so APIM uses 9444/8244/8281 instead. |
| Container exits with `Killed` in `docker logs` | Docker VM ran out of memory. Check `docker info` MemTotal; APIM needs ≥ 4 GiB. Increase the runtime's VM memory (Colima: edit `~/.colima/default/colima.yaml`; Docker Desktop: Settings → Resources → Memory). |
| Docker not running | Tell user to start their Docker runtime (Docker Desktop, `colima start`, OrbStack, etc.). |
| JDK not found or wrong version | Tell user to install JDK 21. On macOS, `/usr/libexec/java_home -v 21` is the canonical probe. Do not install JDK yourself. |
| SSH connection fails | Report the SSH error. Suggest checking hostname, user, and key config. |
| APIM fails to start within 180s | Tell user to check logs at `<APIM_HOME>/repository/logs/wso2carbon.log` (zip) or `docker logs wso2apim-quickstart` (Docker). |
| `registry.wso2.com` login fails | Harbor registry requires valid WSO2 subscription credentials. Confirm credentials and retry, or fall back to open-source Docker Hub image (`wso2/wso2am:4.6.0`). |
| `ERROR - PostAuthenticationInterceptor Authentication failed` in logs | Benign — UI makes unauthenticated probes before login. Not a failure. Ignore unless you see it during automated API calls. |
