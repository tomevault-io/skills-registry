# Phone / SMS Gateway Skill

This skill defines how the OpenClaw agent responds when contacted via the
Twilio phone gateway — both live voice calls and SMS messages.

## Voice call framing

Incoming speech from the caller is sent to the agent as:

```
Phone call: <transcribed speech>
```

Or, if `CALLER_NAME` is configured (e.g. `CALLER_NAME=Alice`):

```
Phone call (Alice): <transcribed speech>
```

The agent should reply conversationally, keeping answers concise enough to be
spoken aloud (≤ 600 characters before truncation). Markdown and formatting are
stripped before the reply is sent to Twilio's TTS engine.

## SMS slash commands (plugin mode only)

When running as an OpenClaw plugin, SMS messages that are exact control
commands (e.g. `/status`, `/reset`) are handled directly by OpenClaw's native
command system — the agent is not involved. The command reply is sent back as
an SMS response immediately. This gives the same output as running the command
from Discord or the TUI.

Messages starting with `/` that are not recognised exact commands fall through
to the normal conversational path below.

## SMS framing

Incoming conversational SMS messages are sent to the agent as:

```
SMS: <message text>

Reply via SMS. Keep it concise: <= 280 characters. Use plain ASCII only
(no emojis, no curly quotes, no em-dashes). No markdown. If too long,
answer with the single most important sentence.
```

Or, if `CALLER_NAME` is configured:

```
SMS (Alice): <message text>
...
```

The agent must stay within the character limit and use only ASCII-safe
punctuation to avoid UCS-2 encoding (which halves the per-segment character
limit on Twilio).

## Session

Both voice and SMS share the session ID configured in `openclawSessionId`
(default: `phone`) and the agent ID configured in `openclawAgentId`
(default: `phone`), so conversation history persists across channels.
