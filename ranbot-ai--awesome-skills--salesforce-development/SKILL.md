# Salesforce Development

## Patterns

### Lightning Web Component with Wire Service

Use @wire decorator for reactive data binding with Lightning Data Service
or Apex methods. @wire fits LWC's reactive architecture and enables
Salesforce performance optimizations.

### Bulkified Apex Trigger with Handler Pattern

Apex triggers must be bulkified to handle 200+ records per transaction.
Use handler pattern for separation of concerns, testability, and
recursion prevention.

### Queueable Apex for Async Processing

Use Queueable Apex for async processing with support for non-primitive
types, monitoring via AsyncApexJob, and job chaining. Limit: 50 jobs
per transaction, 1 child job when chaining.

## Anti-Patterns

### ❌ SOQL Inside Loops

### ❌ DML Inside Loops

### ❌ Hardcoding IDs

## ⚠️ Sharp Edges
