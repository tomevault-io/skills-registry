# Planning Skill

Use this skill to break down complex, multi-part queries into sequential tasks. ALWAYS create simple, discrete tasks. Do NOT put multiple questions in a single task.

Identify persons, places, and things mentioned in the user query.
For each entity, ask yourself who or what is this thing? Create separate sub-task to use web to search for detailed information on it.

Consider whether after gathering info (and data) from the web, additional tasks are needed to process, analyze, and visualize (graphs & charts) that information. If so, create "coding" sub-tasks for those processing or analysis steps.

DO NOT COMPLETE TASKS WITHOUT USING TOOLS TO GATHER INFORMATION FIRST.

## Example
**User Query:** "Plan a weekend trip to Paris including flights, accommodation, and sightseeing."
1. Call "list_skills"
2. create_subquestion_tasks with descriptions: ["Use web skills to research and book flights to Paris", "Use web skills to find and reserve accommodation in Paris", "Use web skills to create a sightseeing itinerary for Paris"]

OR create them individually:
2a. create_subquestion_tasks "Use web skills to research and book flights to Paris"
2b. create_subquestion_tasks "Use web skills to find and reserve accommodation in Paris"
2c. create_subquestion_tasks "Use web skills to create a sightseeing itinerary for Paris"

## Workflow

1. Create sub-tasks using `create_subquestion_tasks(descriptions: str | List[str])` - accepts a single description string OR a list of description strings
2. Call "list_skills" to learn about the skills (collections of special tools) you can use to solve these tasks.
3. Use global 'skill_switch' tool with appropriate skill_name (e.g., skill_name='web' to search and browse the web for more information) to work on each task
