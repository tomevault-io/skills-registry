# Keypair and Cryptography Skill

## Overview

The keypair and cryptography module provides secure cryptographic operations for the Sui blockchain ecosystem, including key generation, signing, verification, and address derivation. It supports multiple signature schemes and provides a unified interface for cryptographic operations.

## Quick Start

### Installation and Import

```typescript
// Import Ed25519 keypair
import { Ed25519Keypair } from '@mysten/sui/keypairs/ed25519';

// Import other signature schemes
import { Secp256k1Keypair } from '@mysten/sui/keypairs/secp256k1';
import { Secp256r1Keypair } from '@mysten/sui/keypairs/secp256r1';

// Import common utilities
import { mnemonicToSeed } from '@mysten/sui/cryptography';
// Note: generateMnemonic needs to be imported from @scure/bip39: import { generateMnemonic } from '@scure/bip39';
```

### Basic Examples

```typescript
import { Ed25519Keypair } from '@mysten/sui/keypairs/ed25519';
import { Transaction } from '@mysten/sui/transactions';

// Generate new keypair
const keypair = new Ed25519Keypair();

// Get address
const address = keypair.toSuiAddress();
console.log('Address:', address);

// Sign transaction
const tx = new Transaction();
// ... build transaction
const bytes = await tx.build({ client });
const { signature } = await keypair.signTransaction(bytes);

// Verify signature
const isValid = await keypair.getPublicKey().verifyTransaction(bytes, signature);
console.log('Signature valid:', isValid);
```

## Core Components

### Signer Abstract Class

**Location**: `https://github.com/MystenLabs/ts-sdks/tree/main/packages/typescript/src/cryptography/keypair.ts`

`Signer` is the abstract base class for all signing operations, providing:
- Message signing with intent scope
- Transaction signing and execution
- Personal message signing
- Address derivation from public key

### Keypair Abstract Class

**Location**: `https://github.com/MystenLabs/ts-sdks/tree/main/packages/typescript/src/cryptography/keypair.ts`

`Keypair` extends `Signer`, adding secret key management:
- Secret key serialization/deserialization
- Bech32 encoding for private keys
- Multiple signature scheme support

### PublicKey Abstract Class

**Location**: `https://github.com/MystenLabs/ts-sdks/tree/main/packages/typescript/src/cryptography/publickey.ts`

`PublicKey` is the base class for public key operations, providing:
- Address derivation and verification
- Signature verification
- Multiple encoding formats
- Intent-based verification

## Supported Signature Schemes
