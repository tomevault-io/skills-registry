# Sui Transaction Building Skill

## Overview

Transaction building is a core functionality of Sui blockchain development. The Sui TypeScript SDK provides the `Transaction` class, allowing developers to create, serialize, sign, and execute blockchain transactions using a fluent builder pattern. This skill helps Claude Code understand how to assist users in building various types of transactions on Sui.

## Quick Start

### Installation and Import

```typescript
// Import Transaction class
import { Transaction } from '@mysten/sui/transactions';

// Create new transaction
const tx = new Transaction();
```

### Basic Example: Sending SUI

```typescript
import { Transaction } from '@mysten/sui/transactions';

const tx = new Transaction();

// Split 100 units of SUI from gas coin
const [coin] = tx.splitCoins(tx.gas, [100]);

// Transfer the split coin to specified address
tx.transferObjects([coin], '0xSomeSuiAddress');

// Execute transaction using signAndExecuteTransaction
const result = await client.signAndExecuteTransaction({
  signer: keypair,
  transaction: tx
});
```

## Core Components

### Transaction Class

**Location**: `https://github.com/MystenLabs/ts-sdks/tree/main/packages/typescript/src/transactions/Transaction.ts`

The Transaction class is the core of transaction building, providing the following key features:
- **Builder Pattern**: Fluent interface supporting method chaining
- **Command Support**: Supports all Sui transaction commands (Move calls, transfers, merges, etc.)
- **Plugin System**: Supports transaction parsing plugins
- **Serialization Capability**: Built-in BCS serialization support
- **Async Support**: Supports automatic resolution of async transaction thunks

### TransactionDataBuilder Class

**Location**: `https://github.com/MystenLabs/ts-sdks/tree/main/packages/typescript/src/transactions/TransactionData.ts`

Handles transaction data structure and serialization:
- Transaction data validation and serialization
- BCS serialization for blockchain compatibility
- Gas configuration and budget management
- Input and command management

### Commands Module

**Location**: `https://github.com/MystenLabs/ts-sdks/tree/main/packages/typescript/src/transactions/Commands.ts`

Defines all available transaction operations:
- **MoveCall**: Execute Move smart contract functions
- **TransferObjects**: Transfer objects between addresses
- **SplitCoins**: Split a coin into multiple amounts
- **MergeCoins**: Merge multiple coins
- **Publish**: Deploy new Move modules
- **Upgrade**: Upgrade existing Move modules
- **MakeMoveVec**: Create Move vectors

## Detailed Documentation

This skill follows a progressive disclosure pattern. The main file provides an overview and quick start, while detailed information is available in the reference directory.

### Transaction Commands
