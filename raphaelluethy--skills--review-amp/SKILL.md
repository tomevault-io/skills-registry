# Review using Amp

This skill performs automated code reviews using the `amp review` command. It analyzes the codebase for issues, reports findings, and can create tasks to fix them if the user requests.

## When to Use

- When the user explicitly asks for a code review
- When the user wants to check code quality or find potential issues
- When the user mentions using Amp for code review
- When you need to run an automated code analysis on the project

## Steps

1. Run `amp review` in the root of the project with a 300-second timeout
2. If `amp` command is not available, alert the user and stop
3. Return the command output to the user
4. Ask the user if they would like you to fix the identified issues
5. If yes, define specific tasks for each issue and ask for permission to continue
6. If permission granted, create tasks for the issues and work on them one by one
