# Skill Creator

## Overview

This skill provides comprehensive guidance for creating effective Claude Skills that extend capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, and tools for the AgentStack Sovereign Platform.

## Skill Anatomy

Every skill consists of a required SKILL.md file and optional bundled resources:

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md (required)
│   ├── YAML frontmatter (name + description)
│   └── Markdown instructions
└── Bundled Resources (optional)
    ├── scripts/       - Executable code (Python/Bash)
    ├── references/    - Documentation loaded into context
    └── assets/        - Templates, icons, fonts for output
```

## Core Principles

### 1. Context Window is Precious

Claude's context window is shared. Only add information Claude doesn't already have.

- **Challenge each piece**: "Does Claude really need this?"
- **Prefer examples over explanations**: Show, don't tell
- **Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines**: Split into references if larger

### 2. Progressive Disclosure

Three-level loading system:

1. **Metadata** (always loaded): ~100 words - name + description
2. **SKILL.md body** (on trigger): <5k words - core workflow
3. **Bundled resources** (as needed): Unlimited - detailed docs

### 3. Degrees of Freedom

Match specificity to task fragility:

| Freedom Level | Use When | Example |
|---------------|----------|---------|
| **High** (text) | Multiple valid approaches | Brainstorming, design |
| **Medium** (pseudocode) | Preferred pattern exists | API integration |
| **Low** (scripts) | Fragile, must be exact | Database migrations |

## Skill Creation Workflow

### Step 1: Understand with Concrete Examples

Before creating, clarify:

- What specific queries should trigger this skill?
- What are 3-5 concrete usage examples?
- What should NOT trigger this skill?

Example questions:
- "What would a user say that should trigger this skill?"
- "Can you give examples of how this skill would be used?"

### Step 2: Plan Reusable Contents

Analyze each example to identify:

| Resource Type | Include When |
|---------------|--------------|
| `scripts/` | Same code written repeatedly, deterministic reliability needed |
| `references/` | Documentation Claude should reference while working |
| `assets/` | Templates, boilerplate to copy into output |

### Step 3: Initialize Skill

Run the initialization script:

```bash
python scripts/init_skill.py <skill-name> --path skills/
```

This creates:
- Skill directory with SKILL.md template
- Example scripts/, references/, assets/ directories
- Placeholder files to customize or delete

### Step 4: Write SKILL.md

#### Frontmatter (YAML)

```yaml
---
name: my-skill
description: Clear explanation of what the skill does AND when to use it. 
  Include triggers: specific scenarios, file types, or tasks. This is the 
  PRIMARY mechanism for skill activation - make it comprehensive.
---
```

**Critical**: All "when to use" information goes in description, NOT body.

#### Body (Markdown)

Use imperative form. Structure options:

**Workflow-Based** (sequential processes):
```markdown
## Workflow Decision Tree
## Step 1: [First Step]
## Step 2: [Second Step]
```

**Task-Based** (tool collections):
```markdown
## Quick Start
## Task Category 1
## Task Category 2
```

**Reference/Guidelines** (standards):
```markdown
## Guidelines
## Specifications
## Usage
```

### Step 5: Test Skill

Test activation:
- "List available skills" - verify it appears
- Try trigger phrases from description
- Verify correct resources load

### Step 6: Iterate

1. Use skill on real tasks
2. Note struggles or inefficiencies
3. Update SKILL.md or resources
4. Test again

## Design Patterns

### Pattern 1: High-level Guide with References

```markdown
# Data Processing

## Quick Start
Basic example here

## Advanced Features
- **Complex ops**: See [ADVANCED.md](references/ADVANCED.md)
- **API docs**: See [API.md](references/API.md)
```

### Pattern 2: Domain-Specific Organization

```
cloud-deploy/
├── SKILL.md (workflow + provider selection)
└── references/
    ├── aws.md
    ├── gcp.md
    └── azure.md
```

### Pattern 3: Conditional Details

```markdown
# Processing

## Basic Usage
Simple operations inline

**For complex cases**: See [COMPLEX.md](references/COMPLEX.md)
```

## What NOT to Include

Never create these files in skills:
- README.md (SKILL.md serves this purpose)
- INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md
- CHANGELOG.md
- Any user-facing documentation

Skills are for AI agents, not humans reading docs.

## AgentStack-Specific Guidance

When creating skills for AgentStack:

1. **Reference the specs**: Point to `/spec/*.md` files
2. **Use Go idioms**: Follow Go project conventions
3. **K8s-native**: Assume Kubernetes deployment context
4. **Multi-tenant aware**: Consider project isolation
5. **Observability built-in**: Include OpenTelemetry patterns

## Resources

- `scripts/init_skill.py` - Initialize new skills
- `references/skill-patterns.md` - Advanced design patterns
- `references/agentstack-context.md` - Platform-specific guidance
