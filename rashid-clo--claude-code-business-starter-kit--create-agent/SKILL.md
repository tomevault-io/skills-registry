# Create Agent

Teaches Claude how to create properly structured subagents through a guided interview process.

---

## What is an Agent?

An agent is a specialized autonomous worker that Claude can spawn for specific tasks. Agents live in `.claude/agents/` and run in their own isolated context with their own token budget.

**Key insight:** Skills teach Claude HOW to do something. Agents ARE someone who does something autonomously.

---

## The 4-Phase Interview Process

When creating a NEW agent, guide the user through these phases:

### Phase 1: ROLE
Ask the user:
- "What specialized task should this agent handle?"
- "What would you call this role?" (researcher, reviewer, writer, etc.)
- "What makes this agent an expert?"

**Goal:** Define the agent's identity and expertise

### Phase 2: TOOLS
Ask the user:
- "What does this agent need access to?" (files, web, APIs, etc.)
- "Should it be read-only or able to make changes?"

**Goal:** Constrain tools to minimum needed (security + focus)

### Phase 3: MODEL
Ask the user:
- "How complex is this task?"
- "Speed vs capability tradeoff?"

**Goal:** Select appropriate model (haiku for simple, sonnet for balanced, opus for complex)

### Phase 4: WORKFLOW
Ask the user:
- "Walk me through what this agent should do step-by-step"
- "What does success look like?"

**Goal:** Define clear instructions and success criteria

## Agent Structure

Agents are single markdown files:

```
.claude/agents/
├── researcher.md      # Research specialist
├── reviewer.md        # Code/content reviewer
├── writer.md          # Writing specialist
└── analyst.md         # Data analyst
```

---

## Agent Template

```markdown
---
name: agent-name
description: What this agent does. USE WHEN user needs [specific task].
tools: Tool1, Tool2, Tool3
model: sonnet
---

# IDENTITY

You are [Agent Name], a [role] specializing in [domain].

You are [personality traits]. You excel at [key capabilities].

## Core Expertise

- **Expertise 1** - What you know deeply
- **Expertise 2** - What you know deeply
- **Expertise 3** - What you know deeply

## When Invoked

1. [First action]
2. [Second action]
3. [Third action]
4. [Fourth action]

## Success Criteria

You have succeeded when:
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
- [ ] Criterion 3

## Output Format

Return your results as:

**Summary:** [Brief overview]
**Findings:** [Key discoveries]
**Actions Taken:** [What you did]

```

## YAML Frontmatter Options

| Field | Required | Default | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|---------|
| `name` | Yes | - | Unique identifier (lowercase, hyphens) |
| `description` | Yes | - | When to use + USE WHEN triggers |
| `tools` | No | All tools | Comma-separated list of allowed tools |
| `model` | No | inherit | `haiku`, `sonnet`, `opus`, or omit to inherit |

---

## Tool Restrictions

Constrain agents to only the tools they need:

```yaml
# Read-only research agent
tools: Read, Glob, Grep, WebSearch, WebFetch

# Content creation agent
tools: Read, Write, Glob

# Code analysis agent
tools: Read, Glob, Grep, Bash(git:*)

# Notion-only agent
tools: mcp__notion__*

# Full access (omit tools field)
# tools: [not specified] = inherits all available tools
```

**Common tool combinations:**

| Agent Type | Tools |
|------------|-------|
| Researcher | `Read, Glob, Grep, WebSearch, WebFetch` |
| Writer | `Read, Write, Glob` |
| Reviewer | `Read, Glob, Grep` |
| Analyst | `Read, Glob, Grep, Bash(python:*)` |
| Publisher | `Read, Write, Bash, mcp__postiz__*` |

**Why constrain tools?**
- Prevents agents from doing things they shouldn't
- Makes agents more focused and reliable
- Security: limits blast radius if something goes wrong

---

## Model Selection

| Model | Speed | Cost | Use When |
|-------|-------|------|----------|
| `haiku` | Fast | Low | Simple tasks, quick lookups, formatting |
| `sonnet` | Balanced | Medium | Most tasks, research, analysis, writing |
| `opus` | Slower | High | Complex reasoning, strategy, difficult problems |
| (omit) | Inherit | Inherit | Use whatever the main session uses |

**Rule of thumb:** Start with `sonnet`, only use `opus` if you need it.

## How Agents Are Invoked

Agents are spawned using the **Task tool** from skills or commands:

```markdown
# In a skill or command:

Use the Task tool to spawn the researcher agent:

Task tool parameters:
- subagent_type: general-purpose
- description: "Research [topic]"
- prompt: "You are the Researcher agent. Load your instructions from .claude/agents/researcher.md. Research: [user's question]"
```

The agent then:
1. Loads its instructions from the agent file
2. Executes with its own token budget (isolated context)
3. Returns results to the calling skill/command

---

## When to Use Agents vs Skills

| Use an Agent when... | Use a Skill when... |
|----------------------|---------------------|
| Task is autonomous | Task needs user interaction |
| Needs isolated context | Needs shared context |
| Single-purpose specialist | Multi-step workflow |
| Can run in background | Needs step-by-step control |
| Quality variation acceptable | Quality standards critical |

**Examples:**
- Research a competitor → Agent (autonomous, isolated)
- Create a skill → Skill (needs interview, user decisions)
- Review code → Agent (autonomous review)
- Plan a video → Skill (needs user input throughout)

---

## Creation Checklist

Before finalizing an agent, verify:

- [ ] `name` is lowercase with hyphens
- [ ] `description` includes USE WHEN triggers
- [ ] `tools` constrained to minimum needed
- [ ] `model` appropriate for complexity
- [ ] IDENTITY section defines role clearly
- [ ] Success criteria are measurable
- [ ] Output format is specified

---

## Common Mistakes

1. **Too many tools** - Constrain to only what's needed
2. **Vague identity** - Be specific about role and expertise
3. **No success criteria** - Agent doesn't know when it's done
4. **Wrong model** - Don't use opus for simple tasks
5. **Missing output format** - Agent returns inconsistent results
