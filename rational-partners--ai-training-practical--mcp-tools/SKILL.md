# MCP Tools Reference

This skill documents the MCP servers available for enhanced code intelligence, automation, and integrations.

## CCLSP (Code Intelligence) - Refactoring Powerhouse

The `cclsp` MCP provides Language Server Protocol capabilities for intelligent code operations. **Use these tools for any refactoring task** - they're significantly more reliable than text-based find/replace.

### Available Tools

| Tool | Purpose | When to Use |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `mcp__cclsp__find_definition` | Find where a symbol is defined | Understanding code, navigating to implementations |
| `mcp__cclsp__find_references` | Find all usages of a symbol | Impact analysis before refactoring |
| `mcp__cclsp__rename_symbol` | Rename across entire codebase | Refactoring variable/function/class names |
| `mcp__cclsp__rename_symbol_strict` | Rename at specific position | When rename_symbol finds multiple candidates |
| `mcp__cclsp__get_diagnostics` | Get TypeScript/lint errors | Checking code health before/after changes |
| `mcp__cclsp__get_hover` | Get type info/docs at position | Understanding types, checking signatures |
| `mcp__cclsp__find_workspace_symbols` | Search symbols by name | Finding classes/functions across codebase |
| `mcp__cclsp__find_implementation` | Find interface implementations | Understanding polymorphism, finding concrete classes |
| `mcp__cclsp__prepare_call_hierarchy` | Prepare for call analysis | Required before get_incoming_calls/get_outgoing_calls |
| `mcp__cclsp__get_incoming_calls` | Find callers of a function | Impact analysis - who calls this? |
| `mcp__cclsp__get_outgoing_calls` | Find callees of a function | Dependency analysis - what does this call? |
| `mcp__cclsp__restart_server` | Restart LSP server | If results seem stale or incorrect |

### Common Patterns

#### Safe Rename Refactoring

```
1. Find all references first (impact analysis):
   mcp__cclsp__find_references
     file_path: "backend/src/services/user.service.ts"
     symbol_name: "getUserById"

2. Review the references to ensure you want to rename all of them

3. Perform the rename (dry_run first):
   mcp__cclsp__rename_symbol
     file_path: "backend/src/services/user.service.ts"
     symbol_name: "getUserById"
     new_name: "fetchUserById"
     dry_run: true

4. If dry_run looks good, execute the rename:
   mcp__cclsp__rename_symbol
     file_path: "backend/src/services/user.service.ts"
     symbol_name: "getUserById"
     new_name: "fetchUserById"
     dry_run: false
```

#### Understanding Call Flow

```
1. Prepare call hierarchy:
   mcp__cclsp__prepare_call_hierarchy
     file_path: "backend/src/services/enrichment.service.ts"
     line: 45
     character: 10

2. Find what calls this function:
   mcp__cclsp__get_incoming_calls
     file_path: "backend/src/services/enrichment.service.ts"
     line: 45
     character: 10

3. Find what this function calls:
   mcp__cclsp__get_outgoing_calls
     file_path: "backend/src/services/enrichment.service.ts"
     line: 45
     character: 10
```

#### Finding Interface Implementations

```
mcp__cclsp__find_implementation
  file_path: "backend/src/types/services.ts"
  line: 15  # Line where interface method is defined
  character: 5
```

#### Checking Code Health

```
mcp__cclsp__get_diagnostics
  file_path: "backend/src/services/new-feature.service.ts"

# Returns TypeScript errors, warnings, and hints
```

### Best Practices

1. **Always use dry_run first** for rename operations
2. **Check references before renaming** to understand impact
3. **Use find_workspace_symbols** when you don't know the file location
4. **Restart server** if results seem incorrect after file changes
5. **Prefer cclsp over grep/sed** for any symbol-aware operations
