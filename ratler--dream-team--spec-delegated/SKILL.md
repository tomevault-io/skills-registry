# Write Delegated Spec

Convert the brainstorming conversation into a formal spec file for delegated execution — single session with an orchestrator dispatching specialized sub-agents via the Task tool.

**Prerequisites:** This skill assumes `/dream-team:plan` has already been run in this session. If the conversation has no brainstorming context (no discussed requirements, no confirmed approach, no validated task breakdown), stop and tell the user: "No brainstorming context found. Run `/dream-team:plan <prompt>` first to explore requirements and design."

## Filename Format

**All spec files MUST be named with a date prefix:** `specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<descriptive-kebab-case>.md`

Use today's date. Example: `specs/2026-02-07-user-auth-api.md`

## What To Do

1. Read the spec template at `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/spec-template.md`.
2. Read the available agent definitions at `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/agents/*.md` to understand each agent's capabilities.
3. Summarize the agreed plan from the conversation — confirm with the user before writing.
4. Write the spec, filling in all sections from the brainstorming context.
5. Set frontmatter `mode: delegated` and `spec-version: 1`.
6. Set frontmatter `playwright: true` if the brainstorming decided to use Playwright MCP, otherwise `playwright: false`.
7. Set frontmatter `frontend-design: true` if the brainstorming discussed frontend/UI work and design direction, otherwise `frontend-design: false`.
8. If `frontend-design: true`, fill in the `## Design Direction` section with the aesthetic style, stack, component libraries, and design notes from the brainstorming conversation. Auto-suggest component libraries based on the chosen stack if not explicitly discussed.
9. Assign each task to a specific agent by name and type.
10. Mark tasks as `background: true` when they can safely run in parallel (no file conflicts, no dependencies).
11. Include Team Members and Review Policy sections.
12. Include a reviewer agent for post-task code review.
13. Include a validator agent for final verification.
14. Fill in the `## Cleanup` section with any teardown commands needed (stop servers, remove temp files). Use "N/A" if nothing to clean up.
15. Save to `specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<descriptive-kebab-case>.md` using today's date.

## Eliminating Ambiguity

Specs are executed by agents that have no access to the brainstorming conversation. Every detail left unspecified becomes a coin flip — different agents will make different choices. The goal is **deterministic builds**: two agents reading the same task description should produce near-identical output.

When writing task descriptions, prefer concrete values over descriptive language:

- **CSS**: Specify exact hex colors, font stacks, spacing values, border-radius. Write `background: #1a1a2e` not "dark background". Write `font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif` not "system sans-serif stack".
- **Strings**: Write exact user-facing text in quotes. Write `"Unable to load weather data"` not "an error message". Write `"${score} points by ${author} | ${comments} comments"` not "display the score, author, and comments".
- **DOM structure**: Specify element types (`<div>`, `<p>`, `<span>`), class names, and nesting. Write `createElement("div")` not "create an element".
- **API details**: Specify exact URLs, query parameters, response field paths, units, and data transformations (rounding, formatting). Write `windspeed_10m` with `mph` or `km/h` explicitly — don't leave the unit unspecified.
- **Implementation patterns**: When a specific approach matters for consistency, spell it out. For example, specify whether a Promise should reject-and-catch or resolve-with-fallback. Specify timeout values. Specify whether to use `classList.remove()` or `className =`.
- **Quote style**: If the project has a convention, state it (e.g., "use double quotes throughout JS").

If you catch yourself writing a vague adjective ("red-tinted", "subtle", "clean"), replace it with the exact value. Vague descriptions are the #1 source of build divergence.

## Task Rules

- Every task must have `Assigned To` (agent display name) and `Agent Type` (builder, researcher, etc.)
- Mark `Background: true` for tasks that can run in parallel with other background tasks
- Mark `Background: false` for tasks that must complete before dependent tasks start
- Set `Depends On` accurately — parallel tasks should not depend on each other
- Every builder task must include a **Tests** field listing the test file paths and test cases it must produce. Use "N/A" only for tasks with zero testable code (research, docs, config-only).
- Every builder task must include a `**Files**` field listing exactly which files it creates or modifies, prefixed with `creates:` or `modifies:`. Review, research, and validation tasks may omit this field.
- Each builder task should produce 1-3 files and ~100-300 lines of code. If a task would be larger, split it into smaller tasks with clear file boundaries.
- For background builder tasks (`Background: true`), verify that their `**Files**` fields do not overlap. Tasks with overlapping files must not both be `Background: true`.
- Research tasks go first, then architecture, then building, then testing, then validation
- **After every builder task that writes code, add a review task** assigned to the reviewer agent. The review task depends on the builder task it reviews.
- **Add tester tasks when appropriate** — do NOT add them by default for every builder task (builders already do TDD). Add a tester task when: (a) multiple builder tasks produce components that must integrate — the tester writes integration tests after both complete; (b) the project handles user input, auth, or has security-sensitive APIs — the tester writes adversarial/boundary tests; (c) acceptance criteria span the full stack — the tester writes E2E tests after all builders finish. Tester tasks depend on the builder task(s) they test and should run before or alongside the final review.
- The second-to-last task MUST be a final code review (reviewer) that depends on all builder tasks
- The final task should always be assigned to the validator agent, depending on the final review

## Review Policy Defaults

Use these defaults unless the brainstorming conversation specified otherwise:
- **Review After**: each task
- **Fix Loop Trigger**: Critical and Important
- **Max Retries**: 3
- **Skip Review For**: researcher, validator

## Team Members Format

List only the agents actually assigned to tasks:

```
- <Display Name>
  - **Role**: <specific focus in this plan>
  - **Agent Type**: <builder | researcher | reviewer | validator | architect | tester>
```

## Git

After saving the spec file, commit it:
```
git add specs/<spec-file>.md
git commit -m "spec: <short description of what the spec covers>"
```

## Report

After saving and committing the spec, output:

```
Spec written (delegated mode)

File: specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>.md
Tasks: <number of tasks>
Complexity: <simple | medium | complex>
Team: <list of agent names and roles>

Execute with: /dream-team:build specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>.md
```
