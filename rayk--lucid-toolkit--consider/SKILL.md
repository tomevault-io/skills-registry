<information_requirements>

<model_information_needs>
| Model | Local Sources | Web Research | User Clarification |
|-------|--------------|--------------|-------------------|
| 5-Whys | Logs, history, docs | Rarely needed | Root symptoms, timeline |
| 10-10-10 | Past decisions | Rarely needed | Values, priorities |
| Eisenhower | Task lists, deadlines | Rarely needed | Urgency criteria |
| First Principles | Technical docs | Industry fundamentals | Core assumptions |

</model_information_needs>

<information_source_decision>
**Before executing any model, classify each information need:**

| Need Type | Source | Tool/Method |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Historical context | Local | Read (logs, docs, git history) |
| Codebase patterns | Local | Task(Explore) with constraints |
| Current metrics | Local | Read analytics, logs |
| Market data | Web | Task + WebSearch |
| Competitor info | Web | Task + WebSearch |
| Industry benchmarks | Web | Task + WebSearch |
| User preferences | User | AskUserQuestion |
| Success criteria | User | AskUserQuestion |
| Constraints/limits | User | AskUserQuestion |
| Technical specs | Local/User | Read docs OR AskUserQuestion |
</information_source_decision>

</information_requirements>

<research_coordination>

When information gathering is needed, use Task tool with structured prompts for token efficiency.

<local_context_gathering>
**For codebase/local file analysis:**

```
@type: AnalyzeAction
about: "[specific question about codebase/docs]"

@return Answer:
- text: string (direct answer, max 200 chars)
- evidence: string[] (file:line references, max 5)
- confidence: string (high|medium|low)

@constraints:
  maxTokens: 2000
  format: JSON object

Return ONLY the specified structure. No preamble or explanations.
```

Use `subagent_type: Explore` with thoroughness based on scope:
- Single file/function: `quick`
- Module/feature: `medium`
- Cross-cutting concern: `thorough`
</local_context_gathering>

<web_research_gathering>
**For market/competitor/industry research:**

```
@type: AnalyzeAction
query: "[specific research query]"

@return ItemList (max 5 items):
- position: integer
- name: string (source name)
- url: string (if available)
- summary: string (max 150 chars, key finding)
- relevance: string (high|medium|low)

@constraints:
  maxTokens: 3000
  format: markdown table

Return ONLY the specified structure. No commentary.
```

Use WebSearch or WebFetch for:
- Current market conditions
- Competitor analysis
- Industry benchmarks
- Recent trends or news
</web_research_gathering>

<parallel_gathering>
**When multiple independent information needs exist:**

Invoke multiple Task calls in a single message:
- Codebase analysis (Task/Explore)
- Web research (Task with WebSearch)
- These run in parallel, reducing latency

**Example parallel invocation:**
```
Task 1: Explore codebase for error handling patterns
Task 2: WebSearch for "industry error handling best practices 2024"
```

Both return focused, structured responses within token budgets.
</parallel_gathering>

</research_coordination>

<combination_patterns>

<serial_chains>
Use when output of one model feeds the next:

**Diagnostic Chain**: 5-Whys → First Principles → Inversion
(find root → verify assumptions → prevent recurrence)

**Decision Chain**: Opportunity Cost → Second-Order → 10-10-10
(what you give up → consequences → time horizons)

**Priority Chain**: Pareto → One Thing → Via Negativa
(vital few → single leverage → remove rest)

**Strategic Chain**: SWOT → Inversion → Second-Order
(position → failure modes → consequences)
</serial_chains>

<parallel_triangulation>
Use multiple lenses simultaneously for validation:

**High-stakes decision**: 10-10-10 + Inversion + Second-Order
**Strategic pivot**: SWOT + First Principles + Opportunity Cost
**Simplification**: Via Negativa + Pareto + One Thing
</parallel_triangulation>

</combination_patterns>

<memory_recall>

**At analysis start, if MCP memory tools are available:**

<step_0_recall>
**Recall Past Context**

Use `mcp__memory__search_nodes` to find relevant prior analyses:

```
search_nodes("{key problem terms}")
```

**Look for:**
- Similar Problem entities (entityType: "Problem")
- Related RootCause entities (entityType: "RootCause")
- Applicable Insight entities (entityType: "Insight")

**If matches found, use `mcp__memory__open_nodes` to get details:**

```
open_nodes(["problem-similar-issue", "insight-relevant-finding"])
```

**Present to user:**
```
## Prior Context (from memory)

**Similar problems analyzed:**
- [problem name]: [key observations]

**Relevant insights:**
- [insight]: [content, outcome]

**Recurring root causes in this area:**
- [root cause]: [occurrence count]
```

**Use prior context to:**
- Suggest models that worked well before
- Highlight root causes that recur
- Avoid repeating failed approaches
- Build on validated insights

**Skip memory recall if:**
- MCP memory tools not available
- User requests fresh analysis
- No relevant matches found
</step_0_recall>

</memory_recall>

<process>

<step_1_analyze>
**Analyze Problem**
- Read problem statement
- Detect signal words (see problem_types table)
- Classify: type, temporal focus, complexity, emotional loading, information state
</step_1_analyze>

<step_2_confirm>
**Confirm Classification**
- Use AskUserQuestion to verify:
  - Problem type classification
  - Focus area within type
  - Any constraints or preferences
- Refine classification based on response
</step_2_confirm>

<step_3_assess_information>
**Assess Information Needs**
For selected model(s), determine:

1. **Available locally?**
   - Conversation history
   - Codebase/project files
   - User-provided documents

2. **Requires web research?**
   - Market/competitor data
   - Industry benchmarks
   - Current trends

3. **Must ask user?**
   - Personal values/priorities
   - Constraints not documented
   - Success criteria
</step_3_assess_information>

<step_4_gather>
**Gather Information**

Execute information gathering based on assessment:

- **Local**: Use Read or Task(Explore) with token constraints
- **Web**: Use Task with WebSearch, structured return format
- **User**: Use AskUserQuestion with specific, focused questions

**Parallel execution**: If needs are independent, invoke multiple Task calls in single message.

**Token budget guidance**:
- Simple lookup: 1000-2000 tokens
- Moderate analysis: 2000-3000 tokens
- Complex research: 3000-5000 tokens
</step_4_gather>

<step_5_execute>
**Execute Model(s)**

With gathered context:
1. Load full model template from `references/[model-name].md`
2. Apply model systematically using template structure
3. For serial chains: complete each model before starting next
4. For parallel triangulation: apply all models, then compare
</step_5_execute>

<step_6_synthesize>
**Synthesize Insights**

Deliver:
- **Key Insight**: Single most important finding (1-2 sentences)
- **Recommended Action**: Specific next step
- **Confidence Level**: High/Medium/Low with reasoning
- **Information Gaps**: What couldn't be determined (if any)
</step_6_synthesize>

</process>

<validation>

**Before proceeding to execution, verify:**

- [ ] Problem type confirmed with user
- [ ] Model selection appropriate for type + focus
- [ ] Information needs classified (local/web/user)
- [ ] Required information gathered with structured responses
- [ ] Token budgets respected in subagent calls
- [ ] No open-ended research (all queries focused)

**Red flags requiring user clarification:**
- Problem fits multiple types equally
- Critical information unavailable
- High emotional loading detected
- Conflicting constraints identified

</validation>

<success_criteria>

Analysis is successful when:
- Problem correctly classified and confirmed
- Required information gathered efficiently (minimal tokens)
- Model(s) applied with full rigor using templates
- Insight is specific and actionable
- Confidence level justified
- User can take immediate action on recommendation

</success_criteria>

<output_format>

## Classification Output Format

For the problem classification section (step 1), use TOON structured format:

```toon
@type: AnalyzeAction
name: problem-classification
object: [problem statement text]
actionStatus: CompletedActionStatus

classification:
primaryType: [DIAGNOSIS|DECISION|PRIORITIZATION|INNOVATION|RISK|FOCUS|OPTIMIZATION|STRATEGY]
temporalFocus: [PAST|PRESENT|FUTURE]
complexity: [SIMPLE|COMPLICATED|COMPLEX]
emotionalLoading: [HIGH|LOW]

signals[N]: [key,signal,words]
```

**Note:** Keep all reasoning, framework selection, model execution, and synthesis as markdown prose. Only use TOON for the structured classification output at the beginning of the analysis.

</output_format>
