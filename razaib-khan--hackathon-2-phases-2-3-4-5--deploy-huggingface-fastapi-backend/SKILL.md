# Deploy FastAPI Backend to Hugging Face Spaces

This Skill teaches how to configure, package, and deploy a FastAPI backend using:

- FastAPI framework
- SQLAlchemy models connected to a Neon PostgreSQL database
- Uvicorn as the ASGI server
- MCP SDK Python
- Docker for deployment on Hugging Face Spaces

## Instructions

1. **Set up the repository.**
   Ensure the root contains:
   - `Dockerfile`
   - `requirements.txt`
   - FastAPI code (application folder)
   - database and MCP initialization files

2. **Define environment variables.**
   Store secrets (e.g., `DATABASE_URL`, `MCP_SDK_KEY`) in Hugging Face Spaces Secrets.

3. **Use the Dockerfile template.**
   See [dockerfile-template.txt](scripts/dockerfile-template.txt) for a working example.

4. **Configure SQLAlchemy for Neon.**
   Use SSL and correct connection pooling patterns.

5. **Expose Uvicorn on port 7860.**
   Required by Hugging Face Spaces for deployment.

6. **Test locally in Docker.**
   Validate build and exposed endpoints.

7. **Push and deploy the Space.**
   Hugging Face will auto-build and serve the FastAPI app.
