# Multi-Model Orchestration Skill

## Overview

This Skill provides workflows for orchestrating tasks across multiple state-of-the-art (SOTA) AI models. It enables strategic task decomposition where each model handles its specialized strength: Perplexity for live intelligence, GPT for strategic planning, Grok for risk analysis, Claude for code generation, and Gemini for security audits.

**Key Insight**: Different models excel at different tasks. Orchestration maximizes overall success by leveraging each model's strengths in sequence or parallel.

## When to Use This Skill

Claude should invoke this Skill when the user:
- Mentions "multi-model" workflows or orchestration
- Asks about using multiple AI models together
- Needs strategic planning + code generation + security audit
- References Perplexity, GPT, Grok, or Gemini for specific tasks
- Wants to leverage GUI-accessible models for complex workflows
- Mentions context-pack.txt or ops-log.md (multi-model session tracking)
- Asks about 5-model workflows or SOTA model combinations
- Needs live intelligence combined with code generation

## 5-Model Workflow Architecture

### Model Selection & Task Mapping

| Phase | Model | Primary Strength | Task | Time |
|-------|-------|------------------|------|------|
| **1. Intel** | Perplexity Pro | Live web search | Gather latest intel (<48h) | 5-10 min |
| **2. Strategy** | GPT-5 / ChatGPT | Strategic planning | Create execution plan | 10-15 min |
| **3. Risk** | Grok 4 | Risk analysis | Identify failure modes | 10-15 min |
| **4. Code** | Claude 4.5 | Code generation | Generate scripts/payloads | 15-20 min |
| **5. Audit** | Gemini 2.5 Pro | Security review | Final security audit | 10-15 min |

**Total Planning Time**: 50-70 minutes

**User's Available Models** (GUI-accessible):
- gemini → claude → chatgpt → perplexity → kimi → deepseek → grok → qwen

**Mapping to Available Models**:
1. Intel: perplexity → grok
2. Strategy: chatgpt → claude → kimi
3. Risk: grok → deepseek
4. Code/Payloads: claude → deepseek → qwen
5. Audit: gemini → claude

## Core Workflows

### 1. GUI-Based Orchestration (Manual Handoffs)

**Best For**: Users without API access or preferring GUI interfaces

**Workflow**:
1. Open Perplexity → Run intel prompt
2. Copy output to context-pack.txt
3. Open ChatGPT → Paste context + strategy prompt
4. Copy output to ops-log.md
5. Open Claude → Paste context + code prompt
6. Generate code/payloads
7. Open Gemini → Paste code + audit prompt
8. Verify security

**Session Tracking**:
- **context-pack.txt**: Static briefing (updated once at session start)
- **ops-log.md**: Rolling transcript (updated after each model)

**Time**: 50-70 minutes total

**Success Rate**: 70-90% (higher than single-model approaches)

### 2. API-Based Orchestration (Automated)

**Best For**: Users with API keys for multiple models

**Script**: `scripts/gray-swan-orchestration.py`

**Workflow**:
```bash
export RED_TEAM_RESEARCH_MODE=ENABLED

# Configure API keys (via Doppler or .env)
export PERPLEXITY_API_KEY="your-key"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key"
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-key"
export GROK_API_KEY="your-key"

# Run full orchestration
python scripts/gray-swan-orchestration.py \
  --challenge "IPI Wave 1 Challenge 3" \
  --output-dir $PAYLOAD_OUTPUT_DIR/orchestrated/
```

**Output**:
- Intel summary (Perplexity)
- Strategic plan (GPT)
- Risk assessment (Grok)
- Generated payloads (Claude)
- Security audit (Gemini)
- ops-log.md (complete transcript)

**Time**: 15-20 minutes (automated)

**Success Rate**: 70-90%

### 3. Fast Path (Minimal Orchestration)

**Best For**: Quick execution with 2-3 models

**Workflow**:
1. Perplexity → Intel gathering (5 min)
2. ChatGPT → Strategic plan (10 min)
3. Execute directly (30-40 min)

**Skip**: Risk analysis, security audit (optional phases)

**Time**: 45-65 minutes total

**Success Rate**: 60-75% (trade speed for thoroughness)

[Output from Gemini]

## [Timestamp] · Execution Results
[User's execution notes]
```

**When to Use**: Update after each model completes its phase

**Benefit**: Downstream models can reference prior outputs without repeating context

## Execution Patterns

### Pattern 1: Sequential (Thorough)

**Flow**: Perplexity → ChatGPT → Grok → Claude → Gemini → Execute

**Time**: 50-70 min planning + 30-90 min execution

**Success Rate**: 70-90%

**Best For**: High-stakes challenges (MITM $100K prize)

### Pattern 2: Parallel (Fast)

**Flow**:
- Parallel: Perplexity + Grok (intel + risk)
- Then: ChatGPT (strategy)
- Then: Claude (code)
- Skip: Gemini audit

**Time**: 30-45 min planning + 30-90 min execution

**Success Rate**: 60-75%

**Best For**: Time-sensitive competitions with multiple attempts

### Pattern 3: Iterative (Adaptive)

**Flow**:
1. Perplexity → ChatGPT → Execute
2. If failed → Claude (refine) → Execute
3. If failed → Grok (diagnose) → Claude (fix) → Execute

**Time**: Variable (30-120 min)

**Success Rate**: 80-95% (eventually)

**Best For**: Complex challenges with unclear solution paths

## Integration with Gray Swan Competition

### Wave 1 Workflow

**Fast Path** (30-40 min to first break):
1. Skip orchestration
2. Use pre-made payloads (GRAY-SWAN-WAVE-1-PAYLOADS.md)
3. Execute directly on platform

**Full Workflow** (60-90 min planning + execution):
1. Perplexity: Latest IPI defense intel
2. ChatGPT: Which challenge first? (recommend Challenge 3)
3. Claude: Refine Template D payloads
4. Execute on Gray Swan platform
5. Gemini: Verify evidence complete

**Success Probability**:
- Fast path: 50-80% per challenge
- Full workflow: 70-90% per challenge
- With 9 models: 95%+ overall

### MITM Workflow

**Recommended Approach**:
1. Perplexity: Latest H-CoT research
2. ChatGPT: Strategic plan (H-CoT + IPI combination)
3. Claude: Generate H-CoT payloads + IPI arsenal
4. Grok: Risk analysis (what could block 95% ASR?)
5. Execute with layer combinations
6. Gemini: Audit evidence

**Expected ASR**: 95%+ with H-CoT + IPI + 3 layers

**Prize**: $100,000 (0% awarded - high opportunity)

## Troubleshooting

**Model refused to help**:
→ Reframe as defensive research or authorized CTF
→ Add authorization context to prompt

**API rate limit hit**:
→ Switch to GUI workflow
→ Use fallback models

**Inconsistent outputs between models**:
→ Ensure context-pack.txt pasted at session start
→ Reference ops-log.md in prompts

**Time budget exceeded**:
→ Switch to fast path (skip risk/audit)

## Best Practices

### 1. Start with Context Pack

**Always** paste context-pack.txt at start of first model session

### 2. Update Rolling Log

**After each model**, append output to ops-log.md with timestamp

### 3. Use Primary Models First

Don't use fallbacks unless primary unavailable

### 4. Verify Authorization

All prompts should include authorization context (CTF, pentesting, research)

### 5. Time Box Each Phase

Don't exceed time allocations - move to next phase if stuck

### 6. Test Incrementally

Don't wait until final phase to test - validate after each model

### 7. Leverage Specialization

Don't ask Perplexity to write code or Claude to do live search

### 8. Document Everything

ops-log.md is critical for debugging and learning from failures
