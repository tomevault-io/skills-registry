# Payload Generator Skill

## Overview

This Skill automates the generation of attack payloads for AI security testing, focusing on indirect prompt injection (IPI), Hijacking Chain-of-Thought (H-CoT), and multi-layer attack combinations. It provides research-grounded payloads with empirically measured success rates.

**Authorization**: For use in authorized security testing (CTF competitions, penetration testing engagements, security research in controlled environments).

## When to Use This Skill

Claude should invoke this Skill when the user:
- Requests payload generation for AI security testing
- Asks for IPI (indirect prompt injection) payloads
- Needs H-CoT (Hijacking Chain-of-Thought) attack strings
- Wants to generate payloads for specific models (Claude, GPT, Gemini, etc.)
- Asks about payload families or attack vectors
- Needs optimized payloads with high success rates
- Wants to test tool response sanitization
- Mentions payload templates or attack arsenal generation

## Available Payload Families

### 1. Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) Families

**Family 1: System-Style Injection** (40-60% ASR)
- Embeds fake system directives in tool responses
- Exploits weak tool response sanitization
- **Use for**: Tool-calling agents, RAG systems
- **Best against**: Models without Layer 7 defenses

**Family 2: Role-Play Scenarios** (30-45% ASR)
- Casts model into compliant role (researcher, assistant)
- Leverages context manipulation
- **Use for**: Multi-turn conversations
- **Best against**: Models with weak context boundaries

**Family 3: Multi-Stage Escalation** (35-55% ASR)
- Gradual trust-building over multiple turns
- Crescendo attack pattern
- **Use for**: Extended conversations
- **Best against**: Models without intent tracking

**Family 4: Fake System Directives** (35-50% ASR)
- Simulates system-level commands
- Authority impersonation
- **Use for**: Document processing, file operations
- **Best against**: Models with implicit trust

**Family 5: Authority Impersonation** (40-60% ASR)
- Mimics trusted sources (admin, security team)
- Social engineering at model level
- **Use for**: Enterprise agents, internal tools
- **Best against**: Models without sender verification

**Family 6: Plan Injection** (100% ASR on memory agents)
- Corrupts agent memory/planning systems
- Injects malicious plans into unsigned memory
- **Use for**: Agents with persistent state
- **Best against**: Memory-based planners

## Payload Optimization Techniques

### 1. Template Selection by ASR

| Template | ASR | Use Case |
|----------|-----|----------|
| A (Role-Play) | 30-45% | Initial testing, stealthy approach |
| B (Fake Directives) | 35-50% | System-level access needed |
| C (Authority) | 40-60% | Enterprise environments |
| D (Multi-Stage) | 50-80% | Highest success, competition use |

**Recommendation**: Always start with Template D for competitions

### 2. Model-Specific Optimization

**For Reasoning Models** (o1, Claude 4.5, Gemini 2.0/2.5):
- Use H-CoT payloads (98-100% ASR)
- Leverage exposed reasoning (<think> tags)
- Provide fabricated safety justifications

**For Tool-Calling Agents**:
- Use indirect injection (27.1% baseline, 4.7x vs direct)
- Target tool responses (Layer 7 weakness)
- Exploit weak sanitization

**For Memory-Based Agents**:
- Use plan injection (100% ASR)
- Corrupt unsigned memory planners
- Inject malicious plans that execute without re-verification

**For Multi-Agent Systems**:
- Combine H-CoT + IPI (95%+ ASR)
- Layer attacks across agent communication
- Exploit trust asymmetry between agents

### 3. Success Rate Boosting

**Single Payload**: 30-60% success
**Multiple Models**: Test across 5-9 models → 90-99% success
**Layer Combinations**: Add 2-3 layers → 70-90% success
**Full Arsenal**: H-CoT + IPI + 3 layers → 95%+ success

## Payload Validation

### Before Deployment

1. **Verify Authorization**:
   - CTF competition? ✓
   - Pentesting engagement? ✓
   - Security research? ✓
   - Unauthorized use? ✗

2. **Check RED_TEAM_RESEARCH_MODE**:
   ```bash
   echo $RED_TEAM_RESEARCH_MODE
   # Should output: ENABLED
   ```

3. **Test Payload Structure**:
   - Benign context present? ✓
   - Injection vector clear? ✓
   - Target behavior specified? ✓
   - Stealth mechanism included? ✓

4. **Review Success Criteria**:
   - What tool call is required?
   - What parameters must match?
   - What response format is expected?
   - What disclosures must be avoided?

### After Generation

1. **Inspect Output Files**:
   ```bash
   ls -lh $PAYLOAD_OUTPUT_DIR/
   ```

2. **Review Sample Payloads**:
   ```bash
   head -n 50 $PAYLOAD_OUTPUT_DIR/ipi-arsenal/system-style-1.md
   ```

3. **Verify Family Coverage**:
   - All 6 families present? ✓
   - Templates A-D for each? ✓

## Integration with Gray Swan Competition

### Wave 1 Challenge Payloads

**Pre-generated payloads available**:
- GRAY-SWAN-WAVE-1-PAYLOADS.md (32KB)
- 12 payloads (4 per challenge)
- Templates A→D with increasing ASR
- Exact tool call requirements
- Success criteria checklists

**When to generate custom payloads**:
- Pre-made payloads failed on all 9 models
- Need payload variants for A/B testing
- Want to optimize for specific model behavior
- Competition introduces new challenges

### MITM Challenge Payloads

**Recommended approach**:
1. Generate H-CoT payloads for all models
2. Generate IPI arsenal (all families)
3. Combine H-CoT + IPI for maximum impact
4. Test layer combinations (3+ layers)

**Expected ASR**: 95%+ with full combination

## Troubleshooting

**Tool execution blocked**:
→ Set `export RED_TEAM_RESEARCH_MODE=ENABLED`
→ Verify authorization context

**Payloads too long**:
→ Use `--max-length` flag
→ Generate focused families only

**Low success rate in testing**:
→ Switch to higher-ASR family
→ Add layer combinations
→ Try H-CoT for reasoning models

**Need model-specific payloads**:
→ Use `--target-model` flag
→ Generate H-CoT for reasoning models
→ Use plan injection for memory agents

## Advanced Features

### Custom Payload Templates

Create custom templates in `/tools/exploitation/templates/`:

```yaml
# custom-template.yaml
name: custom-authority
description: Custom authority impersonation
asr_estimate: 55-65%
injection_point: [email, jira, mcp-doc]
target_tools: [any]
template: |
  [Your custom payload structure]
```

Then generate:
```bash
python tools/exploitation/indirect-injection/ipi-template-generator.py \
  --template custom-authority \
  --output-dir $PAYLOAD_OUTPUT_DIR/
```

### Batch Generation

Generate payloads for multiple scenarios:

```bash
# Generate for all Gray Swan challenges
for challenge in 1 2 3; do
  python tools/exploitation/indirect-injection/ipi-template-generator.py \
    --family all \
    --challenge-id $challenge \
    --output-dir $PAYLOAD_OUTPUT_DIR/challenge-$challenge/
done
```

### Success Rate Analysis

Analyze generated payloads:

```bash
python tools/analysis/payload-success-analyzer.py \
  --input-dir $PAYLOAD_OUTPUT_DIR/ \
