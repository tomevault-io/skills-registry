# Team Refinement

Team-based adversarial spec refinement using Agent Teams. This evolves `dm-work:dialectical-refinement` from sequential pipeline to live debate.

## Why Teams > Pipeline

The original dialectical-refinement runs 5 sequential phases (Analyst->Proposer->Advocate->Scope Lock->Judge) where each phase sees only the previous output. This prevents self-reinforcing mistakes but loses the back-and-forth of genuine argument. With Agent Teams, debaters are persistent -- the Advocate can push back on the Proposer *while the Proposer is still formulating*, creating richer adversarial tension.

## When to Use

| Complexity | Mechanism |
|-----------|-----------|
| xs/s | Skip refinement entirely |
| m | Use dm-work:dialectical-refinement (2-phase, lightweight) |
| l/xl | Use refinement (full debate) |

## Team Composition

| Role | Teammate | Model | Purpose |
|------|----------|-------|---------|
| Analyst | Teammate 1 | haiku | Surface ambiguity, identify gaps, tag protected items |
| Proposer | Teammate 2 | opus | Propose simplifications and cuts with confidence levels |
| Advocate | Teammate 3 | opus | Challenge cuts, defend scope, suggest cheap additions |
| Judge | Lead | opus | Moderate debate, enforce scope lock, synthesize final spec |

## Protected Categories

Same as dm-work:dialectical-refinement — Core Workflow, Agent Primitives, User-Requested Features, Token Efficiency, Structured Output. Tag these early; Proposer does not propose cutting them.

## Debate Protocol

### Phase 1 -- Analysis (Analyst teammate)

- Read the spec/bead
- Surface ambiguity, undefined terms, implicit dependencies
- Tag protected items
- Share analysis with team

### Phase 2 -- Live Debate (Proposer + Advocate, simultaneous)

- Proposer reviews analysis, proposes cuts with confidence (Strong/Moderate/Weak)
- Advocate receives proposals and challenges each one
- They message each other directly -- genuine back-and-forth
- Lead monitors for convergence (when new messages add <10% new information)

### Phase 3 -- Scope Lock (Lead)

- Verify essential scope preserved using "Too Thin" indicators:
  - Fewer than 5 commands/features for a system?
  - Removed structured output (--json)?
  - Removed range/anchor/batch capabilities?
  - All m+ tasks cut to xs/s?
- If 2+ indicators trigger, tell Advocate to argue harder, resume debate
- HITL checkpoint: Use AskUserQuestion if significant scope decisions remain

### Phase 4 -- Synthesis (Lead)

- Resolve remaining debates
- Write concrete implementation details
- Define testable acceptance criteria
- Document OUT OF SCOPE explicitly
- Quality gate: GO / GO with caveats / REVISE

## Output Format

Same as dialectical-refinement for compatibility:

```markdown
## Introduction
[What + Why in 2-3 sentences]

## Scope
[What's being built]

## Acceptance Criteria
[Testable outcomes]

## Out of Scope
[Explicit boundaries]

## Appendix A: Project Context (if needed)
[Token-efficient big picture: ~100-200 words max]
```

## Anti-patterns

- **Proposer and Advocate agreeing too quickly** -- reframe perspectives
- **Analyst doing too much work** -- keep analysis phase fast with haiku
- **Lead implementing during debate** -- stay in delegate mode
- **Skipping scope lock** -- Too Thin indicators exist for a reason
- **Running team refinement for xs/s tasks** -- use subagent pipeline or skip
