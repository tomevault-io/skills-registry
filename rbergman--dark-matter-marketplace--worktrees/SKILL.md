# Git Worktrees

Git worktrees create isolated workspaces sharing the same repository, allowing work on multiple branches simultaneously without switching.

**Primary tool:** `bd worktree` — handles git worktree + beads integration automatically.

---

## When to Use

- Parallel subagents need filesystem isolation
- Feature work that shouldn't affect current workspace
- Separate builds/servers running simultaneously
- Before executing implementation plans

---

## Guardrails

- Do not merge a worktree branch to main without explicit user sign-off — merges affect shared codebase and may contain unreviewed work
- Do not delete a worktree without explicit user sign-off — deletion destroys uncommitted changes
- Do not close beads for a worktree branch without user sign-off
- After completing implementation, stop and report status. Do not proceed to merge.
- Use `/merge` when ready to integrate — it enforces the pre-flight checklist.

## Setup: Ensure .worktrees/ is Ignored

**Before creating any worktrees**, ensure `.worktrees/` is in `.gitignore`. This is a one-time setup that covers all future worktrees:

```bash
# Check if .worktrees/ is already ignored
git check-ignore -q .worktrees/ || echo '.worktrees/' >> .gitignore
```

If you added the line, commit it:
```bash
git add .gitignore && git commit -m "Ignore .worktrees/ directory"
```

**Why this matters:** Without this, beads adds each worktree individually to `.gitignore`, creating noise. With `.worktrees/` ignored, all worktrees underneath are automatically covered.

---

## Creating a Worktree

**All worktrees go under `.worktrees/` in the repo root.** This is the standard location.

```bash
bd worktree create .worktrees/feature-auth
```

**What it does automatically:**
1. Creates git worktree at the specified path
2. Sets up `.beads/redirect` pointing to main repo's database
3. Creates the branch (same name as the directory by default)

**With custom branch name:**
```bash
bd worktree create .worktrees/bugfix --branch fix-123
```

---

## Personal Prefs Across Worktrees

`CLAUDE.local.md` only exists in one worktree. To share personal preferences across all worktrees, use a home-directory import in each worktree's `CLAUDE.local.md`:

```markdown
# CLAUDE.local.md
@~/.claude/my-project-instructions.md
```

This way all worktrees load the same personal preferences from a single source. The `@~/...` import syntax resolves to your home directory regardless of which worktree you're in.

---

## After Creation

### 1. Enter Worktree

```bash
cd .worktrees/feature-auth
```

### 2. Run Project Setup

```bash
# Node.js
[ -f package.json ] && npm install

# Rust
[ -f Cargo.toml ] && cargo build

# Go
[ -f go.mod ] && go mod download
```

### 3. Verify Baseline

```bash
npm test  # or cargo test, go test ./...
```

**If tests fail:** Report failures, ask whether to proceed.

### 4. Verify Beads Shared

```bash
bd ready  # Should show same beads as main workspace
```

---

## Listing Worktrees

```bash
bd worktree list
```

Or standard git:
```bash
git worktree list
```

---

## Removing a Worktree

Use `bd worktree remove` — includes safety checks:

```bash
bd worktree remove feature-auth
```

**Safety checks (automatic):**
- Uncommitted changes
- Unpushed commits
- Stashes

**Skip checks (not recommended):**
```bash
bd worktree remove feature-auth --force
```

---

## Worktree Info

Check current worktree status:

```bash
bd worktree info
```

---

## Quick Reference

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Ensure .worktrees/ ignored | `git check-ignore -q .worktrees/ \|\| echo '.worktrees/' >> .gitignore` |
| Create worktree | `bd worktree create .worktrees/<name>` |
| Create with branch | `bd worktree create .worktrees/<name> --branch <branch>` |
| List worktrees | `bd worktree list` |
| Remove worktree | `bd worktree remove .worktrees/<name>` |
| Check status | `bd worktree info` |
| Verify beads sync | `bd ready` (in worktree) |

---

## Why bd worktree?

| Manual git worktree | bd worktree |
|---------------------|-------------|
| Separate commands for git + beads | Single command |
| No beads redirect setup | Automatic redirect to main DB |
| No safety checks on remove | Checks for uncommitted/unpushed |

---

## Example Workflow

```bash
# One-time: ensure .worktrees/ is ignored
git check-ignore -q .worktrees/ || echo '.worktrees/' >> .gitignore

# Create isolated workspace
bd worktree create .worktrees/feature-auth

# Enter and setup
cd .worktrees/feature-auth
npm install
npm test  # ✓ 47 passing

# Verify beads shared
bd ready  # Shows same issues as main

# Work on feature...
bd claim auth-001

# When done
cd ../..
bd worktree remove .worktrees/feature-auth
```

---

## Known Limitations

### Worktrees Share the Dolt Database

Worktrees created with `bd worktree create` share the main repo's Dolt database via `.beads/redirect`. This is the correct behavior — all worktrees see the same beads data.

If a worktree was created with `git worktree add` instead, it gets an independent empty Dolt DB. Fix by deleting the worktree's `.beads/dolt/` and creating a `.beads/redirect` file pointing to the main repo's `.beads/`.

---

## Fallback (No Beads)

If beads isn't installed, use manual git worktree:

```bash
# Verify ignored
git check-ignore -q .worktrees/ || echo '.worktrees/' >> .gitignore

# Create
git worktree add .worktrees/feature-auth -b feature-auth

# Remove
git worktree remove .worktrees/feature-auth
```

But you lose: automatic redirect setup and safety checks.
