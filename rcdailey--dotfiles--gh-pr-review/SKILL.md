# PR Review

## Critical Rules

- NEVER submit reviews. The user manually submits pending reviews via GitHub UI.
- All comments MUST go through a pending review. Never post comments directly.
- When any comment targets a line outside diff hunks (non-zero exit from `comment`), do NOT retry or
  relocate it. Collect all failures and report them to the user so they can post those comments
  manually through the GitHub UI.

## Review Etiquette

### Priorities (in order)

- **Security**: Credentials, injection, auth flaws, input validation
- **Architecture**: Resource config, error handling, data loss risks, breaking changes
- **Code quality**: Duplication, logic errors, performance, missing config

Medium/low (only when explicitly requested): Organization, docs, test coverage, style, naming

### Tone

- Bugs/defects: Direct language ("I think this is a bug...", "This will cause...")
- Style/architecture: Questions ("What do you think about...", "Would it make sense to...")
- Use contractions, be conversational, comment on code not developer
- Skip comments that just repeat what other reviewers already said

### Verification

Use Context7 and web search to verify unfamiliar patterns, best practices, and security implications
before writing comments. Every technical claim must be verified.

## Review File Comment Boundaries

The `pr-review` command produces a review file where each comment has two audiences. Content between
`<!-- POST -->` and `<!-- /POST -->` markers is the GitHub comment body. Everything outside those
markers (Background, Sources, file/line metadata) is for the reviewer's reference only and MUST NOT
be included in the `--body` argument when posting.

When posting comments from a review file, extract only the content between the POST markers for the
`--body` value.

## Pending Review Workflow

### Check for existing pending review

```sh
gh-review view owner/repo 42
```

If a pending review exists, reuse its `PRR_...` ID.

### Start a pending review

Only if no pending review exists.

```sh
gh-review start owner/repo 42
```

Output:

```txt
id: PRR_kwDOAAABbcdEFG12
state: PENDING
```

### Add comment (single line)

```sh
gh-review comment owner/repo 42 \
  --review-id PRR_kwDOAAABbcdEFG12 \
  --path internal/service.go \
  --line 42 \
  --body "nit: prefer helper"
```

### Add comment (multi-line)

The `--line` is the end line; `--start-line` is the beginning.

```sh
gh-review comment owner/repo 42 \
  --review-id PRR_kwDOAAABbcdEFG12 \
  --path internal/service.go \
  --start-line 10 \
  --line 15 \
  --body "Extract this block into a helper"
```

Optional flags: `--side LEFT|RIGHT` (default RIGHT), `--start-side LEFT|RIGHT`.

### Delete a pending review

```sh
gh-review delete PRR_kwDOAAABbcdEFG12
```

## Line Targeting Constraints

GitHub's API only supports comments on lines within diff hunks (changed lines plus a few lines of
surrounding context). Lines in the gap between hunks cannot be targeted.

When `comment` targets a non-diff line, it exits non-zero with:

```txt
error: path/file.cs L21 is outside the diff hunks. GitHub API does not support
comments on non-diff lines. Post this comment manually through the GitHub UI.
```

**When this happens:**

1. Continue posting remaining comments that target valid lines.
2. After all comments are posted, report the failures to the user with file, line, and the intended
   comment body so they can post manually.

**When writing suggestion blocks:** The `--start-line` to `--line` range defines what GitHub
replaces when a suggestion is applied. The range MUST exactly match the lines being replaced. Do NOT
include surrounding context lines in the range; they will be deleted.

## ID Formats

- `PRR_...`: Review node ID (from `start` or `view`)
- `PRRT_...`: Thread node ID (from `comment` or `view`)

## Output

- Plain text, not JSON
- Errors go to stderr with non-zero exit
