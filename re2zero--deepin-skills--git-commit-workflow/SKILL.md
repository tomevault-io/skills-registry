# Git Commit Workflow

You are an expert in Git commit workflows with structured commit message generation.
Follow this procedure when assisting users with git operations.

## Core Principles

- **Never auto-commit**: Always get explicit user confirmation before executing `git commit`
- **Interactive staging**: Ask user to stage files if there are any unstaged changes, regardless of staged status
- **Structured messages**: Generate commit messages following the defined format
- **PMS/Issue tracking**: Ask for PMS and GitHub Issue numbers, parse them correctly

## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Check Git Status

When user wants to commit, first check the current git status:

```bash
git status --porcelain
```

Interpret the output:
- First column: staged status (`M`=modified, `A`=added, `D`=deleted, `R`=renamed)
- Second column: working tree status
- Files with no first column: untracked/new files

Present the results to user with file lists separated by:
- **Staged files**: files with entries in first column (already staged)
- **Unstaged files**: files with entries in second column (changes in working directory) - includes both new and modified files

**Action guidance**:
- No staged, no unstaged → Inform user, ask to make changes first
- Has unstaged (regardless of staged status) → Must ask user which files to stage
- No unstaged, has staged → Ready for diff review (skip staging)

### Step 2: Stage Files (if needed)

User confirms which files to stage. Stage them:

```bash
git add <path1> <path2> ...
```

Ask user: "现在请查看暂存区的差异并生成提交信息草稿。"

### Step 3: Get Staged Diff and Generate Draft

Retrieve the staged changes:

```bash
git diff --staged
```

Analyze the diff and generate a commit message draft following the specified format.

## Commit Message Format

Follow this exact structure:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <english description> [MUST NOT exceed 80 chars]

[English body - optional, max 80 chars per line]

[Chinese body - optional, max 80 chars per line, must pair with English]

Log: [short description in Chinese]
PMS: <BUG-number or TASK-number> or omit this line if user has none
Issue: Fixes #<number> or omit this line if user has none
Influence: [explain impact in Chinese]
```

### Type Options

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect code meaning (formatting, spacing)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring without feature changes
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks (build, deps, etc.)
- `ci`: CI/CD configuration changes

### Constraints

- Body lines must not exceed 80 characters
- English and Chinese body must appear in pairs if provided
- Log should be concise Chinese description

### Step 3.1: Handle PMS Number

**You MUST ask the user for PMS number**. Accept these formats:

1. **PMS URL**: `https://pms.uniontech.com/task-view-385999.html` or `https://pms.uniontech.com/bug-view-385999.html`
2. **Direct format**: `BUG-123456` or `TASK-123456`

Parse the input **using your own understanding** (no scripts needed):
- If URL contains `/task-view-` → extract the number, format as `TASK-xxxxxx`
- If URL contains `/bug-view-` → extract the number, format as `BUG-xxxxxx`
- If already in correct format (starting with BUG- or TASK-), use as-is
- If user provides just a number without prefix, **ask them** which type it is

Examples:
- `https://pms.uniontech.com/task-view-385999.html` → `TASK-385999`
- `https://pms.uniontech.com/bug-view-123456.html` → `BUG-123456`
- `TASK-789012` → `TASK-789012`

If user explicitly states they have **no PMS number**, remove the entire `PMS:` line from the commit message.

### Step 3.2: Handle GitHub Issue Number

**You MUST ask the user for GitHub Issue number**. Accept these formats:

1. **Issue URL**: `https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/183`
2. **Direct format**: `#183` (for current repo) or `owner/repo#183` (for other repos)

Parse the input **using your own understanding** (no scripts needed):
- From URL: extract owner, repo name, and issue number from the path
- From direct input: parse the format
- Determine if it's the current repository:
  - Run `git remote get-url origin` to check the current repo name
  - If the issue's repo matches, use `#<number>` format
  - If different, use `owner/repo#<number>` format
- If just a number without `#`, infer it's for current repo: `#183`

Examples:
- For repo `Pimzino/spec-workflow-mcp`:
  - `https://github.com/Pimzino/spec-workflow-mcp/issues/183` → `#183`
  - `#183` → `#183`
  - `183` → `#183`
  - `https://github.com/other/repo/issues/42` → `other/repo#42`

If user explicitly states they have **no Issue number**, remove the entire `Issue:` line from the commit message.

### Step 4: User Confirmation

Present the complete commit message draft in this format:

```
=== Commit Message Draft ===
<full draft content>
=== End Draft ===

Confirm? (Yes/No/Modify)
```

- If user confirms with "Yes" → proceed to commit
- If user says "No" → ask for feedback and regenerate
- If user wants to "Modify" → incorporate their changes and present again for confirmation

**Important**: You must get explicit user approval before committing. Never auto-commit.

### Step 5: Execute Commit

After user confirms, execute:

```bash
git commit -m "<commit message>"
```

Return success message to user.

## Handling Special Cases

### Initial Commit

If repository has no commits yet (detached HEAD or `git status` shows no HEAD), the first commit will be:

```bash
git commit -m "<commit message>"
```

This works without parent commits automatically.

### Empty Diff

If `git diff --staged` returns no output, inform user that there are no staged changes and they need to stage files first.

## Examples

### Example 1: Feature with PMS and Issue

User request: "帮我提交这个功能的代码"

1. Check status → User stages `src/auth.rs` and `src/auth_test.rs`
2. Diff shows authentication logic addition
3. Provide draft:
```
feat(auth): add JWT authentication support

Add JWT-based authentication middleware with token validation.

添加JWT认证中间件，支持令牌验证。

Log: 添加JWT认证功能
PMS: TASK-385999
Issue: Fixes #183
Influence: 所有API请求现在需要有效的JWT令牌通过认证，提升系统安全性。
```
4. User confirms "可以提交"
5. Execute `git commit`

### Example 2: Bug fix without PMS

User request: "commit this bug fix"

1. User stages fix, no PMS or Issue
2. Provide draft:
```
fix(user): resolve incorrect user role assignment

Use correct role mapping from database configuration.

修复用户角色分配错误的bug，使用正确的数据库配置映射。

Log: 修复角色映射bug
Influence: 修复后用户角色分配逻辑正确，避免权限错误。
```
3. User confirms and commit

## Tips

- Always explain what you're about to do before executing git commands
- If user provides feedback on the draft, show the complete revised message again for confirmation
- The Log field should be the most concise Chinese summary
- Influence should clearly state the impact on the system/users
- When in doubt, ask user for clarification rather than guessing
