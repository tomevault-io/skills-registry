# Qt Translation Assistant Skill

## Iron Laws

1. **Never modify original TS files without backup** - Always preserve original content
2. **Validate AI translation quality** - Verify translations are accurate and contextually appropriate
3. **Maintain translation consistency** - Use consistent terminology across all translations
4. **Respect file encoding** - Preserve UTF-8 encoding and special characters
5. **Minimal changes principle** - Only modify translation content, preserve XML structure

## Red Flags

- User requests translation of non-TS files
- User asks to translate without proper AI configuration
- Requests to overwrite existing translations without verification
- Asks to translate to unsupported language codes

## Rationalization Table

| Excuse | Response |
|--------|----------|
| "Just translate everything quickly" | Quality matters in localization - proper AI configuration and validation required |
| "We don't need consistent terminology" | Inconsistent translations hurt user experience - consistency is critical |
| "Original files don't need backup" | Always preserve originals - translation errors can corrupt content |
| "Rewrite the whole file" | Only translation text should change - git diff will show other modifications |

## Quick Reference

### Core Commands
```bash
# Translate entire directory of TS files
python translate.py /path/to/ts/files/

# Translate specific file
python translate.py /path/to/file.ts

# With custom batch size and workers
python translate.py /path/to/ts/files/ --batch-size 30 --max-workers 3

# Create configuration file
python translate.py --create-config
```

### Configuration
```json
{
  "api_url": "http://localhost:8080/v1/chat/completions",
  "api_key": "sk-uos-12345",
  "model": "qwen3-coder-flash",
  "temperature": 0.3
}
```

## Common Mistakes & Fixes

### Mistake: AI provider not configured properly
**Fix**: Create `qt_translation_config.json` with valid API credentials using `--create-config`

### Mistake: Large files causing API timeouts
**Fix**: Adjust `--batch-size` parameter (try 20-50) and `--max-workers` (try 2-5)

### Mistake: Language codes not detected correctly
**Fix**: Ensure TS files follow standard naming convention (e.g., `project_zh_CN.ts`, `project_de.ts`)

### Mistake: Translation quality issues
**Fix**: Adjust model selection and temperature settings in configuration file

### Mistake: Git diff shows many unnecessary changes
**Fix**: The tool only modifies translation content - any other changes indicate a bug that needs fixing

## Architecture

This skill uses a parallel processing architecture:

- **TranslationWorker**: Handles AI API calls with automatic retry and exponential backoff
- **QtTranslationAssistant**: Main orchestrator with parallel batch processing
- **ThreadPoolExecutor**: Manages concurrent translation workers (default 3)

Performance improvements over subagent architecture:
- Direct API calls without subprocess overhead (~5-10x faster)
- Larger batch sizes (default 30 vs previous 10)
- Parallel workers (3 concurrent API calls vs sequential)
- Error isolation (single batch failure doesn't affect others)

## Key Features

- Smart parsing of TS files to identify incomplete translations
- Parallel batch processing with ThreadPoolExecutor
- Support for multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, local servers)
- Configurable batch size and worker count
- Automatic retries with exponential backoff
- Git diff-friendly modifications (only changes translation content)
