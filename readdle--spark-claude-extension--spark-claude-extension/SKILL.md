# Using Spark

The Spark MCP extension exposes the user's mailbox, calendar, contacts, meetings, and team data as tools. Use it to answer questions about their Spark data and, when the account allows it, to act on it - draft messages, post team comments, triage threads, and manage contacts.

## Access levels

Each account and shared inbox has its own **access level**, configured by the user in Spark Desktop under **Settings > AI Agents**. The `accounts` tool reports the current level for every account and shared inbox.

| Level | Allowed operations |
|-------|-------------------|
| **read-only** | List, search, and read emails, threads, folders, events, contacts, meetings, teams |
| **triage** | Everything in read-only plus all write operations: `draft`, `comment`, `action`, `contact-action` |

Shared inboxes can have a different access level than the parent account - for example, a personal account may have triage access while a shared inbox under the same team is read-only or disabled.

If a write tool is invoked against an account with insufficient access, the call returns a descriptive error explaining how to raise the level. Pass that on to the user verbatim and offer to retry once they have updated the setting, or perform the action in Spark Desktop directly.

## Calling tools

Each tool is an MCP tool exposed by the `spark` server. Examples below use the notation:

```
tool_name { "param": "value", ... }
```

Map this to your runtime's tool-call syntax - the left side is the MCP tool name, the right side is the JSON arguments object.

Always call `accounts` once at the start of any non-trivial task to discover available accounts, calendars, teams, shared inboxes, and access levels. Call `folders` before passing folder identifiers to `emails` or `search`.

## Tools

| Tool | Access | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `accounts` | read-only | List accounts, calendars, teams, shared inboxes, and access levels |
| `folders` | read-only | List folders/labels with message counts |
| `emails` | read-only | List emails with filters and pagination |
| `search` | read-only | Topic search (full bodies), or list emails by filter across all folders |
| `thread` | read-only | Read full thread - headers, bodies, attachments |
| `attachment` | read-only | Read a single email attachment by ID (auto-downloads) |
| `events` | read-only | List calendar events for a time range |
| `availability` | read-only | Find free time slots, optionally with attendees |
| `contacts` | read-only | Search contacts by name or email |
| `team` | read-only | Show team info, members, shared inboxes, assignments |
| `meetings` | read-only | List meeting transcripts |
| `meeting` | read-only | Read a single meeting transcript |
| `templates` | read-only | List saved message templates (personal and team) |
| `template` | read-only | Show a single template by ID or name with its placeholders |
| `draft` | triage | Create or edit a draft (new, reply, forward, from template); share with team |
| `comment` | triage | Post a team comment on a thread |
| `action` | triage | Perform actions on emails (archive, pin, snooze, assign, etc.) |
| `contact-action` | triage | Perform actions on contacts (block, accept, categorize, etc.) |

### accounts

List all configured accounts with their calendars, teams, and shared inboxes. Output reports each account's and shared inbox's **access level** - check this before attempting any write tool. Takes no parameters.

```
accounts {}
```

Run first to discover what is available and which accounts allow triage actions.

### folders

List folders with message counts. Output includes folder identifiers in parentheses - use those as the `folder` parameter for `emails` and as scope for `search`. Mailboxes backed by a Google account show `(Gmail labels)` on the **Email Account** or **Shared Inbox** header. Teams show the team name as a usable identifier for `emails`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `account` | string | no | Filter by email address (account or shared inbox). All accounts if omitted. |

```
folders {}
folders { "account": "user@example.com" }
```

### emails

List emails with metadata (ID, From, Date, Subject, Flags). Supports pagination and Gmail-style filters. Does **not** return bodies - use `search` or `thread` when you need content.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `folder` | string | no | Folder identifier. Unified Inbox if omitted. |
| `filter` | string | no | Gmail-style filter (see operators below). |
| `page` | integer | no | Page number, 1-based (default `1`). |
| `page_size` | integer | no | Results per page (default `50`). |
| `order` | string | no | `ascending` or `descending`. |
| `new_senders` | boolean | no | Show only new-sender emails (GateKeeper). |

```
emails {}                                                                         # Unified Inbox
emails { "folder": "user@example.com:Archive" }                                   # specific folder
emails { "folder": "My Team" }                                                    # team's shared threads
emails { "filter": "from:alice@co.com is:unread" }
emails { "filter": "newer_than:7d has:attachment" }
emails { "page": 2, "page_size": 20 }
emails { "order": "ascending" }
emails { "new_senders": true }
```

**GateKeeper:** When viewing the Inbox with GateKeeper in explicit mode, new-sender emails are filtered out and a "New Senders" count is shown at the top. Set `new_senders: true` to view them. Use `contact-action` with `acceptContact` or `blockContact` to accept or block a sender (requires triage).

**Folder identifier formats** (call `folders` to see available ones):

| Format | Example | Meaning |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Bare name | `Inbox`, `Archive` | Unified folder (cross-account) |
| Email | `user@example.com` | Account inbox shorthand |
| `email:Folder` | `user@example.com:Archive` | Specific account folder |
| Team name | `My Team` | All shared threads in a team |
| `shared@email:Folder` | `shared@co.com:Inbox` | Shared inbox folder |

**Filter operators** (combine space-separated inside the `filter` string):

| Operator | Example |
|----------|---------|
| `from:<addr>` | `from:alice@co.com` |
| `to:<addr>` | `to:bob@co.com` |
| `cc:<addr>` | `cc:team@co.com` |
| `subject:<text>` | `subject:"quarterly report"` |
| `before:yyyy/MM/dd` | `before:2026/03/01` |
| `after:yyyy/MM/dd` | `after:2026/01/01` |
| `newer_than:Xd` | `newer_than:7d` (also `w`, `m`, `y`) |
| `older_than:Xd` | `older_than:30d` |
| `has:attachment` | also `document`, `spreadsheet`, `presentation`, `reminder` |
| `is:unread` | also `read`, `starred`, `pinned`, `unreplied` |
| `is:shared` | emails shared to any team |
| `is:shared_inbox_open` | open items in shared inbox |
| `is:shared_inbox_done` | completed/closed items in shared inbox |
| `category:<name>` | `priority`, `personal`, `notification`, `newsletter`, `invitation`, `invitation_response` |
| `assigned_to:<who>` | `me`, `<email>`, `unassigned`, `other` |
| `assigned_by:me` | emails you delegated |
| `filename:<name>` | `filename:report.pdf` |

### search

Two modes, selected by whether you pass `query`:

- **Topic mode** (`query` set): hybrid keyword + semantic search returning up to 20 emails **with full bodies**, sorted by relevance. Use this when the user asks about a topic and you need content to answer.
- **List mode** (`query` omitted): a paged, compact table of every email matching `filter`/`in` across **all folders in all accounts**, newest first (same columns as `emails`). Trash, Spam, and Blocked are excluded unless `in` targets one of them. Use this to filter by metadata (especially `from:`) beyond the Unified Inbox that `emails` is limited to.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `query` | string | no | Search topic (keyword + semantic matching). Omit to switch to list mode. |
| `filter` | string | no | Gmail-style filter to narrow results (same operators as `emails`). |
| `in` | string | no | Scope: account, folder, team, or shared inbox. All folders if omitted. |
| `page` | integer | no | Page number, 1-based (default `1`). List mode only. |
| `page_size` | integer | no | Results per page (default `50`). List mode only. |
| `order` | string | no | `ascending` or `descending`. List mode only. |

```
search { "query": "quarterly report" }
search { "query": "API integration", "filter": "from:alice@co.com" }
search { "query": "budget", "in": "user@example.com:Archive" }
search { "query": "vacation", "in": "user@example.com" }
search { "filter": "from:alice@co.com" }                       # list mode: every email from alice, all folders
search { "filter": "is:unread newer_than:7d", "page": 2 }
```

Use `search` with a `query` when the user asks about content (you need bodies). Use `search` without a `query` to filter across every folder - `emails` only sees the Unified Inbox, so it can't answer "every email from alice, anywhere". Use `emails` for plain browsing of the Inbox or a single folder.

### thread

Read every message in a conversation - headers, plain-text bodies, attachment info. After the thread summary line, lists custom (non-system) folder labels once for the whole thread.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `message_id` | string | yes | Message ID from `emails`/`search`, or a Spark deep link (the `Link:` line of a previous result). |
| `download_attachments` | boolean | no | Fetch attachments that aren't yet local. |

```
thread { "message_id": "1114" }
thread { "message_id": "1114", "download_attachments": true }
```

Each message's `Attachments:` block is a table with columns `ID`, `Name`, `Size`, and `MIME Type`. The `ID` is a stable integer - pass it to the `attachment` tool to read the file's bytes (images, PDFs, text, audio). Local filesystem paths are deliberately omitted because sandboxed MCP clients can't follow them; the `attachment` tool is the only path to attachment contents through this connection.

Find IDs with `emails` or `search` first, then call `thread` to read the full conversation.

### attachment

Read a single email attachment by its ID and receive the file content directly through MCP - the server reads the bytes off disk and returns them as image, audio, text, or embedded-resource (binary blob) content blocks depending on the MIME type. Auto-downloads the file via IMAP if it isn't cached locally yet, so this works even for attachments whose `thread` row showed `(not downloaded, ...)`.

This is the sandbox-friendly way to read attachments: clients never need to touch the local filesystem path printed in the `thread` output.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | integer | yes | Attachment ID from the `thread` Attachments table. |

```
attachment { "id": 42 }
```

Returns a leading text block summarizing the attachment (name, size, MIME type, message ID), followed by the file content as one of:

- **Image** (`image/*`) - inline `image` content block, ready for vision.
- **Audio** (`audio/*`) - inline `audio` content block.
- **Text** (`text/*`, plus JSON/XML/NDJSON) - inline `text` content block with the file's UTF-8 contents.
- **Anything else** (PDF, ZIP, Office documents, etc.) - embedded `resource` content block with a base64 `blob` and the original MIME type.

Files larger than the configured cap (default 50 MB; override with the `SPARK_ATTACHMENT_MAX_BYTES` env var on the MCP server) are rejected with a clear error - ask the user to open the attachment in Spark Desktop instead.

Typical flow:

1. `thread { "message_id": "<id>" }` - find the attachment's ID in the `Attachments:` table.
2. `attachment { "id": <attachment-id> }` - read its bytes.

### events

List calendar events for a time range. Defaults to today's remaining events.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `today` | boolean | no | From now until end of today. |
| `tomorrow` | boolean | no | Tomorrow, full day. |
| `week` | boolean | no | From now until end of this week. |
| `start` | string | no | Start date (`yyyy-MM-dd` or `yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm`). |
| `end` | string | no | End date (same formats). |
| `in` | string | no | Calendar account (`user@example.com`) or specific calendar (`user@example.com:Work`). |

```
events {}
events { "tomorrow": true }
events { "week": true }
events { "week": true, "in": "user@example.com" }
events { "week": true, "in": "user@example.com:Work" }
events { "start": "2026-03-16", "end": "2026-03-20" }
```

Call `accounts` to see available calendar accounts and calendar names.

### availability

Find free time slots. Without `attendees`, shows the user's own availability. With `attendees`, computes mutual free windows. Working hours are 08:00-20:00, weekends skipped, events marked "free" are ignored.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `today` | boolean | no | From now until end of today. |
| `tomorrow` | boolean | no | Tomorrow, full day. |
| `week` | boolean | no | From now until end of this week. |
| `start` | string | no | Start date (`yyyy-MM-dd` or `yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm`). |
| `end` | string | no | End date (same formats). |
| `attendees` | string | no | Comma-separated email addresses. |

```
availability {}
availability { "tomorrow": true }
availability { "week": true, "attendees": "alice@co.com" }
availability { "start": "2026-03-16", "end": "2026-03-20", "attendees": "a@co.com,b@co.com" }
```

### contacts

Search contacts by name or email. Strict match first, then fuzzy fallback.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `query` | string | yes | Name or email to search for. |

```
contacts { "query": "john" }
contacts { "query": "example.com" }
```

### team

Show team info - metadata, shared inboxes with members, full member list, assigned emails, and assignment summary. Call without `name` to list available teams.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | string | no | Team name (or partial match). Lists all teams if omitted. |

```
team {}
team { "name": "My Team" }
```

### meetings

List meeting transcripts, newest first. Supports filtering and pagination.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `filter` | string | no | Filter expression (operators below). |
| `page` | integer | no | Page number, 1-based. |
| `page_size` | integer | no | Results per page (default `50`). |

```
meetings {}
meetings { "filter": "newer_than:30d" }
meetings { "filter": "subject:standup", "page_size": 10 }
```

Filter operators for `meetings`: `subject:<text>`, `before:yyyy/MM/dd`, `after:yyyy/MM/dd`, `newer_than:Xd`, `older_than:Xd`.

### meeting

Read a single meeting transcript's summary. Optionally include the full transcript and/or user notes.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `meeting_id` | string | yes | Meeting ID (from `meetings`) or a Spark deep link. |
| `transcript` | boolean | no | Include the full transcript text. |
| `notes` | boolean | no | Include user notes. |

```
meeting { "meeting_id": "42" }
meeting { "meeting_id": "42", "transcript": true }
meeting { "meeting_id": "42", "notes": true }
meeting { "meeting_id": "42", "transcript": true, "notes": true }
```

### templates

List saved Spark message templates - the drafts you can apply via `draft`'s `template` parameter. Personal and team templates both appear; they round-trip from Spark Desktop.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `personal` | boolean | no | Show only personal templates. |
| `team` | string | no | Show only the named team's templates. |
| `page` | integer | no | Page number, 1-based (default `1`). |
| `page_size` | integer | no | Results per page (default `50`). |

```
templates {}
templates { "personal": true }
templates { "team": "Marketing" }
templates { "page": 2, "page_size": 20 }
```

Output columns: `ID`, `Scope` (Personal or team name), `Name`, `Subject`, `Modified`. Use the `ID` or `Name` with the `template` tool and with `draft`'s `template` parameter.

### template

Show a single template's full contents and its placeholder requirements. Run this before `draft { "template": ... }` so you know which placeholders to fill.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `ref` | string | yes | Template ID (numeric) or name (case-insensitive). |

```
template { "ref": "123" }
template { "ref": "Welcome reply" }
```

Output includes scope, recipients, subject, body (HTML stripped to text), attachments, and a `Placeholders:` section listing every placeholder:

- `[auto]` - auto-fillable (recipient/self name), resolved from `to`/`account` when applied. **Not** overridable via `placeholder`.
- `[manual]` - free-form; **must** be passed as `placeholder: ["<name>=<value>"]` to `draft`.

If a name matches more than one template, the call errors with the matching IDs - disambiguate by ID.

### draft

**Requires triage access.**

Create a new email draft or edit an existing one. The body is markdown and is converted to HTML. Seed a draft from an existing message with `reply_to` or `forward`, update an existing draft with `edit`, apply a saved template with `template`, and collaborate with teammates with the sharing parameters.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `to` | array of string | no | Recipient addresses. |
| `cc` | array of string | no | CC addresses. |
| `bcc` | array of string | no | BCC addresses. |
| `subject` | string | no | Subject line. |
| `body` | string | no (yes for new) | Body content in markdown. Required for a new draft unless a template supplies one. |
| `account` | string | no | Account email to send from. Personal accounts, aliases, and shared-inbox emails are all valid - any account that has triage access. |
| `edit` | string | no | Message ID (or Spark deep link) of an existing draft to update. |
| `reply_to` | string | no | Message ID (or deep link) to reply to. |
| `forward` | string | no | Message ID (or deep link) to forward. |
| `attach` | array of string | no | Absolute paths to files to attach. |
| `template` | string | no | Apply a saved template by ID or name. Combine with `edit` to overlay it onto an existing draft. |
| `placeholder` | array of string | no | Fill manual template placeholders, each `"<name>=<value>"`. Auto placeholders (recipient/self name) resolve from `to`/`account` and are not addressable here. |
| `team` | string | no | Team to share the draft with. Required when you belong to multiple teams; on an already-shared draft, must match the owning team. |
| `user` | array of string | no | Teammate emails to share with. On an already-shared draft this **adds** collaborators - use `remove_user` to remove. |
| `remove_user` | array of string | no | Teammate emails to **remove** from a shared draft, preserving the share, its comments, and remaining collaborators. Requires `edit` of a shared draft. Cannot remove yourself - use `unshare`. |
| `allow_send` | boolean | no | Let teammates send the shared draft on your behalf. New share defaults to off; on edit, omit to leave the current value unchanged. |
| `disallow_send` | boolean | no | Revoke teammates' send-on-behalf permission. (This is the parameter for the `--no-allow-send` flag - note the name.) |
| `unshare` | boolean | no | Revert a shared draft back to a personal draft. Requires `edit`; cannot be combined with sharing params or content edits. |

```
draft { "to": ["alice@example.com"], "subject": "Hello", "body": "Hi Alice, ..." }
draft { "to": ["alice@co.com", "bob@co.com"], "cc": ["carol@co.com"], "subject": "Meeting", "body": "..." }
draft { "edit": "1234", "subject": "Updated subject", "body": "Updated body" }
draft { "reply_to": "5678", "body": "Thanks for the update!" }
draft { "forward": "5678", "to": ["manager@co.com"], "body": "FYI" }
draft { "account": "john@gmail.com", "to": ["alice@co.com"], "subject": "Hi", "body": "..." }
draft { "to": ["alice@co.com"], "subject": "Report", "body": "See attached", "attach": ["/path/to/report.pdf"] }
draft { "to": ["alice@co.com"], "subject": "Files", "body": "Two files", "attach": ["/path/to/a.pdf", "/path/to/b.xlsx"] }
```

Apply a saved template (run `template` first to learn its manual placeholders):

```
draft { "template": "Cold outbound v3", "to": ["alice@co.com"], "placeholder": ["Project name=Acme Q3", "Deadline=Friday EOD"] }
draft { "template": "124", "edit": "9821", "placeholder": ["Project name=Acme Q3"] }
```

Share a draft and manage collaborators:

```
draft { "to": ["client@co.com"], "subject": "Proposal", "body": "...", "team": "Engineering", "user": ["alice@co.com", "bob@co.com"] }
draft { "edit": "1234", "team": "Engineering", "user": ["carol@co.com"], "allow_send": true }
draft { "edit": "1234", "remove_user": ["alice@co.com"], "user": ["dave@co.com"] }   # swap collaborators in one call
draft { "edit": "1234", "disallow_send": true }                                       # revoke send-on-behalf
draft { "edit": "1234", "unshare": true }
```

Use `emails` to find message IDs for `edit`, `reply_to`, and `forward`. Use `accounts` to find account emails for `account` - both personal accounts and shared inboxes are listed there, and either can be used as the from address when the account has triage access. Use `team` to list teams and members for `team`/`user`.

**Templates.** Run `template { "ref": "<id|name>" }` before `draft { "template": ... }` to discover required manual placeholders - a missing manual placeholder is a hard error before any draft is created. Explicit fields always win over template fields.

**Threading is critical.** When a message belongs to an existing conversation, you **must** pass `reply_to` with the **last message in that thread** - that is what attaches the draft to the conversation (correct In-Reply-To/References headers, same thread in the recipient's mailbox). Without `reply_to` the draft starts a brand new thread, which is almost always wrong when the user said "reply", "respond", "follow up", or "ping" within an existing conversation. Use `thread` to inspect the conversation and pick the most recent message's ID.

**Follow-ups (no reply yet).** When following up on a thread whose most recent message is your own outgoing one (e.g. "nudge Alice - she never replied"), use that outgoing message's ID as `reply_to` so the follow-up stays attached as a bump rather than a new cold email.

**Sharing.** Sharing is triggered by the presence of `team` or `user`; teams with exactly one other active member auto-share with everyone, otherwise `user` is required. To change collaborators or the send-on-behalf setting on an existing shared draft, pass `edit` together with the sharing params - the change is applied to the existing share. Content edits (`to`/`cc`/`bcc`/`subject`/`body`/`attach`) and sharing updates (`team`/`user`/`remove_user`/`allow_send`/`disallow_send`) must be issued as **separate** calls, and `unshare` cannot be combined with either.

### comment

**Requires triage access.**

Post a team comment (chat message) on a thread. If the thread isn't yet shared, it is shared automatically. Supports text comments, file attachments, or both. Use `edit` to update an existing comment.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `message_id` | string | yes (post) | Message ID (or Spark deep link) of a message in the thread to comment on. Required when posting a new comment; omit when using `edit`. |
| `body` | string | when no `attach` | Comment text. Required when using `edit`. |
| `attach` | array of string | when no `body` | Absolute paths to files to attach. Each file is sent as a separate message. Cannot be combined with `edit`. |
| `edit` | string | no | Message ID of an existing comment to edit. Requires `body`. |
| `team` | string | when >1 team | Team name. Required when the user belongs to multiple teams. |
| `user` | array of string | when team >2 members | Teammate emails to share with. Only used when auto-sharing an unshared thread. For teams with 2 or fewer members, the whole team is shared with automatically. |

```
comment { "message_id": "1234", "body": "Looks good, let's proceed." }
comment { "message_id": "1234", "body": "Please review this", "team": "Engineering" }
comment { "message_id": "1234", "body": "FYI", "team": "Engineering", "user": ["alice@co.com", "bob@co.com"] }
comment { "message_id": "1234", "attach": ["/path/to/screenshot.png"] }
comment { "message_id": "1234", "body": "See attached", "attach": ["/path/to/report.pdf", "/path/to/data.csv"] }
comment { "edit": "5678", "body": "Updated comment text" }
```

Use `emails` to find message IDs. Use `thread` to see comment IDs already posted on a conversation. Use `team` to list teams and their members.

### action

**Requires triage access.**

Perform an action on one or more emails. Pass `action_name` plus a `message_ids` array; some actions need additional options (`date`, `folder`, `team`, `user`, `assignee`, `comment`).

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `action_name` | string | yes | Action to perform (see list below). |
| `message_ids` | array of string | yes | Message IDs (or Spark deep links) to act on. |
| `date` | string | for `snooze`, `changeReminder`; optional for `assign` | `yyyy-MM-dd`, `dd/MM/yyyy`, or `yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm`. |
| `folder` | string | for `moveToFolder`, `attachLabel`, `detachLabel` | Qualified folder/label (e.g. `user@example.com:Archive`). Run `folders` for valid identifiers. |
| `team` | string | when >1 team for team actions | Team name. |
| `user` | array of string | for `shareInTeam` when team >2 members | Teammate emails to share with. |
| `assignee` | string | for `assign` | Teammate email to assign the email to. |
| `comment` | string | optional for `assign` | Comment text included with the assignment. |

```
contact-action { "action_name": "blockContact", "emails": ["spammer@example.com"] }
contact-action { "action_name": "acceptContact", "emails": ["alice@co.com", "bob@co.com"] }
contact-action { "action_name": "changeCategoryPersonal", "emails": ["alice@co.com"] }
contact-action { "action_name": "markContactAsPrimary", "emails": ["ceo@company.com"] }
contact-action { "action_name": "enableAutosummaryForContact", "emails": ["newsletter@example.com"] }
```

Use `contacts` to look up email addresses.

## Smart Categories

Spark automatically classifies incoming email into six categories. Use the `category:` filter operator with `emails` and `search` to view mail by category, and use `action` / `contact-action` to reclassify and tune (triage).

| Category | Filter | Typical Content |
|----------|--------|-----------------|
| Priority | `category:priority` | Auto-prioritized or manually marked as priority |
| People | `category:personal` | Direct person-to-person email |
| Notifications | `category:notification` | Service notifications, alerts, receipts |
| Newsletters | `category:newsletter` | Subscriptions, digests, marketing |
| Invites | `category:invitation` | Calendar invitations |
| Invite Responses | `category:invitation_response` | RSVPs, accepts, declines |

Browse by category (read-only):

```
emails { "folder": "Inbox", "filter": "category:priority is:unread" }
emails { "folder": "Inbox", "filter": "category:personal is:unread" }
emails { "folder": "Inbox", "filter": "category:invitation" }
emails { "folder": "Inbox", "filter": "category:notification is:unread" }
emails { "folder": "Inbox", "filter": "category:newsletter newer_than:7d" }
```

Reclassify a single message (triage):

```
action { "action_name": "changeCategoryPersonal", "message_ids": ["12345"] }
action { "action_name": "changeCategoryNotification", "message_ids": ["12345"] }
action { "action_name": "changeCategoryNewsletters", "message_ids": ["12345"] }
```

Tune per-contact category rules (triage) - changes apply to all future mail from the sender:

```
contact-action { "action_name": "changeCategoryPersonal", "emails": ["sender@example.com"] }
contact-action { "action_name": "changeCategoryNewsletters", "emails": ["sender@example.com"] }
contact-action { "action_name": "groupEmailsFromContact", "emails": ["sender@example.com"] }
contact-action { "action_name": "markContactAsImportant", "emails": ["vip@example.com"] }
contact-action { "action_name": "markContactAsPrimary", "emails": ["ceo@example.com"] }
contact-action { "action_name": "enableAutosummaryForContact", "emails": ["newsletter@example.com"] }
```

**Category-first triage pattern:** Process inbox in priority order - priority -> people -> invites -> notifications -> newsletters. This ensures the most important messages get attention first.

## Typical Workflows

**Answer a question about emails:**
1. `search { "query": "topic" }` - find relevant emails with bodies.
2. Read the output and answer the user's question.

**Find and read a specific email:**
1. `emails { "filter": "from:sender subject:keyword" }` - locate the email.
2. `thread { "message_id": "<ID>" }` - read the full conversation.

**Read an attachment (image, PDF, CSV):**
1. `thread { "message_id": "<ID>" }` - look up the `ID` column in the `Attachments:` table.
2. `attachment { "id": <attachment-id> }` - receive the file contents directly (no need to read the local `Path`).

**Draft a reply:**
1. `emails { "filter": "from:sender" }` - find the email.
2. `draft { "reply_to": "<ID>", "body": "Thanks for the update!" }`.

**Send an email from a saved template:**
1. `templates {}` - list templates (or `templates { "personal": true }` / `templates { "team": "<name>" }`).
2. `template { "ref": "<id|name>" }` - inspect required manual placeholders.
3. `draft { "template": "<id|name>", "to": ["alice@co.com"], "placeholder": ["<name>=<value>"] }` - create the draft.

**Check someone's schedule for a meeting:**
1. `availability { "tomorrow": true, "attendees": "alice@co.com,bob@co.com" }`.
2. Suggest a time from the free slots.

**Comment on a shared thread:**
1. `emails { "filter": "subject:keyword" }` - find the email.
2. `comment { "message_id": "<ID>", "body": "Looks good, approved!" }`.

**Get team workload overview:**
1. `team { "name": "Team Name" }` - see members and assigned emails.

**Look up a contact:**
1. `contacts { "query": "name or domain" }` - find their email address.

**Triage a thread (archive/pin/snooze):**
1. `emails { "filter": "from:sender" }` - find the message.
2. `action { "action_name": "archive", "message_ids": ["<ID>"] }` - archive (or `pin`, `snooze` with `date`, etc.).

**Bulk archive after review:**
1. `emails { "folder": "Inbox", "filter": "category:newsletter newer_than:7d" }` - list candidates.
2. `action { "action_name": "archive", "message_ids": ["<ID1>", "<ID2>", "<ID3>"] }` - archive in one call.

**Share an email with the team:**
1. `emails { "filter": "subject:keyword" }` - find the email.
2. `action { "action_name": "shareInTeam", "message_ids": ["<ID>"], "user": ["alice@co.com"] }`.

**Delegate an email to a teammate:**
1. `emails { "filter": "subject:keyword" }` - find the email.
2. `action { "action_name": "assign", "message_ids": ["<ID>"], "assignee": "bob@co.com", "date": "2026-04-15", "comment": "Please handle this" }`.

**Mark delegated emails as done:**
1. `emails { "filter": "subject:keyword" }` - find the email(s).
2. `action { "action_name": "delegationComplete", "message_ids": ["<ID1>", "<ID2>"] }`.

**Review assigned shared inbox items:**
1. `emails { "folder": "shared@co.com:Inbox", "filter": "assigned_to:unassigned" }` - unassigned items.
2. `action { "action_name": "assign", "message_ids": ["<ID>"], "assignee": "bob@co.com" }` - assign to a teammate.
3. `emails { "filter": "assigned_to:bob@co.com" }` - items assigned to a teammate.
4. `emails { "filter": "is:shared_inbox_open" }` - all open shared inbox items.
5. `emails { "filter": "is:shared_inbox_done" }` - completed items.

**Read meeting notes:**
1. `meetings { "filter": "newer_than:30d" }` - find recent meetings.
2. `meeting { "meeting_id": "<ID>", "transcript": true, "notes": true }` - read summary, transcript, and notes.

**Manage a contact (block/accept/categorize):**
1. `contacts { "query": "name or domain" }` - find the contact email.
2. `contact-action { "action_name": "blockContact", "emails": ["spammer@example.com"] }` - block (or `acceptContact`, change category, etc.).

## Tips

- Combine filter operators into a single `filter` string: `"from:alice@co.com is:unread newer_than:7d"` - do not split them across calls.
- Call `folders` to discover exact folder identifiers before passing them to `emails` or `search`'s `in` parameter.
- Call `accounts` to discover calendar identifiers before passing them to `events`'s `in` parameter, **and** to check each account's access level before attempting `draft`, `comment`, `action`, or `contact-action`.
- Use `search` for topic-based queries - it returns bodies. Use `emails` for browsing or slicing by metadata - it does not.
- Use `thread` after finding an interesting message ID with `emails` or `search`.
- Multi-word subjects and team names must be quoted inside the filter string: `subject:"quarterly report"`.
- `action` and `contact-action` accept arrays of IDs/emails - batch related changes into a single call rather than one call per message.
- If a write tool returns an "access denied" error, surface it to the user and point them at **Spark Desktop > Settings > AI Agents** to raise the level. They can also perform the action directly in Spark Desktop.
