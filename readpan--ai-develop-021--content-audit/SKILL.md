# Content Audit

Audit tutorial content quality for the "AI 开发 0 到 1" site.

## Quick Start

Run the audit script from the project root:

```bash
python3 .agents/skills/content-audit/scripts/audit.py docs/
```

The script checks all `.md` files under `docs/` and reports:

- Missing images (referenced in markdown but file doesn't exist) -> Reported as PENDING
- Placeholder images (file exists but is a tiny stub) -> Reported as PENDING
- Missing required sections per page type
- Broken internal links (links to `.md` files that don't exist)
- Image naming convention violations
- Empty or stub pages

## Interpreting Results

The script outputs categorized findings:

- **MISSING_IMAGE**: Image placeholder referenced but no file on disk. Action: screenshot needed or path typo.
- **PLACEHOLDER_IMAGE**: Image file exists but is too small to be a real screenshot (e.g., 1x1 pixel stub). Action: replace with actual screenshot.
- **MISSING_SECTION**: Page lacks a required section (本节目标, 下一步, etc.). Action: add the section or confirm it's intentionally omitted (FAQ/index pages exempt).
- **BROKEN_LINK**: Internal markdown link target doesn't exist. Action: fix the link path.
- **IMAGE_NAMING**: Image filename doesn't follow `{section}-{description}.png` convention. Action: rename for consistency.
- **STUB_PAGE**: Page has fewer than 5 non-empty lines of content. Action: write content or remove placeholder.

## Manual Review Checklist

After running the automated audit, manually review:

1. **Writing style consistency**: 「你」not「您」, conversational tone, no unexplained jargon
2. **Prompt examples**: All prompts in `>` blockquote, complete sentences in Chinese
3. **AI response descriptions**: Describes behavior, never pastes actual AI output
4. **VitePress config sync**: Every page file has a corresponding sidebar entry in `docs/.vitepress/config.ts`
5. **Page flow**: Each non-FAQ page ends with "下一步" linking to the next logical page
6. **Comparison teaching**: Pages introducing new concepts include contrast with what students already know
7. **Writing quality**: Check for awkward phrasing, forced humor, or confusing expressions (see details below)

## Writing Quality Review

Read each page and flag expressions that would make a beginner pause or feel confused. The tutorial tone should be **warm and encouraging, but not gimmicky**.

### Rules

1. **No forced humor or slang**: Jokes that require cultural context or feel out of place break trust with beginners. Keep humor natural and light.
2. **No disruptive parenthetical asides**: Parenthetical expressions that contradict or undercut the main sentence confuse readers.
3. **Metaphors must be self-explanatory**: If a metaphor needs its own explanation, replace it with plain language.
4. **Consistent register**: Don't mix formal explanations with overly casual interjections in the same paragraph.

### Examples

| ❌ 有问题                | ✅ 改后                          | 原因                                 |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| 你刚刚亲手（用嘴）做到的 | 你刚刚通过和 AI 对话，亲手做到的 | 括号里的"用嘴"打断阅读、语义奇怪     |
| 恭喜你成为了一个码农！   | 恭喜你完成了第一个应用！         | "码农"是圈内自嘲用语，初学者可能困惑 |
| 这就像给代码吃了炫迈     | 这会让页面的响应速度明显变快     | 广告梗不是所有读者都能理解           |
| AI 这波操作很秀          | AI 会自动帮你完成这些步骤        | 网络用语在教程中显得不专业           |

## Fixing Issues

Process audit results top-to-bottom. For each category:

1. **MISSING_IMAGE**: List all for the screenshot author — these are expected during development
2. **PLACEHOLDER_IMAGE**: Same as above — list for the screenshot author to replace with real screenshots
3. **MISSING_SECTION**: Add missing sections using the tutorial-writer skill's format
4. **BROKEN_LINK**: Fix paths; use relative paths like `./page.md` or `/section/page`
5. **IMAGE_NAMING**: Rename files and update markdown references (remove sequential numbering)
6. **STUB_PAGE**: Write content or remove the file and its sidebar/nav entries
