# Read the Docs API v3 client

Build or update API v3 requests against Read the Docs, and use the bundled references for endpoint-specific details.

## Workflow

1. Choose the correct host.
   - Community: `https://app.readthedocs.org`
   - Read the Docs for Business: `https://app.readthedocs.com`

2. Authenticate when needed.
   - Use `Authorization: Token <token>` for user-scoped data and write operations.
   - Session authentication is allowed for dashboard/internal uses.

3. Pick the endpoint from the short reference.
   - Use `references/api-v3-short.md` to select the method, path, and high-level parameters.

4. Fill in details from the full reference.
   - Use `references/api-v3-full.md` for request bodies, query parameters, response fields, status codes, and notes.

5. Handle shared API behavior.
   - Pagination: list endpoints return `count`, `next`, `previous`, and `results`; use `limit` and `offset`.
   - Field selection: `?fields=`, `?omit=`, and `?expand=` are supported on resources that allow expansion.
   - Rate limits: unauthenticated requests are more limited than authenticated requests; retry on `429`.

## Notes and constraints

- Use the marketing names: "Read the Docs Community" and "Read the Docs Business".
- Organization endpoints and privacy-level fields are only available on Read the Docs Business.
- `expand` values are endpoint-specific; rely on the full reference for allowed values.

## Resources

- Short endpoint reference: `references/api-v3-short.md`
- Full endpoint reference: `references/api-v3-full.md`
- Additional full reference: `https://docs.readthedocs.com/platform/stable/api/v3.html`
