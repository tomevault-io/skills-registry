description: Prepare and publish a new openrouter-rs or openrouter-cli release with consistent version updates, release notes, PR-first branch-protected workflow, and correct SDK-before-CLI sequencing when the CLI depends on a fresh SDK version. Use when asked to cut a release, bump crate versions, publish to crates.io, update changelog entries, refresh README installation versions, or update the README release history. Use when this capability is needed.

# OpenRouter-rs Release

## Overview

Use this skill to run the full release workflow for:
- `openrouter-rs` (SDK)
- `openrouter-cli` (CLI crate)

Always update versioned files/docs together before tagging.

## Unified Publish Policy (Required)

Use GitHub Actions as the single publish path for both SDK and CLI releases.

- Do not run local `cargo publish` as the default release path.
- Publish by pushing release tags and letting workflows perform verify/publish/release jobs.
- Local `cargo publish` is emergency-only fallback.

## Repository Policy And Ordering (Required)

- Assume `main` is protected. Do not assume direct pushes are allowed.
- Push release prep to a release branch, open a PR to `main`, and wait for required checks plus repository review policy before merging.
- If the repo policy blocks merge until review, do not treat green checks alone as sufficient.
- If releasing `openrouter-rs` and `openrouter-cli` together, publish the SDK first when the CLI depends on the new SDK version from crates.io.
- After the SDK release is live on crates.io, rerun CLI package validation and only then push `openrouter-cli-v<version>`.

## Release Inputs

Collect these values first:

- Target package (`openrouter-rs` or `openrouter-cli`)
- Target version (for example `0.6.0` or `0.1.0`)
- Release date in `YYYY-MM-DD`
- Summary bullets grouped by `Added`, `Changed`, `Fixed` (reuse from `CHANGELOG.md` when possible)

## Update Versioned Files (SDK: openrouter-rs)

Apply updates in this order to avoid drift.

1. Update package version in `Cargo.toml`.
2. Update README installation snippet version (`openrouter-rs = "..."`).
3. Update any outdated docs snippet that pins a crate version (notably `src/lib.rs` doctext if present).
4. Update `CHANGELOG.md`:
- Move finalized items from `## [Unreleased]` into a new version section.
- Create `## [<version>] - <date>` with `### Added`/`### Changed`/`### Fixed` headings as needed.
- Keep `## [Unreleased]` at the top for next cycle.
- If `## [Unreleased]` is empty for a patch release, derive concise user-visible bullets from commits merged since the previous release tag instead of shipping an empty release section.
5. Update README bottom `## 📈 Release History`:
- Insert a new `### Version <version> *(Latest)*` section at the top of the history list.
- Remove `*(Latest)*` marker from the previous latest version.
- Copy concise release bullets aligned with the changelog section.

Use [references/release-targets.md](references/release-targets.md) to verify exact files and grep checks.

## Update Versioned Files (CLI: openrouter-cli)

When target is `openrouter-cli`:

1. Update `crates/openrouter-cli/Cargo.toml` version.
2. Ensure `openrouter-rs` dependency has both `path` and `version`.
3. Update `crates/openrouter-cli/README.md` installation snippets/versioned URLs if present.
4. Ensure CLI release workflow contract remains valid:
- tag pattern: `openrouter-cli-v*.*.*`
- tag version matches `crates/openrouter-cli/Cargo.toml`.

## Validate Before Commit

Run local checks in this order:

1. `just quality`
2. `bash .agents/skills/openrouter-rs-release/scripts/verify_release_sync.sh <sdk-version>` for SDK releases
3. `just quality-ci` if you touched CLI behavior, migration docs, or CI-aligned release/test flows
4. `cargo package --locked` on a clean tree, or `cargo package --locked --allow-dirty` before commit, for SDK release validation

For CLI releases, also run:

1. `cargo test -p openrouter-cli`
2. `cargo package -p openrouter-cli --locked` on a clean tree, or `cargo package -p openrouter-cli --locked --allow-dirty` before commit

Important CLI packaging rule:

- `cargo package -p openrouter-cli` validates against crates.io, not the workspace path dependency.
- If `crates/openrouter-cli/Cargo.toml` now requires a just-bumped `openrouter-rs` version that is not yet published, this package step will fail until the SDK release is live on crates.io.
- In that case, validate CLI tests in the PR, merge the release prep, publish `v<sdk-version>`, wait until crates.io resolves the new SDK version, then rerun CLI packaging and push `openrouter-cli-v<cli-version>`.

If `verify_release_sync.sh` reports mismatch, fix files before commit/tag.

## Commit, Tag, and Publish

When all checks pass:

1. Commit release prep changes on a release branch.
2. Open and merge a PR to `main` according to repo policy.
3. Fast-forward local `main` to the merged commit before tagging.
4. Create and push release tag:
- SDK: `v<version>`
- CLI: `openrouter-cli-v<version>`
5. Confirm GitHub Actions release workflow passes:
- SDK workflow: `Release`
- verify job
- crates.io publish (requires `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN`)
- GitHub release creation
- CLI workflow: `CLI Release`
- verify job
- crates.io publish (`openrouter-cli`, requires `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN`)
- binary build matrix + `SHA256SUMS`
- GitHub release assets upload

## Release Note Composition

Use `CHANGELOG.md` as the source of truth.

- Keep GitHub release notes and README bottom latest bullets semantically aligned.
- Prefer concise bullets that explain user-visible impact.
- Mention breaking changes explicitly.
