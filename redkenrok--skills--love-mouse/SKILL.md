## Examples

### Handling mouse click
```lua
function love.mousepressed(x, y, button, istouch)
  if button == 1 then  -- Left mouse button
    print("Clicked at: " .. x .. ", " .. y)
    -- Handle left click logic
  end
end
```

### Custom cursor
```lua
function love.load()
  -- Hide default cursor
  love.mouse.setVisible(false)

  -- Load custom cursor image
  cursorImage = love.graphics.newImage("cursor.png")
end

function love.draw()
  -- Draw custom cursor at mouse position
  local x, y = love.mouse.getPosition()
  love.graphics.draw(cursorImage, x, y)
end
```

## Best practices
- Handle both mouse and touch input for cross-platform compatibility
- Use appropriate cursor visibility for different game states
- Consider mouse acceleration and sensitivity on different platforms
- Handle mouse events efficiently to avoid performance issues
- Test mouse input on target platforms as behavior may vary

## Platform compatibility
- **Desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux)**: Full mouse support
- **Mobile (iOS, Android)**: Mouse events emulated from touch input
- **Web**: Full mouse support in browser environment
