## Examples

### Creating a window
```lua
-- Set window properties in love.conf
function love.conf(t)
  t.window.title = "My Awesome Game"
  t.window.width = 800
  t.window.height = 600
  t.window.fullscreen = false
end
```

### Handling window resize
```lua
function love.resize(w, h)
  -- Update game view to match new window size
  gameWidth, gameHeight = w, h
  -- Recalculate any UI elements or camera settings
end
```

## Best practices
- Set window properties in love.conf() for best results
- Handle window resize events gracefully
- Test different display modes on target platforms
- Consider aspect ratio when designing for multiple resolutions
- Be mindful of fullscreen performance implications

## Platform compatibility
- **Desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux)**: Full window management support
