# Go Codebase Refactor Analysis

Analyze a Go codebase against best practices, security principles, and idiomatic Go
standards. Generate a comprehensive refactoring report with prioritized recommendations.

## Parallel Agent Integration

This command ALWAYS uses parallel agents (security-critical).
Executes: `~/.claude/scripts/parallel_agent.sh --json --full-output --validate --analyze`

Consensus scoring:

- >=80%: Auto-proceed with unified recommendation
- 50-79%: Highlight disagreements to user
- <50%: Escalate for human review

## Task

You are a Senior Go Engineer analyzing a production Go codebase. Your goals are to:

1. Assess code against Go idioms, effective Go patterns, and security standards
2. Identify security vulnerabilities (injection, unsafe packages, secrets handling)
3. Find architectural and code quality refactoring opportunities
4. Rate each finding by **effort** (Minimal/Medium/High) and **risk** (Low/Medium/High/Critical)
5. Generate an actionable improvement roadmap with priority matrix

## Instructions

### Step 0: Consult Knowledge Base

Before starting analysis, check for known patterns relevant to this codebase:

```bash
~/.claude/scripts/learning_capture.sh query --language go --format llm
```

If the knowledge base contains relevant antipatterns or insights for Go:

- Include them as additional check items in your analysis
- Flag any occurrences of known antipatterns with their KB ID (e.g., ANTI-001)
- Note if a known antipattern has been resolved

This step is **non-blocking** — if the knowledge base is empty or the query fails,
proceed with the standard analysis.

### Step 1: Read Project Standards and Configuration

- Read AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, README.md for project context
- Check for existing tooling: go.mod, go.sum, .golangci.yml, Makefile
- Check Go version and module path
- List dependencies and check for known vulnerabilities via `govulncheck`

### Step 2: Architecture Analysis

- List all Go packages and check module structure
- Check for proper package boundaries (no circular imports)
- Check for God packages (>20 files or >2000 lines)
- Verify interface usage (accept interfaces, return structs)
- Check for proper error wrapping with `fmt.Errorf("...: %w", err)`

### Step 3: Security Analysis (CRITICAL)

Scan for these patterns:

**SQL Injection**:

- String concatenation in SQL: `"SELECT...WHERE " + var`
- `fmt.Sprintf` in queries without parameterized inputs

**Unsafe Operations**:

- `unsafe.Pointer` usage
- `reflect` package in production code (performance/security)
- `os/exec.Command` with user input
- `net/http` without timeouts

**Secrets Handling**:

- Hardcoded credentials, API keys, tokens
- Secrets in struct tags or comments

**Concurrency Safety**:

- Race conditions: shared state without mutex/channels
- Goroutine leaks: goroutines without context cancellation
- Unbuffered channels in loops

**Error Handling**:

- Ignored errors: `result, _ := fn()`
- Bare `panic()` in production code
- Missing error returns from deferred Close()

### Step 4: Code Quality Analysis

- Long functions (>60 lines)
- Deep nesting (>4 levels)
- Magic numbers/strings
- Exported types without documentation
- Inconsistent naming (Go conventions: MixedCaps, not snake_case)
- init() function abuse

### Step 5: Testing Analysis

- Test file coverage: every `foo.go` should have `foo_test.go`
- Table-driven test patterns
- Test helper usage (`t.Helper()`)
- Benchmark tests for performance-critical code
- Fuzz tests for input parsing

### Step 6: golangci-lint Integration

Recommend or check `.golangci.yml` configuration:

```yaml
linters:
  enable:
    - errcheck
    - govet
    - staticcheck
    - gosec
    - ineffassign
    - unused
    - gocritic
    - revive
    - bodyclose
    - noctx
    - exhaustive
```

## Effort Classification

| Level | Time | Scope | Examples |
|-------|------|-------|----------|
| **Minimal** | <1 hour | Single file | Add error check, fix naming, add doc comment |
| **Medium** | 2-8 hours | Multi-file | Refactor package, add tests, fix concurrency |
| **High** | 1-3 days | Architectural | Restructure modules, add interfaces, break God packages |

## Risk Classification

| Level | Impact | Testing Required | Examples |
|-------|--------|------------------|----------|
| **Low** | No behavior change | None | Add docs, rename internal var |
| **Medium** | Internal changes | Unit tests | Refactor helpers, add validation |
| **High** | API/signature changes | Integration tests | Change exported interfaces |
| **Critical** | Security/Breaking | Full regression | Fix injection, race conditions |

## Configuration Templates

If missing, recommend creating:

### .golangci.yml

```yaml
run:
  timeout: 5m
  go: "1.23"

linters:
  enable:
    - errcheck
    - govet
    - staticcheck
    - gosec
    - ineffassign
    - unused
    - gocritic
    - revive
    - bodyclose
    - noctx

linters-settings:
  gocritic:
    enabled-tags:
      - diagnostic
      - style
      - performance
  revive:
    rules:
      - name: unexported-return
        disabled: true
```

### Makefile

```makefile
.PHONY: lint test build

lint:
 golangci-lint run ./...

test:
 go test -race -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...

build:
 go build -ldflags="-s -w" -o bin/ ./...
```

---

## Analysis Principles

- **Be idiomatic**: Recommend Go patterns, not patterns from other languages
- **Be specific**: Every finding must have exact file:line location
- **Be actionable**: Every finding must have a concrete fix
- **Prioritize concurrency**: Race conditions are production incidents
- **Check error handling**: Go's explicit errors are a feature, not boilerplate

---

## Learning Capture (Optional)

After completing the analysis, capture the most significant findings:

1. For each critical or high-severity finding:
   - Run:

     ```bash
     ~/.claude/scripts/learning_capture.sh add \
       --category antipattern --language go \
       --title "<finding title>" \
       --description "<finding description and recommended fix>" \
       --source refactor-go --confidence high
     ```

2. For any new tool recommendations discovered:
   - Run:

     ```bash
     ~/.claude/scripts/learning_capture.sh add \
       --category tool_discovery --language go \
       --title "<tool recommendation>" \
       --description "<why this tool is better>" \
       --source refactor-go --confidence medium
     ```

3. This step is **non-blocking** -- failures in learning capture should not affect the analysis output.
