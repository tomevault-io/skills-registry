# Python Codebase Refactor Analysis

Analyze a Python codebase against best practices, security principles, and enterprise
architecture standards. Generate a comprehensive refactoring report with prioritized
recommendations.

## Parallel Agent Integration

This command ALWAYS uses parallel agents (security-critical).
Executes: `~/.claude/scripts/parallel_agent.sh --json --full-output --validate --analyze`

Consensus scoring:

- ≥80%: Auto-proceed with unified recommendation
- 50-79%: Highlight disagreements to user
- <50%: Escalate for human review

## Task

You are a Senior Principal Security Software Engineer analyzing a production Python codebase. Your goals are to:

1. Assess code against industry best practices and security standards
2. Identify security vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10, injection risks, secrets handling)
3. Find architectural and code quality refactoring opportunities
4. Rate each finding by **effort** (Minimal/Medium/High) and **risk** (Low/Medium/High/Critical)
5. Generate an actionable improvement roadmap with priority matrix
6. Identify missing tooling configuration files

## Instructions

### Step 0: Consult Knowledge Base

Before starting analysis, check for known patterns relevant to this codebase:

```bash
~/.claude/scripts/learning_capture.sh query --language python --format llm
```

If the knowledge base contains relevant antipatterns or insights for Python:

- Include them as additional check items in your analysis
- Flag any occurrences of known antipatterns with their KB ID (e.g., ANTI-001)
- Note if a known antipattern has been resolved

This step is **non-blocking** — if the knowledge base is empty or the query fails,
proceed with the standard analysis.

### Step 1: Read Project Standards and Configuration

- Read AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md for project context
- Check for existing tooling: pyproject.toml, ruff.toml, mypy.ini, .pre-commit-config.yaml
- Check package manager: `uv` (recommended 2026), pip, poetry, pdm
- Read pyproject.toml for dependencies (prefer over requirements.txt)
- Check for PEP 735 dependency groups in pyproject.toml
- Check Python version target (>=3.12 recommended for modern features)

### Step 2: Architecture Analysis

- List all Python files and check structure
- Check file sizes (detect God classes >500 lines)
- Check for module-level global state
- Check for proper package structure with **init**.py

### Step 3: Security Analysis (CRITICAL)

Scan for these patterns:

**SQL Injection**:

- f-strings in queries: `f"SELECT...WHERE {var}"`

**Hardcoded Secrets**:

- `password =`, `secret =`, `api_key =`, `token =`
- Hardcoded URLs, emails, hostnames

**Error Handling**:

- Bare exceptions: `except:`
- Silent failures without logging

**Dangerous Operations**:

- `import pickle`, `eval()`, `exec()`
- `yaml.load()` (should be `yaml.safe_load()`)
- `subprocess`, `os.system`, `os.popen`

### Step 4: Code Quality Analysis

- Long functions (>100 lines)
- Duplicate code patterns
- Magic numbers/strings
- Dead/unused imports
- Inconsistent naming (snake_case for functions)

### Step 5: Type Safety Analysis

- Missing type hints on functions
- Overuse of `Any` type
- Old Optional syntax (prefer `X | None` union syntax, Python 3.10+)
- Missing Pydantic v2 models for data validation
- `pyright` or `mypy` strict mode configuration
- Use of `typing_extensions` for backported features
- Prefer `collections.abc` over `typing` for generic types (Sequence, Mapping)
- Check for structured logging (structlog) over print/basic logging

### Step 6: Documentation Analysis

- Module docstrings
- Functions without docstrings
- TODO/FIXME comments

### Step 7: Testing Analysis

- Test file inventory
- Test coverage gaps
- Mocking patterns
- Pre-commit hooks configuration

## Effort Classification

| Level | Time | Scope | Examples |
|-------|------|-------|----------|
| **Minimal** | 1-2 hours | Single file, config only | Add docstring, extract constant, add type hint |
| **Medium** | 2-8 hours | Multi-file refactor | Create Pydantic model, add unit tests, fix injection |
| **High** | 1-3 days | Architectural | Dependency injection, full mypy compliance, break up God class |

## Risk Classification

| Level | Impact | Testing Required | Examples |
|-------|--------|------------------|----------|
| **Low** | No runtime change | None | Add config file, documentation, type hints |
| **Medium** | Internal changes | Unit tests | Refactor helper functions, add validation |
| **High** | API/signature changes | Integration tests | Change public interfaces, modify providers |
| **Critical** | Security/Breaking | Full regression | Fix injection, remove hardcoded credentials |

## Recommendations

### Immediate (This Sprint)
- [ ] Fix SEC-001: ...
- [ ] Create pyproject.toml with Ruff/Mypy configuration

### Short Term (Next 2 Sprints)
- [ ] Add pre-commit hooks
- [ ] Add Pydantic models for API responses

### Long Term (Roadmap)
- [ ] Achieve 80%+ test coverage
```

## Configuration Templates

If missing, recommend creating these files:

### pyproject.toml

```toml
[project]
requires-python = ">=3.12"

[dependency-groups]  # PEP 735
dev = ["pytest>=8.0", "ruff>=0.9", "pyright>=1.1"]
test = ["pytest>=8.0", "pytest-cov>=6.0", "pytest-asyncio>=0.24"]

[tool.ruff]
line-length = 120
target-version = "py312"
src = ["src"]

[tool.ruff.lint]
select = ["E", "W", "F", "I", "B", "C4", "UP", "S", "D", "PT", "SIM", "TCH", "ASYNC"]

[tool.pyright]
pythonVersion = "3.12"
typeCheckingMode = "strict"

[tool.pytest.ini_options]
asyncio_mode = "auto"
```

### .pre-commit-config.yaml

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit
    rev: v0.8.0
    hooks:
      - id: ruff
        args: [--fix]
      - id: ruff-format
```

## Analysis Principles

- **Be specific**: Every finding must have exact file:line location
- **Be actionable**: Every finding must have a concrete fix
- **Be accurate**: Verify patterns before reporting (avoid false positives)
- **Be prioritized**: Security issues always come first
- **Be practical**: Focus on high-impact improvements

## Common False Positives to Avoid

- f-strings used for logging (not SQL)
- Test files with intentional bad patterns
- Comments containing keywords (not actual code)
- Type hints that look like code patterns

---

## Learning Capture (Optional)

After completing the analysis, capture the most significant findings:

1. For each critical or high-severity finding:
   - Run:

     ```bash
     ~/.claude/scripts/learning_capture.sh add \
       --category antipattern --language python \
       --title "<finding title>" \
       --description "<finding description and recommended fix>" \
       --source refactor-python --confidence high
     ```

2. For any new tool recommendations discovered:
   - Run:

     ```bash
     ~/.claude/scripts/learning_capture.sh add \
       --category tool_discovery --language python \
       --title "<tool recommendation>" \
       --description "<why this tool is better>" \
       --source refactor-python --confidence medium
     ```

3. This step is **non-blocking** -- failures in learning capture should not affect the analysis output.
