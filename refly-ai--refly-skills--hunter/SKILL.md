RUN_ID=$(echo "$RESULT" | jq -r '.payload.workflowExecutions[0].id')
# RUN_ID is we-xxx format, use this for workflow commands
```

### Step 2: Open Workflow in Browser and Wait for Completion

```bash
open "https://refly.ai/workflow/c-yy5s998sby8jaqrhmjnjq5im"
refly workflow status "$RUN_ID" --watch --interval 30000
```

### Step 3: Extract Text Content

```bash
# Get email data from toolcalls
CONTENT=$(refly workflow toolcalls "$RUN_ID" --files --latest | jq -r '.payload.nodes[].content')
echo "$CONTENT"
```
