# Codex Analysis

Run the Codex CLI to get deep analysis using gpt-5.2-codex with high reasoning effort.

**IMPORTANT: This skill MUST spawn subagents for parallel exploration. Always include subagent instructions in the prompt.**

## When to Use

- User asks for "Codex analysis" or "Codex help"
- User wants a second opinion on code or architecture
- User needs deep reasoning on a complex problem

## Running the Analysis (MUST spawn subagents)

Execute this command, replacing `{PROMPT}` with the user's question or analysis request.

**Always append subagent instructions to the prompt:**

```bash
codex exec -m gpt-5.2-codex \
  --config model_reasoning_effort="high" \
  --sandbox read-only \
  --skip-git-repo-check \
  "{PROMPT} Spawn subagents to explore different aspects in parallel."
```

## Command Parameters

| Flag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `-m gpt-5.2-codex` | Use gpt-5.2-codex model (spawns subagents for parallel work) |
| `--config model_reasoning_effort="high"` | Maximum reasoning depth |
| `--sandbox read-only` | Safe read-only sandbox |
| `--skip-git-repo-check` | Skip git repository validation |

## Subagent Requirements

**MANDATORY:** Every prompt MUST include instructions to spawn subagents. This enables:

- Parallel exploration of different code areas
- Concurrent analysis of multiple concerns (security, performance, architecture)
- Faster and more thorough analysis

Template suffix to append to every prompt:
> "Spawn subagents to explore different aspects in parallel."

## After Running

1. **Summarize** the Codex analysis output
2. **Highlight** key suggestions and findings
3. **Ask** if the user wants to:
   - Implement any suggested changes
   - Get more details on specific points
   - Run additional analysis

## Example Usage

User asks: "Use Codex to analyze the authentication flow"

Run (note: subagent spawning is REQUIRED):
```bash
codex exec -m gpt-5.2-codex \
  --config model_reasoning_effort="high" \
  --sandbox read-only \
  --skip-git-repo-check \
  "Analyze the authentication flow in this codebase. Spawn subagents to explore security issues, improvement opportunities, and best practices in parallel."
```

User asks: "Get Codex help with performance issues"

Run:
```bash
codex exec -m gpt-5.2-codex \
  --config model_reasoning_effort="high" \
  --sandbox read-only \
  --skip-git-repo-check \
  "Identify performance bottlenecks in this codebase. Spawn subagents to analyze database queries, API endpoints, and frontend rendering in parallel."
```

Then summarize findings and offer follow-up actions.
