# Research Camps

## Overview

**Locate research directory:** Read `.claude/kids-camp-planner.local.md` to get the `research_dir` path (default: `camp-research`). All user data paths below are relative to this directory. The family profile is at `<research_dir>/family-profile.md`.

Discover, evaluate, and document camp providers for a family's area, creating structured provider files in the `<research_dir>/providers/` directory. Each provider gets its own markdown file with standardized information for easy comparison. Providers are cross-referenced from period-specific schedule files (summer, March break, PA days).

## Research Workflow

### Step 1: Define Search Criteria

Read the family profile from `<research_dir>/family-profile.md` to determine:
- Home address and maximum commute time
- Children's ages (determines eligible programs)
- Children's interests (guides specialty camp search)
- Budget range (filters out unaffordable options)
- Before/after care needs
- Lunch preferences

### Step 2: Conduct Research

Use web search to find camp providers. Search in this order:

**1. Municipal programs (best value):**
- Search: "[municipality] summer camp registration [year]"
- Search: "[municipality] recreation programs children [year]"
- Check the municipal recreation portal directly

**2. Established organizations:**
- Search: "YMCA day camp [city/area] [year]"
- Search: "Boys and Girls Club [city/area] camps"
- Search: "[city] community centre summer programs"

**3. Private and specialty camps:**
- Search: "day camps near [home address area] [year]"
- Search: "[interest] camp [city] children" (e.g., "robotics camp Toronto children")
- Search: "best day camps [area] [year]"
- Check Ontario Camps Association directory: ontariocamps.ca

**4. Niche and interest-based:**
- Search based on each child's interests
- Check local sports clubs, art studios, music schools for camp programs
- Look at university/college campus programs

### Step 3: Create Provider Files

For each camp provider found, create a markdown file in `<research_dir>/providers/` using the standard template.

**File naming:** Use kebab-case: `provider-name.md` (e.g., `ymca-downtown.md`, `city-of-toronto-parks-rec.md`)

**Provider file template:** Use the template at `<research_dir>/templates/provider-template.md` (seeded during setup from the plugin). The template includes sections for: basic information, distance & commute, programs offered, costs (with discount tracking), quality indicators, logistics, suitability rating, and notes.

For completed examples showing all fields filled in with realistic data, see `<research_dir>/examples/ymca-cedar-glen.md` and `<research_dir>/examples/boulderz-etobicoke.md`.

### Step 4: Verify Key Details

For the most promising providers, verify critical details:
- Confirm current-year pricing (costs change annually)
- Check registration status (open, full, waitlist)
- Verify age eligibility for each child
- Confirm before/after care hours match parent schedules

If details cannot be confirmed via web search, note them as "needs verification" and suggest the user confirm by phone/email (offer to draft an inquiry email via the draft-email skill).

### Step 5: Create Comparison Summary

After researching multiple providers, generate a comparison table:

```markdown
# Camp Provider Comparison - [Area]

| Provider | Ages | $/Day | $/Week | Before Care | After Care | Lunch | Distance | Rating |
|----------|------|-------|--------|-------------|------------|-------|----------|--------|
| YMCA Downtown | 4-12 | $56 | $280 | $10/day | $10/day | Pack | 3.2 km | Strong |
| City Parks Rec | 6-12 | $39 | $195 | $8/day | $8/day | Pack | 1.5 km | Strong |
| Science Camp | 7-12 | $85 | $425 | No | No | Incl | 8.1 km | Good |
```

Include daily rates ($/Day) alongside weekly rates for accurate partial-week and PA day costing.

Save this comparison to `<research_dir>/providers/comparison-summary.md`.

## Research Tips

### Finding Current-Year Information
- Always include the year in search queries
- Municipal program guides are usually published in January-February
- Check "What's New" sections on recreation portals
- Look for PDF program guides (often more detailed than web pages)

### Evaluating Online Reviews
- Check Google Reviews, Facebook reviews, and parent forums
- Look for reviews from the most recent year
- Pay attention to recurring themes (positive and negative)
- Weight reviews from parents with similar-aged children more heavily

### Hidden Gems
- Library-run programs (free or very low cost)
- Conservation authority camps (nature-focused, affordable)
- University faculty/staff camps (sometimes open to public)
- Ethnic/cultural community centres (multilingual options)
- Church-run VBS programs (often free, typically July)
