# Skill Validator

Validate any skill against production-level quality criteria.

## Validation Workflow

### Phase 1: Gather Context

1. **Read the skill's SKILL.md** completely
2. **Identify skill type** from frontmatter description:
   - Builder skill (creates artifacts)
   - Guide skill (provides instructions)
   - Automation skill (executes workflows)
   - Analyzer skill (extracts insights)
   - Validator skill (enforces quality)
   - Hybrid skill (combination of above)
3. **Read all reference files** in `references/` directory
4. **Check for assets/scripts** directories
5. **Note frontmatter fields** (`name`, `description`, `allowed-tools`, `model`)

### Phase 2: Apply Criteria

Evaluate against **9 criteria categories**. Each criterion scores 0-3:
- **0**: Missing/Absent
- **1**: Present but inadequate
- **2**: Adequate implementation
- **3**: Excellent implementation

---

## Criteria Categories

### 1. Structure & Anatomy (Weight: 12%)

| Criterion | What to Check |
|-----------|---------------|
| **SKILL.md exists** | Root file present |
| **Line count** | <500 lines (context is precious) |
| **Frontmatter complete** | `name` and `description` present in YAML |
| **Name constraints** | Lowercase, numbers, hyphens only; ≤64 chars; matches directory |
| **Description format** | [What] + [When] format; ≤1024 chars |
| **Description style** | Third-person: "This skill should be used when..." |
| **No extraneous files** | No README.md, CHANGELOG.md, LICENSE in skill dir |
| **Progressive disclosure** | Details in `references/`, not bloated SKILL.md |
| **Asset organization** | Templates in `assets/`, scripts in `scripts/` |
| **Large file guidance** | If references >10k words, grep patterns in SKILL.md |

**Fail condition**: Missing SKILL.md or >800 lines = automatic fail

### 2. Content Quality (Weight: 15%)

| Criterion | What to Check |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Conciseness** | No verbose explanations, context is public good |
| **Imperative form** | Instructions use "Do X" not "You should do X" |
| **Appropriate freedom** | Constraints where needed, flexibility where safe |
| **Scope clarity** | Clear what skill does AND does not do |
| **No hallucination risk** | No instructions that encourage making up info |
| **Output specification** | Clear expected outputs defined |

### 3. User Interaction (Weight: 12%)

| Criterion | What to Check |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Clarification triggers** | Asks questions before acting on ambiguity |
| **Required vs optional** | Distinguishes must-know from nice-to-know |
| **Graceful handling** | What to do when user doesn't answer |
| **No over-asking** | Doesn't ask obvious or inferrable questions |
| **Question pacing** | Avoids too many questions in single message |
| **Context awareness** | Uses available context before asking |

**Key pattern to look for**:
```markdown
## Required Clarifications
1. Question about X
2. Question about Y

## Optional Clarifications
3. Question about Z (if relevant)

Note: Avoid asking too many questions in a single message.
```

### 4. Documentation & References (Weight: 10%)

| Criterion | What to Check |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Source URLs** | Official documentation links provided |
| **Reference files** | Complex details in `references/` not main file |
| **Fetch guidance** | Instructions to fetch docs for unlisted patterns |
| **Version awareness** | Notes about checking for latest patterns |
| **Example coverage** | Good/bad examples for key patterns |

**Key pattern to look for**:
```markdown
| Resource | URL | Use For |
|----------|-----|---------|
| Official Docs | https://... | Complex cases |
```

### 5. Domain Standards (Weight: 10%)

| Criterion | What to Check |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Best practices** | Follows domain conventions (e.g., WCAG, OWASP) |
| **Enforcement mechanism** | Checklists, validation steps, must-verify items |
| **Anti-patterns** | Lists what NOT to do |
| **Quality gates** | Output checklist before delivery |

**Key pattern to look for**:
```markdown
### Must Follow
- [ ] Requirement 1
- [ ] Requirement 2

### Must Avoid
- Antipattern 1
- Antipattern 2
```

### 6. Technical Robustness (Weight: 8%)

| Criterion | What to Check |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Error handling** | Guidance for failure scenarios |
| **Security considerations** | Input validation, secrets handling if relevant |
| **Dependencies** | External tools/APIs documented |
| **Edge cases** | Common edge cases addressed |
| **Testability** | Can outputs be verified? |

### 7. Maintainability (Weight: 8%)

| Criterion | What to Check |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Modularity** | References are self-contained topics |
| **Update path** | Easy to update when standards change |
| **No hardcoded values** | Uses placeholders/variables where appropriate |
| **Clear organization** | Logical section ordering |

### 8. Zero-Shot Implementation (Weight: 12%)

Skills should enable single-interaction implementation with embedded expertise.

| Criterion | What to Check |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Before Implementation section** | Context gathering guidance present |
| **Codebase context** | Guidance to scan existing structure/patterns |
| **Conversation context** | Uses discussed requirements/decisions |
| **Embedded expertise** | Domain knowledge in `references/`, not runtime discovery |
| **User-only questions** | Only asks for USER requirements, not domain knowledge |

**Key pattern to look for**:
```markdown
## Before Implementation

Gather context to ensure successful implementation:

| Source | Gather |
|--------|--------|
| **Codebase** | Existing structure, patterns, conventions |
| **Conversation** | User's specific requirements |
| **Skill References** | Domain patterns from `references/` |
| **User Guidelines** | Project-specific conventions |
```

**Red flag**: Skill instructs to "research" or "discover" domain knowledge at runtime instead of embedding it.

### 9. Reusability (Weight: 13%)

Skills should handle variations, not single requirements.

| Criterion | What to Check |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Handles variations** | Not hardcoded to single use case |
| **Variable elements** | Clarifications capture what VARIES |
| **Constant patterns** | Domain best practices encoded as constants |
| **Not requirement-specific** | Avoids hardcoded data, tools, configs |
| **Abstraction level** | Appropriate generalization for domain |

**Good example**:
```markdown
"Create visualizations - adaptable to data shape, chart type, library"
```

**Bad example (too specific)**:
```markdown
"Create bar chart with sales data using Recharts"
```

**Key check**: Does the skill work for multiple use cases within its domain?

## Type-Specific Validation

After scoring general criteria, verify type-specific requirements:

| Type | Must Have |
|------|-----------|
| **Builder** | Clarifications, Output Spec, Domain Standards, Output Checklist |
| **Guide** | Workflow Steps, Examples (Good/Bad), Official Docs links |
| **Automation** | Scripts in `scripts/`, Dependencies, Error Handling, I/O Spec |
| **Analyzer** | Analysis Scope, Evaluation Criteria, Output Format, Synthesis |
| **Validator** | Quality Criteria, Scoring Rubric, Thresholds, Remediation |

**Scoring**: Deduct 10 points if type-specific requirements missing for identified type.

## Scoring Guide

### Category Scores

Calculate each category score:
```
Category Score = (Sum of criterion scores) / (Max possible) * 100
```

### Overall Score

```
Overall = Σ(Category Score × Weight)
```

### Rating Thresholds

| Score | Rating | Meaning |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 90-100 | **Production** | Ready for wide use |

| 40-59 | **Developing** | Significant gaps |
| 0-39 | **Incomplete** | Major rework required |

---

## Output Format

Generate validation report:

```markdown
