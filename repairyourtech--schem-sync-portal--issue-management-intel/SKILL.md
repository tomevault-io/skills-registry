# 🧠 Issue Management Intelligence (Traycer.ai)

This skill defines how to use Traycer.ai to analyze bugs and plan enhancements for the **Schematic Sync Portal**.

## 🛠️ The Traycer Loop

Traycer.ai is configured to automatically review new issues in this repository and suggest implementation steps.

### 1. Triggering Analysis
For Traycer to review an issue, it **MUST** be assigned to the repository owner.
- **Assignee**: `repairyourtech`
- Trigger: This assignment signals Traycer to analyze the issue description and provide a solution proposal.

### 2. The Analysis Wait
Once an issue is created and assigned:
- Traycer will typically respond with a comment within minutes.
- Wait for a comment from `@traycerai` (or similar bot identity) containing the technical breakdown.

### 3. Reviewing Suggestions & Agent Prompt Ingestion
Before starting work, you must ingest the implementation plan. Although the plan is visible in the GitHub UI, it is most efficiently consumed via the **GitHub CLI**:

- **Command**: `gh issue view <issue_number> --json comments --jq '.comments[-1].body'`
- **Key Asset**: Look for the **"🤖 Prompt for AI Agents"** section within the raw Markdown. This contains a high-fidelity technical plan, including file paths and Mermaid diagrams, which should be fed directly into your context.
- **Verification**: Even with Traycer's plan, ensure the proposed changes align with **OpenTUI patterns** and **Surgical Isolation** principles.

### 4. Iterating on the Plan
If Traycer's initial proposal needs refinement or if you have specific constraints to add:
- **Reply**: Post a comment on the issue starting with `@traycerai generate` followed by your refinement requests.
- **Trigger**: This command forces Traycer to re-evaluate the issue and update its suggested plan.
- **Repeat**: Re-run the CLI command above to ingest the updated prompt.

## 🐙 workflow Integration

1. **Submit Issue**: Use [submit-issue.md](file:///home/birdman/schem-sync-portal/.agent/workflows/submit-issue.md) to report a bug or suggest a feature.
2. **Review & Proceed**: Once Traycer responds, use [push-changes.md](file:///home/birdman/schem-sync-portal/.agent/workflows/push-changes.md) to implement the suggested fix.
