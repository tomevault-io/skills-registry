# PRISM Workflow Loop

TDD-driven workflow orchestration using the Ralph Wiggum self-referential loop pattern.

## Quick Start

1. Run `*prism-loop [your context/prompt]`
2. SM agent reviews previous notes and drafts story
3. SM agent verifies plan coverage against requirements
4. QA agent writes failing tests with traceability headers (TDD RED)
5. Red gate pauses for `/prism-approve`
6. DEV agent implements tasks (TDD GREEN)
7. QA verifies green state, green gate completes

## When to Use

- User wants to run the PRISM core development cycle
- Starting a new story implementation with TDD
- Need automated workflow progression with gates

## How It Works

1. **Stop Hook** intercepts session exit and re-injects the next step instruction
2. **Agent steps** auto-progress (SM → QA → DEV)
3. **Gate steps** pause for `/prism-approve` (or `/prism-reject` at red_gate)
4. **Validation** runs tests to verify TDD state (RED = fail, GREEN = pass)

## Workflow Steps (8 steps)

| # | Phase | Step | Agent | Type | Validation |
|---|-------|------|-------|------|------------|
| 1 | Planning | review_previous_notes | SM | agent | - |
| 2 | Planning | draft_story | SM | agent | story_complete |
| 3 | Planning | verify_plan | SM | agent | plan_coverage |
| 4 | TDD RED | write_failing_tests | QA | agent | red_with_trace |
| 5 | TDD RED | red_gate | - | **gate** | - |
| 6 | TDD GREEN | implement_tasks | DEV | agent | green |
| 7 | TDD GREEN | verify_green_state | QA | agent | green_full |
| 8 | TDD GREEN | green_gate | - | **gate** | - |

## Commands

### *prism-loop [prompt]

Start the PRISM workflow loop.

```bash
python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/prism-loop/scripts/setup_prism_loop.py" --session-id "${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}" "$ARGUMENTS"
```

The prompt provides context to the SM agent for planning.

**Example:**
```
*prism-loop implement user authentication feature
```

### *prism-approve

Approve the current gate and advance to next phase.

```bash
python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/prism-loop/scripts/prism_approve.py"
```

- At `red_gate`: Proceeds to GREEN phase (implementation)
- At `green_gate`: Completes workflow

### *prism-reject

Reject at red_gate and loop back to planning (step 1).

```bash
python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/prism-loop/scripts/prism_reject.py"
```

Only valid at `red_gate`. Use when tests need redesign.

### *prism-status

Check current workflow state.

```bash
python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/prism-loop/scripts/prism_status.py"
```

Shows progress through all 8 steps.

### *cancel-prism

Cancel the active workflow.

```bash
python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/prism-loop/scripts/cancel_prism_loop.py"
```

Removes state file and stops the loop.

## Requirements Traceability

The workflow enforces a traceability chain to prevent silent requirement drops:

```
User Request → Requirements → Acceptance Criteria → Tests
              (REQ-1, REQ-2)   (AC-1 → REQ-1)      (test_ac1 → AC-1)
```

### Capture and Validation Points

| Step | Validation | What's Checked |
|------|------------|----------------|
| review_previous_notes | - | Captures requirements in "## Original Requirements" section |
| draft_story | story_complete | Story file exists with ## Acceptance Criteria and AC items |
| verify_plan | plan_coverage | ## Plan Coverage section has zero MISSING requirements |
| write_failing_tests | red_with_trace | Tests fail with assertions + every AC has a mapped test |
| red_gate | - | Human reviews and approves RED state |

### Test Mapping Conventions

For the trace audit to find test coverage:

| Method | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Test name | `test_ac1_user_login()` |
| Comment | `# AC-1: Validates login` |
| Docstring | `"""Tests AC-1 login flow"""` |

If an AC has no mapped test, the workflow blocks with "SILENT DROP DETECTED".

### Trace Matrix at Red Gate

The red_gate displays a trace matrix for human verification:

```
## Trace Matrix
| REQ | AC | Test | Status |
|-----|-----|------|--------|
| REQ-1 | AC-1 | test_ac1_login | COVERED |
| REQ-2 | AC-2 | test_ac2_logout | COVERED |
```

This ensures no requirement silently disappears during implementation.

## TDD Validation

The stop hook validates before advancing:

- **draft_story** → Story file must exist with ## Acceptance Criteria containing AC items
- **verify_plan** → ## Plan Coverage section must exist with zero MISSING requirements
- **write_failing_tests** → Tests must FAIL (assertion errors, not syntax errors) + every AC must have a mapped test (blocks with "SILENT DROP DETECTED" otherwise)
- **implement_tasks** → All tests must PASS
- **verify_green_state** → Tests + lint must pass

Claude cannot "think" it's done - the hook runs tests to verify. The trace audit ensures every acceptance criterion has test coverage before proceeding to implementation.

## State File

Located at `.claude/prism-loop.local.md`

Tracks:
- `current_step`: Active step
- `current_step_index`: Position (0-7)
- `story_file`: Path to story file (set after draft_story)
- `paused_for_manual`: True at gates

## Integration

The stop hook is registered in `hooks/hooks.json`:

```json
{
  "Stop": [{
    "matcher": "*",
    "hooks": [{
      "type": "command",
      "command": "python ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/prism_stop_hook.py"
    }]
  }]
}
```

## Example Session

```bash
# Start workflow
*prism-loop implement login feature

# SM agent runs planning phases automatically
# QA writes failing tests
# Stop hook blocks until tests fail correctly

# At red_gate - approve to continue
*prism-approve

# DEV implements until tests pass
# QA verifies

# At green_gate - complete
*prism-approve

# Done!
```

## Triggers

This skill activates when you mention:
- "prism loop" or "prism workflow"
- "start development cycle"
- "TDD workflow" or "core development cycle"
- "/prism" or "/prism-loop"
