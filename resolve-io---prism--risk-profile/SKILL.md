# risk-profile

Generate a comprehensive risk assessment matrix for a story implementation using probability × impact analysis.

## When to Use

- During story planning to identify potential risks
- When assessing story complexity before estimation
- When creating mitigation strategies for high-risk features
- As part of comprehensive story review

## Quick Start

1. Provide story ID and path
2. Identify risks across categories (TECH, SEC, PERF, DATA, BUS, OPS)
3. Rate each risk by probability and impact
4. Generate risk matrix with mitigation strategies
5. Document testing focus areas based on risk levels

## Inputs

```yaml
required:
  - story_id: '{epic}.{story}' # e.g., "1.3"
  - story_path: 'docs/stories/{epic}.{story}.*.md'
  - story_title: '{title}' # If missing, derive from story file H1
  - story_slug: '{slug}' # If missing, derive from title (lowercase, hyphenated)
```

## Purpose

Identify, assess, and prioritize risks in the story implementation. Provide risk mitigation strategies and testing focus areas based on risk levels.

## Risk Assessment Framework

### Risk Categories

**Category Prefixes:**

- `TECH`: Technical Risks
- `SEC`: Security Risks

## Risk Analysis Process

### 1. Risk Identification

For each category, identify specific risks with E2E testing focus:

```yaml
risk:
  id: 'SEC-001' # Use prefixes: SEC, PERF, DATA, BUS, OPS, TECH
  category: security
  title: 'Multi-tenant authentication boundary violation'
  description: 'Cross-tenant access possible through compromised auth tokens or session hijacking'
  affected_components:
    - 'Authentication Service'
    - 'API Gateway'
    - 'Tenant Context Resolution'
  detection_method: 'E2E testing with multi-tenant scenarios'
  e2e_testable: true
  integration_scope: 'cross-service'
```

**E2E Integration Testing Priority Examples:**

```yaml
# Critical E2E Risks
risk:
  id: 'DATA-001'
  title: 'Cross-tenant data leakage through shared services'
  e2e_validation: 'Complete tenant isolation workflows'
  test_scenarios:
    - 'Tenant A cannot access Tenant B data through any API endpoint'
    - 'Database connections properly isolated by tenant context'
    - 'Shared services maintain tenant boundaries'

risk:
  id: 'SEC-002'
  title: 'API endpoint authentication bypass'
  e2e_validation: 'End-to-end authentication workflows'
  test_scenarios:
    - 'Expired tokens properly rejected across all services'
    - 'Service-to-service auth maintained throughout request chain'
    - 'Token refresh cycles work across integrated services'

risk:
  id: 'TECH-001'
  title: 'Container orchestration dependency failure'
  e2e_validation: 'Full deployment and runtime scenarios'
  test_scenarios:
    - 'Service mesh communication under container restarts'
    - 'Database connections survive container scaling events'
    - 'Load balancing maintains service availability'
```

### 2. Risk Assessment

Evaluate each risk using probability Ã— impact:

**Probability Levels:**

- `High (3)`: Likely to occur (>70% chance)
- `Medium (2)`: Possible occurrence (30-70% chance)
- `Low (1)`: Unlikely to occur (<30% chance)

**Impact Levels:**

- `High (3)`: Severe consequences (data breach, system down, major financial loss)
- `Medium (2)`: Moderate consequences (degraded performance, minor data issues)
- `Low (1)`: Minor consequences (cosmetic issues, slight inconvenience)

### Risk Score = Probability Ã— Impact

- 9: Critical Risk (Red)
- 6: High Risk (Orange)
- 4: Medium Risk (Yellow)
- 2-3: Low Risk (Green)
- 1: Minimal Risk (Blue)

### 3. Risk Prioritization

Create risk matrix:

```markdown
## Risk Matrix

| Risk ID  | Description             | Probability | Impact     | Score | Priority |
| -------- | ----------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----- | -------- |
| SEC-001  | XSS vulnerability       | High (3)    | High (3)   | 9     | Critical |
| PERF-001 | Slow query on dashboard | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   |
| DATA-001 | Backup failure          | Low (1)     | High (3)   | 3     | Low      |
```

### 4. Risk Mitigation Strategies

**E2E Integration Testing as Primary Mitigation**

For integration-testable risks, E2E tests provide the most comprehensive mitigation:

```yaml
mitigation:
  risk_id: 'SEC-001'
  strategy: 'preventive' # preventive|detective|corrective
  primary_mitigation: 'E2E Integration Testing'
  actions:
    - 'Implement comprehensive multi-tenant E2E test suites'
    - 'Add tenant boundary validation in all API endpoints'
    - 'Create cross-service authentication test scenarios'
    - 'Implement tenant context isolation verification'
  testing_requirements:
    - 'E2E multi-tenant isolation tests (CRITICAL)'
    - 'Cross-service authentication flow validation'
    - 'API endpoint security boundary testing'
    - 'Database connection tenant isolation verification'
    - 'Container orchestration failure recovery testing'
  e2e_coverage:
    - 'Complete tenant lifecycle workflows'
    - 'Authentication/authorization across all services'
    - 'Data isolation under various load conditions'
    - 'Service-to-service communication security'
  residual_risk: 'Low - E2E tests validate complete system behavior'
  owner: 'qa'
  timeline: 'Continuous - with every integration'
```

**E2E Testing Mitigation Priorities:**

1. **Critical Risks (Score 9)** - Must have comprehensive E2E coverage

## Risk Scoring Algorithm

Calculate overall story risk score:

```text
Base Score = 100
For each risk:
  - Critical (9): Deduct 20 points
  - High (6): Deduct 10 points
  - Medium (4): Deduct 5 points
  - Low (2-3): Deduct 2 points

Minimum score = 0 (extremely risky)
Maximum score = 100 (minimal risk)
```

## Key Principles

**E2E Integration Risk Assessment Focus:**

- **Prioritize Integration-Testable Risks**: Focus on risks best validated through complete system workflows
- **Multi-Tenant Security First**: Tenant isolation and cross-tenant security as highest priority

- **Authentication/Authorization Flows**: Complete auth workflows across all service boundaries
- **Database Multi-Tenancy**: Data isolation and connection management under realistic load
- **API Gateway Security**: End-to-end request routing and security enforcement validation

**Risk Assessment Process:**
- Identify risks early with E2E testing capability in mind
- Use consistent probability Ã— impact scoring with integration complexity weighting
- Provide E2E test-focused mitigation strategies as primary approach
- Link risks to specific E2E integration test scenarios and coverage requirements
- Track residual risk after comprehensive E2E integration testing
- Update risk profile as system integration complexity evolves

**E2E Testing as Risk Mitigation:**
- E2E integration tests provide highest confidence for cross-system risks
- Multi-tenant scenarios validate most critical security and data isolation risks  
- Service integration testing catches risks that unit/component tests cannot detect
- Container orchestration testing validates infrastructure dependency risks
- Complete workflow testing ensures business continuity under failure conditions
