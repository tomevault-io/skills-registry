# Build Skills Using Progressive Disclosure

## When to Use

- Creating a new Claude Code skill from scratch
- Optimizing an existing skill for token efficiency
- Learning progressive disclosure, dynamic manifests, or deferred loading patterns
- Need templates, checklists, or troubleshooting for skill development
- Want to understand the three-level loading pattern (metadata → body → bundled)

## What This Skill Does

**Guides you through building efficient Claude Code skills** that follow best practices:

- **Progressive Disclosure**: Structure skills in * levels (metadata, body, bundled, *)
- **Token Optimization**: Keep metadata ~100 tokens, body <2k tokens, details in bundled files
- **Templates**: Copy-paste ready SKILL.md templates and structure examples
- **Process**: Step-by-step guide from planning to deployment
- **Patterns**: Deep dives into progressive disclosure, dynamic manifests, deferred loading

## 🎯 Core Principle: The 3-Level Pattern

**Every skill loads in three levels:**

| Level | File | Loaded When | Token Limit | What Goes Here |
|-------|------|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| **1** | SKILL.md Metadata (YAML) | Always | ~100 | Name, description, version |
| **2** | SKILL.md Body (Markdown) | Skill triggers | <5k (<2k recommended) | Quick ref, core instructions, links to Level 3 |
| **3** | Bundled files in `/reference/` | As-needed by Claude | Unlimited | Detailed docs, scripts, examples, specs |

**Key rules**:
1. SKILL.md is a **table of contents**, not a comprehensive manual
2. **ALL reference .md files MUST be in `/reference/` folder** (not root!)
3. Link to them as `./reference/filename.md` from SKILL.md
4. Move details to Level 3 files that Claude loads only when referenced

**Critical Structure:**
```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md              # ✅ Level 1+2: Only .md in root
├── reference/            # ✅ REQUIRED: All reference .md files HERE
│   ├── detail1.md
│   └── detail2.md
└── scripts/              # Executable tools
```

## Quick Start

### Building Your First Skill (Recommended)

1. **Read the 3-level table above** (30 seconds)
2. **Scan the template**: [Quick Reference](./reference/quick-reference.md) (3 min)
3. **Follow the process**: [Skill Creation Process](./reference/skill-creation-process.md) (3-5 hours)
   - Phase 1: Planning (30 min)
   - Phase 2: Structure (15 min)
   - Phase 3: Implementation (2-4 hours) with full `incident-triage` example
   - Phase 4: Testing (30 min)
   - Phase 5: Refinement (ongoing)

**Result**: A working skill following best practices

### Quick Lookup (While Building)

Need a template or checklist right now?

→ [Quick Reference](./reference/quick-reference.md) - Templates, checklists, common pitfalls

### Learn the Patterns (Deep Dive)

Want to understand the architectural patterns?

1. [Philosophy](./reference/philosophy.md) - Why these patterns matter (10 min)
2. [Progressive Disclosure](./reference/progressive-disclosure.md) - Reveal info gradually (~1.4k tokens)
3. [Dynamic Manifests](./reference/dynamic-manifests.md) - Runtime capability discovery (~1.9k tokens)
4. [Deferred Loading](./reference/deferred-loading.md) - Lazy initialization (~2.2k tokens)

## Inputs

This skill doesn't require specific inputs. Use it when:
- User asks to "create a skill" or "build a skill"
- User mentions "progressive disclosure" or "token optimization"
- User needs help with SKILL.md structure
- User asks about best practices for Claude Code skills

## Outputs

Provides guidance, templates, and examples for:
- SKILL.md metadata and body structure
- **Folder layout with REQUIRED `/reference/` folder** for all reference .md files
- Token budgets per level
- Copy-paste templates
- Working code examples (incident-triage)
- Structure validation checklist
- Troubleshooting common issues

## ⚠️ Critical Requirement: /reference/ Folder

**Before creating any skill, understand this:**

✅ **CORRECT Structure:**
```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md              # Only .md in root
├── reference/            # ALL reference docs go HERE
│   ├── api-spec.md
│   ├── examples.md
│   └── advanced.md
└── scripts/
```

❌ **WRONG Structure:**
```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md
├── api-spec.md           # ❌ Should be in reference/
├── examples.md           # ❌ Should be in reference/
└── scripts/
```

**This hierarchy is MANDATORY for:**
1. Token optimization (Claude loads only what's needed)
2. Consistency across all skills
3. Clear separation of concerns (Level 2 vs Level 3)

## Available Reference Files

All detailed content lives in bundled files (Level 3):

- **[Quick Reference](./reference/quick-reference.md)** (~1k tokens) - Templates, checklists, metadata examples
- **[Philosophy](./reference/philosophy.md)** (~700 tokens) - Why patterns matter, learning paths
- **[Skill Creation Process](./reference/skill-creation-process.md)** (~5.5k tokens) - Complete step-by-step guide
- **[Progressive Disclosure](./reference/progressive-disclosure.md)** (~1.4k tokens) - Pattern deep dive
- **[Dynamic Manifests](./reference/dynamic-manifests.md)** (~1.9k tokens) - Runtime discovery pattern
- **[Deferred Loading](./reference/deferred-loading.md)** (~2.2k tokens) - Lazy loading pattern

## Common Questions

**Q: Where do I start?**
A: Read the [3-level table](#core-principle-the-3-level-pattern) above, then follow [Skill Creation Process](./reference/skill-creation-process.md)

**Q: My SKILL.md is too long. What do I do?**
A: Move details to `reference/*.md` files (Level 3). Keep SKILL.md body <2k tokens.

**Q: How do I make my skill trigger correctly?**
A: Use specific keywords in the description (Level 1 metadata). See [Quick Reference](./reference/quick-reference.md#metadata-best-practices)

**Q: Can I see a complete working example?**
A: Yes! See the `incident-triage` example in [Skill Creation Process](./reference/skill-creation-process.md)

## Guardrails

- **ALWAYS enforce `/reference/` folder structure** - reference .md files MUST NOT be in root
- **Validate folder structure** before considering a skill complete
- Focus on **creating skills**, not using existing skills
- Emphasize **token optimization**: ~100 (L1), <2k (L2), unlimited (L3)
- Always recommend **scripts for deterministic logic** instead of generated code
- Remind about **environment variables** for credentials (never hardcode)
- Point to **working examples** (incident-triage) rather than abstract explanations
- **Catch and fix** skills with reference files in root directory

## Triggers

This skill should activate when user mentions:
- "create a skill" or "build a skill"
- "progressive disclosure"
- "token optimization" or "token limits"
- "SKILL.md" or "skill structure"
- "best practices" for Claude Code skills
- "how to organize a skill"
- "skill creation process"

## Validation

**NEW: Automated Skill Validator**

Use the included validation script to check your skill before deployment:

```bash
# Install dependencies (first time only)
cd .claude/skill-builder/scripts
npm install

# Validate your skill
node validate-skill.js /path/to/your/skill
node validate-skill.js .  # validate current directory
```

The validator checks:
- ✓ YAML frontmatter format and syntax
- ✓ Required fields (name, description)
- ✓ Description specificity and triggers
- ✓ Token budgets (metadata ~100, body <2k)
- ✓ File structure (/reference/ folder compliance)
- ✓ No stray .md files in root
- ✓ Path format (forward slashes)
- ✓ Referenced files exist

See: [Validation Script](./scripts/validate-skill.js)

## Testing

To test this skill:
```bash
# Ask Claude:
"Help me create a new Claude Code skill for incident triage"
"What are best practices for skill token optimization?"
"Show me a SKILL.md template"
```

Verify the skill:
- [ ] Provides the 3-level table
- [ ] Links to appropriate reference files
- [ ] Emphasizes token limits
- [ ] Shows working examples
- [ ] Guides through the process
- [ ] Passes automated validation (run validate-skill.js)
