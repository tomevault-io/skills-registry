# RevenueCat Status

Get a quick overview of your RevenueCat project configuration.

## Description

This command provides a summary of your RevenueCat project including:
- Number of apps and their platforms
- Total products configured
- Entitlements defined
- Offerings and their packages
- Webhook integrations

## Usage

```
/rc:status [project_name]
```

**Arguments:**
- `project_name` (optional): Name of the project to show status for. If not provided, shows status for all accessible projects.

Can be referenced as `$ARGUMENTS` in the skill.

## Instructions

When the user invokes this skill, perform the following steps:

1. **Parse Arguments** (from $ARGUMENTS)
   - Extract `project_name` (optional)
   - Project name matching is case-insensitive and supports partial matches

2. **Get Projects**
   - Call `mcp_RC_get_project` to retrieve all accessible projects
   - If `project_name` is specified in arguments, filter projects by name (case-insensitive partial match)
   - If no matching project found, inform the user and list available projects
   - If no `project_name` provided, show status for all projects

3. **Gather Statistics for Each Project**
   For each project (filtered or all):
   - Call `mcp_RC_list_apps` with the project_id
   - Call `mcp_RC_list_products` with the project_id
   - Call `mcp_RC_list_entitlements` with the project_id
   - Call `mcp_RC_list_offerings` with the project_id
   - Call `mcp_RC_list_webhook_integrations` with the project_id

4. **Present Summary**
   Format the results as a clear status report:

   ```
   📊 RevenueCat Project Status

      ...

   🔗 Webhooks: {count}
      - {webhook_name} → {url}

   ```

5. **Highlight Issues** (if any)
