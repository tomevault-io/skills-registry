- **Tilt Up/Down** - Camera rotates vertically
- **Zoom In/Out** - Lens focal length change

**Advanced Movements:**

- **Snorricam** - Camera mounted to subject's body

## Usage Guidelines

**One Movement Per Beat:** Each timed beat should have ONE dominant camera movement to avoid conflicts.

**Precision Terminology:** Use exact terms from vocabulary to ensure machine interpretation accuracy.

**Conflict Prevention:**
- ❌ WRONG: "Dolly in while arc left" (conflicting movements)
- ✅ CORRECT: "Dolly in" OR "Arc left" (choose one)
