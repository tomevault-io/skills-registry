# Content Verification Skill

Verify workshop or demo content against Red Hat quality standards, style guidelines, technical accuracy, and accessibility requirements.

## When to Use

**Use this skill when you want to**:
- Verify workshop content before publishing
- Check demo modules for quality and completeness
- Validate technical accuracy and Red Hat style compliance
- Review content for accessibility standards
- Get actionable feedback on content improvements

**Don't use this for**:
- Creating new content → use `/create-lab` or `/create-demo`
- Converting between formats → use `/blog-generate`

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify Content Type

**Q: What type of content are you verifying?**

Options:
1. Workshop module (hands-on lab content)
2. Demo module (presenter-led demonstration)
3. Multiple files (specify pattern)

### Step 2: Locate Content

**For single file**:
- Provide file path (e.g., `content/modules/ROOT/pages/module-01-install-aap.adoc`)

**For multiple files**:
- Provide glob pattern (e.g., `content/modules/ROOT/pages/*.adoc`)
- Or directory path (e.g., `content/modules/ROOT/pages/`)

### Step 3: Run Verification Agents

I'll run comprehensive verification using these validation frameworks:

**For Workshop Content**:
1. `enhanced_verification_workshop.txt` - Overall quality assessment
2. `redhat_style_guide_validation.txt` - Red Hat style compliance
3. `verify_workshop_structure.txt` - Workshop structure validation
4. `verify_technical_accuracy_workshop.txt` - Technical accuracy
5. `verify_accessibility_compliance_workshop.txt` - Accessibility standards
6. `verify_content_quality.txt` - General content quality

**For Demo Content**:
1. `enhanced_verification_demo.txt` - Overall demo quality
2. `redhat_style_guide_validation.txt` - Red Hat style compliance
3. `verify_technical_accuracy_demo.txt` - Demo technical accuracy
4. `verify_accessibility_compliance_demo.txt` - Accessibility standards
5. `verify_content_quality.txt` - General content quality

### Step 4: Present Results

I'll provide:

**Summary Report**:
- Overall quality score
- Critical issues (must fix)
- Warnings (should fix)
- Recommendations (nice to have)

**Detailed Findings**:
- Specific file locations
- Before/after examples
- Implementation steps
- Priority levels

**Actionable Items**:
- Numbered list of fixes
- Links to relevant documentation
- Estimated effort level

### Step 5: Offer Fixes (Optional)

After showing results, I can:
- Apply fixes automatically (with your approval)
- Provide code snippets for manual fixes
- Explain why each change improves quality

## Example Usage

### Example 1: Verify Single Workshop Module

```
User: /verify-content

Skill: What type of content are you verifying?
User: Workshop module

Skill: File path?
User: content/modules/ROOT/pages/module-01-install-aap.adoc

[Runs all workshop verification agents]

Skill:
📊 Verification Results for module-01-install-aap.adoc

**Overall Score**: 82/100

1. Missing verification commands in Exercise 2 (line 145)
2. Incorrect Red Hat product name: "OCP" should be "Red Hat OpenShift" (line 67)
3. Missing alt text for screenshot placeholder (line 203)

**Warnings** (5):
1. Troubleshooting section could be more comprehensive
2. Learning outcomes section recommended but missing
3. Some commands lack expected output examples

**Recommendations** (2):
1. Add time estimates for each exercise
2. Include references section with documentation links

[Scans and finds 3 modules + index/overview]

Skill: Found 5 files:
- index.adoc
- 01-overview.adoc
- 02-details.adoc
- module-01-install-aap.adoc
- module-02-configure-aap.adoc

Verify all? [Yes/Select specific files]

User: Yes

[Runs verification on all files]

Skill:
📊 Batch Verification Results

**Summary**:
- 5 files verified

**Impact**: Learners can't verify success, leading to confusion

**Current**:
```asciidoc
. Deploy the AutomationController:
```

**Fixed**:
```asciidoc
. Deploy the AutomationController:
+
[source,bash]
----
oc get automationcontroller -n ansible-automation-platform
----
+
Expected output:
----
