# Content Verification Skill

Verify workshop or demo content against Red Hat quality standards, style guidelines, technical accuracy, and scaffold requirements. Runs all checks silently, then presents one consolidated findings table. User picks which issue to fix first.

## Workflow

### Phase 1 — Auto-detect (silent, no questions)

Check CWD for Showroom structure:

- `content/modules/ROOT/pages/` exists and contains `.adoc` files → use it, proceed silently

**If CWD is not a Showroom repo**, output:

```
📁 No Showroom content found in [CWD].

Provide a local path or GitHub URL:
```

Wait for user response:

- **Local path** (e.g. `~/work/showroom-content/my-lab-showroom`) → use it, proceed
- **GitHub URL** (e.g. `https://github.com/rhpds/my-lab-showroom`) → ask:
  ```
  Clone to /tmp/my-lab-showroom? Or enter a different path:
  ```
  User confirms or says nothing → clone to `/tmp/[repo-name]` and proceed.
  User provides a different path → clone there and proceed.

**Never scan directories or list repos from `~/CLAUDE.md` or `~/work/showroom-content/`.** The user knows what they want to verify — just let them say it.

Detect content type from file structure (no questions):
- Has `=== Verify` sections or numbered exercise steps → Workshop
- Has Know/Show structure, presenter notes → Demo
- Cannot determine → default to Workshop

Confirm detection in one line:
```
📋 Verified: Workshop content in content/modules/ROOT/pages/ (6 files). Running all checks...
```

Then run all checks silently.

---

### Phase 2 — Run All Checks (silent)

Run every check below without pausing or outputting intermediate results. Collect all findings. Output nothing until all checks are complete.

All checks run inline. Before running content checks, read the appropriate prompt files based on detected content type — these are the source of truth for each pass.

**For a workshop, read:**
- `@showroom/prompts/enhanced_verification_workshop.txt`
- `@showroom/prompts/verify_workshop_structure.txt`
- `@showroom/prompts/verify_technical_accuracy_workshop.txt`
- `@showroom/prompts/verify_accessibility_compliance_workshop.txt`
- `@showroom/prompts/redhat_style_guide_validation.txt`

**For a demo, read:**
- `@showroom/prompts/enhanced_verification_demo.txt`
- `@showroom/prompts/verify_technical_accuracy_demo.txt`
- `@showroom/prompts/verify_accessibility_compliance_demo.txt`
- `@showroom/prompts/redhat_style_guide_validation.txt`

Read all relevant prompts first, then run all checks in one pass. Collect every finding. Output nothing until Phase 3.

#### Scaffold Checks (S)

Check all scaffold files in repo root and `content/`. Collect findings — do NOT block or pause.

**S.1 — Antora playbook** (`site.yml` or `default-site.yml`):

| State | Severity |
|---|---|
| `site.yml` present | — proceed |
| `default-site.yml` only (no `site.yml`) | High — rename to `site.yml`: `mv default-site.yml site.yml` then update `.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml` |
| Both present | High — remove `default-site.yml` |
| Neither present | Critical — no playbook found |

Fields to check in whichever file exists:

| Field | Fail condition | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| `site.title` | Stale/template value (`Workshop Title`, `Lab Title`, `Showroom Template`, `Red Hat Showroom`, `My Workshop`, `Template`, `showroom_template_nookbag`, empty, or matches repo directory name) | High |
| `site.start_page` | Not `modules::index.adoc` | High |
| `ui.bundle.url` | Missing or empty | High |
| `ui.supplemental_files` | Not `./supplemental-ui` | High |
| `runtime.fetch` | Not `true` | Medium |

**S.2 — `ui-config.yml`**:

Detect infra type silently from content:
- Contains `console-openshift-console` or `rhods-dashboard` → OCP
- Contains `/wetty` with `port:` or AAP/Cockpit URLs → VM
- Cannot determine → note as Unknown, continue

| Field | Fail condition | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| File missing | — | Critical |
| `type: showroom` | Missing | High |
| `view_switcher.enabled` | Not `true` | High |
| `view_switcher.default_mode` | Not `split` | Medium |
| `persist_url_state` | Not `true` | Medium |
| tabs section | No uncommented tabs | High |

**S.3 — `content/antora.yml`**:

| Field | Fail condition | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| File missing | — | Critical |
| `title` | Stale/template value | High |
| `name` | Not `modules` | High |
| `start_page` | Not `index.adoc` | High |
| `nav` | Doesn't reference `modules/ROOT/nav.adoc` | High |
| `asciidoc.attributes.lab_name` | Missing or stale | High |

**S.4 — `.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml`**:

| State | Severity |
|---|---|
| File missing | Critical |
| Workflow references wrong playbook filename | Critical |

Also note: GitHub Pages must be enabled in repo Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions.

**S.5 — `content/supplemental-ui/`**:

Missing `css/site-extra.css` or `partials/head-meta.hbs` → High.

| B.4 | `02-details.adoc` present | Missing | High |
| B.5 | Workshop: at least one hands-on module (`03-*` or higher). Demo: at least one Know/Show module | None found | Critical |
| B.6 | `nav.adoc` lists all module files | Any `.adoc` not in nav | High |

| B.8 | Workshop: each module has ≥3 learning objectives. Demo: skip (Know sections provide context instead) | Missing or fewer than 3 | High |
| B.9 | Workshop: each module has ≥2 exercises. Demo: skip (Know/Show modules have no exercises by design) | Fewer than 2 | High |
| B.10 | Exercise steps use numbered lists (`.`) | Using bullets (`*`) for steps | Medium |
| B.11 | Learning objectives use bullets (`*`) | Using numbers for objectives | Medium |
| B.12 | Workshop: every exercise has a `=== Verify` section. Demo: skip (no exercises) | Missing after any exercise | High |
| B.13 | No `== References` in individual modules | Present in any module | Medium |
| B.14 | Conclusion has `== What You've Learned` | Missing | High |
| B.15 | Conclusion has `== References` | Missing | Medium |

#### Pass F — Demo-specific (skip entirely if workshop)

---

### Phase 3 — Present Findings Table

After all checks complete, output **one table** containing every finding. Nothing else before this table.

Format:

```
## Verification Results

| # | ID | Issue | Severity | Location |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | S.1 | site.title is a template default — update to your lab name | High | site.yml:3 |
| 2 | B.5 | No hands-on module found (no 03-*.adoc or higher) | Critical | pages/ |
| 3 | C.5 | Code block missing language identifier | High | module-01.adoc:47 |
| 4 | D.2 | "AAP" used without first-use expansion | High | 01-overview.adoc:12 |
| 5 | E.4 | Hardcoded cluster URL found | Critical | module-02.adoc:88 |
...

**Total: X issues — Y Critical, Z High, N Medium, M Low**
```

Sort order: Critical first, then High, Medium, Low. Within each severity, scaffold (S) before content (B–F).

If zero findings:
```
✅ No issues found. Content passes all checks.
```

Then ask:

```
Which issue do you want to fix first? (Enter the number, e.g. "3")
Or say "all critical" to fix all Critical issues, "all high" for all High, or "skip" to finish.
```

---

### Phase 4 — Fix Loop

When the user picks an issue:

1. Show the specific fix:
   - What the current content is (BEFORE)
   - What it should be (AFTER)
   - Why the change is needed (one sentence)
2. Apply the fix
3. Confirm: "Fixed #3. X issues remaining."
4. Re-show the remaining table (with fixed items removed)
5. Ask: "Which one next?"

Repeat until the user says "done", "skip", or there are no issues left.

**Never fix multiple issues at once unless the user explicitly says "all critical" or similar.**

---

#### Special fix — E.3a: missing `role="execute"` (bulk replace)

This issue is common in repos originally cloned from `showroom_template_nookbag` before the `role="execute"` standard was introduced. The fix is a bulk find/replace across all module files.

When E.3a is selected:

1. Inform the user:
   ```
   This fix will replace [source,bash] → [source,role="execute"] across all
   .adoc files in content/modules/ROOT/pages/.

   It will NOT touch [source,bash] lines that appear inside [source,asciidoc]
   or [source,text] documentation blocks (those are showing syntax examples,
   not student commands).

   Apply bulk fix to all module files? [Y/n]
   ```

2. If YES — use the Edit tool to replace in each module file:
   - Target: `[source,bash]` on its own line (not inside another source block)
   - Replacement: `[source,role="execute"]`
   - Skip any `.adoc` files where the line appears inside a `[source,asciidoc]----...----` fence

3. Report:
   ```
   Fixed: replaced [source,bash] → [source,role="execute"] in N files (M occurrences).
   ```
