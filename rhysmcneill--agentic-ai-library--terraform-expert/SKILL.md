description: Terraform and Infrastructure as Code optimization guidelines from Terramate. This skill should be used when writing, reviewing, or refactoring Terraform/OpenTofu code to ensure optimal patterns for security, maintainability, and reliability. Triggers on tasks involving Terraform modules, infrastructure provisioning, state management, or IaC optimization. Use when this capability is needed.

# Terraform Expert

Comprehensive optimization guide for Terraform and Infrastructure as Code, maintained by Terramate. Contains 37 rules across 10 categories, prioritized by impact to guide automated refactoring and code generation.

## When to Apply

Reference these guidelines when:
- Writing new Terraform modules or configurations
- Implementing infrastructure patterns (AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.)
- Reviewing code for security and reliability issues
- Refactoring existing Terraform/OpenTofu code
- Optimizing state management and performance
- Setting up team workflows and governance

## Rule Categories by Priority

| Priority | Category | Impact | Prefix |
|----------|----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Organization & Workflow | CRITICAL | `org-` |
| 2 | State Management | CRITICAL | `state-` |
| 3 | Security Best Practices | CRITICAL | `security-` |
| 4 | Module Design | HIGH | `module-` |
| 5 | Resource Organization | MEDIUM-HIGH | `resource-` |
| 6 | Variable & Output Patterns | MEDIUM | `variable-`, `output-` |
| 7 | Language Best Practices | MEDIUM | `language-` |
| 8 | Provider Configuration | MEDIUM | `provider-` |
| 9 | Performance Optimization | LOW-MEDIUM | `perf-` |
| 10 | Testing & Validation | LOW | `test-` |

## Quick Reference

### 1. Organization & Workflow (CRITICAL) - 5 rules

- `org-version-control` — All Terraform code in version control
- `org-workspaces` — One workspace per environment per configuration
- `org-access-control` — Control who can change what infrastructure
- `org-change-workflow` — Formal process for infrastructure changes
- `org-audit-logging` — Track all infrastructure changes

### 2. State Management (CRITICAL) - 3 rules

- `state-remote-backend` — Always use remote state backends
- `state-locking` — Enable state locking to prevent corruption
- `state-import` — Import existing infrastructure into Terraform

### 3. Security Best Practices (CRITICAL) - 3 rules

- `security-no-hardcoded-secrets` — Never hardcode secrets in code
- `security-credentials` — Use proper credential management (OIDC, Vault, IAM roles)
- `security-iam-least-privilege` — Follow least privilege principle

### 4. Module Design (HIGH) - 5 rules

- `module-single-responsibility` — One module per logical component
- `module-naming` — Use consistent naming conventions (`terraform-<provider>-<name>`)
- `module-versioning` — Version all module references
- `module-composition` — Compose modules like building blocks
- `module-registry` — Use existing community/shared modules

### 5. Resource Organization (MEDIUM-HIGH) - 5 rules

- `resource-naming` — Use consistent naming conventions
- `resource-tagging` — Tag all resources for cost tracking
- `resource-lifecycle` — Use lifecycle blocks (`prevent_destroy`, `ignore_changes`)
- `resource-count-vs-foreach` — Prefer `for_each` over `count`
- `resource-immutable` — Prefer immutable infrastructure patterns

### 6. Variable & Output Patterns (MEDIUM) - 6 rules

- `variable-types` — Use specific types, positive naming, nullable
- `variable-validation` — Add validation rules for early error detection
- `variable-sensitive` — Mark secrets as sensitive, no defaults
- `variable-descriptions` — Document all variables with descriptions
- `output-descriptions` — Document all outputs with descriptions
- `output-no-secrets` — Never output secrets directly

### 7. Language Best Practices (MEDIUM) - 5 rules

- `language-no-heredoc-json` — Use `jsonencode`/`yamlencode`, not HEREDOC
- `language-locals` — Use locals to name complex expressions
- `language-linting` — Run `terraform fmt` and `tflint`
- `language-data-sources` — Use data sources instead of hardcoding
- `language-dynamic-blocks` — Use dynamic blocks for DRY code

### 8. Provider Configuration (MEDIUM) - 1 rule

- `provider-version-constraints` — Pin provider versions

### 9. Performance Optimization (LOW-MEDIUM) - 2 rules

- `perf-parallelism` — Tune parallelism for large deployments
- `perf-debug` — Enable debug logging for troubleshooting

### 10. Testing & Validation (LOW) - 2 rules

- `test-strategies` — Testing pyramid (validate, lint, plan, integration)
- `test-policy-as-code` — Implement policy checks (OPA, Checkov, tfsec)

## How to Use

Apply rules by ID when reviewing or generating code. Each rule ID maps to a specific pattern:

- **CRITICAL rules** — always apply, block merges if violated
- **HIGH rules** — apply by default, require explicit override to skip
- **MEDIUM rules** — apply for new code; flag but don't block existing code
- **LOW rules** — apply opportunistically during refactors

Read individual rule files in `references/` for detailed explanations and code examples:

```
references/state-remote-backend.md
references/security-no-hardcoded-secrets.md
references/module-versioning.md
```

See `references/rule-index.md` for the full list of all 37 rules mapped to their local files.
