## Common Patterns

### Self-Learning Workflow
```bash
# Before editing
npx @claude-flow/cli@latest hooks pre-edit --file src/auth.ts

# After editing
npx @claude-flow/cli@latest hooks post-edit --file src/auth.ts --success

# View what was learned
npx @claude-flow/cli@latest hooks metrics
```

### Pretrain from Repository
```bash
# Bootstrap intelligence
npx @claude-flow/cli@latest hooks pretrain

# Generate agent configs
npx @claude-flow/cli@latest hooks build-agents
```

### Model Routing
```bash
# Route to optimal model
npx @claude-flow/cli@latest hooks model-route

# Record outcome
npx @claude-flow/cli@latest hooks model-outcome

# View stats
npx @claude-flow/cli@latest hooks model-stats
```

## Key Options

- `--file`: File path for edit hooks
- `--command`: Command string for command hooks
- `--task`: Task description for task hooks
- `--success`: Mark outcome as successful
- `--exit-code`: Command exit code
- `--verbose`: Enable verbose output

## Programmatic API
```typescript
import { HooksSystem, ReasoningBank } from '@claude-flow/hooks';

// Initialize hooks
const hooks = new HooksSystem();

// Pre-task hook
const suggestions = await hooks.preTask({ task: 'implement auth' });

// Post-task learning
await hooks.postTask({ task: 'implement auth', success: true });

// Route task
const agent = await hooks.route({ task: 'fix performance bug' });
```
