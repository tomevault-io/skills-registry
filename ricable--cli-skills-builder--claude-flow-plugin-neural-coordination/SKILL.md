# CF Plugin Neural Coordination

Neural coordination plugin for multi-agent swarm intelligence using Self-Optimizing Neural Architecture (SONA), Graph Neural Networks (GNN), and attention mechanisms to optimize agent communication and decision-making.

## Quick Command Reference

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Enable plugin | `npx @claude-flow/cli@latest plugins toggle --enable neural-coordination` |
| Disable plugin | `npx @claude-flow/cli@latest plugins toggle --disable neural-coordination` |
| Plugin info | `npx @claude-flow/cli@latest plugins info neural-coordination` |
| List tools | `npx @claude-flow/cli@latest mcp tools` |
| Check status | `npx @claude-flow/cli@latest plugins list` |

## Installation

**Via claude-flow**: Already included with `npx @claude-flow/cli@latest init`
**Standalone**: `npx @claude-flow/plugin-neural-coordination@latest`

## Activation

```bash
# Enable the plugin
npx @claude-flow/cli@latest plugins toggle --enable neural-coordination

# Verify activation
npx @claude-flow/cli@latest plugins info neural-coordination
```

## Plugin Capabilities

### SONA (Self-Optimizing Neural Architecture)
Adapts agent communication patterns in real-time (<0.05ms) based on task characteristics and agent performance, automatically adjusting routing weights.

```bash
npx @claude-flow/cli@latest mcp exec neural-coordination.sona \
  --swarm-id my-swarm --action optimize --learning-rate 0.001
```

### GNN (Graph Neural Network)
Models agent interactions as a graph and applies message-passing neural networks to learn optimal coordination strategies, improving context retrieval accuracy by ~12%.

```bash
npx @claude-flow/cli@latest mcp exec neural-coordination.gnn \
  --swarm-id my-swarm --layers 3 --action predict-routing
```

### Attention Mechanisms
Multi-head attention over agent outputs for weighted consensus, flash attention for large swarms (2.5-7.5x speedup), and cross-attention for inter-agent communication.

```bash
npx @claude-flow/cli@latest mcp exec neural-coordination.attention \
  --swarm-id my-swarm --mode flash --heads 8
```

### Swarm Topology Optimization
Analyzes current swarm topology and suggests optimal restructuring based on communication patterns and task requirements.

```bash
npx @claude-flow/cli@latest mcp exec neural-coordination.topology \
  --swarm-id my-swarm --suggest --constraint latency
```

## Common Patterns

### Optimize Swarm Communication
```bash
npx @claude-flow/cli@latest plugins toggle --enable neural-coordination
npx @claude-flow/cli@latest mcp exec neural-coordination.sona \
  --swarm-id my-swarm --action optimize
npx @claude-flow/cli@latest mcp exec neural-coordination.topology \
  --swarm-id my-swarm --suggest
```

### Neural-Enhanced Consensus
```bash
npx @claude-flow/cli@latest mcp exec neural-coordination.attention \
  --swarm-id my-swarm --mode flash --consensus weighted
```

### Train GNN on Historical Swarm Data
```bash
npx @claude-flow/cli@latest mcp exec neural-coordination.gnn \
  --action train --data swarm-history.json --epochs 50
npx @claude-flow/cli@latest mcp exec neural-coordination.gnn \
  --swarm-id my-swarm --action predict-routing
```
