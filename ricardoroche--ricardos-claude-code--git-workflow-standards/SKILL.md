# Git Workflow Standards

When working with git, follow these patterns for consistent, professional version control.

**Trigger Keywords**: git, commit, branch, pull request, PR, merge, release, version control, conventional commits, semantic versioning

**Agent Integration**: Used by `backend-architect`, `devops-engineer`, `release-manager`

## ✅ Correct Pattern: Conventional Commits

```bash
# Format: <type>(<scope>): <description>
#
# Types:
# - feat: New feature
# - fix: Bug fix
# - docs: Documentation only
# - style: Code style (formatting, semicolons)
# - refactor: Code restructuring
# - perf: Performance improvement
# - test: Adding tests
# - build: Build system changes
# - ci: CI configuration changes
# - chore: Other changes (dependencies, etc.)

# Examples:

# Feature commits
feat(auth): add JWT authentication
feat(api): add user profile endpoint
feat: implement password reset flow

# Bug fix commits
fix(database): resolve connection pool leak
fix(api): correct status code for validation errors
fix: handle null values in user input

# Documentation commits
docs(readme): update installation instructions
docs: add API documentation
docs(contributing): add code review guidelines

# Performance commits
perf(query): optimize user search query
perf: reduce memory usage in data processing

# Refactoring commits
refactor(models): simplify user model structure
refactor: extract common validation logic

# Breaking changes (add !)
feat(api)!: change response format to JSON:API spec
fix(auth)!: remove deprecated login endpoint

# With body and footer
feat(payments): add Stripe integration

Implement Stripe payment processing with webhooks
for subscription management.

BREAKING CHANGE: Payment API now requires Stripe account
Closes #123
```

## Branch Naming Convention

```bash
# Format: <type>/<short-description>
#
# Types:
# - feature/ - New features
# - bugfix/  - Bug fixes
# - hotfix/  - Urgent production fixes
# - release/ - Release branches
# - docs/    - Documentation changes

# Examples:

# Feature branches
git checkout -b feature/user-authentication
git checkout -b feature/add-search-endpoint
git checkout -b feature/implement-caching

# Bug fix branches
git checkout -b bugfix/fix-login-redirect
git checkout -b bugfix/resolve-memory-leak
git checkout -b bugfix/correct-email-validation

# Hotfix branches (for production)
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-security-patch
git checkout -b hotfix/fix-payment-processing

# Release branches
git checkout -b release/v1.2.0
git checkout -b release/v2.0.0-beta.1

# Documentation branches
git checkout -b docs/update-api-reference
git checkout -b docs/add-deployment-guide

# Include issue number when applicable
git checkout -b feature/123-user-profile
git checkout -b bugfix/456-fix-crash
```

## ❌ Anti-Patterns

```bash
# ❌ Vague commit messages
git commit -m "fix stuff"
git commit -m "update code"
git commit -m "changes"

# ✅ Better: Descriptive commits
git commit -m "fix(auth): resolve JWT token expiration issue"
git commit -m "feat(api): add pagination to user list endpoint"


# ❌ Committing to main directly
git checkout main
git commit -m "quick fix"  # Bad practice!

# ✅ Better: Use feature branch
git checkout -b bugfix/fix-issue
git commit -m "fix: resolve issue"
# Then create PR


# ❌ Large commits with mixed changes
git add .
git commit -m "add feature and fix bugs and update docs"

# ✅ Better: Separate commits
git add feature.py
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
git add bugfix.py
git commit -m "fix: resolve bug"
git add docs/
git commit -m "docs: update documentation"


# ❌ No branch naming convention
git checkout -b my-changes
git checkout -b fix
git checkout -b update-stuff

# ✅ Better: Consistent naming
git checkout -b feature/add-authentication
git checkout -b bugfix/fix-validation-error
```

## Best Practices Checklist

- ✅ Use conventional commit format
- ✅ Follow branch naming convention
- ✅ Create descriptive PR descriptions
- ✅ Keep commits small and focused
- ✅ Write commits in imperative mood
- ✅ Reference issues in commits
- ✅ Use semantic versioning
- ✅ Maintain CHANGELOG.md
- ✅ Set up pre-commit hooks
- ✅ Review your own code before requesting review
- ✅ Keep PR size manageable (<400 lines)
- ✅ Squash/rebase before merging

## Auto-Apply

When working with git:
1. Use conventional commit format: `type(scope): description`
2. Create branch with type prefix: `feature/`, `bugfix/`
3. Write descriptive PR descriptions with checklist
4. Update CHANGELOG.md for releases
5. Tag releases with semantic versions
6. Set up pre-commit hooks
7. Keep commits focused and atomic
