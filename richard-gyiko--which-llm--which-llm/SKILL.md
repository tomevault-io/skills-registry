# Skill: which-llm

Select the right LLM(s) for a task using real benchmark and capability data.

## When to Use

- User needs to pick a model for a specific task
- User wants to compare models by capability/price/speed
- User is designing a multi-agent system and needs model recommendations

## Preflight Check

Before proceeding, verify the CLI is operational:

```bash
# 1. Check CLI exists and show version
which-llm --version

# 2. Check data freshness (should be < 7 days old)
which-llm cache status

# 3. If stale or missing, refresh data
which-llm refresh
```

**If CLI is unavailable:** See [references/INSTALL.md](references/INSTALL.md) for installation, or use [references/FALLBACK.md](references/FALLBACK.md) for heuristic recommendations without the CLI.

## Quick Start

1. **Run preflight check** to verify CLI is ready
2. **Classify the task** using the decision tree below
3. **Query with `which-llm`** to find matching models
4. **Recommend Primary + Fallback** models with tradeoffs

## Task Classification

Use this decision tree to classify the user's task:

```
Is the task primarily about FORMAT conversion (summarize, extract, reformat)?
├─ YES → Transformational (intelligence ≥ 20)
└─ NO ↓

Does it require EXTERNAL ACTIONS (API calls, DB queries, file ops, code execution)?
├─ YES → Does it need to PLAN multiple steps autonomously?
│        ├─ YES → Agentic (intelligence ≥ 48, coding ≥ 42)
│        └─ NO  → Tool-using (intelligence ≥ 35, coding ≥ 35)
└─ NO ↓

Does it require JUDGMENT, COMPARISON, or ANALYSIS?
├─ YES → Analytical (intelligence ≥ 38)
└─ NO  → Transformational (intelligence ≥ 20)
```

### Skill Type Reference

> **Note:** Thresholds calibrated for Intelligence Index v4.0 (Jan 2026), SOTA ~50. Scores within ±2 points are effectively equivalent. See [references/BENCHMARKS.md](references/BENCHMARKS.md) for dynamic threshold calculation.

| Skill Type | Examples | Min Intelligence | Min Coding | Consider Also |
|------------|----------|------------------|------------|---------------|
| **Transformational** | summarize, extract, reformat | 20 | - | `tps` for high volume |
| **Analytical** | compare, analyze, justify | 38 | - | `context_window` (models table) for long docs |
| **Tool-using** | API calls, DB queries, code execution | 35 | 35 | `tool_call` (models table) |
| **Agentic** | plan, decompose, orchestrate, self-critique | 48 | 42 | `tool_call`, `reasoning`, `context_window` (all in models table) |

## Additional Selection Factors

Beyond skill type thresholds, consider these constraints when relevant:

| Factor | Table | Column | When to Use |
|--------|-------|--------|-------------|
| Context window | `models` | `context_window` | Long documents (>32k tokens), RAG with large chunks |
| Tool calling | `models` | `tool_call` | Function calling, MCP servers, API integration |
| Structured output | `models` | `structured_output` | JSON responses, typed outputs, schema validation |
| Reasoning | `models` | `reasoning` | Complex multi-step problems, chain-of-thought |
| Latency | `benchmarks` | `latency` | Real-time chat, streaming UIs (want < 0.5s) |
| Throughput | `benchmarks` | `tps` | Batch processing, high volume (want > 100 tps) |
| Open weights | `models` | `open_weights` | Self-hosting, fine-tuning, data privacy |

> **Note:** The `benchmarks` table contains AA benchmark data (intelligence, coding, price, tps). Capability fields (tool_call, reasoning, context_window) are in the `models` table from models.dev.

## Weighted Scoring

Instead of just filtering by thresholds, use weighted scoring to rank models based on user priorities.

### Scoring Formula

```
Score = (intelligence × quality_weight) 
      + (100/price × cost_weight) 
      + (tps/10 × speed_weight)
```

### Priority Presets

| Preset | Quality | Cost | Speed | Best For |
|--------|---------|------|-------|----------|
| **Balanced** | 0.4 | 0.4 | 0.2 | General use, no strong preference |
| **Quality** | 0.7 | 0.2 | 0.1 | Critical tasks, accuracy matters most |
| **Cost** | 0.2 | 0.7 | 0.1 | High volume, budget-sensitive |
| **Speed** | 0.2 | 0.2 | 0.6 | Real-time, latency-sensitive |

### Weighted Query Example

```bash
# Balanced scoring for analytical tasks
which-llm query "SELECT name, intelligence, price, tps,
          ROUND((intelligence * 0.4) + (100/price * 0.4) + (tps/10 * 0.2), 1) as score
          FROM benchmarks 
          WHERE intelligence >= 38 AND price > 0
          ORDER BY score DESC 
          LIMIT 10"

# Cost-priority scoring
which-llm query "SELECT name, intelligence, price, tps,
          ROUND((intelligence * 0.2) + (100/price * 0.7) + (tps/10 * 0.1), 1) as score
          FROM benchmarks 
          WHERE intelligence >= 38 AND price > 0
          ORDER BY score DESC 
          LIMIT 10"
```

See [references/QUERIES.md](references/QUERIES.md) for more weighted scoring patterns.

## Core Queries

### Two-Table Architecture

The CLI provides two independent tables:

1. **`benchmarks` table** - Benchmark data from Artificial Analysis
   - Contains: intelligence, coding, math, pricing (input_price, output_price), performance (tps, latency)
   - Use for: Model selection based on benchmarks and pricing

2. **`models` table** - Capability data from models.dev
   - Contains: tool_call, reasoning, structured_output, context_window, provider info
   - Use for: Filtering by capabilities, finding providers for a model

### The `benchmarks` Table (Benchmarks & Pricing)

The `benchmarks` table contains benchmark scores and pricing from Artificial Analysis.

```bash
# Find models meeting benchmark requirements, sorted by price
which-llm query "SELECT name, creator, intelligence, coding, price, tps 
          FROM benchmarks 
          WHERE intelligence >= 38 
          ORDER BY price 
          LIMIT 10"

# Find high-capability models for agentic tasks
which-llm query "SELECT name, creator, intelligence, coding, price 
          FROM benchmarks 
          WHERE intelligence >= 48 AND coding >= 42
          ORDER BY price 
          LIMIT 10"

# Speed-critical (real-time chat)
which-llm query "SELECT name, intelligence, tps, latency, price 
          FROM benchmarks 
          WHERE tps > 100 AND latency < 0.5 
          ORDER BY tps DESC"
```

### The `models` Table (Capabilities & Provider Data)

The `models` table contains capability data and provider-specific information from models.dev.

**Use `models` when:**
- Filtering by capabilities (tool_call, reasoning, structured_output)
- Finding models with specific context lengths
- Finding alternative providers for a model
- Comparing provider-specific pricing
- Getting provider configuration info (env vars, API endpoints, npm packages)

**Key columns:**
- `provider_id`, `provider_name` - Provider identification
- `provider_env` - Comma-separated env vars needed (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`)
- `provider_npm` - npm package for Vercel AI SDK (e.g., `@ai-sdk/openai`)
- `provider_api` - API endpoint URL
- `provider_doc` - Documentation URL
- `model_id`, `model_name`, `family` - Model identification
- `tool_call`, `reasoning`, `structured_output` - Capability flags
- `context_window`, `max_input_tokens`, `max_output_tokens` - Context limits
- `cost_input`, `cost_output` - Per-million-token pricing
- `cost_cache_read`, `cost_cache_write` - Prompt caching pricing

```bash
# Find models with tool calling support
which-llm query "SELECT provider_name, model_id, tool_call, context_window, cost_input 
          FROM models 
          WHERE tool_call = true
          ORDER BY cost_input LIMIT 10"

# Find reasoning models with large context
which-llm query "SELECT provider_name, model_id, reasoning, context_window, cost_input 
          FROM models 
          WHERE reasoning = true AND context_window >= 128000
          ORDER BY cost_input LIMIT 10"

# Find all providers offering Claude models
which-llm query "SELECT provider_name, model_id, cost_input, cost_output 
          FROM models 
          WHERE model_name LIKE '%Claude%'
          ORDER BY cost_input"

# Find cheapest provider for a specific model family
which-llm query "SELECT provider_name, model_id, cost_input, cost_output
          FROM models
          WHERE family = 'claude-3.5'
          ORDER BY cost_input LIMIT 5"

# Get provider configuration for OpenAI
which-llm query "SELECT provider_env, provider_npm, provider_api, provider_doc
          FROM models
          WHERE provider_id = 'openai'
          LIMIT 1"

# Find models with cache pricing
which-llm query "SELECT provider_name, model_id, cost_cache_read, cost_cache_write
          FROM models
          WHERE cost_cache_read IS NOT NULL
          ORDER BY cost_cache_read LIMIT 10"
```

### Cross-Table Queries

Since the tables are independent, you may need to query both to make a complete decision:

```bash
# Step 1: Find high-capability models from benchmarks table
which-llm query "SELECT name, intelligence, coding, price FROM benchmarks 
          WHERE intelligence >= 45 ORDER BY price LIMIT 5"

# Step 2: Check capabilities for a specific model in models table
which-llm query "SELECT model_id, tool_call, reasoning, context_window FROM models 
          WHERE model_name LIKE '%GPT-4o%'"
```

**Note:** Model naming may differ between tables (e.g., `claude-3.5-sonnet` in benchmarks vs `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022` in models). Use LIKE with wildcards for fuzzy matching when cross-referencing.

## Compare Models

Use the `compare` command for side-by-side model comparison with winner highlighting:

```bash
# Compare candidate models directly
which-llm compare "gpt-5 (high)" "claude 4.5 sonnet" "gemini 2.5 pro"

# Include additional metrics with --verbose
which-llm compare "gpt-5" "claude-4.5" --verbose

# Output as JSON for programmatic use
which-llm compare "gpt-5" "claude-4.5" --json
```

Winners for each metric are marked with `*`. This is useful when presenting trade-offs to users.

## Calculate Token Costs

Use the `cost` command to estimate costs and project usage:

```bash
# Calculate cost for a single model
which-llm cost "gpt-5 (high)" --input 10k --output 5k

# Compare costs across multiple models
which-llm cost "gpt-5" "claude 4.5" --input 1M --output 500k

# Project daily/monthly costs with request volume
which-llm cost "gpt-5 (high)" --input 2k --output 1k --requests 1000 --period daily
```

Token units: `k` (thousands), `M` (millions), `B` (billions). Decimals supported (e.g., `1.5M`).

## Cascade Recommendations

For cost optimization, recommend a **Primary + Fallback** pair instead of a single model:

1. **Primary model**: Cheapest model meeting *relaxed* requirements (e.g., 5-10 points below strict threshold)
2. **Fallback model**: Higher-capability model meeting *strict* requirements for when primary fails

**Relaxed vs Strict thresholds:**
- Strict: Use the skill type thresholds directly (e.g., Agentic: intelligence ≥ 48)
- Relaxed: Lower by ~20% for primary selection (e.g., intelligence ≥ 40)

This approach can reduce costs by 50-70% compared to always using the best model. See [references/CASCADE-PATTERNS.md](references/CASCADE-PATTERNS.md) for detailed implementation guidance.

## Output Format

```markdown
## Task Classification
- **Skill Type:** [type]
- **Key Constraints:** [e.g., needs tool_call, context > 100k]
- **Priority:** [Balanced/Quality/Cost/Speed]
- **Reasoning:** [why this classification]

## Recommendations

### Primary: [Model] ($X.XX/M) - Score: Y
- Meets requirements: intelligence X, coding Y
- Capabilities: [relevant capabilities like tool_call, context_window]
- Why: Best cost/capability ratio for this task

### Fallback: [Model] ($X.XX/M) - Score: Y
- Use if: Primary fails or task is unusually complex
- Capabilities: [relevant capabilities]
- Why: Higher capability ceiling

### Other Options
| Rank | Model | Score | Intelligence | Price | Key Capability |
|------|-------|-------|--------------|-------|----------------|
| 3 | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| 4 | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

## Cost Estimate
- **Primary only:** $X.XX/M tokens
- **Fallback only:** $Y.YY/M tokens  
- **Cascade (30% fallback):** $Z.ZZ/M tokens
- **Savings vs always fallback:** NN%

### Calculation
Cascade cost = (0.70 × $X.XX) + (0.30 × $Y.YY) = $Z.ZZ/M
Savings = (1 - Z.ZZ/Y.YY) × 100 = NN%

## Query Used
[the which-llm query command]
```

### Cost Estimate Guidance

When presenting cost estimates:

1. **Always show the cascade calculation** - helps users understand the math
2. **Use 30% as default escalation rate** - reasonable starting assumption
3. **Note the price ratio** - larger ratios mean more potential savings
4. **Include the caveat** - actual savings depend on task complexity mix

Example:
```markdown
## Cost Estimate
- **Primary only:** $0.50/M tokens
- **Fallback only:** $5.00/M tokens (10x primary)
- **Cascade (30% fallback):** $1.85/M tokens
- **Savings vs always fallback:** 63%

*Assumes 30% of requests escalate. Actual rate depends on task complexity.*
```

## Important Disclaimer

These recommendations are **indicative starting points**, not definitive answers. Benchmark scores measure general capabilities but may not reflect performance on your specific task.

**Always validate** by testing candidate models on representative examples from your actual use case before committing to a model choice.
