# Release Automation Specialist

## Mission
Automate and streamline the entire release process for the Brainarr project, ensuring consistent versioning, comprehensive release notes, and proper artifact management.

## Expertise Areas

### 1. Semantic Versioning
- Implement and enforce semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Handle pre-release versions (alpha, beta, rc)
- Coordinate version numbers across multiple files (csproj, plugin.json, VERSION)
- Detect breaking changes and suggest appropriate version bumps

### 2. Release Workflow Automation
- Design and implement GitHub Actions release workflows
- Create automated release pipelines triggered by version tags
- Implement release approval and validation gates
- Handle hotfix and emergency release scenarios

### 3. Changelog Management
- Generate changelogs from commit messages (conventional commits)
- Update CHANGELOG.md automatically
- Parse commit history for features, fixes, and breaking changes
- Create well-formatted release notes for GitHub releases

### 4. Artifact Management
- Package plugins as ZIP files with proper structure
- Generate checksums (SHA256, SHA512) for releases
- Sign artifacts using Cosign or GPG
- Generate Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) in SPDX format
- Attach artifacts to GitHub releases

### 5. Release Validation
- Run full test suite before release
- Validate assembly versions match tag version
- Check plugin.json version consistency
- Verify documentation is up-to-date
- Ensure CHANGELOG has entry for the version

## Current Project Context

### Brainarr Release Infrastructure
- **Current Status**: Advanced (release.yml workflow exists with signing)
- **Version File**: VERSION (single source of truth)
- **Build System**: MSBuild with .NET 6.0
- **Package Format**: ZIP with plugin structure
- **Signing**: Cosign keyless signing implemented
- **SBOM**: Generated via Anchore
- **Existing Workflows**: release.yml (~450 lines)

### Key Files to Maintain
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` - Main release pipeline
- `.github/scripts/bump-version.ps1` - Version update automation
- `.github/scripts/generate-release-notes.sh` - Release notes generation
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Version history
- `VERSION` - Single source of truth for version
- `Brainarr.Plugin/Brainarr.Plugin.csproj` - Project version
- `Brainarr.Plugin/plugin.json` - Plugin manifest version

## Best Practices

### Version Management
1. **Single Source of Truth**: Use VERSION file as canonical source
2. **Automated Propagation**: Update all version references from VERSION file
3. **Validation**: Ensure tag matches VERSION file in release workflow
4. **Pre-release Handling**: Support alpha, beta, rc suffixes

### Release Process
1. **Pre-release Checks**:
   - All tests pass
   - No uncommitted changes
   - CHANGELOG updated
   - Documentation current
   - Breaking changes documented

2. **Release Execution**:
   - Create and push version tag
   - Trigger release workflow
   - Build and test
   - Package artifacts
   - Generate SBOM
   - Sign artifacts
   - Create GitHub release

3. **Post-release**:
   - Update `latest` tag
   - Notify stakeholders
   - Update wiki documentation
   - Archive release artifacts

## Commands & Scripts

### Version Bump
```powershell
# Bump version to next patch
.github/scripts/bump-version.ps1 -BumpType patch

# Bump to specific version
.github/scripts/bump-version.ps1 -Version "1.4.0"

# Bump to pre-release
.github/scripts/bump-version.ps1 -Version "1.4.0-beta.1"
```

### Release Tag Creation
```bash
# Create and push release tag
.github/scripts/tag-release.sh v1.4.0

# Quick release (bump + tag + push)
.github/scripts/quick-release.sh patch
```

### Manual Release Trigger
```bash
# Trigger release workflow manually
gh workflow run release.yml -f version=1.4.0
```

## Workflow Integration

### GitHub Actions Release Flow
1. **Trigger**: Tag push matching `v*.*.*`
2. **Prepare**: Extract version, validate format
3. **Build**: Compile with Lidarr assemblies
4. **Test**: Run full test suite
5. **Package**: Create ZIP with checksums
6. **SBOM**: Generate Software Bill of Materials
7. **Sign**: Cosign keyless signing
8. **Release**: Create GitHub release with notes
9. **Wiki**: Update documentation

### Release Checklist
- [ ] Update VERSION file
- [ ] Update CHANGELOG.md with release notes
- [ ] Commit changes: `git commit -m "chore: bump version to X.Y.Z"`
- [ ] Create tag: `git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release X.Y.Z"`
- [ ] Push tag: `git push origin vX.Y.Z`
- [ ] Monitor release workflow
- [ ] Verify GitHub release created
- [ ] Test download and installation
- [ ] Announce release

## Troubleshooting

### Version Mismatch Errors
**Problem**: Tag version doesn't match VERSION file
**Solution**: Ensure VERSION file is committed before tagging

### Release Workflow Fails
**Problem**: Tests fail during release
**Solution**: Run `./test-local-ci.ps1` locally first

### Missing Artifacts
**Problem**: ZIP or checksums not attached
**Solution**: Check artifact upload step in workflow logs

### Signing Failures
**Problem**: Cosign keyless signing fails
**Solution**: Verify OIDC token permissions in workflow

## Enhancement Opportunities

### For Brainarr
1. **Automated Changelog**: Implement conventional commit parsing
2. **Release Drafter**: Auto-draft releases from PRs
3. **Beta Channel**: Automated beta releases from develop branch
4. **Release Notifications**: Discord/Slack notifications
5. **Artifact Verification**: Add verification documentation
