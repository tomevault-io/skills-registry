# Claim Extraction Skill

Extract all substantive claims from AI research content. A claim is any assertion that:
- States something as true about AI capabilities, limitations, or progress
- Predicts future developments
- Hints at unreleased work
- Expresses a positioned opinion on the field's direction
- Critiques others' claims or work

## Extraction Schema

For each claim, extract:

### 1. claimText
The claim in clear, standalone form. Paraphrase if needed for clarity.

### 2. claimType
- `fact`: Assertion about current state ("GPT-4 can do X")
- `prediction`: Forward-looking ("By 2026, we'll have...")
- `hint`: Implies unreleased work ("We've been seeing interesting results with...")
- `opinion`: Positioned take ("I think scaling is/isn't sufficient")
- `critique`: Challenges others ("Marcus is wrong because...")
- `question`: Genuine uncertainty expressed ("I'm not sure if...")

### 3. topic
Primary topic category:
- `scaling`: Scaling laws, compute, training efficiency
- `reasoning`: LLM reasoning, chain-of-thought, planning
- `agents`: AI agents, tool use, autonomy
- `safety`: AI safety, alignment, control
- `interpretability`: Mechanistic interpretability
- `multimodal`: Vision, audio, video models
- `rlhf`: RLHF, preference learning, Constitutional AI
- `benchmarks`: Evals, benchmarks, capability measurement
- `infrastructure`: Training infra, chips, hardware
- `policy`: AI policy, regulation, governance
- `general`: General AI commentary

### 4. stance
- `bullish`: Optimistic about AI progress/capabilities
- `bearish`: Skeptical/pessimistic about AI progress
- `neutral`: Balanced or factual without clear stance

### 5. bullishness
Float from 0.0 (maximally bearish) to 1.0 (maximally bullish)

### 6. confidence
How confident does the author seem? (0.0-1.0)
- Hedging language: "might", "could", "I think", "possibly" → lower
- Certainty language: "will", "definitely", "it's clear that" → higher

### 7. timeframe (for predictions)
- `near-term`: < 1 year
- `medium-term`: 1-3 years
- `long-term`: 3-10 years
- `unspecified`: No clear timeframe
- `null`: Not a prediction

### 8. evidenceProvided
- `strong`: Cites data, papers, or detailed reasoning
- `moderate`: Some reasoning but not rigorous
- `weak`: Assertion without support
- `appeal-to-authority`: "Trust me, I work on this"

### 9. quoteworthiness
Is this claim notable enough to quote in a digest? (0.0-1.0)

## Output Format

Return JSON:
```json
{
  "claims": [
    {
      "claimText": "The claim in clear form",
      "claimType": "prediction",
      "topic": "reasoning",
      "stance": "bullish",
      "bullishness": 0.8,
      "confidence": 0.7,
      "timeframe": "medium-term",
      "evidenceProvided": "moderate",
      "quoteworthiness": 0.6,
      "relatedTo": ["o1", "chain-of-thought"],
      "originalQuote": "Brief relevant quote if notable"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Guidelines

- Extract MULTIPLE claims from a single piece of content if present
- Don't over-extract - only substantive, meaningful claims
- A tweet saying "Interesting paper" is NOT a claim
- Look for IMPLICIT claims ("We've made a lot of progress" implies capability gains)
- Pay attention to WHO is speaking - lab researchers hinting at their own work is high signal
- Critics often make claims by contradiction ("X is wrong, therefore Y")

## Author Context Matters

Consider the author's affiliation when assessing:
- **Lab researchers** (Anthropic, OpenAI, DeepMind): May hint at unreleased work
- **Critics** (Marcus, Chollet, Mitchell): Often make claims through critique
- **Independent** (Simon Willison, Jim Fan): Provide practitioner perspectives
