# Hype Assessment Skill

Assess which AI topics are overhyped, underhyped, or accurately assessed based on synthesized claims.

## Assessment Framework

### Overhyped Topics (Lab enthusiasm exceeds warranted confidence)

Signs of overhype:
- Lab researchers make strong claims that critics have substantively challenged
- Evidence quality is low but confidence is high
- Past predictions in this area have repeatedly failed
- Marketing language exceeds technical substance
- Hype delta > +0.3

### Underhyped Topics (Critic skepticism may be excessive)

Signs of underhype:
- Real progress has been made but critics haven't updated
- Evidence is strong but narrative hasn't caught up
- Lab hints suggest unreleased capabilities
- Quiet progress without announcements
- Hype delta < -0.3

### Accurately Assessed Topics

Signs of accurate assessment:
- Lab and critic views are relatively aligned
- Claims match observable evidence
- Predictions have been reasonably accurate
- Hype delta between -0.2 and +0.2

## Scoring System

For each topic, assign a score from -1.0 to +1.0:

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| +1.0 | Severely overhyped - massive gap between claims and reality |
| +0.5 | Moderately overhyped - lab enthusiasm outpaces evidence |
| +0.2 | Slightly overhyped |
| 0.0 | Accurately assessed |
| -0.2 | Slightly underhyped |
| -0.5 | Moderately underhyped - real progress being underrated |
| -1.0 | Severely underhyped - major developments being ignored |

## Evidence to Consider

### For Overhyped Assessment
- Repeated failed predictions
- Marketing claims exceeding published results
- Hype cycle patterns (lots of announcements, few deliverables)
- Benchmark gaming without real-world transfer
- "Just around the corner" claims that keep slipping

### For Underhyped Assessment
- Steady progress without fanfare
- Working deployments with limited publicity
- Academic results that haven't reached mainstream
- Capabilities that exist but aren't marketed
- Legitimate breakthroughs dismissed by critics

### For Accurate Assessment
- Claims that held up over time
- Convergence between lab and critic views
- Predictions that came true
- Honest acknowledgment of limitations
- Nuanced discussion of tradeoffs

{
  "overhypedTopics": [
    {
      "topic": "agents",
      "score": 0.6,
      "reasoning": "Lab enthusiasm for autonomous agents significantly exceeds demonstrated reliability. Multiple high-profile failures in production while claims of imminent AGI-like autonomy persist.",
      "keyEvidence": [
        "Devin and similar demos failed to replicate",
        "Production agent deployments have high failure rates",
        "Claims of 'replacing developers' haven't materialized"

      "topic": "multimodal",
      "score": 0.1,
      "reasoning": "Vision-language models have improved substantially and assessments largely reflect actual capabilities. Both enthusiasm and concerns are grounded.",
      "keyEvidence": [
        "GPT-4V and Claude vision work as advertised",
        "Known limitations acknowledged",
        "Incremental improvements match expectations"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "overallFieldSentiment": 0.72,
  "summary": "A paragraph summarizing the overall hype landscape..."
}
```

## Overall Field Sentiment

Calculate as weighted average of lab researcher bullishness across all topics (0.0-1.0).

Interpretation:
- 0.8-1.0: Extremely bullish field sentiment (potential bubble)
- 0.6-0.8: Optimistic but measured
- 0.4-0.6: Balanced/uncertain
- 0.2-0.4: Cautious/skeptical
- 0.0-0.2: Pessimistic

## Summary Guidelines

Write a single paragraph summarizing:
1. Overall hype temperature
2. Most overhyped area and why
3. Most underhyped area and why
4. What sophisticated observers should pay attention to

Tone: Direct, opinionated but fair, grounded in evidence.
