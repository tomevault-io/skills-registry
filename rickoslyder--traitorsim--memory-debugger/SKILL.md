# Memory Debugger

Debug and inspect TraitorSim's file-system-based agent memory architecture. Each agent maintains a private directory with structured memory files that influence their decision-making. This skill helps troubleshoot memory-related issues and validate agent behaviors.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Inspect an agent's complete memory state
ls -la data/memories/player_03/

# Read agent profile
cat data/memories/player_03/profile.md

# Check trust matrix
cat data/memories/player_03/suspects.csv

# View recent diary entries
ls -t data/memories/player_03/diary/ | head -5
cat data/memories/player_03/diary/day_05_roundtable.md
```

## Memory Architecture

Each agent has a private directory structure:

```
data/memories/player_03/
├── profile.md              # Self-concept, role, personality, backstory
├── suspects.csv            # Trust Matrix (suspicion scores)
├── diary/                  # Daily event logs
│   ├── day_01_morning.md
│   ├── day_01_mission.md
│   ├── day_01_social.md
│   ├── day_01_roundtable.md
│   ├── day_01_night.md
│   └── ...
└── skills/                 # Behavioral modules (SKILL.md files)
    ├── skill-traitor-defense.md       # How to defend when accused (if Traitor)
    ├── skill-faithful-hunting.md      # How to identify Traitors (if Faithful)
    ├── skill-shield-logic.md          # When to use Shield
    ├── skill-murder-targeting.md      # Who to murder (Traitors only)
    └── skill-recruitment-decision.md  # Accept/decline recruitment
```

## What to Debug

### 1. Profile.md - Agent Self-Concept

**Contents:**
- Agent name and role (FAITHFUL or TRAITOR)
- Archetype and personality traits (OCEAN)
- Demographics and backstory
- Stats (intellect, dexterity, social_influence)
- Strategic approach

**Common issues:**

**Issue: Profile doesn't reflect persona backstory**
```bash
# Check if profile.md includes persona backstory
grep -A 10 "## Backstory" data/memories/player_03/profile.md

# Expected: Should include full backstory from persona card
# If missing: Memory manager isn't injecting backstory correctly
```

**Issue: Role is visible in profile (breaks immersion)**
```bash
# Check role section
grep "## Role" data/memories/player_03/profile.md

# Expected: Should clearly state FAITHFUL or TRAITOR
# This is correct - agents know their own role
```

**Issue: OCEAN traits not in profile**
```bash
# Check personality section
grep -A 10 "## Personality" data/memories/player_03/profile.md

# Expected: Should list all 5 OCEAN traits with values
# If missing: Player initialization didn't create profile correctly
```

### 2. Suspects.csv - Trust Matrix

**Format:**
```csv
target_id,suspicion_score,last_updated,evidence_summary
player_01,0.35,day_05,"Voted for revealed Traitor player_07"
player_02,0.72,day_05,"Failed mission despite high intellect - likely sabotage"
player_04,0.15,day_03,"Consistently votes with me, seems trustworthy"
```

**Fields:**
- `target_id`: Player being evaluated
- `suspicion_score`: 0.0 (complete trust) to 1.0 (certain Traitor)
- `last_updated`: Last day this suspicion was updated
- `evidence_summary`: Brief justification for current score

**Common issues:**

**Issue: Trust matrix not updating**
```bash
# Check if suspicion scores change over time
cat data/memories/player_03/suspects.csv

# Look for `last_updated` - should have recent days
# If all entries are "day_01", trust matrix isn't updating
```

**Issue: All suspicions are 0.5 (no differentiation)**
```bash
# Check score distribution
awk -F, '{print $2}' data/memories/player_03/suspects.csv | sort | uniq -c

# Expected: Range of scores (0.1 to 0.9)
# If all ~0.5: Agent not processing evidence
```

**Issue: Traitor has high suspicion of self**
```bash
# A Traitor shouldn't suspect fellow Traitors (knows they're allies)
grep "player_03" data/memories/player_03/suspects.csv

# Expected: Traitors should have low suspicion of each other
# If high: Traitor logic broken
```

**Issue: No evidence summaries**
```bash
# Check if evidence column is populated
awk -F, '{print $4}' data/memories/player_03/suspects.csv

# Expected: Each row should have justification
# If empty: Memory updates not recording evidence
```

### 3. Diary Entries - Event Logs

**File naming pattern:** `day_{N}_{phase}.md`

**Phases:**
- `morning`: Breakfast, murder reveal, initial reactions
- `mission`: Mission participation and observations
- `social`: Pre-Round Table conversations
- `roundtable`: Accusations, defenses, voting
- `night`: Traitor meeting, murder selection (Traitors only)

**Contents:**
- What happened this phase
- Who said/did what
- Agent's reactions and thoughts
- Updated suspicions

**Common issues:**

**Issue: Diary entries missing**
```bash
# Check if entries exist for each day/phase
ls data/memories/player_03/diary/

# Expected: 5 files per day (morning, mission, social, roundtable, night)
# If missing: Memory manager not creating entries
```

**Issue: Entries too short (< 50 words)**
```bash
# Check entry length
wc -w data/memories/player_03/diary/day_05_roundtable.md

# Expected: 100-300 words with specific observations
# If < 50 words: Agent not processing events thoroughly
```

**Issue: Entries don't reference other agents**
```bash
# Check if entries mention other players
grep -E "player_[0-9]{2}" data/memories/player_03/diary/day_05_roundtable.md

# Expected: Multiple player references with observations
# If none: Agent not tracking social dynamics
```

**Issue: Traitor night entries leak to Faithfuls**
```bash
# Traitors have night phase entries, Faithfuls don't
ls data/memories/player_03/diary/ | grep "night"

# If player_03 is Faithful and has night entries: BUG
# If player_03 is Traitor and NO night entries: Missing memory
```

### 4. Skills - Behavioral Modules

**Common skills:**

**skill-traitor-defense.md** (Traitors only):
```markdown
# Traitor Defense Strategy

When accused at Round Table:

1. **Stay calm** (leverage low Neuroticism if you have it)
2. **Deflect to evidence**: "What actual evidence do you have?"
3. **Counter-accuse** (if low Agreeableness): Point to voting records
4. **Appeal to alliance** (if high Agreeableness): "We've worked together since day 1"
5. **Bus throw if necessary**: Sacrifice fellow Traitor if suspicion > 0.8
```

**skill-faithful-hunting.md** (Faithfuls only):
```markdown
# Faithful Hunting Strategy

Identifying Traitors:

1. **Voting patterns**: Who defended revealed Traitors?
2. **Mission sabotage**: Unexplained failures with high-stat participants
3. **Breakfast tells**: Always enters last, never murdered
4. **Knowledge leaks**: Too knowledgeable about night events
5. **Shield bluffs**: Claims Shield to detect information leaks
```

**Common issues:**

**Issue: Skills not loaded for archetype**
```bash
# Check which skills exist
ls data/memories/player_03/skills/

# Expected: Should match archetype's strategic approach
# If missing: Skills weren't created during initialization
```

**Issue: Skills contradict personality**
```bash
# Read skill and compare to personality
cat data/memories/player_03/skills/skill-traitor-defense.md
cat data/memories/player_03/profile.md | grep -A 5 "## Personality"

# Example contradiction:
# Skill says: "Stay calm under pressure"
# But agent has high Neuroticism (0.85)
# Expected: Skill should account for neuroticism
```

## Instructions

### When Debugging Agent Behavior

1. **Read the agent's profile**:
   ```bash
   cat data/memories/player_{ID}/profile.md
   ```

2. **Check recent diary entries**:
   ```bash
   # Find most recent entries
   ls -t data/memories/player_{ID}/diary/ | head -5

   # Read latest roundtable
   cat data/memories/player_{ID}/diary/day_XX_roundtable.md
   ```

3. **Examine trust matrix**:
   ```bash
   cat data/memories/player_{ID}/suspects.csv
   ```

4. **Compare to expected behavior**:
   - High Extraversion → Should speak often at Round Table
   - Low Agreeableness → Should make harsh accusations
   - High Openness → Trust matrix should update frequently
   - High Conscientiousness → Mission performance should be consistent

### When Agent Makes Unexpected Decision

**Example: Agent votes for ally**

1. **Check trust matrix**:
   ```bash
   grep "player_05" data/memories/player_03/suspects.csv
   ```

   Expected: If voted for ally, suspicion should be > 0.6

2. **Check diary for context**:
   ```bash
   cat data/memories/player_03/diary/day_XX_roundtable.md | grep "player_05"
   ```

   Expected: Should explain why suspicion increased

3. **Check voting history in game log**:
   ```python
   votes = [e for e in game_log["events"]
            if e["type"] == "round_table_vote" and e["voter_id"] == "player_03"]

   # Did agent vote consistently with suspicions?
   ```

### When Trust Matrix Seems Broken

1. **Check if updates are happening**:
   ```bash
   # Look for varying last_updated days
   awk -F, '{print $3}' data/memories/player_03/suspects.csv | sort | uniq -c
   ```

2. **Validate Bayesian updates**:
   ```python
   # Read trust matrix history from game log
   updates = [e for e in game_log["events"]
              if e["type"] == "trust_matrix_update" and e["player_id"] == "player_03"]

   # Check if updates are evidence-based
   for update in updates:
       print(f"Day {update['day']}: {update['target_id']}")
       print(f"  {update['suspicion_before']:.2f} → {update['suspicion_after']:.2f}")
       print(f"  Evidence: {update['evidence']}\n")
   ```

3. **Check personality influence**:
   ```python
   player = get_player("player_03")
   openness = player["personality"]["openness"]

   # High Openness agents should update more frequently
   update_count = len(updates)
   expected_updates = openness * 10  # Heuristic

   if update_count < expected_updates:
       print("⚠️  Agent updating suspicions less than expected for Openness level")
   ```

### When Diary Entries Are Poor Quality

1. **Check entry length**:
   ```bash
   wc -w data/memories/player_03/diary/day_05_roundtable.md
   ```

2. **Check specificity**:
   ```bash
   # Should mention specific players and events
   grep -E "player_[0-9]{2}" data/memories/player_03/diary/day_05_roundtable.md
   ```

3. **Check emotional tone matches personality**:
   ```bash
   cat data/memories/player_03/diary/day_05_roundtable.md

   # High Neuroticism → Should express anxiety/defensiveness
   # High Extraversion → Should describe speaking up
   # Low Agreeableness → Should describe confrontations
   ```

## Debugging Workflows

### Workflow 1: Why Did Agent X Vote for Agent Y?

```bash
# 1. Check trust matrix
grep "player_Y" data/memories/player_X/suspects.csv

# 2. Check diary from that day
cat data/memories/player_X/diary/day_N_roundtable.md | grep "player_Y"

# 3. Check if personality influenced decision
cat data/memories/player_X/profile.md | grep -A 5 "## Personality"

# 4. Check if skills guided decision
cat data/memories/player_X/skills/skill-faithful-hunting.md
```

### Workflow 2: Why Didn't Traitor X Murder Agent Y?

```bash
# 1. Check Traitor's night diary
cat data/memories/player_X/diary/day_N_night.md

# 2. Check trust matrix for murder target prioritization
cat data/memories/player_X/suspects.csv

# Traitors typically murder low-suspicion Faithfuls (strategic)
# Or high-threat Faithfuls (protective)

# 3. Check murder targeting skill
cat data/memories/player_X/skills/skill-murder-targeting.md
```

### Workflow 3: Why Did Agent Perform Poorly in Mission?

```bash
# 1. Check stats
cat data/memories/player_X/profile.md | grep -A 3 "## Stats"

# 2. Check stress level (from game log)
# High stress reduces performance

# 3. Check if Traitor sabotaging
cat data/memories/player_X/profile.md | grep "## Role"

# If Traitor → Intentional sabotage
# If Faithful → Low stats or high stress
```

## Common Memory Issues

### Issue 1: Agent Doesn't Know Their Backstory

**Symptom:** Agent makes decisions that contradict their backstory

**Debug:**
```bash
cat data/memories/player_03/profile.md | grep -A 20 "## Backstory"
```

**Expected:** Full backstory from persona card should be present

**Fix:** Update `memory_manager.py` to inject backstory:
```python
def _create_profile(self) -> str:
    # ... existing code ...

    if self.player.backstory:
        backstory_section = f"""
## Backstory
{self.player.backstory}

## Demographics
- Age: {self.player.demographics.get('age')}
- Location: {self.player.demographics.get('location')}
- Occupation: {self.player.demographics.get('occupation')}
"""
        base_profile += backstory_section
```

### Issue 2: Trust Matrix Not Persisting

**Symptom:** Suspicion scores reset between phases

**Debug:**
```bash
# Check if CSV file is being written
ls -l data/memories/player_03/suspects.csv

# Check file permissions
stat data/memories/player_03/suspects.csv
```

**Expected:** File should update after each trust matrix change

**Fix:** Ensure `memory_manager.py` writes to CSV after updates:
```python
def update_trust_matrix(self, target_id: str, new_suspicion: float, evidence: str):
    # Update in-memory matrix
    self.trust_matrix[target_id] = {
        "suspicion": new_suspicion,
        "last_updated": self.current_day,
        "evidence": evidence
    }

    # CRITICAL: Write to file immediately
    self._write_trust_matrix_to_csv()
```

### Issue 3: Diary Entries Don't Influence Decisions

**Symptom:** Agent repeats mistakes, doesn't learn from past events

**Debug:**
```bash
# Check if agent's prompt includes diary context
# (This requires checking agent decision-making code)
```

**Expected:** Agent should query recent diary entries when making decisions

**Fix:** Ensure agent queries diary before major decisions:
```python
async def make_voting_decision(self, nominees: List[str]) -> str:
    # Load recent diary entries
    recent_entries = self._load_recent_diary_entries(days=3)

    # Include in decision prompt
    prompt = f"""
Recent observations:
{recent_entries}

Current nominees: {nominees}

Based on your memories and trust matrix, who should you vote for?
"""
```

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Agent makes unexpected decisions
- Trust matrix appears broken
- Diary entries are missing or poor quality
- Agent doesn't use backstory in decisions
- Skills don't match archetype
- Memory files have permission issues
- Debugging personality-behavior mismatches

## When NOT to Use This Skill

Don't use this skill for:
- Analyzing game outcomes (use game-analyzer skill)
- Generating personas (use persona-pipeline skill)
- Validating content (use world-bible-validator skill)
- Modifying game rules (use simulation-config skill)
