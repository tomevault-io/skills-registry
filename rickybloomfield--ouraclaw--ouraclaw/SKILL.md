## Usage Instructions

- **Date defaults**: If no dates specified, the tool defaults to today's data. Use `start_date` and `end_date` in `YYYY-MM-DD` format for specific ranges.
- **Multi-endpoint queries**: For comprehensive answers, call multiple endpoints. E.g., "How did I sleep?" should fetch both `daily_sleep` (score) and `sleep` (details).
- **Duration conversion**: Sleep/activity durations are in **seconds**. Convert to hours and minutes: `27360s` → `7h 36m`.
- **Null values**: Some fields may be `null` if Oura hasn't computed them yet. Note this gracefully rather than showing "null".

## Score Interpretation

| Range | Label |
|-------|-------|
| 85+ | Excellent |
| 70–84 | Good |
| 60–69 | Fair |
| Below 60 | Needs attention |

## Formatting Guidelines

- Use concise bullet points, not long paragraphs
- Lead with scores and labels (e.g., "Sleep: 82 (Good)")
- Include 2–3 key contributor details per category
- Convert all durations from seconds to Xh Ym format
- Add brief, personalized context when relevant (e.g., "HRV is trending lower than usual")
- Keep summaries scannable — the user may be reading on a phone
- **Adapt formatting to the delivery channel** — see Channel Formatting Guide below

## Channel Formatting Guide

Different messaging channels support different formatting syntax. Use the correct format for the delivery channel. When the channel is unknown or "default", use plain text formatting (safe everywhere).

### Plain text — iMessage (bluebubbles), Signal

No text-based formatting syntax is supported. Characters like `*`, `_`, and `~` appear literally.

- Use emoji and whitespace for visual structure
- Use UPPERCASE sparingly for emphasis if needed (e.g., "SLEEP: 82")
- URLs are auto-linked — just include them as plain text
- Use `|` or `·` as inline separators
- Use `—` (em dash) for inline breaks

### WhatsApp

- **Bold**: `*text*`
- **Italic**: `_text_`
- **Strikethrough**: `~text~`
- **Inline code**: `` `text` ``
- **Lists**: `- item` at the start of a line
- URLs are auto-linked — do NOT use markdown link syntax `[text](url)`

### Telegram

Supports Markdown-style formatting:

- **Bold**: `*text*`
- **Italic**: `_text_`
- **Underline**: `__text__`
- **Strikethrough**: `~text~`
- **Links**: `[display text](url)`
- Escape special characters (`.`, `-`, `(`, `)`, `!`, etc.) with `\` when they appear outside formatting

### Slack

Uses Slack's mrkdwn syntax (not standard Markdown):

- **Bold**: `*text*`
- **Italic**: `_text_`
- **Strikethrough**: `~text~`
- **Links**: `<url|display text>`
- **Lists**: `- item` or `• item`
- Do NOT use standard Markdown bold (`**text**`) or link syntax (`[text](url)`)

### Discord

Uses standard Markdown:

- **Bold**: `**text**`
- **Italic**: `*text*`
- **Underline**: `__text__`
- **Strikethrough**: `~~text~~`
- **Links**: `[display text](url)`
- **Lists**: `- item`
- **Headers**: `#`, `##`, `###` (at start of line)

### WebChat / Default

Use standard Markdown formatting.

## Scheduled Summary Delivery

When producing a scheduled summary (morning or evening), follow these rules:

- **Read the template carefully** and follow every format rule, including all specified data points, line counts, and examples.
- **Send the complete formatted summary as a single message** to the channel and target specified in the request. Do not summarize, abbreviate, or rephrase the summary.
- **Apply channel-appropriate formatting** using the Channel Formatting Guide above based on the channel specified in the request.

## Morning Summary Template

When delivering a morning summary, fetch `daily_sleep`, `sleep` (detailed periods), `daily_readiness`, `daily_activity`, and `daily_stress` for today. Also fetch yesterday's `daily_activity` as a fallback.

Send only the formatted summary — no preamble, intro message, or extra commentary before or after it. Apply the correct formatting syntax for the delivery channel (see Channel Formatting Guide).

Format rules:
- Start with "Good morning!" and today's date
- **Sleep**: score with label, total sleep time (convert seconds to Xh Ym), key contributors that are notably high or low. From the detailed `sleep` endpoint, include lowest resting heart rate, average overnight heart rate, and average HRV. Show deep, REM, and light durations in minutes.
- **Readiness**: score with label, body temperature deviation, HRV balance, recovery index. Call out anything that's dragging the score down.
- **Activity**: use today's `daily_activity` if available (score, steps, active calories). If score is null or data is missing, use yesterday's activity instead and note that it's yesterday's data.
- **Stress**: mention if data is available (normal, high, etc.). If no stress data, skip it.
- End with: "Dive deeper in the Oura app: https://cloud.ouraring.com/app/v1/home — enjoy your day!" (include trailing text after the URL so it renders inline, not as a separate link preview).
- Keep it concise — 8–10 lines max. Use emoji sparingly. Warm but not cheesy.
- Bold the category labels and scores on channels that support bold (e.g., `*Sleep: 82 (Good)*` on WhatsApp/Telegram/Slack, `**Sleep: 82 (Good)**` on Discord). On plain text channels (iMessage, Signal), do not use any formatting markers.

Example tone (plain text / iMessage):

```
Good morning! Here's your recap for Monday, Jan 27.

😴 Sleep: 82 (Good) — 7h 12m total
Deep 58m | REM 1h 24m | Light 4h 50m
Lowest HR 52 bpm | Avg HR 58 bpm | HRV 42 ms

💪 Readiness: 78 (Good)
Body temp +0.1°C | HRV balance solid | Recovery index slightly low

🏃 Activity (yesterday): 74 (Good) — 8,241 steps, 312 active cal

Stress: normal range

Solid night overall — deep sleep was a bit short but REM made up for it.

## Evening Summary Template

When delivering an evening summary, fetch `daily_activity`, `daily_readiness`, `daily_stress`, and `daily_sleep` for today. Also fetch yesterday's `daily_activity` as a fallback in case today's data isn't available yet.

Send only the formatted summary — no preamble, intro message, or extra commentary before or after it. Apply the correct formatting syntax for the delivery channel (see Channel Formatting Guide).

Format rules:
- Start with "Good evening!" and today's date
- Focus on today's **activity**: score, steps, active calories, total calories. If today's activity score is null or data is missing, use yesterday's activity instead and note that it's yesterday's data. Activity data must always be included — never show "pending" or skip it.
- Include today's **readiness** and **stress**.
- Briefly mention last night's sleep score as a one-line recap.
- End with a short, genuine motivational nudge to wind down, then: "Dive deeper in the Oura app: https://cloud.ouraring.com/app/v1/home — sleep well!" (include trailing text after the URL so it renders inline).
- Keep it concise — 6–8 lines max. Use emoji sparingly.
- Bold the category labels and scores on channels that support bold. On plain text channels (iMessage, Signal), do not use any formatting markers.

Example tone (plain text / iMessage):

```
Good evening! Here's your day in review for Monday, Jan 27.

🏃 Activity: 81 (Good) — 9,432 steps, 387 active cal, 2,145 total cal
📊 Readiness: 78 (Good) | Stress: normal range
😴 Last night's sleep: 82 (Good)

Nice active day — you moved well. Wind down soon and aim for a solid bedtime to keep the momentum going.

## Ad-hoc Query Mapping

Map natural language to endpoints:

| User says | Fetch |
|-----------|-------|
| "How did I sleep?" / "Sleep report" | `daily_sleep` + `sleep` |
| "Am I ready to work out?" / "Readiness" | `daily_readiness` |
| "How active was I?" / "Steps today" | `daily_activity` |
| "Stress levels" | `daily_stress` |
| "Full health summary" | All endpoints |
| "Last week's sleep" / "trends" | `daily_sleep` with 7-day date range |
| "Compare this week to last" | Two date ranges, summarize differences |

When the user asks about trends or comparisons, fetch the relevant date range and summarize the pattern (improving, declining, stable) with specific numbers.
