# AI Memory Unifier

This skill guides Claude through a multi-phase migration that turns scattered memory artifacts — across multiple AI products — into a single clean system, with Claude Code's `~/.claude/` as the authoritative home. Default language: **English technical output; user-facing explanations mirror the user's language**.

## When this skill triggers

- User mentions organizing / consolidating / unifying AI memory or instructions
- User references this skill by name (`/ai-memory-unifier`)
- User mentions drift across two or more AI products ("my Cursor rules say X but Claude Code thinks Y")

## When NOT to trigger

- User has one AI product and asks a one-off question about its config → just answer
- User has zero memory files anywhere → overkill; use `templates/CLAUDE.md.template` as a starter
- User explicitly says "quick fix" / "only edit this one file"
- User only wants to sync Cowork Global Instructions back (out of scope)

## Phase map

```
Phase 0  Diagnose        (read-only scan: registry + user-mentioned products)
Phase 1  Analyze         (classify files → propose CLAUDE.md sections + skills)
Phase 2  Archive setup   (create ~/.claude/archive-<date>/ + manifest.json)
Phase 3  Build CLAUDE.md (synthesize sections from scanned content)
Phase 4  Build skills    (create ~/.claude/skills/<name>/ directories)
Phase 5  Migrate         (mv source files into archive; NEVER direct delete)
Phase 6  Loops           (register scheduled tasks: Codex sync + daily reorg)
```

**Every phase requires explicit user approval before execution.** Skip-phase, adjust, or abort-at-any-time is always allowed.

Each phase has a detailed runbook in `references/phase-<N>-*.md` — load it on demand, not all at once.

---

## Scope: which AI products

The product registry is at `references/product-registry.md`. It lists:

- **Primary target** (writable, authoritative): Claude Code
- **Sync target** (writable): Codex CLI via `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` + `~/.codex/skills/`
- **Scannable sources** (read during Phase 0): Cursor, Aider, Continue, Cline, Windsurf, Zed, Gemini CLI, Amp, Qclaw/OpenClaw, and more
- **Out of scope** (server-side, can't reliably read/write locally): Cowork Global Instructions, ChatGPT custom instructions, Claude.ai preferences, Gemini custom instructions, GitHub Copilot

Phase 0 iterates the registry; Phase 0 also **asks the user** whether they use products not in the registry (especially smaller or regional ones like Hermes, KimiClaw, Doubao, Tongyi Lingma, etc.), and adds those to the scan.

---

## Core operating principles (read before starting)

### 1. Read-only → Propose → Approve → Execute

For phases 0–1: only read the filesystem, never modify. Present findings to the user first. Only act after explicit "yes, proceed".

### 2. Copy-first; never direct-delete

Phase 5 "migration" is actually `mv source → ~/.claude/archive-<date>/`. Archive is kept for at least 30 days. Users delete when they're ready.

### 3. SHA256 manifest for every file moved

Before moving any file, hash it and record `{source, archive, sha256, size, category, decision}` in `manifest-<date>.json`. This makes rollback precise and verifiable.

### 4. Dynamic detection, not assumed setup

Don't assume the user has Codex, Cursor, Aider, or any other specific product. Use `references/product-registry.md` to enumerate detection methods; skip products that aren't installed.

Also ask the user: "any AI products I might have missed?" — the registry isn't exhaustive.

### 5. Never modify settings.json automatically

The user likely has custom hooks, permissions, and plugins in `~/.claude/settings.json` (and analogs for other products). **Read-only** from this skill. If AutoMemory is out of control, *recommend* toggling `autoMemoryEnabled: false` but require explicit user confirmation to change.

### 6. Log everything

Append to `~/.claude/reorg-log/<date>.md` as each phase completes. The log is the audit trail and the rollback instruction sheet.

### 7. Progressive disclosure in this skill

- SKILL.md (this file) stays short (< 300 lines). Overview only.
- Details for each phase in `references/phase-<N>-*.md`.
- Product registry in `references/product-registry.md`.
- Templates in `templates/` — loaded when generating specific files.

## Phase 0 — Kickoff interview + Diagnose

**Intent**: two-part phase.
- **Part A (interview)**: before any scanning, ask the user upfront what AI products they use — including ones not in our registry. Build internal `scan_sources` + `sync_target_list` + `note_only` lists. Also confirm which detected Tier-1 products they want auto-synced going forward.
- **Part B (inventory)**: read-only filesystem scan guided by Part A's answers.

**Load**: `references/phase-0-diagnose.md` + `references/product-registry.md`

**Output**: a diagnostic report listing products in scope, their memory files, sync targets set up in Phase 6, and server-side products noted for manual handling. Ask the user to confirm before Phase 1.

**Key principle**: the interview is where the user tells Claude what to sync to. Users **never hand-edit** `state.json`. Claude writes the config based on the natural-language conversation in Part A.

---

## Phase 1 — Analyze & propose

**Intent**: read every candidate file; classify each into a target; propose a final structure.

**Load**: `references/phase-1-analyze.md`

**Classification labels** (apply per file):
- 🔵 **CLAUDE.md** — cross-product, high-frequency, identity/preference/rule content
- 🟢 **Existing skill** — fits an existing skill's topic
- 🟡 **New skill** — topic is thick enough to stand alone
- ⚪ **Keep in place** — project-bound or product-bound, low-frequency, fine where it is
- 🔴 **Archive only** — noise, duplicates, or expired info

**Propose**:
- CLAUDE.md target structure (sections, estimated line count; keep under 150)
- List of new skills to create (name + one-line description + source files)
- List of files going to archive-only

**User approval**: the user can edit classifications before Phase 2.

---

## Phase 2 — Archive setup

**Intent**: create the safety net before touching anything.

**Load**: `references/phase-5-migrate.md` (sections on archive layout + manifest schema)

**Actions**:
1. `mkdir -p ~/.claude/archive-<YYYY-MM-DD>/{projects,per-product,misc}`
2. `mkdir -p ~/.claude/reorg-log/`
3. Compute SHA256 of every source file in Phase 1's plan
4. Write `~/.claude/reorg-log/manifest-<YYYY-MM-DD>.json` using `templates/manifest.json.template`
5. Start `~/.claude/reorg-log/<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` with "Phase 0-1 findings + Phase 2 starting"

**Nothing moves yet** — this is all preparation.

---

## Phase 3 — Build CLAUDE.md

**Intent**: synthesize the global CLAUDE.md from extracted content.

**Load**: `references/phase-3-claude-md.md` + `templates/CLAUDE.md.template`

**Process**:
1. Read template skeleton (sections: Identity, People, Speaker Identification, Active Projects, Communication, Work Style, Tool Constraints, Memory Mechanism, Reorg History)
2. For each 🔵-classified source file (from any product), extract key facts into the right section
3. Add the fixed **Memory Mechanism** meta-rule (CLAUDE.md + skills are authority; AutoMemory absorbed by daily Loop)
4. Add **Reorg History** footnote pointing at `archive-<date>/`
5. Write to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`. Verify line count ≤ 150; warn if > 200

**User review**: show the generated CLAUDE.md; let the user edit before committing.

---

## Phase 4 — Build skills

**Intent**: materialize each 🟡 (new skill) and update each 🟢 (existing skill).

**Load**: `references/phase-4-skills.md` + `templates/skill.template.md`

**Process** (for each new skill):
1. `mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/<name>/`
2. Fill `SKILL.md` from template: `frontmatter.name`, `frontmatter.description` (with trigger words), content body drawn from source files
3. Preserve section granularity (don't flatten multiple source files into one blob)
4. If Codex detected: `ln -s ~/.claude/skills/<name> ~/.codex/skills/<name>`

**User review**: list all new/modified skills. Let user approve en masse or skip some.

---

## Phase 5 — Migrate sources

**Intent**: move everything migrated into archive, leaving the authority locations pristine.

**Load**: `references/phase-5-migrate.md`

**Process** (per classified file):
1. `mv <source> <archive_path>` (the `archive_path` from manifest)
2. Verify move succeeded; update manifest entry with `migrated_at: <timestamp>`
3. Append to `~/.claude/reorg-log/<date>.md`

**Never direct delete**. Never `rm -rf`. Only `mv`.

Sources from **other products** (Cursor, Aider, etc.) are **NOT moved by default** — we only moved Claude Code's own scattered files. Other products' configs stay where they are; the consolidation copies content into CLAUDE.md + skills, but leaves original files alone so the other products keep working.

Exception: if the user explicitly asks "strip Cursor rules I've migrated to CLAUDE.md", do it per-file with confirmation and archive the stripped version.

---

## Phase 6 — Register Loops

**Intent**: set up two durable scheduled tasks to keep the system healthy.

**Load**: `references/phase-6-loops.md` + `templates/scheduled-task-*.template.md`

**Loop 1 — Memory Sync** (multi-target, data-driven):
- Cron: `17 9 * * *` (daily ~09:17)
- Reads `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`; on change, writes to every enabled target in `state.json` with header comment
- **Targets were decided during Phase 0's interview** (Part A): built-in Tier-1 products user confirmed + any user-added custom raw-md targets. Phase 6 just writes them into `state.json` — no new questions to user here.
- Built-in Tier-1 baseline (auto-included if user has them):
  - `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` (Codex CLI)
  - `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md` (Gemini CLI)
  - `~/.codeium/windsurf/memories/global_rules.md` (Windsurf)
- Per-target hash state; per-target fail-closed on external edit
- Runs silently (no user notification)
- Tier 2 / 3 targets (JSON/YAML fields, project-local) planned for future versions
- Post-setup tweaks (add / disable / remove): see `references/custom-sync-targets.md`

**Loop 2 — Daily reorg scan**:
- Cron: `23 21 * * *` (daily ~21:23)
- Scans: CLAUDE.md health (line-count thresholds), skill changes, AutoMemory new files, symlink consistency
- Appends a daily report to `~/.claude/reorg-log/<date>.md`
- Suggests migrations but never executes without user confirmation
- Runs with `notifyOnCompletion: true` so user sees the nightly report

**Register using** `mcp__scheduled-tasks__create_scheduled_task`. Target IDs: `memory-sync-agents` and `memory-reorg-scan`.

---

## Completion report

At the very end, print a summary to chat and append to `~/.claude/reorg-log/<date>.md`:

- CLAUDE.md: X lines (target < 150)
- Skills: N total (M newly created, K merged)
- Products scanned: list with detection status
- Archive: `~/.claude/archive-<date>/` with Y files totaling Z KB
- Loops registered: Loop 1 (if applicable) + Loop 2
- Out-of-scope products (e.g., Cowork): listed for user awareness, no action taken
- Rollback: "Run `bash ~/.claude/archive-<date>/rollback.sh` to restore (script generated during Phase 2)"

---

## Boundaries & anti-patterns

- **Don't invent content**. If a section has no source material, leave it empty with a `<!-- TODO: fill when info available -->` comment.
- **Don't suggest plugin packaging**. CoWork plugin mount bug (#31542) makes that path unreliable and Cowork sync is out of scope anyway.
- **Don't touch `settings.json`**. Only read it.
- **Don't move other products' source files** (like `.cursorrules`) unless user explicitly asks. They serve that product; consolidation means copying content into CLAUDE.md/skills, not stealing the source.
- **Don't try to sync Cowork Global Instructions**. Server-side; no local API. Out of scope for this skill's v1.
- **Don't try to read ChatGPT / Gemini / Copilot / Claude.ai server-side custom instructions**. Mention them in the diagnostic report as "manual reference" and let the user paste if they want to include that content.
