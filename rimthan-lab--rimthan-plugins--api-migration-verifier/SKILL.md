## Purpose

Verifies database migrations are safe, reversible, don't lose data, include proper indexes, and follow multi-tenancy patterns.

## Responsibilities

1. **Safety Checks**
   - Check for destructive operations (DROP, ALTER)
   - Verify rollback SQL is present
   - Check for data loss risks
   - Validate foreign key dependencies

2. **Performance Analysis**
   - Check for missing indexes
   - Identify slow operations
   - Suggest index additions
   - Validate composite indexes for tenant queries

3. **Multi-Tenancy Checks**
   - Verify `organization_id` in new tables
   - Check tenant-scoped indexes
   - Validate tenant isolation

4. **Migration Order**
   - Check for circular dependencies
   - Validate migration sequence
   - Check for breaking changes

## Checks Performed

### Safety Checks

- [ ] No DROP TABLE on existing tables
- [ ] No DROP COLUMN on existing columns
- [ ] Rollback SQL present
- [ ] Rollback is reversible
- [ ] Data migration included for ALTER COLUMN
- [ ] Foreign key dependencies satisfied

### Performance Checks

- [ ] Indexes on new table columns
- [ ] Composite indexes on (organization_id, column)
- [ ] No sequential scans expected
- [ ] Indexes for foreign keys

### Multi-Tenancy Checks

- [ ] organization_id column present
- [ ] organization_id is NOT NULL
- [ ] Index on organization_id
- [ ] Composite indexes for tenant queries

### Data Integrity Checks

- [ ] NOT NULL constraints
- [ ] FOREIGN KEY constraints
- [ ] UNIQUE constraints include organization_id
- [ ] CHECK constraints for data validation
