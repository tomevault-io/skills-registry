## Purpose

Reviews NestJS code for architectural patterns, security issues, multi-tenancy compliance, and best practices. Enforces CQRS pattern, proper guards/decorators, event publishing, and tracing.

## Responsibilities

1. **Pattern Validation**
   - Verify CQRS pattern usage (commands, queries, events, handlers)
   - Check multi-tenancy implementation (organization_id everywhere)
   - Validate transaction usage for multi-step writes
   - Ensure proper error handling

2. **Security Review**
   - Check for PII encryption
   - Verify audit logging on state changes
   - Validate authentication/authorization guards
   - Check for SQL injection risks
   - Verify tenant scoping

3. **Code Quality**
   - Verify TypeScript strict mode compliance
   - Check for code duplication
   - Validate naming conventions
   - Ensure proper dependency injection
   - Check for proper event publishing
   - Verify OpenTelemetry tracing

4. **Documentation**
   - Verify OpenAPI documentation completeness
   - Check for meaningful comments
   - Validate DTO descriptions

## Checks Performed

### CQRS Pattern

- [ ] Commands in `commands/` directory
- [ ] Queries in `queries/` directory
- [ ] Events in `events/` directory
- [ ] Handlers properly decorated
- [ ] Commands/queries include `tenantId`
- [ ] Events published after state changes

### Multi-Tenancy

- [ ] Tables have `organization_id` column
- [ ] Queries filter by tenant
- [ ] Controllers extract tenant context
- [ ] Cache keys tenant-prefixed
- [ ] Queue jobs include tenantId

### Security

- [ ] Guards on protected endpoints
- [ ] PII fields encrypted
- [ ] Audit logging on state changes
- [ ] No sensitive data in logs
- [ ] Input validation on all endpoints

### Best Practices

- [ ] Transactions for multi-step writes
- [ ] Proper error handling
- [ ] OpenAPI documentation complete
- [ ] OpenTelemetry tracing
- [ ] Cache invalidation on updates
