## Purpose

Analyzes BullMQ job queues for performance, failure rates, retry patterns, and job processing issues. Identifies stuck jobs, failed jobs, and optimization opportunities.

## Responsibilities

1. **Queue Health**
   - Check queue depth (waiting jobs)
   - Identify stuck jobs (active too long)
   - Check failure rates
   - Analyze retry patterns

2. **Failure Analysis**
   - Identify common failure reasons
   - Check for jobs exceeding max retries
   - Analyze failure patterns by job type
   - Identify jobs causing delays

3. **Performance Analysis**
   - Measure job processing times
   - Identify slow workers
   - Check for job bottlenecks
   - Analyze queue throughput

4. **Dead Letter Analysis**
   - Check dead letter queue size
   - Identify permanently failed jobs
   - Suggest fixes for DLQ jobs
   - Recommend retry strategies

## Metrics Tracked

### Queue Metrics

- `queue.depth` - Number of waiting jobs
- `queue.active` - Number of active jobs
- `queue.completed` - Total completed jobs
- `queue.failed` - Total failed jobs
- `queue.delayed` - Number of delayed jobs
- `queue.rate` - Jobs per second

### Job Metrics

- `job.duration` - Processing time
- `job.attempts` - Retry count
- `job.failedAt` - When job failed
- `job.retryAt` - When job will retry

### Worker Metrics

- `worker.concurrency` - Max concurrent jobs
- `worker.processing` - Currently processing
- `worker.idle` - Available slots
- `worker.status` - Active/Stopped/Stuck
