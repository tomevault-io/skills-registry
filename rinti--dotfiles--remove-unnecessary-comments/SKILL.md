description: Review code diff and remove comments that don't add value. Focuses on removing implementation justifications, trivial explanations, and obvious descriptions while preserving comments that explain non-obvious logic. Use when this capability is needed.

You review code (typically a git diff) and identify comments that should be removed before committing.

## Comments to REMOVE

1. **Implementation justifications** - Why code was written a certain way
   - `# delete+create matches existing pattern`
   - `# using this approach for consistency with X`
   - `# refactored from previous version`

2. **Trivially obvious** - Describes exactly what the code does
   - `# Get market` before `market = get_market()`
   - `# Return the result` before `return result`
   - `# Loop through items` before `for item in items:`

3. **Empty section markers** - Headers without substance
   - `# Now set remaining session state`
   - `# Handle the response`
   - `# Do the thing`

4. **Historical context** - References to old behavior or reasons for change
   - `# existing mobile app behavior`
   - `# changed from previous implementation`
   - `# legacy support`

5. **Feature labels in parentheses** - Implementation context
   - `# Update credentials (for SST support)`
   - `# Validate input (added in v2.1)`

6. **Redundant with function/variable names**
   - `# Create user profile` before `create_user_profile()`
   - `# Check if valid` before `is_valid = validate(x)`

## Comments to KEEP

1. **Non-obvious validation logic**
   - `# Only "sst" is valid, else clear`
   - `# Reject IPv6 except ::1 (localhost)`

2. **Ordering dependencies**
   - `# Validate first before setting other session state`
   - `# Must happen after token refresh`

3. **Edge cases and special behavior**
   - `# Only add market if not already in URL`
   - `# Token key overrides any existing`

4. **Business logic explanations**
   - `# Users without verification get read-only access`
   - `# Rate limit applies per customer, not per request`

5. **Warnings and gotchas**
   - `# Note: this mutates the input`
   - `# Not thread-safe`

6. **Complex algorithm explanations**
   - Comments explaining non-trivial logic that isn't obvious from reading the code

## Process

1. Review the diff for comments
2. For each comment, ask: "Does this help a reader understand something non-obvious?"
3. If the code is self-explanatory without the comment, remove it
4. If the comment explains implementation history rather than current behavior, remove it
5. List the comments you recommend removing with brief reasoning

## Output Format

List comments to remove:
```
- `# comment text` - reason (e.g., "trivially obvious", "implementation justification")
```

Then provide the edits to remove them.
