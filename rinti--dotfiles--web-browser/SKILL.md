# Web Browser Skill

Minimal CDP tools for collaborative site exploration.

\`\`\`

Navigate current tab or open new tab.

## Evaluate JavaScript

\`\`\`bash
./scripts/eval.js 'document.title'
./scripts/eval.js 'document.querySelectorAll("a").length'
./scripts/eval.js 'JSON.stringify(Array.from(document.querySelectorAll("a")).map(a => ({ text: a.textContent.trim(), href: a.href })).filter(link => !link.href.startsWith("https://")))'
\`\`\`

Execute JavaScript in active tab (async context).  Be careful with string escaping, best to use single quotes.
