# Phase Planning — Phoenix Agentic Engine Interface

## Repo Context

This is the **Interface SDK** (TypeScript). It defines contracts between Engine and Backend.

## Current Status

- **Phase 1 foundation**: Complete — fixtures, typed SDK, transport, validators, tests

## Next steps

- Keep contract fixtures in sync as backend evolves
- Add WebSocket transport support for real-time streaming (Phase 5+)
- Add `v2` contract namespace when breaking changes are needed
- Expand test coverage for edge cases
- Publish as npm package when ready for external consumption

## How Interface fits into project phases

| Phase | Interface involvement |
|-------|----------------------|
| Phase 0 | Complete — contracts, SDK, tests |
| Phase 1 | Engine integrates SDK into adapter layer |
| Phase 2 | Add delta sync transport, sequence validation |
| Phase 3 | Add tool invocation contract types |
| Phase 4 | Add parallel plan / worktree contract types |
| Phase 5+ | WebSocket streaming, advanced transport |

## Key deliverables this repo owns

- `contracts/v1/*.json` — golden fixture mirrors
- `sdk/client/PhoenixClient.ts` — typed HTTP client
- `sdk/client/types.ts` — request/response TypeScript types
- `sdk/transport/` — HTTP transport with retry/backoff
- `sdk/validators/` — Zod validation schemas
- `tests/contract/` — fixture validation tests
- `tests/compatibility/` — SDK compatibility tests

## Working principles

1. Stay protocol-only — no UI, no orchestration, no business logic
2. Contract compatibility is non-negotiable
3. Keep dependencies minimal
4. Both Engine and Backend depend on this repo
5. Test edge cases — malformed payloads, network errors, retry exhaustion
