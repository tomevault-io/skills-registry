# Code Qualities Assessment

Evaluate code maintainability using 5 timeless design qualities with quantifiable scoring rubrics.

## Triggers

- `assess code quality`
- `evaluate maintainability`
- `check code qualities`
- `testability review`
- `run quality assessment`

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Assess a single file
python3 scripts/assess.py --target src/services/auth.py

# Assess changed files only (CI mode)
python3 scripts/assess.py --target . --changed-only --format json

# Full module assessment with HTML report
python3 scripts/assess.py --target src/services/ --format html --output quality-report.html
```

## The 5 Code Qualities

| Quality | Question | Score 10 | Score 1-3 |
|---------|----------|----------|-----------|
| **Cohesion** | How related are responsibilities? | Single, well-defined responsibility | Unrelated responsibilities jammed together |
| **Coupling** | How dependent on other code? | Minimal deps, depends on abstractions | Tightly coupled, hard-coded dependencies |
| **Encapsulation** | How well are internals hidden? | All internals private, minimal API | Everything public, no information hiding |
| **Testability** | How easily verified in isolation? | Pure functions, injected dependencies | Hard to test, requires full integration |
| **Non-Redundancy** | How unique is each piece of knowledge? | Zero duplication, appropriate abstractions | Pervasive copy-paste |

---

## When to Use

Use this skill when:

- Reviewing code quality before merge
- Identifying refactoring priorities
- Establishing quality baselines
- Teaching code design principles
- Tracking quality trends over time
- Enforcing quality gates in CI

Use [analyze](../analyze/SKILL.md) instead when:

- Performing broad codebase investigation
- Security assessment is the focus
- Architecture review is needed

---

## Process

The skill runs automated assessment via `scripts/assess.py`:

1. **Symbol Extraction**
   - Detect language
   - Use Serena (if available)
   - Extract classes/methods

2. **Quality Scoring**
   - Run 5 quality assessments
   - Apply context rules (test vs prod)
   - Aggregate symbol -> file -> module

3. **Comparison (if historical data)**
   - Load previous scores
   - Identify regressions/improvements

4. **Report Generation**
   - Format: markdown, JSON, or HTML
   - Include remediation guidance
   - Link to refactoring patterns

5. **Gate Enforcement (CI mode)**
   - Check thresholds
   - Exit code: 0=pass, 10=degraded

## Command Reference

### Basic Usage

```bash
python3 scripts/assess.py --target <path> [options]
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `--target` | Yes | - | File, directory, or glob pattern |
| `--context` | No | production | production, test, or generated |
| `--changed-only` | No | false | Only assess changed files (git diff) |
| `--format` | No | markdown | markdown, json, or html |
| `--config` | No | .qualityrc.json | Path to config file |
| `--output` | No | stdout | Output file path |
| `--use-serena` | No | auto | auto, yes, or no (Serena integration) |

### Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Assessment complete, all thresholds met |
| 10 | Quality degraded vs previous run |
| 11 | Quality below configured thresholds |
| 1 | Script error (invalid args, file not found) |

---

## Configuration

Create `.qualityrc.json` to customize thresholds:

```json
{
  "thresholds": {
    "cohesion": { "min": 7, "warn": 5 },
    "coupling": { "max": 3, "warn": 5 },
    "encapsulation": { "min": 7, "warn": 5 },
    "testability": { "min": 6, "warn": 4 },
    "nonRedundancy": { "min": 8, "warn": 6 }
  },
  "context": {
    "test": {
      "testability": { "min": 3 }
    }
  },
  "ignore": [
    "**/generated/**",
    "**/*.pb.py",
    "**/migrations/**"
  ]
}
```

---

## Anti-Patterns

| Avoid | Why | Instead |
|-------|-----|---------|
| Running on entire codebase every commit | Slow, noisy | Use --changed-only in CI |
| Using scores for performance reviews | Gaming the system | Focus on trend improvement |
| Blocking merges on absolute scores | Discourages refactoring old code | Block on regression only |
| Ignoring context (test vs production) | False positives | Use --context flag |
| Not configuring thresholds | One-size-fits-all does not fit | Customize .qualityrc.json |

---

## Verification

After running assessment:

- [ ] All 5 qualities scored for each symbol
- [ ] Scores are 1-10 (not null or out of range)
- [ ] Remediation links provided for low scores
- [ ] Report format is valid (markdown/JSON/HTML)
- [ ] Exit code matches assessment result
- [ ] Historical data saved to .quality-cache/

### Cohesion

How strongly related are responsibilities within a boundary?

High cohesion = focused, understandable code. Low cohesion = "god objects" doing too much.

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 10 | Single, well-defined responsibility |
| 7-9 | Primary responsibility clear, minor supporting concerns |
| 4-6 | Multiple loosely related responsibilities |
| 1-3 | Unrelated responsibilities jammed together |

### Coupling

How dependent is this code on other code?

Loose coupling = independent evolution, easy testing. Tight coupling = fragile, hard to test.

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 10 | Minimal dependencies, depends on abstractions |
| 7-9 | Few dependencies, all explicit |
| 4-6 | Moderate dependencies, some global state |
| 1-3 | Tightly coupled, hard-coded dependencies |

### Encapsulation

How well are implementation details hidden?

Good encapsulation = freedom to change internals. Poor encapsulation = brittle API.

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 10 | All internals private, minimal public API |
| 7-9 | Mostly private, well-defined API |
| 4-6 | Some internals exposed |
| 1-3 | Everything public, no information hiding |

### Testability

How easily can behavior be verified in isolation?

Testable code = fast feedback, confidence to refactor. Untestable code = fear of change.

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 10 | Pure functions, injected dependencies |
| 7-9 | Mostly testable, straightforward to mock |
| 4-6 | Moderately testable, requires setup |
| 1-3 | Hard to test, requires full integration |

### Non-Redundancy

How unique is each piece of knowledge?

DRY code = fix once, single source of truth. Duplication = fix N times, maintenance burden.

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 10 | Zero duplication, appropriate abstractions |
| 7-9 | Minimal duplication (intentional) |
| 4-6 | Moderate duplication, missed abstractions |
| 1-3 | Pervasive copy-paste |

<summary><strong>Deep Dive: Examples</strong></summary>

### Example 1: Single File Assessment

```bash
python3 scripts/assess.py --target src/models/user.py
```

Output:

```markdown
# Code Quality Assessment: src/models/user.py

## Summary
- **Cohesion**: 8/10
- **Coupling**: 4/10 (warning)
- **Encapsulation**: 9/10
- **Testability**: 7/10
- **Non-Redundancy**: 9/10

## Issues Found

### Coupling: 4/10 (Warning)
**Problem**: Direct instantiation of DatabaseConnection in constructor

**Impact**: Hard to test, tightly coupled to database layer

**Remediation**: Use dependency injection
- See: [Dependency Injection](references/patterns/dependency-injection.md)
- Related ADR: ADR-023 (Dependency Management)
```

**Example Fix:**

```python
# Before
class User:
    def __init__(self):
        self.db = DatabaseConnection()  # Hard-coded dependency

# After
class User:
    def __init__(self, db: DatabaseInterface):
        self.db = db  # Injected dependency
```

### Example 2: CI Integration

```bash
# In CI pipeline
python3 scripts/assess.py --target . --changed-only --format json --output quality.json

# Exit code 10 = quality degraded, fail PR
# Exit code 0 = quality maintained, pass
```

### Example 3: Full Codebase Report

```bash
python3 scripts/assess.py --target src/ --format html --output reports/quality.html
```

Opens dashboard showing:

- Quality trends over time
- Hot spots (lowest scoring files)
- Improvement opportunities
- Top refactoring priorities

### With planner

```bash
# Identify refactoring targets
python3 scripts/assess.py --target src/ --format json | \
  jq '.files | sort_by(.overall) | .[0:5]' > low-quality-files.json

# Feed to planner
planner --input low-quality-files.json --goal "Refactor lowest quality files"
```

### With adr-review

When reviewing ADRs, include quality impact:

```bash
# Before implementing ADR
python3 scripts/assess.py --target affected-files.txt > baseline.md

# After implementing ADR
python3 scripts/assess.py --target affected-files.txt > post-implementation.md

# Compare
diff baseline.md post-implementation.md
```

### With analyze

Combine broad analysis with focused quality metrics:

```bash
# First: broad exploration
analyze --target src/

# Then: quality deep dive on problem areas
python3 scripts/assess.py --target src/services/auth.py
```

## Design Philosophy

This skill embodies "sergeant methods directing privates":

- **Sergeant (assess.py)**: Orchestrates workflow, delegates to specialists
- **Privates (score_*.py)**: Focus on one quality each, report back

Each quality scorer is cohesive (single responsibility), loosely coupled (independent), and testable (pure calculation).

### Timelessness: 9/10

These 5 qualities are computer science fundamentals:

- Cohesion and coupling: 1970s (Parnas, Stevens)
- Encapsulation: Core OOP principle (1960s)
- Testability: TDD movement (1990s-2000s)
- DRY: Pragmatic Programmer (1999)

Language-agnostic design ensures longevity across technology shifts.
