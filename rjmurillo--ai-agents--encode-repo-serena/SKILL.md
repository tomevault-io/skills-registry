# Encode Repository (Serena-Enhanced)

Transform an undocumented codebase into a rich, searchable knowledge repository using Serena's LSP-powered symbol analysis.

## Triggers

| Trigger Phrase | Operation |
|----------------|-----------|
| `encode this repository` | Full 12-phase encoding pipeline |
| `populate forgetful with this codebase` | Full encoding pipeline |
| `onboard to this repo` | Discovery + foundation phases |
| `refresh project understanding` | Re-run encoding on updated codebase |
| `build knowledge base for this project` | Full encoding pipeline |

## When to Use

Use this skill when:

- Onboarding to a new repository that lacks Forgetful knowledge
- Repository structure has changed significantly since last encoding
- Forgetful searches return sparse or outdated results for the project

Use `research-and-incorporate` instead when:

- Researching an external topic, not encoding a codebase
- You need analysis of a single concept, not full repository encoding

## Quick Start

```text
/encode-repo-serena
/encode-repo-serena ./my-project
"encode this repository"
"populate forgetful with this codebase"
```

| Input | Output | Duration |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Codebase path | Forgetful memories + entities + docs | 30-60 min |

## Prerequisites

1. **Serena plugin**: `claude plugins list | grep serena`
2. **Forgetful MCP**: Test with `execute_forgetful_tool("list_projects", {})`
3. If missing, run `/context-hub-setup` first

## Process

### Phase 0: Discovery

Assess project size, complexity, and structure. Produce a structure map.

### Phase 1: Foundation

Create 5-10 project overview memories covering purpose, tech stack, and entry points.

### Phase 1B: Dependencies

Create 1-3 dependency memories documenting external libraries and internal references.

### Phase 2: Symbols

Use Serena `find_symbol` and `find_referencing_symbols` to produce 10-15 architecture memories.

### Phase 2B: Entities

Create component entities with relationships in Forgetful. Deduplicate before creating.

### Phase 3: Patterns

Document 8-12 recurring code patterns, conventions, and idioms.

### Phase 4: Features

Create 1-2 memories per critical feature describing behavior and implementation.

### Phase 5: Decisions

Record design decisions with rationale and alternatives considered.

### Phase 6: Artifacts

Store code artifacts (configs, schemas, key files) in Forgetful.

### Phase 6B: Symbol Index

Create a symbol index document with an entry memory for navigation.

### Phase 7: Documents

Produce long-form documentation summarizing the codebase.

### Phase 7B: Architecture

Create an architecture reference document linking all prior phases.

See [references/phases.md](references/phases.md) for full phase details.

## Execution Order

```text
0 → 1 → 1B → 2 → 2B → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 6B → 7 → 7B
```

**Guidelines**:

- Execute phases in order
- Use Serena's `find_symbol` and `find_referencing_symbols`
- Deduplicate entities before creating
- Link entities to memories bidirectionally
- Create entry memories for documents

## Memory Targets

| Profile | Total Memories | Documents | Entities |
|---------|----------------|-----------|----------|
| Small Simple | 17-31 | 2 | 3-5 |
| Small Complex | 28-46 | 2 | 5-10 |
| Medium | 38-66 | 2-3 | 10-20 |
| Large | 66-112 | 3-6 | 20-40 |

## Quality Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Symbol-accurate | Use LSP data, not guesses |
| Atomic | One concept per memory |
| Size | 200-400 words ideal |
| Importance | Most should be 7-8 |
| Linking | Connect related memories |

## Validation

After encoding, verify all outputs meet quality standards:

- [ ] Test memory search: "How do I add a new API endpoint?"
- [ ] Test dependency query: "What dependencies does this project use?"
- [ ] List entities by project
- [ ] Verify entity relationships
- [ ] Check Symbol Index document exists
- [ ] Check Architecture Reference document exists
- [ ] Verify project.notes populated
- [ ] All target components have Forgetful entities created
- [ ] Entity relationships reflect actual code dependencies
- [ ] Memories linked to corresponding entities
- [ ] No duplicate entities in knowledge graph

See [references/validation.md](references/validation.md) for test commands.

## Anti-Patterns

| Avoid | Why | Instead |
|-------|-----|---------|
| Skipping Phase 0 discovery | Wastes effort on wrong project scope | Always assess project size and complexity first |
| Creating non-atomic memories | Pollutes search results, hard to maintain | One concept per memory, 200-400 words |
| Duplicate entities | Bloats knowledge graph, inconsistent links | Deduplicate entities before creating |
| Skipping validation | No confidence in encoding quality | Run validation checklist after completion |
