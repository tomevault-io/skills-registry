# SLO Designer

When this skill activates, you guide users through designing production-ready Service Level Objectives. Your role is to help identify critical user journeys, define measurable SLIs, set appropriate targets, and calculate error budgets.

## Triggers

Activate when the user:

- `Design SLOs for my service`
- `Define reliability targets`
- `Calculate error budget`
- `Define SLIs for this system`
- `What should my availability target be?`

## When to Use

Use this skill when:

- Defining reliability targets for a new or existing service
- Calculating error budgets for capacity planning
- Establishing SLIs and alerting thresholds
- Stakeholders ask "what should our availability target be?"

Use [chaos-experiment](../chaos-experiment/SKILL.md) instead when:

- Testing whether the system meets its SLOs through failure injection
- Validating resilience mechanisms work as designed

Use [threat-modeling](../threat-modeling/SKILL.md) instead when:

- Analyzing security threats, not reliability targets

## Core Concepts

| Term | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| **SLI** | Service Level Indicator. Metric measuring service quality. | p99 latency, availability % |
| **SLO** | Service Level Objective. Target value for an SLI. | p99 < 200ms, 99.9% availability |
| **SLA** | Service Level Agreement. Contract with consequences. | 99.95% uptime or credits issued |
| **Error Budget** | Allowed failures before SLO breach. | 0.1% = 43 min/month downtime |
| **Burn Rate** | Speed of error budget consumption. | 2x burn = budget exhausted in 15 days |

## Common SLI Categories

### Availability

Percentage of successful requests.

```python
availability_sli = (successful_requests / total_requests) * 100
```

Good for: APIs, web services, databases.

### Latency

Response time percentiles (p50, p95, p99).

```python
latency_sli = percentile(response_times, 99)
```

Good for: User-facing endpoints, real-time systems.

### Throughput

Requests per second (RPS) or transactions.

```python
throughput_sli = requests_per_second / expected_baseline
```

Good for: Batch processing, high-volume systems.

### Error Rate

Percentage of 5xx responses.

```python
error_rate_sli = (error_responses / total_responses) * 100
```

Good for: APIs, microservices.

### Correctness

Percentage of correct results.

```python
correctness_sli = (correct_results / total_results) * 100
```

Good for: Data pipelines, ML inference, calculations.

## Process

```text
1. DISCOVERY          Identify critical user journeys
        |             What matters to users?
        v
2. SLI DEFINITION     Select measurable indicators
        |             How do we measure success?
        v
3. SLO TARGETS        Set achievable targets
        |             What should we promise?
        v
4. ERROR BUDGET       Calculate allowed failures
        |             How much can we fail?
        v
5. ALERTING           Define burn rate alerts
        |             When do we intervene?
        v
6. DOCUMENTATION      Generate SLO document
```

## Scripts

### calculate_error_budget.py

Calculate error budget for a given SLO target:

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/slo-designer/scripts/calculate_error_budget.py \
  --target 99.9 \
  --period monthly
```

**Arguments:**

| Argument | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `--target` | Yes | SLO target percentage (e.g., 99.9) |
| `--period` | No | Time period: monthly, weekly, daily, quarterly (default: monthly) |
| `--format` | No | Output format: text, json, markdown (default: text) |

**Exit Codes:**

- 0: Success
- 1: Invalid arguments
- 2: Calculation error

### generate_slo_document.py

Generate a complete SLO document from configuration:

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/slo-designer/scripts/generate_slo_document.py \
  --config path/to/slo-config.yaml \
  --output docs/slo-document.md
```

## Question Framework

Use these questions to gather requirements:

### 1. Service Context

- What is the service name and purpose?
- Who are the primary users (internal, external, both)?
- What is the business criticality (revenue impact)?
- Are there existing SLAs or customer expectations?

### 2. User Journeys

- What are the 3-5 most critical user journeys?
- What actions must succeed for users to be satisfied?
- What is the acceptable response time for each journey?
- Which failures are most impactful?

### 3. Current State

- What metrics are already collected?
- What is the current availability (if known)?
- What are the current p50, p95, p99 latencies?
- What is the current error rate?

### 4. Infrastructure

- What is the deployment architecture?
- Are there external dependencies?
- What is the disaster recovery capability?
- What maintenance windows exist?

### 5. Targets

- What availability level is appropriate?
- What latency targets align with user expectations?
- How much error budget can the team responsibly manage?
- What alerting thresholds make sense?

## SLO Target Guidelines

| Service Type | Typical Availability | Latency (p99) | Error Rate |
|--------------|---------------------|---------------|------------|
| Consumer Web | 99.9% (43 min/month) | < 500ms | < 1% |
| Internal API | 99.5% (3.6 hr/month) | < 1s | < 2% |
| B2B Critical | 99.95% (22 min/month) | < 200ms | < 0.1% |
| Batch Jobs | 99% (7.3 hr/month) | N/A | < 5% |
| Real-time | 99.99% (4 min/month) | < 100ms | < 0.01% |

**Choosing a target:**

- Start conservative (lower targets are easier to meet)
- Consider external dependencies (chain reliability)
- Account for maintenance windows
- Leave margin from SLA (SLO should be tighter)

## Error Budget Table

| SLO Target | Error Budget | Monthly Downtime | Weekly Downtime |
|------------|--------------|------------------|-----------------|
| 99% | 1% | 7h 18m | 1h 41m |
| 99.5% | 0.5% | 3h 39m | 50m |
| 99.9% | 0.1% | 43m 50s | 10m |
| 99.95% | 0.05% | 21m 55s | 5m |
| 99.99% | 0.01% | 4m 23s | 1m |
| 99.999% | 0.001% | 26s | 6s |

## Burn Rate Alerting

Configure alerts based on budget consumption rate:

| Alert Severity | Burn Rate | Time to Exhaust | Action |
|----------------|-----------|-----------------|--------|
| Warning | 1x | 30 days | Monitor closely |
| Elevated | 2x | 15 days | Investigate |
| Urgent | 6x | 5 days | Prioritize fix |
| Critical | 14.4x | 2 days | Immediate action |
| Emergency | 36x | 20 hours | All hands |

**Multi-window alerting:**

```text
Alert if:
  burn_rate_1h > 14.4 AND burn_rate_6h > 6
  OR
  burn_rate_6h > 6 AND burn_rate_24h > 2
```

## Output Template

Generate this structure:

```markdown
# SLO Document: [Service Name]

## Service Overview
- **Name**: [Service name]
- **Owner**: [Team name]
- **Description**: [What the service does]
- **Business Criticality**: [Low/Medium/High/Critical]

## Critical User Journeys
1. [Journey 1]: [Description]
2. [Journey 2]: [Description]
3. [Journey 3]: [Description]

## Service Level Indicators

### SLI 1: Availability
- **Definition**: Percentage of successful HTTP requests
- **Measurement**: `sum(rate(http_requests_total{status!~"5.."}[5m])) / sum(rate(http_requests_total[5m]))`
- **Data Source**: Prometheus metrics

### SLI 2: Latency
- **Definition**: 99th percentile response time
- **Measurement**: `histogram_quantile(0.99, rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m]))`
- **Data Source**: Prometheus metrics

## Service Level Objectives

| SLI | Target | Measurement Window | Rationale |
|-----|--------|-------------------|-----------|
| Availability | 99.9% | 30-day rolling | Industry standard for user-facing APIs |
| Latency (p99) | < 200ms | 30-day rolling | User research shows frustration above 200ms |

## Error Budgets

| SLO | Error Budget | Monthly Allowance | Current Consumption |
|-----|--------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Availability 99.9% | 0.1% | 43 minutes | [Current] |
| Latency p99 < 200ms | 0.1% | 43 minutes | [Current] |

## Alerting Strategy

### Page-worthy Alerts (Critical)
- Burn rate > 14.4x for 1 hour AND > 6x for 6 hours
- Action: Immediate response required

### Ticket-worthy Alerts (Warning)
- Burn rate > 2x for 24 hours
- Action: Investigate within 1 business day

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Metrics collection configured
- [ ] SLO dashboard created
- [ ] Alerts configured
- [ ] Runbook documented
- [ ] Team trained on error budget policy
```

## Related Concepts

### SLO vs SLA

- **SLO**: Internal target. No contractual penalty.
- **SLA**: External contract. Financial consequences.
- **Best Practice**: SLO should be stricter than SLA to provide buffer.

### Error Budget Policy

When error budget is exhausted:

1. Freeze non-critical feature work
2. Prioritize reliability improvements
3. Conduct incident reviews
4. Address technical debt

When error budget is healthy:

1. Invest in new features
2. Accept more risk
3. Run experiments

## Anti-Patterns

| Avoid | Why | Instead |
|-------|-----|---------|
| Setting SLO equal to SLA | No buffer for error budget | SLO should be stricter than SLA |
| Targeting 100% availability | Impossible and prevents feature velocity | Use 99.9% or lower based on service type |
| Internal metrics as SLIs | Do not reflect user experience | Measure from user perspective (latency, errors) |
| No error budget policy | SLOs become meaningless targets | Define actions when budget is exhausted |
| Same SLO for all services | Different services have different needs | Match target to business criticality |

## Verification

After designing SLOs:

- [ ] SLIs defined with specific measurement queries
- [ ] SLO targets set with rationale documented
- [ ] Error budgets calculated for each SLO
- [ ] Alerting thresholds defined (burn rate based)
- [ ] Error budget policy documented (what happens when exhausted)
- [ ] SLO document generated and reviewed by stakeholders
