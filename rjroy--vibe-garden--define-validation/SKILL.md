description: This skill defines AI validation criteria for work in progress. Use when validation wasn't defined in spec/plan, or when starting work without formal documentation. Triggers include "how will the AI validate", "define validation criteria", "what should the AI check", "validation for this work".

# Define Validation

Define how the AI validates its work before declaring done.

## When to Use

- Spec or plan exists but lacks AI Validation section
- Starting work without formal spec/plan
- Want to make validation criteria explicit for any chunk of work
- Reviewing existing criteria for completeness

## Process

1. **Identify the work**: Read any existing spec, plan, or gather context from conversation
2. **Start with defaults**: Always include the standard validation checklist
3. **Probe for custom needs**: Ask "Does this feature need any specific verification beyond the defaults?"
4. **Output the criteria**: Present for user confirmation
5. **Save or append**: Either update existing spec/plan or save standalone

## Output

If a spec or plan exists, offer to append the AI Validation section to it.

If no formal document exists, save to `.lore/validation/[feature-or-work].md`

### Validation Criteria Structure

```markdown
## AI Validation

**Defaults** (apply unless overridden):
- Unit tests with mocked time/network/filesystem/LLM calls (including Agent SDK `query()`)
- 90%+ coverage on new code
- Code review by fresh-context sub-agent

**Custom**:
- [Feature-specific validation steps]
```

## Defaults Explained

These apply to virtually all work:

| Default | Why |
|---------|-----|
| Mock time | Tests shouldn't depend on when they run |
| Mock network | Tests shouldn't fail due to connectivity |
| Mock filesystem | Tests should be isolated and reproducible |
| Mock LLM calls | Agent SDK `query()` is an external API, costs money, can fail |
| 90%+ coverage | New code should be exercised by tests |
| Code review | Fresh-context sub-agent catches what the implementer misses |

## Custom Validation Examples

When probing for custom needs, consider:

- **CLI tools**: "Output matches expected format in examples/"
- **Parsers**: "All test fixtures parse without errors"
- **Generators**: "Generated files are syntactically valid"
- **Integrations**: "Integration test passes against staging/mock API"
- **UI components**: "Renders without console errors in test harness"
- **Data migrations**: "Round-trip preserves data integrity"

## Standalone Document Structure

When no spec/plan exists:

```markdown
# Validation: [Work Description]

**For**: Brief description of what's being built

## AI Validation

**Defaults** (apply unless overridden):
- Unit tests with mocked time/network/filesystem/LLM calls (including Agent SDK `query()`)
- 90%+ coverage on new code
- Code review by fresh-context sub-agent

**Custom**:
- [Feature-specific items]

## Context
How this validation criteria was derived (conversation, informal description, etc.)
```

## Keep It Actionable

Validation criteria must be things the AI can actually do:
- "Run the test suite" - actionable
- "Verify the user experience is good" - not actionable
- "Check output matches examples/expected.json" - actionable
- "Ensure performance is acceptable" - not actionable (unless threshold defined)
