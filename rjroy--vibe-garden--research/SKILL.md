# Research

Gather context from outside the project scope.

## When to Use

- Exploring external documentation or APIs
- Finding prior art or existing solutions
- Understanding libraries, frameworks, or tools
- Gathering reference material

## Process

1. Clarify what the user wants to research if unclear
2. Use web search, fetch docs, or read external resources
3. Synthesize findings into a research document
4. Save to `.lore/research/`

## Output

Save findings to `.lore/research/[topic].md`

Use kebab-case for filenames. Use the `date:` frontmatter field for time-sensitive research.

### Document Structure

**Before writing**: Load `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/frontmatter-schema.md` to get frontmatter field definitions and status values for research.

```markdown

## Context
