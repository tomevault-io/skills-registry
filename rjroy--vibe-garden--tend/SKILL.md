# Tend

Maintain hygiene across `.lore/` documents through four sequential modes.

## Config Loading

Before any mode, check for `.lore/lore-config.md`. If it exists, read it and use its frontmatter to inform all subsequent checks. See `references/lore-config.md` for the config format and how each mode uses it.

If no config exists, use defaults from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/frontmatter-schema.md`. Non-standard patterns will be flagged as findings (not errors) and feed into the config suggestion step at the end.

## Modes

| Mode | Purpose | Produces |
|------|---------|----------|
| `status` | Verify and update document status fields | Accuracy: documents reflect reality |
| `tags` | Unify variants, find connections, identify clusters | Semantics: tags are consistent and meaningful |
| `filenames` | Check conventions, suggest renames based on content | Findability: names match content |
| `directories` | Suggest subdivision, archive candidates, detect orphans | Navigation: structure serves scale |

**Dependency chain**: status → tags → filenames → directories

Each mode builds on prior work. Status must be accurate before tag analysis is meaningful. Tags inform filename suggestions. Tag clusters inform directory suggestions.

## Invocation

```
/tend                    # Run all modes sequentially (pause between each)
/tend status             # Run only status mode
/tend tags               # Run only tags mode
/tend filenames          # Run only filenames mode
/tend directories        # Run only directories mode
```

## Common Pattern

All modes follow dry-run → confirm → apply:

1. **Scan**: Gather information without changing anything
2. **Report**: Present findings in categorized format
3. **Confirm**: Wait for user decisions on proposed changes
4. **Apply**: Make confirmed changes and report final state

Never skip confirmation for changes to existing content.

## Running a Mode

Load the appropriate reference file for detailed guidance:

| Mode | Reference |
|------|-----------|
| config | `references/lore-config.md` |
| status | `references/status.md` |
| tags | `references/tags.md` |
| filenames | `references/filenames.md` |
| directories | `references/directories.md` |

Each reference defines: checks to perform, output report format, how to apply changes.

## Sequential Execution

When running `/tend` without arguments, execute modes in order with pauses:

1. Run status mode to completion
2. Ask: "Status complete. Continue to tags?"
3. On confirmation, run tags mode
4. Ask: "Tags complete. Continue to filenames?"
5. On confirmation, run filenames mode
6. Ask: "Filenames complete. Continue to directories?"
7. On confirmation, run directories mode
8. Present final summary

User can stop after any mode. The pause allows them to absorb findings before proceeding.

**Re-scan between modes**: After filenames or directories mode makes changes, paths may have changed. Re-scan `.lore/` before the next mode to pick up new state.

## Config Suggestion

After completing all requested modes (or when the user stops), check whether any findings were dismissed as intentional during this run. If so, offer to write or update `.lore/lore-config.md` so those patterns aren't flagged next time.

See `references/lore-config.md` for what gets suggested and when to skip.

This step only fires when there's something to suggest. If the project's config already covers everything, or nothing non-standard was found, skip silently.

## Task Tracking

Use `TaskCreate` to make tending visible and structured:

```
TaskCreate: "Scan .lore/ for [mode-specific findings]"
TaskCreate: "Present [mode] findings"
TaskCreate: "Get user decisions"
TaskCreate: "Apply confirmed updates"
```

Mark tasks `in_progress` before starting, `completed` when done. Task boundaries force deliberate pacing through each phase.

**Why this matters**:
- Rushing through phases causes missed documents
- Each mode requires different analysis; collapsing them loses thoroughness
- A task marked complete is a claim that the work was done properly

## When to Use

- Documents have accumulated and status is unclear
- Before starting new work, to understand what's active
- Periodically, to keep lore healthy
- When something feels "off" about the project state
- After completing a feature cycle (good time to archive)
- When search isn't finding documents you know exist (tag/naming issues)
