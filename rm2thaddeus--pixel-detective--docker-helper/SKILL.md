# Docker Helper

Use this skill to read Docker state for the repo and list stored data sources.

## Quickstart
- Status + capabilities: `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File skills\\docker-helper\\scripts\\docker_inventory.ps1 -Action status -ListCapabilities`

## Workflow

1. Confirm Docker is available
- `docker version`
- `docker compose version`

2. Inspect containers and compose services
- `docker ps -a`
- `docker compose ps`

3. Inspect volumes and storage
- `docker volume ls`
- `docker system df`
- For repo volumes, run:
  - `docker volume inspect qdrant_storage`
  - `docker volume inspect neo4j_data`

4. Report findings
- Note which services are up, stopped, or missing.
- Identify which volumes exist and their mountpoints.

## Script
- Run: `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File skills\docker-helper\scripts\docker_inventory.ps1`
- With volume details: `-ShowVolumes`
- List capabilities: `-ListCapabilities`
- Action examples:
  - `-Action status`
  - `-Action start -Target neo4j`
  - `-Action stop -Target dev_graph_api`
  - `-Action restart -Target qdrant_db`
  - `-Action logs -Target dev_graph_ui -LogsTail 200`

## Notes
- This skill can start/stop/restart services via docker compose in the repo root.
- `docker compose` actions auto-detect the repo root (by locating `docker-compose.yml`).
- The compose file may warn that the `version` field is obsolete; ignore the warning.
