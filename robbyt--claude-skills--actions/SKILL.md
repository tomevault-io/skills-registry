# GitHub Actions

Monitor and manage GitHub Actions workflows with the `gh` CLI.

## Prerequisites

GitHub CLI must be installed and authenticated:
```bash
gh auth status
```

## Quick Reference

```bash
gh run list                         # List recent runs
gh run view 789                     # View run details
gh run view 789 --log               # View run logs
gh run watch 789                    # Watch running workflow
gh run rerun 789                    # Rerun workflow
```

## List Workflow Runs

```bash
gh run list
gh run list --limit 10
gh run list --workflow ci.yml
gh run list --status failure
gh run list --branch main
```

## View Run Details

```bash
gh run view 789
gh run view 789 --json status,conclusion,jobs
```

## View Run Logs

```bash
gh run view 789 --log
gh run view 789 --log-failed  # Only failed job logs
```

```

## Rerun Workflows
