# Codebase Analysis via Codex

Use Codex for codebase analysis with read-only sandbox.

## CRITICAL: Default Model

**ALWAYS use `model: "gpt-5.2"`** unless the user explicitly requests a different model. Do NOT choose `o3` or other models on your own.

## CRITICAL: Instruct Codex

Every prompt sent to Codex MUST include these instructions:

> "You are running non-interactively as part of a script. Do not ask questions or wait for input. Do not make any changes. Provide your complete analysis immediately."

Codex is a consultant. Claude Code handles all file modifications.

## Quick Start (MCP)

If the `codex` MCP tool is available, use it directly:

```
mcp__plugin_codex_cli__codex({
  "prompt": "You are running non-interactively as part of a script. Do not ask questions or wait for input. Do not make any changes. Provide your complete analysis immediately.\n\nAnalyze this project structure and architecture.",
  "sandbox": "read-only",
  "model": "gpt-5.2"
})
```

## Fallback (Bash)

If MCP is unavailable, use shell command:

```bash
codex exec "You are running non-interactively as part of a script. Do not ask questions or wait for input. Do not make any changes. Provide your complete analysis immediately.

Analyze this project structure and architecture." --sandbox read-only -m gpt-5.2-codex 2>&1
```

## When to Use

- Onboarding to unfamiliar codebases
- Understanding legacy systems
- Mapping component relationships
- Finding hidden dependencies
- Architecture documentation
- Technical debt assessment

## Examples

**Full project analysis:**
```
mcp__plugin_codex_cli__codex({
  "prompt": "You are running non-interactively as part of a script. Do not ask questions or wait for input. Do not make any changes. Provide your complete analysis immediately.\n\nAnalyze this project. Report on:\n- Overall architecture\n- Key dependencies\n- Component relationships\n- Potential issues",
  "sandbox": "read-only",
  "model": "gpt-5.2"
})
```

**Flow mapping:**
```
mcp__plugin_codex_cli__codex({
  "prompt": "You are running non-interactively as part of a script. Do not ask questions or wait for input. Do not make any changes. Provide your complete analysis immediately.\n\nMap the authentication flow in this codebase. Identify all components involved.",
  "sandbox": "read-only",
  "model": "gpt-5.2"
})
```

**Dependency analysis:**
```
mcp__plugin_codex_cli__codex({
  "prompt": "You are running non-interactively as part of a script. Do not ask questions or wait for input. Do not make any changes. Provide your complete analysis immediately.\n\nAnalyze dependencies in this project:\n- Direct vs transitive\n- Outdated packages\n- Circular dependencies\n- Bundle size impact",
  "sandbox": "read-only",
  "model": "gpt-5.2"
})
```

## Performance

- MCP simple analysis: ~5-30 seconds
- MCP with many files: ~1-2 minutes
- Bash fallback: ~2-3 minutes

## Notes

- **Always use `sandbox: "read-only"`** to prevent file modifications
- **NEVER use `sandbox: "danger-full-access"`** - this is forbidden
- Tool name may vary by installation. Check available tools for exact name.
- MCP is preferred; Bash fallback requires `dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true`
- See `references/setup.md` for troubleshooting
