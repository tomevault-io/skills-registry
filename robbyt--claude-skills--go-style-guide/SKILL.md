# Go Style Guide Reviewer

Review Go code against comprehensive style guide, focusing on critical bugs and important maintainability issues.

**This guide assumes Go 1.25+ and does not consider backwards compatibility.** All patterns use modern Go best practices.

## Reference Files

Load references based on code patterns found during review:

| Code Pattern | Reference File |
|--------------|----------------|
| `go func()`, `sync.Mutex`, `sync.`, channels, atomic | `references/concurrency.md` |
| `err`, `error`, `panic`, `Must` functions | `references/errors.md` |
| `interface`, embedding, receivers, `func New`, `init()` | `references/api-design.md` |
| slice/map return, `slices.Clone`, `maps.Clone` | `references/api-design.md` |
| `_test.go`, `t.`, `b.` | `references/testing.md` |
| naming, comments, logging | `references/style.md` |

**Quick reference**: `references/review-checklist.md` - critical patterns with code examples

**Note**: "Copying at boundaries" lives in api-design.md but relates to concurrency safety - check both when ownership/encapsulation is the concern.

## Quick Style Reference

Basic rules that don't need a file lookup:

- **Package names**: lowercase, no underscores, singular (`net/url` not `net/urls`)
- **Receiver names**: 1-2 letters, consistent across all methods (`func (c *Client) Connect()`)
- **Error strings**: lowercase, no punctuation (`errors.New("connection failed")`)
- **Variable names**: short for small scopes (`i`, `v`), longer for large scopes (`requestTimeout`)

## Review Process

Follow this 3-phase workflow for systematic code review:

### Phase 1: Scope Identification

Determine what code to review based on the user's request:

**Pull Request / Branch Review**:
```bash
# Get all changed files in branch
git diff --name-only main...HEAD | grep '\.go$'

# Get diff with context
git diff main...HEAD
```

**Specific Files**:
```bash
# User specifies file(s) directly
# Read the files using the Read tool
```

**Recent Work**:
```bash
# Review recent commits
git log --oneline -n 10
git diff HEAD~5..HEAD
```

**Output**: List of Go files and changes to review.

### Phase 2: Code Analysis

Review the code systematically using the bundled references:

1. **Start with critical issues** (load `references/review-checklist.md` for quick patterns):
   - Unhandled errors
   - Type assertions without check
   - Panics in production code
   - Fire-and-forget goroutines
   - Mutex races and missing defers
   - Nil pointer dereferences

2. **Check important patterns**:
   - Error handling (wrapping, naming, handling once)
   - Boundary safety (copying slices/maps)
   - Struct design (embedding, initialization)
   - Concurrency lifecycle (goroutine management)
   - Exit handling (os.Exit only in main)

3. **Consult topic files as needed** (see Reference Files table above):
   - For detailed explanations of specific patterns
   - When encountering unfamiliar idioms
   - To verify best practices for specific scenarios

**Grep patterns for architectural issues**:
```bash
# Find panic usage (context-dependent - init/main vs library)
rg 'panic\(' --type go

# Find goroutine launches (check lifecycle management)
rg '\bgo\s+' --type go

# Find os.Exit or log.Fatal (should only be in main)
rg '(os\.Exit|log\.Fatal)' --type go

# Find global var declarations (check for mutable state)
rg '^var\s+\w+\s*=' --type go
```

### Phase 3: Report Findings

Structure the review with **Critical** and **Important** issues only (skip Minor issues per user preference).

**Format**:

```markdown
## Code Review Summary

[1-2 sentence overview of code quality and adherence]

**Note**: This review focuses on architectural and semantic issues that require human judgment. For syntax, formatting, and common bugs (unhandled errors, type assertions, etc.), ensure `golangci-lint` is run separately.

## Critical Issues

[Issues that could cause bugs, panics, or data races - MUST fix]

### [Issue Title]
**Location**: `file.go:123` or `functionName()`
**Severity**: Critical

**Current Code**:
```go
[problematic code snippet]
```

**Issue**: [What's wrong and why it's critical]

**Recommended**:
```go
[corrected code]
```

**Guideline**: [Reference to style guide section, e.g., "Error Handling > Type Assertions"]

---

## Important Issues

[Issues affecting maintainability, performance, or style - Should fix]

[Use same format as Critical Issues]

---

## Positive Observations

[Acknowledge good practices: proper error wrapping, clean concurrency patterns, good test structure]

---

## Recommendations

1. [Prioritized action items]
2. [Suggest running golangci-lint skill if not already done]
```

## Optional: Automated Linting Integration

Before or after manual review, suggest running automated linters for complementary coverage:

**If golangci-lint skill is available**:
"Consider running the `golangci-lint` skill for automated static analysis. Say 'run golangci-lint' to execute."

**Manual linting**:
```bash
# Run staticcheck
staticcheck ./...

# Run golangci-lint
golangci-lint run
```

## Key Focus Areas

### Critical (Architecture & Safety)
- Goroutine lifecycle issues (fire-and-forget)
- Race conditions (requires race detector, not linter)
- Panics in production (context-dependent: library vs main)

### Important (Design & Patterns)
- Error handling strategy (when/where to handle, observability boundaries)
- Data ownership (boundaries, copying, shared state)
- Concurrency patterns (channel sizing, context propagation)
- API design (embedding, evolution, encapsulation)
- Testing strategy (table-driven, parallel, time mocking)

### Skip (Handled by Linters or Out of Scope)

**Linter-Caught Issues**:
- Unhandled errors (errcheck)
- Type assertions without checks (staticcheck)
- Missing struct field names (govet)
- Import grouping (goimports/gci)
- Formatting issues (gofmt)
- Common bugs (staticcheck, govet)

**Subjective Preferences (Do Not Flag)**:
- **Assertion library choice**: Use what codebase uses; don't add to new projects unless requested. Both manual checks and assertion libraries (testify, assert) are valid.
- **Line length variations**: Focus on refactoring opportunities, not mechanical line breaking
- **Test helper patterns**: Either `testing.T` parameter or returning errors acceptable; ensure `t.Helper()` used
- **Performance nitpicks**: Only flag when profiling data shows actual impact

## Review Principles

When evaluating code, apply Google's Core Principles in order (from `references/style.md`):
1. **Clarity**: Is the purpose and rationale clear?
2. **Simplicity**: Does it accomplish goals in the straightforward manner?
3. **Concision**: High signal-to-noise ratio?
4. **Maintainability**: Can future programmers modify it correctly?
5. **Consistency**: Aligns with broader codebase patterns?

Then apply specific review guidance:
1. **Be specific**: Quote exact code, provide exact fixes
2. **Cite guidelines**: Reference specific sections of the style guide
3. **Explain impact**: Why does this matter? (correctness, maintainability, performance)
4. **Prioritize**: Critical issues first, important second
5. **Acknowledge good code**: Recognize patterns that follow the core principles

## When to Load Reference Files

Load `references/review-checklist.md` first for quick architectural patterns - it focuses on semantic issues requiring judgment.

Load topic-specific files based on code patterns (see Reference Files table):
- `concurrency.md` - goroutines, mutexes, races, channels
- `errors.md` - error types, wrapping, panic avoidance
- `api-design.md` - interfaces, function design, data boundaries
- `testing.md` - table tests, parallel tests, benchmarks
- `style.md` - naming, documentation, code style

**Important**: Skip reporting issues that golangci-lint would catch. The agent should focus on design, architecture, and context-dependent patterns that require human understanding.

## Context Matters

Some patterns have exceptions:
- `init()` acceptable for database driver registration
- `panic()` acceptable in tests (use `t.Fatal` or `t.FailNow`)
- Global constants acceptable
- Embedding in private structs sometimes acceptable for composition

Apply judgment based on context and domain.
