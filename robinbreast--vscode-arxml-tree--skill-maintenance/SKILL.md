description: Maintain and evolve local Agent Skills for this repo. Use after implementing features or changing workflows so skills stay current. Use when this capability is needed.
metadata:
  author: robinbreast

Use this skill whenever new features, workflows, or tooling are added.

Base specification
- The authoritative base specification for skill maintenance is [Agent Skills Specification](https://agentskills.io/specification).
- If local guidance and the specification differ, align the skill with the specification unless the repo has an explicit, documented exception.

Maintenance rules
1. Update an existing skill when behaviors or patterns change within that skill's domain.
2. Add a new skill only if the change introduces a distinct domain not covered by existing skills (for example: a new tool type, file format, or workflow paradigm).
3. Keep [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md) frontmatter valid and matching directory name.
4. Keep skill instructions concise and task-focused.
5. Avoid duplicating [`AGENTS.md`](../../../AGENTS.md); reference it if needed.
6. Follow [`AGENTS.md`](../../../AGENTS.md) for design-first, SOLID/DRY, and minimal-change guidance.
7. Prefer single-source references:
   - [`package.json`](../../../package.json) for commands/settings
   - [`AGENTS.md`](../../../AGENTS.md) for shared conventions
   - [`README.md`](../../../README.md) for user-facing behavior
   - Use skill-local `references/` docs for domain-specific schemas and examples (for example, [`custom-views.md`](../arxml-tree-domain/references/custom-views.md)).
8. Think and design first before editing skill docs: define structure and ownership up front.
9. All source-file and documentation references in markdown docs/skills must use markdown links.
10. Keep skill structure and frontmatter compliant with [Agent Skills Specification](https://agentskills.io/specification) (name/description constraints, optional fields, and directory conventions).
11. Prefer progressive disclosure from the specification: keep [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md) concise and place detailed material in `references/` when needed.
12. Use relative paths for in-skill file links as defined by [File references](https://agentskills.io/specification#file-references).

Consistency checklist
- Skill name: lowercase, hyphenated, 1-64 chars.
- Description: clear when-to-use guidance (1-1024 chars).
- Compatibility: only if environment constraints matter.
- Structure: `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`.

Update triggers
- New build/test commands.
- New components/modules with unique workflows.
- New repo-specific patterns or constraints.

Quality gates
- No outdated paths or commands.
- Instructions align with current codebase conventions.
- Skills avoid heavy refactors and keep steps minimal.
- Skills remain compliant with [Agent Skills Specification](https://agentskills.io/specification).
- Principles are not copy-pasted across multiple skills when they already exist in [`AGENTS.md`](../../../AGENTS.md).
