# LinkedIn Updater

Generate LinkedIn profile update instructions by applying best practices to career data.

## Workflow Overview

```
1. LOAD CAREER DATA
   └─ Read: career-summary.xml (positioning, metrics), career-profile.xml (STAR activities)

2. EXTRACT KEY ELEMENTS
   └─ Identity, headline positioning, key metrics, differentiators, keywords

3. APPLY BEST PRACTICES
   └─ Generate content for each LinkedIn section per formula/structure

4. OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS
   └─ Save to linkedin/profile-update-{YYYY-MM-DD}.md with copy-paste blocks
```

## Input Requirements

**From Project Knowledge (experience/ directory):**
- `experience/career-summary.xml` — Identity, positioning, key metrics, keywords (quick reference)
- `experience/career-profile.xml` — Full career with STAR-formatted activities for Experience bullets
- `experience/interview-positioning.xml` — Elevator pitch, differentiators, talking points

## Step 1: Load and Extract Career Data

Extract from XML files:

| Element | Source | Usage |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Identity | `<identity>` in career-summary.xml | Name, title, contact info |
| Headline | `<positioning><headline>` | Starting point for Headline optimization |
| Key Metrics | `<key-metrics>` | Proof points for About section |
| Differentiators | `<differentiators>` | Unique value props for About |
| Keywords | `<keywords>` | SEO terms for all sections |
| STAR Activities | `<activity>` in career-profile.xml | CAR bullets for Experience |
| Elevator Pitch | `<elevator-pitch>` in interview-positioning.xml | Hook for About section |

## Step 2: Generate Section Content

### Headline (220 characters max)

**Formula:** `[Role] | [Specialization] | [Quantified Value] | [Key Differentiator]`

Apply formula using:
- Role: Current title from `<current-title>`
- Specialization: Primary profile from `<profile-hierarchy>`
- Quantified Value: Top metric from `<key-metrics>`
- Key Differentiator: Strongest from `<differentiators>`

**Include 2-3 searchable AI keywords:** Generative AI, LLMs, AI Strategy, AI Platform

**Generate 3 headline options** for user to choose from.

### About Section (2600 characters max)

**Five-Part Structure:**

1. **Hook (first 3 lines visible before "see more")**
   - Use `<elevator-pitch>` from interview-positioning.xml
   - Make boldest claim or unique insight

2. **Who You Help + Transformation**
   - Target audience and problems you solve
   - Draw from `<positioning>` section

3. **Proof Points (3-5 bullets)**
   - Select from `<key-metrics>`:
     - $1.5B pipeline (Google Value Engineering)
     - 100% program survival rate (6 programs, 3-7+ years)
     - 10-layer AI platform architecture (McDonald's CIO endorsed)
     - 154 GCP Champs participants (7X completion rate)
     - SME for Stratozone → Google Cloud Migration Center

4. **Philosophy/Unique Lens**
   - Permanence Architecture methodology
   - Builder-architect hybrid approach

5. **Call to Action**
   - DM invitation with specific context

**First-person voice.** Use 8th grade English. Avoid jargon and hyperbole.

### Experience Section

**Per Position (3-5 bullets each):**

Convert STAR activities to CAR format:
- **Challenge:** Combine `<situation>` + `<task>` for context
- **Action:** Use `<action>` with power verbs
- **Result:** Use `<result>` with inline metrics

**Bullet Format:**
```
[Action verb] [what was done] to [address challenge], resulting in [quantified result]
```

**Guidelines:**
- Lead with quantified outcomes, not responsibilities
- Use 8th grade English
- Vary action verbs (no verb used more than twice)
- Include keywords naturally

See `references/linkedin-best-practices.md` for power verb lists.

### Skills Section

**Order by keyword tier:**

| Tier | Count | Strategy |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Core** | Top 3 | Most searched skills for target roles |
| **Secondary** | Next 7 | Supporting technical/domain skills |
| **Long-tail** | Remaining | Niche differentiators |

**Extract from `<keywords>` section and `<expertise>` tiers.**

**Recommended Core Skills:**
1. Generative AI
2. Enterprise Architecture
3. AI Strategy

### Featured Section

**Recommend content to add:**
- Case studies demonstrating Permanence Architecture
- Speaking engagements or thought leadership
- Certifications display
- External validation (articles, awards)
