# Resume Generator

Generate tailored, ATS-optimized resumes that survive both algorithmic screening AND the 7-second human scan.

## Critical Context

**The 7-Second Reality**: Recruiters spend 6-7 seconds on initial scan. 80% of viewing time concentrates on: name, current title/company, previous title/company, dates, education. Everything below the fold is largely ignored during yes/no/maybe sorting.

**Dual-Audience Optimization**: Resume must pass ATS keyword matching AND create human excitement. Optimize for both without alienating either.

## Workflow Overview

```
0. KNOCKOUT SCREENING (Mandatory)
   └─ Verify no disqualifying factors before proceeding

1. CONTEXT SELECTION
   └─ User selects: seniority level, function type, company type

2. PARSE JOB DESCRIPTION
   └─ Extract: keywords, requirements, culture signals, seniority indicators

3. RETRIEVE & MATCH
   └─ Load achievements; score against JD; apply context-specific weights

4. ABOVE-THE-FOLD OPTIMIZATION
   └─ Place strongest evidence in high-attention zones (top-third, left-aligned)

5. GENERATE WITH AUTHENTICITY
   └─ Apply frameworks; vary patterns; use precise metrics

6. QUALITY VERIFICATION
   └─ Knockout re-check, authenticity audit, parsing confidence

7. PRODUCE OUTPUT
   └─ Render artifact; save file; provide tailoring summary with LinkedIn alert
```

## Step 0: Knockout Screening (MANDATORY)

Complete before any optimization. A single knockout negates all other work.

### Hard Knockouts (Flag if present)
| Factor | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Missing required degree/certification | Flag gap; recommend addressing in cover letter |
| Below minimum experience threshold | Calculate actual years; if close, emphasize depth |
| Employment gap >6 months | Develop proactive framing (see references/gap-strategies.md) |
| Job hopping (<1yr tenures × 3+) | Prepare context (contracts, acquisitions, reorgs) |
| Title inflation risk | Verify claimed titles match LinkedIn exactly |

### Format Knockouts (Verify clean)
- [ ] Professional email address
- [ ] Phone in standard format
- [ ] LinkedIn URL functional
- [ ] No special characters that may corrupt parsing

**STOP if hard knockout present without mitigation strategy.**

## Step 1: Context Selection

User MUST specify (ask if not provided):

### Seniority Level
| Level | Weight Profile |
|-------|---------------|
| **Entry-level** | Education 40%, Skills 35%, Potential indicators HIGH |
| **Mid-career** | Skills 40%, Experience 25%, Progression 20% |
| **Senior/Executive** | Strategic impact 30%, Leadership 25%, Education MINIMAL |

### Function Type
| Function | Optimization Focus |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Technical** | Boolean skills match, specific tools/versions, penalize fluff |
| **Sales** | Quota attainment %, deal metrics, HIGH skepticism on claims |
| **Operations** | Operational metrics (OEE, yield), certifications, safety |
| **Executive** | P&L, board exposure, transformation narratives |

### Company Type
| Type | Signals to Emphasize |
|------|---------------------|
| **Startup** | Adaptability, breadth, speed, "wore multiple hats" |
| **Enterprise** | Brand recognition, specialization, stability, process |

Load weight profile from `references/context-profiles.md` based on selection.

## Step 2: Parse Job Description

Extract and categorize:

| Category | Extract |
|----------|---------|
| **Hard requirements** | Required skills, certs, years (these are knockout criteria) |
| **Soft requirements** | Preferred qualifications, nice-to-haves |
| **Keywords** | Technical terms, tools, methodologies—exact phrasing |
| **Culture signals** | Values language, team descriptors |
| **Success metrics** | How performance measured (informs achievement selection) |

Create keyword frequency map. Top 10 keywords MUST appear in resume.

## Step 3: Retrieve & Match Achievements

For each JD requirement, scan achievements-bank.md:

**Scoring (apply context weights from Step 1):**
- Direct match (same skill/outcome): 3 points × context weight
- Adjacent match (transferable): 2 points × context weight
- Contextual match (similar domain): 1 point × context weight

**Prioritization:**
1. Ensure ALL hard requirements have evidence
2. Rank by weighted score
3. Flag gaps (requirements without strong matches)

## Step 4: Above-the-Fold Optimization

**The First Screen Rule**: What appears in top-third, left-aligned determines whether deeper engagement occurs.

### Placement Requirements
| Element | Location | Purpose |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Name | Top center | Anchor point |
| Current title | Immediately below name | Pattern-match to role |
| Top 3-5 keywords | Summary section | ATS + human scan |
| Strongest achievement | First bullet of current role | Anchoring effect |
| Second strongest | Second bullet OR summary highlight | Reinforcement |

### Achievement Promotion Rules
If strongest achievements are from older roles:
- Option A: Promote to summary as "Career Highlights"
- Option B: Add "Key Achievement" callout in summary
- Option C: Restructure current role to demonstrate continued excellence

**Verify**: Can recruiter see qualification evidence within 7 seconds?

## Step 5: Generate with Authenticity

### Apply CAR Framework
See `references/achievement-frameworks.md` for full guidance.

```
[Action verb] [specific what] to address [challenge], resulting in [quantified outcome]
```

### Authenticity Requirements

**AVOID these AI-detection patterns:**
- Consecutive buzzwords ("spearheaded... orchestrated... leveraged...")
- Same verb starting 3+ bullets
- All round numbers (50%, 25%, 100%)
- Generic phrases without specificity

**INCLUDE these authenticity markers:**
- At least one non-round metric (47.3%, $892K, 23-27%)
- Named projects, tools, or systems
- Exact team sizes when known
- Varied sentence structures

### Factual Integrity (MANDATORY)

All data from XML source files is treated as immutable fact. Wording may be adjusted for flow and keyword optimization, but the underlying facts must not change.

**Protected Facts (NEVER modify):**

| Element | Rule |
|---------|------|
| Job titles | Use exact title from XML—no "equivalents" |
| Company names | Exact spelling from XML |
| Dates | Exact MM/YYYY from XML |
| Metrics/results | Numbers must match XML exactly |
| Team sizes | Exact counts from XML |
| Project/product names | Verbatim from XML |
| Scope descriptors | "enterprise-wide", "global" etc. only if in XML |

**Allowed Modifications:**

- Verb substitution (same meaning, different word)
- Sentence structure variation
- Condensing (omit details, but don't change remaining facts)
- Keyword insertion (add context, don't alter facts)

**Prohibited:**

- Inflating metrics (47% → 50%)
- Expanding scope ("team" → "cross-functional organization")
- Adding responsibilities not in XML
- Creating achievements not documented
- Rounding for readability (keep $892K, don't write $900K)

**Excluded from Resume (interview prep only):**

- `<departure-context>` elements — NEVER include departure reasons on resume
- `<vulnerability>` elements — for interview preparation only
- `<reframe>` elements — for interview preparation only
- Any explanation of why a role ended

### Precision Metrics Rules
| Type | Format | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| Percentages | One decimal when accurate | 47.3% improvement |
| Currency <$1M | Exact | $892K savings |
| Currency >$1M | Nearest $0.1M | $2.4M revenue |
| Ranges | When genuinely uncertain | 15-22% across regions |

**Rule**: Only use precise metrics you can defend in interview.

## Step 6: Quality Verification

### Knockout Re-Check
- [ ] Zero typos (spell-check + read aloud)
- [ ] Zero grammatical errors
- [ ] Consistent date formatting (MM/YYYY)
- [ ] All claims verifiable if asked
- [ ] No orphan bullets

### Authenticity Audit
- [ ] Power verbs vary (no verb used >2 times)
- [ ] At least one non-round metric present
- [ ] At least one named project/tool/system
- [ ] No 3+ consecutive bullets with identical structure

### Above-the-Fold Check
- [ ] Current title visible in first screen
- [ ] Top 3 keywords visible in first screen
- [ ] Strongest achievement visible in first screen

### Parsing Confidence
- [ ] Single-column layout
- [ ] Standard section headers
- [ ] No tables, graphics, or text boxes
- [ ] Dates in parseable format

### Source Validation (MANDATORY)

Before generating final output, validate ALL facts against XML source files:

**Validation Checklist:**

- [ ] Each job title matches `<title>` element exactly
- [ ] Each company name matches `<company>` element exactly
- [ ] Each date range matches `<start>` and `<end>` elements exactly
- [ ] Each metric matches value in `<result>` element exactly
- [ ] Each team size matches count in source activity
- [ ] Each project/product name matches `<activity>` or `<initiative>` elements

**Validation Process:**

1. For each Experience entry, identify source `<position>` by matching company + date range
2. For each bullet, identify source `<activity>` by ID or content match
3. Verify all numerical claims trace to XML `<result>` elements
4. Flag any claim without XML source attribution

**If validation fails:** Do NOT generate output. List discrepancies and request correction.

## Step 7: Produce Output

### File Output
Save as `resume-[company]-[role].md` in `/mnt/user-data/outputs/`

### Markdown Structure
```markdown
# [Full Name]
[Email] | [Phone] | [Location] | [LinkedIn URL]

---

## Professional Summary
[3-5 lines: specific identity + top achievements + value proposition for THIS role]
[Include top 5 JD keywords naturally]

---

## Professional Experience

**[Job Title]** | [Company Name] | [Location]
*[MM/YYYY] – [MM/YYYY or Present]*

- [Strongest achievement—quantified, specific]
- [Second achievement—different verb, different structure]
- [Third achievement—demonstrates another JD requirement]

[Repeat for relevant roles]

---

## Skills
**[Category aligned to JD]:** [Skill 1], [Skill 2], [Skill 3]
**[Second category]:** [Skill 1], [Skill 2], [Skill 3]

---

## Education
**[Degree]** | [Institution] | [Year]
[Certifications if relevant to role]
```

### Tailoring Summary (in conversation, not resume)

Provide:
1. **Keywords incorporated**: List with placement locations
2. **Requirements matched**: Each requirement → supporting achievement
3. **Coverage gaps**: Requirements without strong evidence
4. **Authenticity score**: Count of specificity markers
5. **LinkedIn consistency alert**: Flag any resume/LinkedIn divergence risk
6. **Source attribution**: For each bullet, note the XML activity ID it derives from

```
⚠️ LinkedIn Consistency Check:
Ensure your LinkedIn reflects [specific elements] before applying.
Recruiters cross-check—discrepancies trigger investigation.
```

### Excitement Assessment
Rate candidate's "excitement potential" for this role:
- **High**: Multiple quantified wins visible in 7-second scan, unexpected specificity
- **Medium**: Meets requirements, lacks standout evidence
- **Low**: Gaps in hard requirements, may land in "maybe pile"

If LOW, explicitly flag: "Candidacy may be weak regardless of optimization. Consider: [specific strengthening recommendations]"
