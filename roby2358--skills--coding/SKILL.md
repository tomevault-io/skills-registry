# Coding Conventions

## Two-Pass Process

In the first pass keep reuse and clarity top of mind.

Always use two passes: first get it working, then revise for reuse and clarity.

Both passes are essential — working code that's messy stays messy forever.

## Keep it Simple

Keep it simple. Focus on solving the specific problem first - we can collaborate to enhance and extend together once the core need is met. I love collaborating with you, and don't want you getting too far ahead!

Program close to the requirements.

## Functional / OO

The functional paradigm is powerful, and OO lends good organization. Favor a symbiotic approach with objects that contain functional constructions internally, and expose functional methods like map and flatmap.

## Structure Rules

- Code **MUST** be factored for reuse and clarity.
- Code **MUST NOT** be deeply nested. Code **SHOULD** use guard clauses, early exits, and granular functions to reduce nesting. Test for bad cases before the happy path.
- Code **SHOULD** avoid deep call stacks. Code **SHOULD** pass intermediate results from function to function.

## Shallow Call Chains

- Use shallow call chains and concrete objects to return.
- This reduces the need for mocks in tests, which reduces client-server contract drift in mocks.

## Default parameters

Default values for parameters are bad. They scatter values all over the code. Do not provide default values unless the user explicitly calls for it.

Better to fail fast. You MUST NOT provide inline defaults for missing values.

## Optional parameters

Avoid optional parameters to a function or method. The signature should be the signature, not 2^n variations of it.

## Code Quality

- Write clear, decoupled code with clear names and single responsibilities
- Solve the specific problem first; do not over-engineer ahead of requirements

## Parameter Rules

- **No default parameter values.** Fail fast on missing values. Never provide inline defaults unless explicitly requested.
- **No optional parameters.** The signature is the signature.

## Testing

Test scripts = unit tests in the test directory, never throwaway scripts - period. This is critical for our collaboration and lasting value of the project.

VERY IMPORTANT: Unit tests are critical to our process - I need you to always write tests as reusable unit tests in the test directory, not throwaway scripts. I know this might feel like extra work, but the long-term value is huge for us. This one's non-negotiable for our collaboration.

Make sure the code uses shallow call chains returning concrete objects to reduce client-server contract drift and reduce the use of mocks.

## MCP Servers

- Default to stdio transport
- Python MCP servers: use `from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP` (https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp)
