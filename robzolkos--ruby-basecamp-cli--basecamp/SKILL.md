# Basecamp CLI

Interact with Basecamp projects and card tables using the `basecamp` command.

## Prerequisites

The CLI must be installed and authenticated:

```bash
basecamp version  # Verify installation
basecamp projects  # Verify authentication
```

If not authenticated, the user needs to run `basecamp auth`.

## Commands

```bash
basecamp projects
```

Output:
```
Projects
============================================================
[*] 12345678  Website Redesign
    Project description here
[*] 23456789  Mobile App

[*] = active
```

### List boards in a project

```bash
basecamp boards <project_id>
```

Output:
```
Card Tables in: Website Redesign
============================================================

  - Done (45 cards)
```

### List cards

```bash
basecamp cards <project_id> <board_id>
basecamp cards <project_id> <board_id> --column "In Progress"
```

Started on the color palette.

John Doe (2025-01-17T09:15:00.000Z):
Looks great!
```

### Move a card

```bash
basecamp move <project_id> <board_id> <card_id> --to "Done"
```

Output:
```
Card 44444444 moved to 'Done'
```

## Workflow example

To check what's being worked on and move a completed card:

```bash
# Find the project
basecamp projects

# Find the board
basecamp boards 12345678

# See cards in progress
basecamp cards 12345678 87654321 --column "Progress"

# View details of a specific card
basecamp card 12345678 44444444 --comments

# Move it to Done
basecamp move 12345678 87654321 44444444 --to "Done"
```

## Error handling

If you see "Not authenticated", the user needs to run:
```bash
basecamp auth
```

If you see "Token expired", same fix applies.
