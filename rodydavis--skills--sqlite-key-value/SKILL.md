# Using SQLite as a Key Value Store


[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) is a very capable edge database that can store various shapes of data.

Key/Value databases are popular in applications for storing settings, and other non-relational data.

By using SQLite to store the key/values you can contain all the data for a user in a single file and can [attach it to other databases](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_attach.html) or sync it to a server.

## Create the table

To store key/value type data we need to first create our table.

```
CREATE TABLE key_value (
  key TEXT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  value,
  UNIQUE(key)
);
```

key

value

user\_id

1

foo

bar

active

1

guest

0

SQLite has [optional column types](https://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html) and can be very useful for dynamic values.

## Save a value

To save a value for a given key we can run the following:

```
INSERT OR REPLACE 
INTO key_value (key, value) 
VALUES (:key, :value)
RETURNING *;
```

key

value

user\_id

1

Since the key is [UNIQUE](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-unique-constraint/) we do not have to worry about conflicts as it will overwrite the value as intended.

## Read a value

To read a value we can pass in a key to our query:

```
SELECT value FROM key_value 
WHERE key = :key;
```

value

1

This will only return a single value column with a max of 1 rows.

## Delete a value

To delete a value or key we can run the following:

```
DELETE FROM key_value 
WHERE key = :key;
```

## Search for key or value

We can also search for a specific key or value (if it is a string) with the following:

```
SELECT key, value
FROM key_value 
WHERE key LIKE :query 
OR value LIKE :query;
```

key

value

bar

1

foo

bar

## Drift Support

If you are using [Drift](https://drift.simonbinder.eu/) in dart, create a new file `key_value.drift` and add the following:

```
CREATE TABLE key_value (
  "key" TEXT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  value TEXT,
  UNIQUE("key")
);

setItem:
INSERT OR REPLACE 
INTO key_value ("key", value) 
VALUES (:key, :value)
RETURNING *;

getItem:
SELECT value FROM key_value 
WHERE "key" = :key;

deleteItem:
DELETE FROM key_value 
WHERE "key" = :key;

searchItem:
SELECT "key", value
FROM key_value 
WHERE "key" LIKE :query 
OR value LIKE :query;
```
