# HammerEngine Performance Regression Detection

This Skill is **critical** for SDL3 HammerEngine's performance requirements. The engine must maintain 10,000+ entity support at 60+ FPS with minimal CPU usage. This Skill detects performance regressions before they reach production.

## Cross-Platform Considerations

**IMPORTANT:** Absolute performance numbers vary significantly across platforms (CPU, memory, OS).
Regression detection should always compare against **platform-specific baselines**, not hard-coded
absolute values. Example outputs in this document show representative values from one platform.

**Baseline Strategy:**
- Each platform maintains its own baseline in `test_results/baseline/`
- Compare percentage change from baseline, not absolute numbers
- Thresholds (>15% = CRITICAL, etc.) apply universally across platforms

## Performance Requirements (from CLAUDE.md)

- **AI System:** 10,000+ entities at 60+ FPS with <6% CPU
- **Collision System:** Spatial hash with efficient AABB detection
- **Pathfinding:** A* pathfinding with dynamic weights
- **Event System:** 1K-10K event throughput
- **Particle System:** Camera-aware batched rendering

## Workflow Overview

**⚠️ CRITICAL: AI Scaling Benchmark is MANDATORY**
The AI System is the most performance-critical component. Always run `./tests/test_scripts/run_ai_benchmark.sh` as part of the regression check. DO NOT proceed to report generation without AI benchmark results.

1. **Identify or Create Baseline** - Store previous metrics
2. **Run Benchmark Suite** - Execute ALL 10 performance tests (including AI)
3. **Extract Metrics** - Parse results from test outputs
4. **Compare vs Baseline** - Calculate percentage changes
5. **Flag Regressions** - Alert on performance degradation
6. **Generate Report** - Detailed analysis with recommendations

### Total Benchmark Duration: ~25 minutes

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Identify Baseline

**Baseline Storage Location:**
```
$PROJECT_ROOT/test_results/baseline/
├── thread_safe_ai_baseline.txt         (AI system baseline)
├── collision_benchmark_baseline.txt
├── pathfinder_benchmark_baseline.txt
├── event_benchmark_baseline.txt
├── particle_manager_baseline.txt
├── buffer_utilization_baseline.txt
├── resource_tests_baseline.txt
├── serialization_baseline.txt
└── baseline_metadata.txt
```

**Baseline Creation Logic:**
```bash
# Check if baseline exists (requires PROJECT_ROOT to be set)
if [ ! -d "$PROJECT_ROOT/test_results/baseline/" ]; then
    echo "No baseline found. Creating baseline from current run..."
    mkdir -p "$PROJECT_ROOT/test_results/baseline/"
    CREATING_BASELINE=true
fi
```

**When to Create New Baseline:**
- No baseline exists (first run)
- User explicitly requests baseline refresh
- Major optimization work completed (intentional performance change)
- After validating improvements (new baseline for future comparisons)

### Step 2: Run Benchmark Suite

**CRITICAL: ALL 10 benchmarks must be run. DO NOT skip the AI benchmark.**

**⚠️ SEQUENTIAL EXECUTION ONLY:** Benchmarks MUST be run one at a time, waiting for each to complete before starting the next. NEVER run benchmarks in parallel (background tasks, concurrent shells, etc.) — parallel execution causes CPU/memory contention that skews timing results and produces unreliable metrics. Use `run_in_background: false` (foreground) for every benchmark invocation.

**Run individually and sequentially (REQUIRED):**
```bash
# IMPORTANT: Set PROJECT_ROOT and run from project directory
# Example: cd /path/to/SDL3_HammerEngine_Template && export PROJECT_ROOT=$(pwd)

# 1. AI Scaling Benchmark (REQUIRED - 3 minutes)
./tests/test_scripts/run_ai_benchmark.sh

# 2. Collision Scaling Benchmark (REQUIRED - 2 minutes)
./tests/test_scripts/run_collision_scaling_benchmark.sh

# 3. Pathfinder Benchmark (REQUIRED - 5 minutes)
./tests/test_scripts/run_pathfinder_benchmark.sh

# 4. Event Manager Scaling (REQUIRED - 2 minutes)
./tests/test_scripts/run_event_scaling_benchmark.sh

# 5. Particle Manager Benchmark (REQUIRED - 2 minutes)
./tests/test_scripts/run_particle_manager_benchmark.sh

# 6. GPU Frame Timing Benchmark (REQUIRED - 1 minute)
./tests/test_scripts/run_gpu_frame_benchmark.sh

# 7. SIMD Performance Benchmark (REQUIRED - 1 minute)
./tests/test_scripts/run_simd_benchmark.sh

# 8. Integrated System Benchmark (REQUIRED - 3 minutes)
./tests/test_scripts/run_integrated_benchmark.sh

# 9. Background Simulation Benchmark (REQUIRED - 2 minutes)
./tests/test_scripts/run_background_simulation_manager_benchmark.sh

# 10. Adaptive Threading Analysis (REQUIRED - 4 minutes)
./tests/test_scripts/run_adaptive_threading_analysis.sh
```

**Timeout Protection:**
Each benchmark has timeout protection:
- AI Scaling: 600 seconds (10 minutes)
- Others: 300 seconds (5 minutes)

If timeout occurs, flag as potential infinite loop or performance catastrophe.

**Progress Tracking:**
```
Running benchmarks (this will take ~25 minutes)...
[1/10] AI Scaling Benchmark... ✓ (3m 00s) - CRITICAL
[2/10] Collision Scaling Benchmark... ✓ (2m 05s)
[3/10] Pathfinder Benchmark... ✓ (5m 05s)
[4/10] Event Manager Scaling... ✓ (2m 10s)
[5/10] Particle Manager Benchmark... ✓ (2m 05s)
[6/10] GPU Frame Timing Benchmark... ✓ (1m 02s)
[7/10] SIMD Performance Benchmark... ✓ (1m 00s)
[8/10] Integrated System Benchmark... ✓ (3m 15s)
[9/10] Background Simulation Benchmark... ✓ (2m 00s)
[10/10] Adaptive Threading Analysis... ✓ (4m 00s)
Total: 25m 42s
```

**Execution Order:**
Run benchmarks **sequentially** in the order listed above, one at a time. AI benchmark should always be run first as it's the most critical system and longest-running test. Wait for each benchmark to fully complete before launching the next — this ensures no resource contention between benchmarks.

### Step 3: Extract Metrics

**Metrics Extraction Patterns:**

#### AI System Metrics

**Extract scaling performance:**
```bash
# Parse tabular output from AIEntityScaling test
grep -A 20 "AI Entity Scaling" test_results/ai_scaling_benchmark_*.txt | \
  grep -E "^\s+[0-9]+\s+[0-9.]+"

# Extract summary metrics (primary regression detection)
grep -E "Entity updates per second:|Threading mode:|Threading threshold" \
  test_results/ai_scaling_benchmark_*.txt

# Or use the current run file
cat test_results/ai_scaling_current.txt | grep -A 5 "SCALABILITY SUMMARY"
```

**Example Output (EDM Architecture - values are platform-specific):**
```
--- AI Entity Scaling ---
  Entities   Time (ms)   Updates/sec   Threading     Status
       100        0.02       4998406      single        OK
       500        0.10       7740798      single        OK
      1000        0.18      11275361      single        OK
      2000        0.43      13993477      single        OK
      5000        0.30     100413620       multi        OK
     10000        0.30     201148289       multi        OK

SCALABILITY SUMMARY:
Entity updates per second: 201148289 (at 10000 entities)
Threading mode: WorkerBudget Multi-threaded
```

**Note:** The EDM architecture (pure data-driven behaviors) achieves ~200M+ updates/sec due to:
- No behavior class instances or virtual dispatch
- Contiguous EDM arrays with excellent cache locality
- Free-function dispatch via `Behaviors::execute(ctx, config)`

**Baseline Key Format:** `Entity_<count>_UpdatesPerSec`

**Key Metrics:**
- **Updates/sec:** Primary performance metric (higher is better)
- **Threading threshold:** Adaptive via WorkerBudget (typically 2000-5000 entities for multi-threading benefit)
- **Scaling efficiency:** Updates/sec should increase sub-linearly with entity count

#### Collision Scaling Metrics
```bash
# Extract metrics from collision scaling benchmark
grep -E "Movables|Statics|Time \(ms\)|Throughput|Scenario" test_results/collision_scaling_current.txt
```

**Example Output:**
```
--- MM Scaling (SAP) ---
  Movables   Time (ms)    MM Pairs    Throughput
       100        0.02           5        5151/ms
       500        0.14          31        3559/ms
      1000        0.22          59        4596/ms
      2000        0.41          97        4893/ms
      5000        1.11         282        4509/ms
     10000        2.26         527        4434/ms

--- MS Scaling (Spatial Hash) ---
   Statics    Movables   Time (ms)    MS Pairs          Mode
       100         200        0.15         155          hash
       500         200        0.14          93          hash
      2000         200        0.15          83          hash
      5000         200        0.15          79          hash
     10000         200        0.15          70          hash
     20000         200        0.15          72          hash

--- Combined Scaling ---
       Scenario   Time (ms)        MM        MS      Total
    Small (500)        0.11        14        15          29
  Medium (1500)        0.19        35        36          71
   Large (3000)        0.34        64        65         129
      XL (6000)        0.65       164       164         328
    XXL (12000)        1.31       305       305         610
```

**Key Metrics:**
- MM SAP: O(n log n) - time grows sub-quadratically with movable count
- MS Hash: O(n) - time stays FLAT as static count increases (spatial hash effectiveness)
- Combined: Sub-quadratic scaling verified up to 12K entities

#### Trigger Detection Metrics
```bash
# Extract trigger detection scaling from collision benchmark
grep -E "Detectors|Triggers|Overlaps|Method" test_results/collision_scaling_current.txt | \
  grep -v "^--"
```

**Example Output:**
```
--- Trigger Detection Scaling ---
   Detectors    Triggers   Time (ms)    Overlaps        Method
           1         100       0.143           0        spatial
           1         400       0.138           0        spatial
          10         200       0.145           1        spatial
          25         200       0.148           4        spatial
          50         200       0.228           3          sweep
         100         200       0.255           9          sweep
         200         400       0.433          44          sweep
```

**Key Metrics:**
- **Detectors:** Entities with NEEDS_TRIGGER_DETECTION flag (Player + enabled NPCs)
- **Triggers:** EventOnly triggers in the world (water, area markers, etc.)
- **Method:** Spatial query (<50 entities) or sweep-and-prune (>=50 entities)
- **Performance Target:** <0.5ms for typical scenarios (1-50 detectors, 100-400 triggers)

**Adaptive Strategy Thresholds:**
- < 50 entities: Spatial queries O(N × ~k nearby triggers)
- ≥ 50 entities: Sweep-and-prune O((N+T) log (N+T))

#### Pathfinder Metrics **[ASYNC THROUGHPUT ONLY]**

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** PathfinderManager uses **async-only pathfinding** in production. Immediate (synchronous) pathfinding is deprecated and should NOT be tracked in regression analysis.

**Production Metrics Extraction:**
```bash
# Extract async pathfinding throughput - PRIMARY METRIC
grep -E "Async.*Throughput|paths/sec" test_results/pathfinder_benchmark_results.txt | \
  grep -E "Throughput:"

# Example output format:
#   Throughput: 3e+02 paths/sec
#   Throughput: 4e+02 paths/sec
#   Throughput: 4e+02 paths/sec
```

**REQUIRED Metrics to Extract:**
1. **Async throughput** (paths/second) - Production metric
2. **Success rate** (must be 100%)
3. **Batch processing performance** (if high-volume scenarios tested)

**DEPRECATED Metrics (DO NOT TRACK):**
- ❌ Immediate pathfinding timing (deprecated, not used in production)
- ❌ Path calculation time by distance (legacy synchronous metric)
- ❌ Per-path latency measurements (not relevant for async architecture)

**Baseline Comparison Keys:**
- `Pathfinding_Async_Throughput_PathsPerSec`
- `Pathfinding_Batch_Processing_Enabled`
- `Pathfinding_SuccessRate`

**Example Baseline Comparison:**
```
| Metric | Baseline | Current | Change | Status |
|--------|----------|---------|--------|--------|
| Async Throughput | 300-400 paths/sec | 300-400 paths/sec | 0% | ⚪ Stable |
| Batch Processing | 50K paths/sec | 100K paths/sec | +100% | 🟢 Major Improvement |
| Success Rate | 100% | 100% | 0% | ✓ Maintained |
```

**What to Report:**
- Always include a dedicated "Pathfinding System" section in regression reports
- Focus on async throughput as primary metric
- Highlight batch processing performance for high-volume scenarios
- Note success rate (failures are critical regressions)
- Exclude deprecated immediate pathfinding metrics from analysis

#### Event Manager Metrics
```bash
# Extract key throughput metrics from deferred event benchmark
grep -E "Events/sec:|Total time:|Time per event:" test_results/event_scaling_benchmark_output.txt

# Extract threading threshold detection
grep -A 10 "THREADING THRESHOLD DETECTION" test_results/event_scaling_benchmark_output.txt

# Extract concurrency benchmark
grep -A 5 "CONCURRENCY BENCHMARK" test_results/event_scaling_benchmark_output.txt

# Extract batch vs single enqueue comparison
grep -A 5 "BATCH ENQUEUE vs SINGLE" test_results/event_scaling_benchmark_output.txt
```

**Example Output:**
```
===== BASIC HANDLER PERFORMANCE TEST =====
  Config: 3 types, 1 handlers per type, 10 deferred events
  Events/sec: 163436
  Time per event: 0.0061 ms

===== CONCURRENCY BENCHMARK =====
  Config: 23 threads, 173 events/thread = 3979 total deferred events
  Total time: 8.18 ms
  Events/sec: 486696

===== BATCH ENQUEUE vs SINGLE ENQUEUE BENCHMARK =====
  Single + alloc:     583,736 events/sec
  Single (no alloc): 1,805,799 events/sec
  Batch (no alloc):  7,857,195 events/sec
```

**Key Metrics:**
- **Events/sec per config:** Throughput at different handler/event counts
- **Concurrency throughput:** Multi-threaded event processing (23 threads)
- **Batch vs Single:** Enqueue method comparison (batch should be 5-10x faster)
- **Threading threshold:** WorkerBudget mode selection for event processing
- **Time per event:** Dispatch latency (should be <0.01ms)

#### Particle Manager Metrics
```bash
grep -E "Particles/frame:|Render Time:|Batch Count:" test_results/particle_benchmark/performance_metrics.txt
```

**Example Output:**
```
Particles/frame: 5000
Render Time: 3.2ms
Batch Count: 12
Culling Efficiency: 88%
```

#### GPU Frame Timing Metrics
```bash
grep -E "Avg frame time:|Avg swapchain:|Avg GPU upload:|Avg GPU submit:" test_results/gpu/gpu_frame_timing_benchmark_debug.txt
```

**Example Output:**
```
  Avg frame time:   8.343 ms
  Avg swapchain:    8.039 ms
  Avg GPU upload:   0.001 ms
  Avg GPU submit:   0.045 ms
```

**Key Metrics:**
- **Frame time:** Total CPU+GPU frame time (lower is better)
- **Swapchain:** VSync/present wait time (display-dependent)
- **GPU upload:** Vertex data upload overhead (should be <0.1ms)
- **GPU submit:** Draw call submission overhead (should be <0.5ms)

# Extract speedup factors
grep -E "Speedup:|SIMD Time:|Scalar Time:|Status:" test_results/simd_benchmark_current.txt

# Platform detection
grep -E "Detected SIMD:|Platform:" test_results/simd_benchmark_current.txt
```

**Example Output:**

```

**Key Metrics:**
- **Speedup factor:** Must be ≥1.0x (SIMD faster than scalar)
- **Platform:** SSE2/AVX2/NEON (should not be "Scalar (no SIMD)")
- **Status:** PASS/FAIL per operation

```

**Note:** With EDM architecture, background simulation is so fast (~50K items/ms) that threading
overhead exceeds the benefit. Single-threaded processing handles 10K entities in ~0.2ms.

**Key Metrics:**
- **Update time:** Should scale sub-linearly with entity count
- **Threading mode:** Adaptive via WorkerBudget (may stay single-threaded if fast enough)
- **Batches:** WorkerBudget batch sizing effectiveness
- **Throughput:** Single throughput ~50K+ items/ms expected with EDM architecture

#### Adaptive Threading Analysis Metrics

**Note:** This benchmark validates WorkerBudgetManager adaptive logic using Collision system only.

=== VALIDATION ===
  Scale UP (50->2000): PASS - switched to MULTI
  Below MIN_WORKLOAD (99): PASS - forced SINGLE
  At MIN_WORKLOAD (100): SINGLE (throughput comparison)
  Bidirectional adaptive: PASS

===== WORKERBUDGET VALIDATION SUMMARY =====
Collision System:
  Single TP:      660 items/ms
  Multi TP:       2301 items/ms
  Batch Mult:     1.00
  Preferred Mode: MULTI
  Multi Speedup:  3.49x
```

**Key Metrics:**
- **Throughput learning:** WBM learns non-zero throughput for single and multi modes
- **Mode selection:** WBM chooses correct mode based on learned throughput (>15% improvement to switch)
- **Batch multiplier:** Should stabilize within range [0.4, 2.0]
- **Natural crossover:** Entity count where MULTI→SINGLE based on throughput (if found above MIN_WORKLOAD)
- **MIN_WORKLOAD boundary:** Entities below 100 forced to SINGLE regardless of throughput
- **Bidirectional switching:** Mode correctly switches when scaling up AND down

### Step 4: Compare Against Baseline

**Comparison Algorithm:**

For each metric:
1. Read baseline value
2. Read current value
3. Calculate percentage change: `((current - baseline) / baseline) * 100`
4. Determine status:
   - **Regression:** Slower/worse performance
   - **Improvement:** Faster/better performance
   - **Stable:** Within noise threshold (±5%)

**Example Comparison:**

| System | Metric | Baseline | Current | Change | Status |
|--------|--------|----------|---------|--------|--------|
| AI | FPS | 62.3 | 56.8 | -8.8% | 🔴 Regression |
| AI | CPU% | 5.8% | 6.4% | +10.3% | 🔴 Regression |
| Collision | Checks/sec | 125000 | 134000 | +7.2% | 🟢 Improvement |
| Pathfinder | Calc Time | 8.5ms | 8.7ms | +2.4% | ⚪ Stable |

### Step 5: Flag Regressions

**Regression Severity Levels:**

#### 🔴 CRITICAL (Block Merge)
- AI System FPS drops below 60
- AI System CPU usage exceeds 8%
- Any performance metric degrades >15%
- Benchmark timeouts (infinite loops)

#### 🟠 WARNING (Review Required)
- Performance degradation 10-15%
- AI System FPS 60-65 (near threshold)
- Collision/Pathfinding >10% slower

#### 🟡 MINOR (Monitor)
- Performance degradation 5-10%
- Within acceptable variance but trending down

#### ⚪ STABLE (Acceptable)
- Performance change <5% (measurement noise)

#### 🟢 IMPROVEMENT
- Performance improvement >5%
- Successful optimization

**Regression Detection Logic:**

```python
def classify_change(metric_name, baseline, current, is_lower_better=False):
    change_pct = ((current - baseline) / baseline) * 100

    # Invert for metrics where lower is better (e.g., CPU%, time)
    if is_lower_better:
        change_pct = -change_pct

    # Critical thresholds for AI system (most important)
    if "AI" in metric_name or "FPS" in metric_name:
        if metric_name == "FPS" and current < 60:
            return "CRITICAL", "FPS below 60 threshold"
        if metric_name == "CPU" and current > 8:
            return "CRITICAL", "CPU exceeds 8% threshold"

    # General thresholds
    if change_pct < -15:
        return "CRITICAL", f"{abs(change_pct):.1f}% regression"
    elif change_pct < -10:
        return "WARNING", f"{abs(change_pct):.1f}% regression"
    elif change_pct < -5:
        return "MINOR", f"{abs(change_pct):.1f}% regression"
    elif change_pct > 5:
        return "IMPROVEMENT", f"{change_pct:.1f}% improvement"
    else:
        return "STABLE", f"{abs(change_pct):.1f}% variance (acceptable)"
```

**AI Benchmark Regression Detection Strategy:**

1. **Scaling Regression (Low Entity Counts):**
   - 100-500 entity performance regresses more than larger counts
   - **Root Cause:** Single-threaded path overhead, behavior initialization
   - **Action:** Profile single-threaded update path, check behavior creation costs
   - **Impact:** Small-world performance degraded

2. **Scaling Regression (High Entity Counts):**
   - 5000-10000 entity performance regresses
   - **Root Cause:** Threading overhead, batch processing, WorkerBudget tuning
   - **Action:** Profile ThreadSystem, check batch sizes, validate WorkerBudget
   - **Impact:** Large-world performance degraded

3. **Threading Speedup Degraded:**
   - Single-threaded time stable but multi-threaded time increases
   - **Root Cause:** Thread contention, lock overhead, false sharing
   - **Action:** Profile thread synchronization, check mutex usage
   - **Impact:** Threading efficiency degraded

4. **Uniform Regression:**
   - All entity counts regress proportionally
   - **Root Cause:** Core update loop changes, behavior execution overhead
   - **Action:** Profile behavior update(), check per-entity costs
   - **Impact:** System-wide performance degradation

**SIMD Benchmark Regression Detection:**

*Note: SIMD benchmarks should be run in Release mode for accurate results. Debug mode lacks
-O3 optimization, causing SIMD intrinsic overhead to exceed benefit (expected behavior).*

**Release Mode:**
- 🔴 CRITICAL: SIMD slower than scalar (speedup < 1.0x) for AI Distance or Particle Physics
- 🔴 CRITICAL: Platform shows "Scalar (no SIMD)" - SIMD not compiling correctly
- 🟠 WARNING: Speedup <2.0x for AI Distance (expect 3-4x)
- ⚪ STABLE: Speedup within ±20% of baseline

**Debug Mode:**
- ⚪ EXPECTED: SIMD may be slower than scalar (no optimization)
- 🔴 CRITICAL: Platform shows "Scalar (no SIMD)" - SIMD not compiling correctly

**Integrated System Regression Detection:**

*Note: Targets below are for Release builds. Debug builds have significant overhead;
expect ~5K max sustainable entities @ 60 FPS in Debug mode.*

**Release Mode:**
- 🔴 CRITICAL: Average frame time >16.67ms (below 60 FPS) at 10K entities
- 🔴 CRITICAL: Frame drop % >10% at standard load
- 🟠 WARNING: P95 >20ms or coordination overhead >2ms
- 🟠 WARNING: Max sustainable entities decreased >20%
- 🟡 MINOR: Sustained performance degradation >5% over 50s
- ⚪ STABLE: All metrics within targets

**Debug Mode:**
- ⚪ EXPECTED: ~5K max sustainable entities @ 60 FPS
- 🔴 CRITICAL: Coordination overhead >2ms (should still be low)
- 🟠 WARNING: Max sustainable entities <3K @ 60 FPS

**Background Simulation Regression Detection:**
- 🔴 CRITICAL: Update time regression >50% from baseline
- 🔴 CRITICAL: Adaptive tuning failing (batch sizing not converging)
- 🟠 WARNING: Throughput regression >25% from baseline
- 🟡 MINOR: Sub-linear scaling not maintained
- ⚪ STABLE: Performance within ±15% of baseline

**Note:** With EDM architecture, background simulation is extremely fast. Threading may not be
beneficial as single-threaded processing is often faster than threading overhead. WBM adapts correctly.

**Adaptive Threading Analysis Regression Detection:**

*Note: With EDM architecture, single-threaded processing is extremely fast. WBM correctly
staying in SINGLE mode even at high entity counts is expected behavior when threading
overhead exceeds benefit. The key is that WBM learns and adapts correctly.*

- 🔴 CRITICAL: WBM not learning throughput (stays at 0.0 items/ms after 1000 frames)
- 🔴 CRITICAL: MIN_WORKLOAD boundary not enforced (MULTI returned for <100 entities)
- 🔴 CRITICAL: Mode switching broken (stays MULTI at 50 entities - should force SINGLE below MIN_WORKLOAD)
- 🟠 WARNING: Batch multiplier outside valid range [0.4, 2.0]
- 🟡 MINOR: Batch multiplier not stabilizing (>10% change in last 500 frames)
- ⚪ STABLE: WBM learns throughput, respects MIN_WORKLOAD, adapts mode based on measured performance
- ⚪ EXPECTED: SINGLE mode dominating in isolated benchmarks (EDM overhead too low for threading benefit)
