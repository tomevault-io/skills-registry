    script1.cjs
    script2.ps1
  templates/         # Template files (optional)
    template1.md
```

## Creating a New Skill

### 1. Plan the Skill

Before creating, answer:

- What problem does this skill solve?
- When should Claude use this skill?
- What knowledge or instructions are needed?
- Are helper scripts beneficial?

### 2. Create the Directory

```bash
mkdir -p .claude/skills/my-skill/scripts
```

### 3. Write SKILL.md

Start with the template:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: [What this skill does]. This skill should be used when [trigger conditions].
---

# [Skill Name]

### 4. Add Helper Scripts (Optional)

For automation, add scripts in the `scripts/` directory:

```javascript
// scripts/helper.cjs
const fs = require("fs");
// Script logic
```

### 5. Test the Skill

1. Verify SKILL.md syntax is valid
2. Test trigger conditions in Claude Code
3. Verify instructions are clear and complete

## Best Practices

- Include example commands
- Provide error handling guidance

### Skill Scope

- Focus on one domain or workflow
- Keep skills modular and reusable
- Avoid overlap with other skills

### Maintenance

- Update skills when workflows change
- Version control skill files
- Document skill dependencies

## Examples of Good Skills

### Release Skill

- Automates npm package releases
- Provides version sync workflow
- Includes troubleshooting guide

### Testing Skill

- Guides test writing
- Provides test patterns

```
/skills
```
