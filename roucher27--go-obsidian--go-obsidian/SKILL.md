# Go Obsidian Skill

Deep reading assistant that converts web pages/documents into structured Obsidian notes and visual Canvas.


## Core Capabilities

1. **Content Fetching** - Fetch blogs/tweets/papers/technical docs
2. **Deep Summarization** - Generate faithful Markdown notes
3. **Visual Overview** - Generate knowledge structure Canvas
4. **Habit Learning** - Dynamically learn and follow user's note style, preferences, and comprehension level
5. **Reading Tracker** - Auto-create reading notes Bases database for indexing and progress tracking

## Tools Used

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| WebFetch | Fetch web content |
| Read | Read local PDF/papers, learn user vault habits |
| Glob | Scan user vault .md/.canvas files |
| Write | Create .md and .canvas files |
| Edit | Update user-habits.md |

## Core Workflow

### Vault Detection Logic

```
Before creating files:
1. Glob scan current and parent directories for:
   - *.md files (high density = likely vault)
   - *.canvas files (unique to Obsidian)
   - .obsidian folder (confirms vault)
2. If multiple vaults found → Ask user which one to use
3. If no vault found → Ask user for vault path or create in current dir
```

```
1. Glob scan current Obsidian vault, auto-learn (no confirmation needed)
   → Glob scan .md and .canvas files
   → Read and analyze 3-5 typical documents
   → Extract frontmatter, tags, callouts habits
   → Write to user-habits.md

2. Create 'Reading Tracker.bases'
   → Glob check if *Reading Tracker*.base or similar exists
   → If not, ask user: "Create Reading Tracker? (Recommended)"
   → If agreed, create based on templates/reading-tracker.base
   → Filename: `Reading Tracker.base`, place in user-specified directory
   → Function: Auto-index all documents with #reading-notes tag
```

### Regular Use

```
1. Read user-habits.md

2. Fetch content
   → URL: WebFetch
   → Local file: Read

3. Identify content type (refer to rules/content-types.md)

4. Generate notes
   → Follow user-habits.md style
   → Follow rules/fidelity.md for source fidelity
   → Frontmatter follows rules/frontmatter.md
   → New notes default: status: unread, progress: 0

5. Ask if Canvas is needed

6. Check consistency
   → If request differs from user-habits.md, ask if habits should be updated after task completion

7. End-of-task checks (MANDATORY)
   → Ask user: "Do you want me to update your preferences in user-habits.md?"
   → Glob scan for `*.base` files in vault
     - If no Reading Tracker found, ask: "No Reading Tracker found. Create one?"
     - If agreed, create based on templates/reading-tracker.base
   → **VALIDATE all generated .canvas files** using the validation script
     - Run: `/Users/roucher/.claude/skills/go-obsidian/scripts/validate-canvas.sh`
     - Fix any JSON errors or validation warnings before completion
   → Confirm all files created successfully
```

### Reading Tracker Description

**File**: `Reading Tracker.base` (based on `templates/reading-tracker.base`)

**When to create**: Auto-ask and create on first use

**When to update**: No manual updates needed, Bases auto-indexes all documents with `#reading-notes` tag

**Included views**:
| View | Function | Group By |
|------|----------|----------|
| All Notes | Overview of all reading notes | By source type (type) |
| By Status | View by reading progress | By status (status) |
| Recent Reading | Notes active in last 7 days | No grouping |

**Display fields**: Date → Status icon → Filename → Type icon → Progress bar → Tags

## Reference As Needed

| File | When to Reference |
|------|-------------------|
| `syntax/obsidian-markdown.md` | When creating .md files (syntax specs) |
| `syntax/json-canvas.md` | When creating .canvas files (syntax specs) |
| `syntax/obsidian-bases.md` | When creating .base files (syntax specs) |
| `rules/frontmatter.md` | When creating .md files (writing rules) |
| `rules/canvas.md` | When creating .canvas files (layout rules) |
| `rules/content-types.md` | When identifying content type and layout |
| `rules/fidelity.md` | Always follow |
| `templates/reading-tracker.base` | When creating Reading Tracker |
| `examples.md` | When usage examples are needed |
| `references.md` | When consulting official documentation links |

## Updatable Configuration

- `user-habits.md` - User habits configuration, can be dynamically updated via Edit tool

## File Path saving Rules

> [!info] Save Location
> All generated files (`*.md`, `*.canvas`, `*.base`) are automatically saved to:
> - **Obsidian Vault**: Determined by Glob scan of vault (usually where vault root is found)
> - Ask user if unsure about vault location
> - Never save to random working directories

## Output Specifications

### Summary Document (.md)

- **Extension: `.md`** (required)
- **Filename**: AI decides based on content and context
- Must include original link
- **Structure is flexible** - Model decides organization based on content
- Use appropriate Callouts, mermaid diagrams, tables as needed
- Add Canvas wikilink with AI-chosen name
  - Canvas filename MUST include `.canvas` extension (e.g., `Article Title - Canvas.canvas`)
  - Wikilink in notes MUST NOT include extension (e.g., `[[Article Title - Canvas]]`)

### Canvas (.canvas)

- **Extension: `.canvas`** (required)
- **Filename**: AI decides based on content
- Detailed layout specs refer to `rules/canvas.md`
- Add link node pointing to original
- Use MULTIPLE colors (refer to Color Guidelines)
- **IMPORTANT**: When linking to article notes from Canvas, use file nodes with `.md` extension:
  ```json
  { "type": "file", "file": "Article Name.md" }
  ```
