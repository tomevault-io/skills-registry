# Apply Easing to Code

The user wants to add or improve easing in their CSS or Tailwind code.

## Step 1: Identify the Target

Read the file(s) the user specifies. If no file is specified, ask which file to modify.

Look for:
- CSS `transition` and `transition-timing-function` properties
- CSS `animation` and `animation-timing-function` properties
- Tailwind CSS `ease-*` and `ease-[...]` utility classes
- Tailwind CSS `transition-*` utilities without an easing class

## Step 2: Assess Current Easings

For each animation/transition found, categorize the current easing:
- **Browser default** — `ease`, `linear`, `ease-in`, `ease-out`, `ease-in-out`, or no easing specified
- **Custom** — `cubic-bezier(...)`, `linear(...)`, or `ease-[...]` with custom values

## Step 3: Determine Replacements

For browser defaults or missing easings, determine the best replacement by analyzing:
- The CSS property being animated (opacity, transform, width, etc.)
- The context (hover state, modal, dropdown, page transition, etc.)
- The user's stated intent if provided (e.g., "make it bouncier")

Use the MCP tools to generate the appropriate curve. Prefer presets via `get_presets` before creating custom curves.

## Step 4: Apply Changes

Modify the code directly:
- For CSS: Replace or add the `transition-timing-function` or `animation-timing-function` value
- For CSS shorthand: Update the easing value within `transition: property duration easing` or `animation: name duration easing`
- For Tailwind: Replace or add the `ease-[...]` utility class

## Supported Formats

- CSS `transition-timing-function` / `animation-timing-function`
- CSS shorthand `transition` / `animation`
- Tailwind CSS `ease-*` and `ease-[...]` utilities

## Not Supported

- JavaScript animation libraries (Framer Motion, GSAP, anime.js) — not in scope for this version
