# Jarvis Test Runner

Automated test execution system for Jarvis plugin agents and skills. Executes test suites with configurable trials, validates responses against assertions, calculates pass@k metrics, and generates detailed reports.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill should be used when the user asks to:
- Run tests for Jarvis agents or skills
- Execute test suites
- Validate agent behavior
- Check if changes broke existing functionality
- Generate test reports

## Core Concepts

### Test Files

Test definitions live in JSON files:
- `tests/agents/*.tests.json` - Agent test suites
- `tests/skills/*.tests.json` - Skill test suites

Each file contains test cases with input (JSON to send to agent) and expect (assertions to validate response).

### Multi-Trial Execution

LLM outputs are non-deterministic. Run each test multiple times (trials) to measure reliability:
- **pass@k**: Test passes if ANY trial succeeds (relaxed)
- **pass^k**: Test passes if ALL trials succeed (strict)
- **majority**: Test passes if >50% of trials succeed

### Assertion System

Validate agent responses using structured assertions:
- Status checks (`status`, `error_code`)
- Field validation (`has_fields`, `field_equals`, `field_contains`)
- Array checks (`all_match`, `all_match_pattern`, `none_match_pattern`)
- Conditional logic (`one_of`, `if_results`)

See `references/assertions.md` for complete assertion reference.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```
Run all tests
Run tests for jarvis-explorer-agent
Run core suite tests
Run test EXP-001 with 5 trials
```

### Parameters

Parse from user input:

| Parameter | Default | Values | Description |
|-----------|---------|--------|-------------|
| `scope` | `"all"` | `all`, `agent:name`, `suite:name`, `test:ID` | What to test |
| `trials` | `3` | 1-10 | Runs per test |
| `pass_threshold` | `"any"` | `any`, `all`, `majority` | Pass criteria |
| `fail_fast` | `false` | `true`, `false` | Stop on first failure |

### Scope Examples

- `all` - Run all test files
- `agent:jarvis-explorer-agent` - Run tests/agents/jarvis-explorer-agent.tests.json
- `suite:core` - Run only "core" suite across all files
- `test:EXP-001` - Run single test by ID

## Test Execution Workflow

### Step 1: Discover Test Files

Use Glob to find test files matching scope:

```
test_files = Glob("tests/agents/*.tests.json")
test_files += Glob("tests/skills/*.tests.json")

# Filter by scope
if scope == "agent:name":
  test_files = filter files matching name
```

### Step 2: Load and Parse

For each test file:

```
content = Read(test_file)
parsed = JSON.parse(content)

# Extract metadata
agent = parsed.agent  // e.g., "jarvis:jarvis-explorer-agent"
suites = parsed.test_suites

# Filter by scope if needed
if scope == "suite:name":
  filter to that suite
if scope == "test:ID":
  find test with that ID
```

### Step 3: Execute Tests

For each test in scope:

```
# Skip if conditions met
if test.skip_if:
  evaluate condition → skip test if true

# Run trials
trial_results = []
for trial in 1..trials:
  start_time = now()

  # Delegate to target agent
  response = Task(
    subagent_type: agent,  // e.g., "jarvis:jarvis-explorer-agent"
    prompt: JSON.stringify(test.input),
    description: `Test ${test.id} - Trial ${trial}/${trials}`,
    model: "haiku"  // Use haiku for speed unless test specifies otherwise
  )

  end_time = now()

  # Validate response
  passed = validateAllAssertions(response, test.expect)

  trial_results.push({
    trial: trial,
    status: passed ? "pass" : "fail",
    duration_ms: end_time - start_time,
    failures: passed ? [] : getFailedAssertions(response, test.expect)
  })

  # Fail fast check
  if fail_fast and not passed:
    break

# Calculate metrics
pass_at_k = trial_results.some(t => t.status == "pass")
pass_all_k = trial_results.every(t => t.status == "pass")
pass_majority = trial_results.filter(t => t.status == "pass").length > trials / 2

# Determine final status
final_status =
  pass_threshold == "any" ? pass_at_k :
  pass_threshold == "all" ? pass_all_k :
  pass_majority
```

### Step 4: Generate Report

Write markdown report to scratchpad:

```
report_path = `${scratchpad}/test-report-${timestamp}.md`
Write(report_path, generateMarkdownReport(results))
```

## Assertion Validation

Validate responses using the assertion system. See `references/assertions.md` for complete details.

### Quick Reference

**Status Checks:**
- `status: "success"` - Response status equals value
- `error_code: "NO_FILTERS"` - Error code equals value

**Field Checks:**
- `has_fields: ["results", "summary"]` - Fields exist (dot notation supported)
- `field_equals: {"pagination.offset": 0}` - Field equals value
- `field_contains: {path: "summary", text: "found"}` - Field contains text

**Array Checks:**
- `all_match: {path: "results[*].type", value: "note"}` - All items equal value
- `all_match_pattern: {path: "results[*].file", regex: "^journal/"}` - All match regex
- `none_match_pattern: {path: "results[*].file", regex: "^people/"}` - None match regex

**Conditional:**
- `one_of: [{status: "error"}, {contains: "filter"}]` - At least one passes
- `if_results: {all_have_tags: ["work"]}` - Check only if results exist

Implement validation using the pseudocode in `references/assertions.md`.

## Report Format

Generate structured markdown report with:

### Executive Summary
- Total tests, passed, failed, skipped
- Pass rate percentage
- Total duration and average per test

### Test Results
- ✅ PASSED section with brief details
- ❌ FAILED section with assertion failures and diffs
- ⊘ SKIPPED section with skip reasons

### Performance Analysis
- Table of suite performance
- Duration statistics
- Slowest tests

### Recommendations
- Action items for failed tests
- Suggestions for improvements

See `examples/sample-report.md` for template.

## Error Handling

**No test files found:**
```
Return error: "NO_TEST_FILES_FOUND"
Message: "No test files found matching scope: {scope}"
Suggestion: "Check scope parameter or verify test files exist"
```

**Invalid test file:**
```
Skip file and log error
Continue with remaining files
Include in report as skipped with reason
```

**Agent not found:**
```
Skip test with reason: "Agent {name} not available"
Include in skipped section of report
```

**Assertion failure:**
```
Log detailed diff:
- Assertion type
- Expected value
- Actual value
- Path (for nested assertions)
Include in test failure details
```

## Implementation Notes

### Performance

- Use `model: "haiku"` for test execution (faster, cheaper)
- Run trials sequentially (not parallel) to avoid rate limits
- Cache test file parsing to avoid re-reading

### Context Management

- Don't load full test files into context unnecessarily
- Parse JSON, extract relevant tests, discard rest
- Keep only active test case data in memory

### Reporting

- Write to scratchpad (temporary), not committed files
- Include timestamp in report filename
- Generate both structured JSON and markdown
