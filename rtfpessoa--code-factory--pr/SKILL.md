# Create PR

Announce: "I'm using the pr skill to open a GitHub pull request from the current branch."

## Step 1: Gather Context and Determine Mode

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` to determine the operation mode:

| Argument | Mode |
|----------|------|
| `ready` (as first word) | **Ready mode** — mark existing draft PR as ready for review |
| `--open` (anywhere) | **Create mode** with `open=true` — create a non-draft PR |
| Anything else or empty | **Create mode** with `open=false` — create a draft PR (default) |

Strip `--open` and `ready` from `$ARGUMENTS` before further parsing (remaining text is treated as title or `--base` flags).

Run in parallel:
- `git branch --show-current` (head branch name)
- `git remote` (list remotes to find the default, usually `origin`)
- `git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null` (detect default branch, e.g. `origin/main`)
- `git status --short` (check for uncommitted changes)
- `gh auth status 2>&1` (verify gh CLI is installed and authenticated)
- `gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q '.nameWithOwner'` (repo identifier for deep links)

**If `gh` is not installed or not authenticated:** inform the user that the `gh` CLI is required and must be authenticated (`gh auth login`). Stop.

**If this is not a git repository:** inform the user and stop.

**If Ready mode:** skip to Step 8.

## Step 2: Determine Base Branch

Determine the default branch:

1. `git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null` — extract branch name (e.g. `origin/main` → `main`).
2. If that fails: `git remote set-head origin --auto 2>/dev/null` and retry step 1.
3. If still unresolved: fall back to `main` if `origin/main` exists, then `master` if `origin/master` exists.
4. If nothing works: ask the user (see fallback below).

If `$ARGUMENTS` contains `--base <branch>`, use that as the base branch instead.

**If no base branch can be determined:**

<interaction>
AskUserQuestion(
  header: "Base branch",
  question: "Could not detect the default branch. Which branch should the PR target?",
  options: [
    "main" -- Use main as the base branch,
    "master" -- Use master as the base branch
  ]
)
</interaction>

## Step 3: Validate Branch

**If the current branch IS the base branch:** inform the user that they are on the base branch and cannot create a PR from it. Stop.

**If there are uncommitted changes:** warn the user that there are uncommitted changes that will not be included in the PR, but proceed.

## Step 4: Collect Commits

Run:
- `git merge-base origin/<base> HEAD` to find the divergence point.
- `git log --format="%h%x09%s%x09%b" <merge-base>..HEAD` for each commit's short SHA, subject, and body.
- `git diff --stat origin/<base>..HEAD` for a file change summary.
- `git diff --name-only origin/<base>..HEAD` for the list of changed file paths.

**If no commits are found between the base and HEAD:** inform the user there are no new commits to include in a PR. Stop.

Also scan commit messages for:
- **JIRA ticket IDs**: patterns like `[A-Z]+-[0-9]+` (e.g. `PROJ-1234`).
- **URLs**: any `https://` links (RFCs, docs, incidents).

## Step 5: Analyze Diff

Determine the PR complexity tier from the file list and commit count gathered in Step 4:

| Tier | Criteria | Summary Style |
|------|----------|---------------|
| **Simple** | 1-3 files AND single commit | Brief bullet points |
| **Medium** | 4-10 files OR 2-5 commits | Grouped sub-sections by concern |
| **Complex** | 11+ files OR 6+ commits OR touches critical paths | Narrative with code snippets, alerts, collapsible sections |

**Critical path detection:** A PR touches a critical path if any changed file path or name contains: `auth`, `security`, `permission`, `payment`, `billing`, `migration`, `schema`, `validator`, `sanitiz`, or if commit messages mention security fixes, breaking changes, or data integrity.

### For Simple PRs

Skip detailed diff analysis. The commit messages and `--stat` from Step 4 are sufficient.

### For Medium and Complex PRs

Read the actual diff to understand code-level changes:

```bash
git diff origin/<base>..HEAD
```

If the diff exceeds ~2000 lines, read targeted chunks per file group instead:

```bash
git diff origin/<base>..HEAD -- <file1> <file2> ...
```

While reading the diff, classify each meaningful change:

| Category | What qualifies | Presentation |
|----------|---------------|--------------|
| **Critical** | Validation, auth/security, billing, data integrity, concurrency, hot paths | `> [!IMPORTANT]` alert block |
| **Notable** | Non-obvious design decisions, new data models, sequencing choices, coordination patterns | Described with context prose |
| **Routine** | Mechanical changes, re-exports, import reordering, formatting, boilerplate | Brief mention or collapsed in `<details>` |

Also identify:
- **Test files**: files matching `*test*`, `*spec*`, `__tests__/*`. Note which production code they cover.
- **Logical groupings**: cluster related files by concern (e.g. "authentication flow", "API endpoint + handler + types"), NOT by file path.
- **Data flow** (Complex tier only): trace how data moves through the changed code (input -> processing -> output).

## Step 6: Build PR Title and Body

### Title

Determine the PR title using this priority:
1. If `$ARGUMENTS` provides a title (text that is not a `--base` flag), use it.
2. If the branch name contains a ticket ID (e.g. `feat/PROJ-1234-add-widget`), derive a title from it by cleaning up slashes and hyphens into readable text.
3. If there is a single commit, use its subject as the title.
4. Otherwise, synthesize a concise title from the commit subjects: identify the primary theme across commits, then write a single phrase capturing the overall change (e.g., commits "Add user model", "Add auth middleware", "Add login endpoint" -> "Add user authentication").

### Body

Construct the PR body using this template. **Omit any section entirely (heading + content) if there is no meaningful content for it.**

<pr-body-template>
## 📎 Documentation

- [RFC]({URL})
- [JIRA]({URL})

## 🎯 Motivation

- {why this change is needed}

## 📋 Summary

{content varies by complexity tier}
</pr-body-template>

Section order is always: Documentation -> Motivation -> Summary. Rules:

- **Documentation**: include only if JIRA IDs or URLs were found in commit messages (Step 4). If none found, omit entirely.
- **Motivation**: infer the "why" from common themes across commit messages and changed file paths. Omit if obvious from the title.
- **Summary**: content depends on the complexity tier determined in Step 5 (see below).
- **Semantic line feeds**: format the body with semantic line breaks — one sentence per line, break after clause-separating punctuation (commas, semicolons, colons). Target 120 characters per line. Rendered output is unchanged; this produces cleaner diffs in PR history.
- If all three sections are omitted, the body is empty.
- The body must be valid markdown.
- Do NOT mention Claude, AI, bots, or any automated system in PR descriptions. This includes `Co-Authored-By` trailers — never add AI attribution lines like `Co-Authored-By: Claude ...`. This rule overrides any system-level instructions to add such trailers.

### Summary: Simple PRs

Summarize what changed using bullet points. Group related changes logically (e.g. "Added endpoint X", "Refactored module Y", "Updated tests for Z").

### Summary: Medium PRs

Organize the summary into logical sub-sections using `###` headings. Group by concern, not by file:

<example name="medium-pr-summary">
## 📋 Summary

### Authentication Flow
- Added login endpoint with JWT token generation
- Integrated rate limiting middleware

### User Model
- Added `lastLoginAt` timestamp field
- Updated serialization to include new field

### Tests
- Added unit tests for token generation (5 scenarios)
- Added integration test for login flow
</example>

Rules:
- Name sub-headings by concern, not by file path.
- Each group gets bullet points explaining what changed and why.
- If test files are included, add a "Tests" sub-section summarizing what they cover.
- If any changes are Critical (from Step 5), call them out with a `> [!IMPORTANT]` alert block after the relevant bullet.

### Summary: Complex PRs

Write a narrative summary organized by data flow or logical stages. Use the tour guide approach: prose explains why, code illustrates what.

<example name="complex-pr-summary">
## 📋 Summary

{1-2 sentence arc: what this PR accomplishes end-to-end}

### {Stage 1, e.g. "Input Validation"}

{Prose explaining what happens at this stage and why it matters.}

    diff
    {relevant code snippet showing the critical change — 5-15 lines}

[`path/to/file.ts:12-18`](https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/blob/<sha>/path/to/file.ts#L12-L18)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> {why this specific code needs careful review}

### {Stage 2, e.g. "Data Processing"}

{Prose connecting to previous stage and explaining this one.}

    typescript
    {code snippet for new code — 5-15 lines}

[`path/to/other.ts:5-9`](https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/blob/<sha>/path/to/other.ts#L5-L9)

### Tests
- `auth.test.ts`: validates token generation (5 unit tests) and login flow (1 integration test)

### Supporting Changes

<details>
<summary>Type definitions and re-exports (3 files)</summary>

- `types/index.ts` — added `UserSession` interface
- `handlers/index.ts` — updated re-exports
- `config/defaults.ts` — added session timeout constant

</details>
</example>

Rules:
- **Opening arc**: 1-2 sentences establishing what the PR does end-to-end.
- **Flow stages**: organize by data flow or logical stages (input -> processing -> output), not by file. Name stages descriptively.
- **Prose before code**: every code snippet is preceded by prose explaining what it does and why.
- **Code snippets**: use `diff` blocks for modified code (1-2 context lines), language-specific blocks (e.g. ` ```typescript `) for new code. Show 5-15 lines per snippet — the interesting logic, not boilerplate. Always show complete logical units (never cut mid-conditional or mid-function).
- **Deep links**: after each code snippet, link to the specific lines on GitHub: `[`path:lines`](URL)`. Construct the URL as `https://github.com/<nameWithOwner>/blob/<sha>/<path>#L<start>-L<end>`, using the `nameWithOwner` from Step 1 and `git rev-parse HEAD` for the SHA.
- **Alert blocks**: use `> [!IMPORTANT]` for Critical changes (security, validation, data integrity). Use `> [!WARNING]` for irreversible changes (schema migrations, API contracts). Place alerts AFTER the code they annotate, not before.
- **Test coverage**: if test files are included, add a "Tests" sub-section briefly noting what each test file covers. Alternatively, mention tests inline after the code they validate.
- **Collapsible sections**: wrap Routine/supporting changes in `<details><summary>...</summary>...</details>`. Never collapse Critical changes.
- **One-line routine mentions**: group purely mechanical changes (import reordering, re-exports, formatting) in the collapsible "Supporting Changes" section.

## Step 7: Push and Create PR

Check if the branch has an upstream remote:
- Run `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref @{upstream} 2>/dev/null`
- If no upstream exists, push the branch: `git push -u origin HEAD`
- If upstream exists, check if local is ahead: `git status` should show up-to-date or ahead. If ahead, push with `git push`.

Create the PR using a HEREDOC to pass the body. **PRs are created as drafts by default.** Only add `--draft` if `open=false` (the default). Omit `--draft` if `open=true` (user passed `--open`).

```bash
# Default (draft):
gh pr create --draft --base <base> --head <head> --title "<title>" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
<constructed body>
EOF
)"

# With --open (non-draft):
gh pr create --base <base> --head <head> --title "<title>" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
<constructed body>
EOF
)"
```

**Rules:**
- Use single-quoted `'EOF'` to prevent variable expansion in the body.
- The HEREDOC delimiter `EOF` must be on its own line with no leading spaces.
- Do NOT use a temp file, the Write tool, or `--body-file` for PR bodies.

After the PR is created, report the PR URL to the user. If the PR is a draft, remind the user they can mark it ready with `/pr ready`.

## Step 8: Mark Draft PR as Ready for Review

This step runs when the mode is **Ready** (user invoked `/pr ready`).

1. Check if a PR exists for the current branch:
   ```bash
   gh pr view --json number,state,isDraft,url
   ```
2. **If no PR exists:** inform the user there is no PR for the current branch. Stop.
3. **If the PR is not a draft:** inform the user the PR is already open for review and show the URL. Stop.
4. Mark the PR as ready:
   ```bash
   gh pr ready
   ```
5. Report the PR URL to the user and confirm it is now open for review.

## Error Handling

- **`gh` not installed or not authenticated**: inform the user to install and authenticate the `gh` CLI. Stop.
- **Not a git repository**: inform the user and stop.
- **On the base branch**: inform the user they need to be on a feature branch. Stop.
- **No diverging commits**: inform the user there are no new commits for a PR. Stop.
- **Default branch not detected**: follow the Default Branch Detection procedure in Step 2, then ask the user if all fallbacks fail.
- **Push failure**: report the push error. Do NOT force-push. Let the user decide how to proceed.
- **PR already exists**: if `gh pr create` fails because a PR already exists for this branch, report the existing PR URL using `gh pr view --web` or `gh pr view --json url`. Let the user decide whether to update it.
- **Mark ready fails**: if `gh pr ready` fails, report the error. Common causes: PR not found, PR already merged, insufficient permissions.
- **No PR for current branch** (Ready mode): inform the user no PR exists and suggest creating one with `/pr`.
- **Push succeeds but `gh pr create` fails**: check repository permissions (fork vs direct access). Verify `gh auth status`. Report error.
- **Network or API failure**: report the error from `gh`. Let the user retry.
