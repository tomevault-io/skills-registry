## When to use

Use this skill when:

- UI does not look right or has layout problems
- Widgets overlap, disappear, or have wrong dimensions
- Unexpected re-renders or flicker
- Performance issues during rendering

## Source of truth

- `packages/core/src/app/widgetRenderer.ts` — full render pipeline
- `packages/core/src/app/__tests__/widgetRenderer.transition.test.ts` — transition behavior expectations
- `packages/core/src/runtime/commit.ts` — VNode → RuntimeInstance tree
- `packages/core/src/layout/` — layout engine
- `packages/core/src/renderer/renderToDrawlist/` — draw operations
- `packages/core/src/widgets/composition.ts` — animation hook implementations
- `packages/core/src/ui/` — design tokens, recipes, and capability tiers

## Debugging steps

1. **Enable profiling**:
   ```bash
   REZI_PERF=1 REZI_PERF_DETAIL=1 node your-app.js
   ```

2. **Check VNode tree structure** — ensure no missing children or null nodes

3. **Check widget IDs** — must be unique across the entire tree. Duplicate IDs cause unpredictable behavior

4. **Check nesting depth**:
   - Warning at 200 levels
   - Fatal at 500 levels
   - Flatten unnecessary wrapper nodes

5. **Check `key` props** on list items — missing keys cause full re-render and lost state

6. **Inspect with test renderer**:
   ```typescript
   const r = createTestRenderer({ viewport: { cols: 80, rows: 24 } });
   const result = r.render(myView(state));
   console.log(result.toText());  // see actual output
   result.findById("my-widget");  // locate specific nodes
   ```

7. **Review layout props**: `width`, `height`, `flex`, `p`, `gap`, `align`

8. **If animation is involved**, verify:
   - container widgets (`ui.box`, `ui.row`, `ui.column`, `ui.grid`) use `transition` with expected `properties` (`position`, `size`, `opacity`)
   - `properties: []` is not accidentally disabling tracks
   - `opacity` stays within `[0..1]`
   - `exitTransition` exists on nodes that should animate out before removal
   - keyed re-entry behavior is intentional (same key cancels in-flight exit)
   - exiting nodes are expected to be render-only (not focusable/hit-testable)
   - animation hooks are not conditionally called

9. **Read enriched runtime errors carefully**:
   - `ZRUI_DUPLICATE_ID` now includes both conflicting widget kinds + `ctx.id()` guidance
   - `ZRUI_DUPLICATE_KEY` includes the duplicate key and parent context
   - `ZRUI_INVALID_PROPS` includes prop name, widget kind, and expected type
   - `ZRUI_UPDATE_DURING_RENDER` includes guidance to move updates into event handlers/effects

## Common causes

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---------|-------------|
| Widget not visible | Missing from VNode tree, or zero width/height |
| Overlapping widgets | Wrong container type (use `column`/`row` not `box`) |
| Content truncated | Fixed width too small, missing `flex` |
| Flicker/full re-render | Missing `key` on list items |
| Transition not animating | `transition` missing, wrong `properties`, or no actual value delta |
| Opacity animation looks wrong | `opacity` outside `[0..1]` (clamped) or `properties` excludes `opacity` |
| Exit animation not visible | Missing `exitTransition`, zero/invalid duration, or node has no stable key |
| Exit node still interactive | Exit nodes are render-only; focus/hit-test should come from active tree only |
| Crash on deep tree | Nesting depth > 500 |
| DS styling not applied | DS styling is automatic with `ThemeDefinition`; check semantic tokens/theme activation (no `dsVariant` required) |
| Wheel scrolling not working | Ensure the container uses `overflow: "scroll"` and content exceeds viewport size |
