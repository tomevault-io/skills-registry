# Dockerfile Patterns

Best practices and patterns for writing production-ready Dockerfiles based on official Docker documentation and industry standards.

> **Sources**: This guide is based on [Docker Official Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/best-practices/), [Docker Multi-stage Builds](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-stage/), and current security best practices as of 2025.

## Dockerfile Structure Template

```dockerfile
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1

# Build stage
FROM node:20.11.0-alpine AS builder

# Metadata
LABEL maintainer="team@example.com"
LABEL version="1.0"

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Install dependencies first (better caching)
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci

# Copy application code
COPY . .

# Build application
RUN npm run build

# Production stage
FROM node:20.11.0-alpine AS production

# Install security updates
RUN apk update && apk upgrade && rm -rf /var/cache/apk/*

# Create non-root user (UID > 10000 for security)
RUN addgroup -g 10001 -S nodejs && \
    adduser -S nodejs -u 10001

WORKDIR /app

# Copy built assets from builder
COPY --from=builder --chown=nodejs:nodejs /app/dist ./dist
COPY --from=builder --chown=nodejs:nodejs /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY --chown=nodejs:nodejs package*.json ./

# Switch to non-root user
USER nodejs

# Expose port
EXPOSE 3000

# Health check (production-necessary, not optional)
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s --start-period=40s --retries=3 \
  CMD node healthcheck.js || exit 1

# Start application
CMD ["node", "dist/server.js"]
```

## Base Image Selection

### Choose from Trusted Sources

Docker recommends using images from:
- **Docker Official Images**: Curated collection with clear documentation
- **Verified Publisher images**: Authenticated by Docker
- **Docker-Sponsored Open Source**: Maintained projects

**Source**: [Docker Best Practices - Base Images](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/best-practices/)

### Alpine Linux (Minimal)

Alpine is recommended as a minimal starting point, currently **under 6 MB** while providing a full Linux distribution.

```dockerfile
# Smallest size, minimal attack surface
FROM node:20.11.0-alpine
FROM python:3.12-alpine
FROM ruby:3.3-alpine

# Install common dependencies on Alpine
RUN apk add --no-cache \
    bash \
    curl \
    git \
    postgresql-dev
```

### Pin to Specific Digests for Supply Chain Security

```dockerfile
# Pin to specific digest for guaranteed immutability
FROM node:20.11.0-alpine@sha256:c0a3badbd8a0a760de903e00cedbca94588e609299820557e72cba2a53dbaa2c

# Note: Requires active maintenance for security updates
# Use Docker Scout for automated remediation workflows
```

**Source**: [Docker Best Practices - Supply Chain Security](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/best-practices/)

### Debian Slim (Balanced)

```dockerfile
# Good balance of size and compatibility
FROM node:20-slim
FROM python:3.12-slim
FROM ruby:3.3-slim

# CRITICAL: Always combine apt-get update with install
# Prevents cache issues that could install outdated packages
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
      curl \
      git \
      postgresql-client && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

### Distroless (Maximum Security)

```dockerfile
# Google's distroless images - no shell, minimal attack surface
FROM gcr.io/distroless/nodejs20-debian12
FROM gcr.io/distroless/python3-debian12
FROM gcr.io/distroless/java17-debian12

# Note: No shell available, debugging is harder
# Best for production security
```

---

## Multi-Stage Builds (Security Critical)

Multi-stage builds are **foundational for production security**. They allow you to "selectively copy artifacts from one stage to another, leaving behind everything you don't want in the final image."

### Security Benefits

1. **Reduced Attack Surface**: Excludes build tools, compilers, and development dependencies
2. **Smaller Image Size**: Final image contains only runtime necessities
3. **No Build Tools in Production**: Eliminates unnecessary security risks

**Source**: [Docker Multi-stage Builds Official Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-stage/)

### Basic Multi-Stage Pattern

```dockerfile
# Build stage
FROM golang:1.24 AS build

WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN go build -o /bin/hello ./main.go

# Production stage - minimal runtime
FROM scratch
COPY --from=build /bin/hello /bin/hello
CMD ["/bin/hello"]
```

### Copy from External Images

```dockerfile
# Copy from any image, not just previous stages
COPY --from=nginx:latest /etc/nginx/nginx.conf /nginx.conf
```

### Named Stages for Maintainability

```dockerfile
FROM node:20-alpine AS dependencies
RUN npm ci --only=production

FROM node:20-alpine AS builder
COPY --from=dependencies /app/node_modules ./node_modules
RUN npm run build

FROM node:20-alpine AS production
COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist
```

Use `AS <NAME>` to reference stages by name rather than numeric index—improves maintainability when reordering instructions.

## Layer Optimization

### Order by Change Frequency (Critical for Caching)

```dockerfile
# ❌ BAD - Changes frequently, invalidates cache
COPY . .
RUN npm install

# ✅ GOOD - Dependencies change less often
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
```

Understanding cache invalidation is critical for efficient builds.

### Combine RUN Commands

```dockerfile
# ❌ BAD - Creates multiple layers
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y curl
RUN apt-get install -y git
RUN rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# ✅ GOOD - Single layer, smaller image
# CRITICAL: Combine apt-get update with install in same RUN
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
      curl \
      git && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

Sort arguments alphanumerically for maintainability.

### Use Pipefail for Error Detection

```dockerfile
# IMPORTANT: Prepend set -o pipefail to catch errors at any stage
RUN set -o pipefail && \
    curl -sL https://example.com/install.sh | bash
```

Without pipefail, errors in piped commands may be silently ignored.

**Source**: [Docker Best Practices - RUN Instructions](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/best-practices/)

### Use .dockerignore (Essential)

Including unnecessary files like `.git`, `node_modules`, and `.env` increases image size and exposes secrets. The `.dockerignore` file excludes files and directories from the build context.

```dockerignore
# .dockerignore
node_modules
npm-debug.log
.git
.env
.env.local
.env.*.local
*.md
.DS_Store
coverage
.next
dist
build
*.log
.vscode
.idea
Dockerfile
docker-compose*.yml
```

## Security Best Practices

### Run as Non-Root User (Critical)

By default, Docker containers run as UID 0 (root). If the container is compromised, the attacker will have host-level root access to all resources allocated to the container.

**UIDs below 10,000 are a security risk** on several systems. If someone manages to escalate privileges outside the Docker container, their Docker container UID may overlap with a more privileged system user's UID, granting them additional permissions.

**Best Practice**: Always run processes as a **UID above 10,000**.

```dockerfile
# Alpine - Use UID > 10000 for security
RUN addgroup -g 10001 -S appuser && \
    adduser -S appuser -u 10001

# Debian/Ubuntu - Use UID > 10000
RUN useradd -m -u 10001 appuser

# Switch to non-root user
USER appuser

# Set proper ownership when copying
COPY --chown=appuser:appuser . .
```

**Source**: [Docker USER Instruction Best Practices](https://www.docker.com/blog/understanding-the-docker-user-instruction/)

### Scan for Vulnerabilities

```dockerfile
# Use specific versions, never :latest
FROM node:20.11.0-alpine

# Keep base image updated
RUN apk update && apk upgrade && rm -rf /var/cache/apk/*
```

Scan images regularly:
```bash
docker scout cves my-image:latest
# or
trivy image my-image:latest
```

### Secrets Management

```dockerfile
# ❌ BAD - Never hardcode secrets
ENV API_KEY=secret123

# ✅ GOOD - Use build args with cleanup
ARG NPM_TOKEN
RUN echo "//registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=${NPM_TOKEN}" > .npmrc && \
    npm install && \
    rm -f .npmrc

# ✅ BETTER - Pass at runtime
# docker run -e API_KEY=$API_KEY my-image
```

## Health Checks (Production-Necessary)

According to Docker best practices, "adding a HEALTHCHECK to your Dockerfile is not a nice-to-have—**it's a production necessity**." Without health checks, Docker cannot detect if a containerized service is unhealthy, preventing automatic restarts or recovery.

### HEALTHCHECK Syntax

```dockerfile
HEALTHCHECK [OPTIONS] CMD command
```

**Options**:
- `--interval=DURATION` (default: 30s)
- `--timeout=DURATION` (default: 30s)
- `--start-period=DURATION` (default: 0s) - Grace period for slow-starting apps
- `--start-interval=DURATION` (default: 5s)
- `--retries=N` (default: 3)

**Exit Codes**:
- `0`: success - container is healthy
- `1`: unhealthy - container isn't working correctly

### Examples

```dockerfile
# Web server check
HEALTHCHECK --interval=5m --timeout=3s \
  CMD curl -f http://localhost/ || exit 1

# Database check
HEALTHCHECK --interval=10s --timeout=5s --retries=5 \
  CMD pg_isready -U postgres || exit 1

# With start-period for slow-starting apps
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s --start-period=120s --retries=3 \
  CMD node healthcheck.js || exit 1
```

### Best Practices

1. **Use appropriate health checks** - Don't use shallow checks (e.g., ping when you need connection tests)
2. **Use `start-period` for slow apps** - Gives containers grace period before failures count
3. **Verify tool availability** - Tools like `curl` may not be in slim/alpine images
4. **Lightweight checks** - Use `wget --spider` or native commands when possible
