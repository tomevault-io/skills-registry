# Nano Banana Image Generator

## Overview

This skill enables AI-powered image generation using Nano Banana Pro (powered by Gemini). Generated images are automatically saved to the user's public images folder for easy access.

## When to Use

- User asks to "generate an image of..."
- User asks to "create a picture of..."
- User asks to "make an illustration of..."
- User wants visual content created from a text description
- User mentions "Nano Banana" for image generation

## Workflow

### Step 1: Generate the Image

Use the Composio/Rube MCP tools to generate the image:

1. Call `RUBE_SEARCH_TOOLS` with the query "generate images using nano banana" to get session ID
2. Call `RUBE_MULTI_EXECUTE_TOOL` with tool_slug `GEMINI_GENERATE_IMAGE`

**Tool Parameters:**
- `prompt` (required): The text description of the image to generate
- `model`: Use `gemini-3-pro-image-preview` for Nano Banana Pro (default, best quality with 4K support)
- `aspect_ratio`: Options include `1:1`, `16:9`, `9:16`, `4:3`, `3:4`, etc.
- `image_size`: For Nano Banana Pro, options are `1K`, `2K`, or `4K`

**Example execution:**
```
RUBE_MULTI_EXECUTE_TOOL with:
  tool_slug: "GEMINI_GENERATE_IMAGE"
  arguments: {
    "prompt": "A cute cat wearing sunglasses on a beach",
    "model": "gemini-3-pro-image-preview",
    "aspect_ratio": "16:9",
    "image_size": "2K"
  }
```

The tool returns a public S3 URL with the generated image.

### Step 2: Download and Save to Public Folder

After receiving the image URL from the generation tool:

1. Download the image using `curl` or `wget`
2. Save it to the public images folder: `/Users/mac/Public/images/`
3. Use a descriptive filename based on the prompt (e.g., `cat-sunglasses-beach.png`)

**Example:**
```bash
curl -o "/Users/mac/Public/images/cat-sunglasses-beach.png" "<generated-image-url>"
```

### Step 3: Confirm to User

After saving:
1. Confirm the image was generated and saved
2. Provide the local file path
3. Optionally display the image if in a supported environment

## Important Notes

- Always set `sync_response_to_workbench: false` when calling `RUBE_MULTI_EXECUTE_TOOL` for image generation
- The public images folder is `/Users/mac/Public/images/` - create it if it doesn't exist
- Use descriptive, kebab-case filenames derived from the prompt
- The Gemini connection is already active and ready to use
