# Parallel File Edits

Efficiently apply coordinated changes across multiple files by validating all edits first, then executing them in parallel using multiple Edit tool calls.

## When to Use

- Renaming variables, functions, or classes across files
- Updating import statements throughout the codebase
- Applying pattern changes or refactoring across multiple files
- Fixing common issues in multiple locations
- Updating configuration or constants in multiple places

## Workflow

1. **Plan the edits**: Identify all files and determine exact old/new string pairs
2. **Read all target files**: Use multiple Read calls in parallel to fetch and validate content
3. **Validate before applying**: Check that old_string exists and is unique (or use replace_all)
4. **Execute edits in parallel**: Make all Edit tool calls in a single response
5. **Report results**: Confirm successes and report any failures with clear messages

## Validation Checklist

Before executing edits, verify:

- [ ] All target files have been read and exist
- [ ] Each old_string is present in its target file
- [ ] old_string is unique OR replace_all will be used
- [ ] new_string differs from old_string
- [ ] Indentation matches exactly (no line number prefixes)
- [ ] File paths are absolute, not relative

## Important Guidelines

### Indentation Preservation
- When reading files, line numbers appear as: [spaces][number][tab][content]
- The actual file content starts AFTER the tab
- Never include line number prefixes in old_string or new_string
- Preserve exact indentation (tabs/spaces) as it appears in the file

### Uniqueness Requirements
- If old_string appears multiple times, provide more context to make it unique
- OR use replace_all: true to change all instances
- The Edit tool will fail if old_string is not unique without replace_all

### Parallel Execution
- All Edit calls should be made in the same tool invocation block
- This maximizes efficiency for coordinated changes
- Each edit is independent and does not depend on others

### Error Handling
- If validation fails, stop before making any edits
- Report which validation check failed and why
- Suggest corrections or ask for clarification

## Examples

### Example 1: Renaming a Variable Across Files

User: "Rename the variable userId to accountId across all files in the auth module"
Assistant: I will rename userId to accountId across the auth module files.

[Reads: auth/login.ts, auth/session.ts, auth/middleware.ts in parallel]
[Validates: Each file contains userId, strings are unique]
[Executes: 3 Edit tool calls in parallel with replace_all=true]

Successfully renamed userId to accountId in 3 files:
- /src/auth/login.ts (2 instances)
- /src/auth/session.ts (4 instances)
- /src/auth/middleware.ts (1 instance)

### Example 2: Updating Import Statements

User: "Update all imports from @/lib/utils to @/lib/helpers across the components folder"

Assistant: I will update the import paths across all component files.

[Searches: components folder for files importing @/lib/utils]
[Reads: 5 component files in parallel]
[Validates: Each contains import from @/lib/utils]
[Executes: 5 Edit tool calls in parallel]

Successfully updated import paths in 5 files:
- /src/components/Button.tsx
- /src/components/Card.tsx
- /src/components/Modal.tsx
- /src/components/Form.tsx
- /src/components/Table.tsx

## Reference

### Edit Tool Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| file_path | string | Yes | Absolute path to the file |
| old_string | string | Yes | Exact text to replace (no line numbers) |
| new_string | string | Yes | Replacement text (must differ from old_string) |
| replace_all | boolean | No | Replace all instances (default: false) |

### Common Patterns

**Simple Rename**: Grep for occurrences, read all files in parallel, edit all with replace_all=true

**Import Update**: Grep for old import path, read matching files, edit import lines with exact strings

**Surgical Change**: Read specific files, include surrounding context for uniqueness, edit with replace_all=false
