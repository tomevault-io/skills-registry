# FastAPI Endpoint Security Audit

## When to Use

Use this skill when performing a security audit of a FastAPI codebase. It provides a methodology for systematically scanning all API endpoint files, categorizing vulnerabilities by severity, and generating actionable findings.

**Trigger phrases**: "security audit fastapi", "check api endpoints for auth", "find unauthenticated endpoints", "audit fastapi security", "review api validation", "scan api for vulnerabilities", "api hardening review"

**Pre-requisites**:
- Access to the FastAPI source code in `app/api/` or similar directory
- Understanding of FastAPI patterns (router, Depends, query params, path params)

## Procedure

### Step 1: Discover all API endpoint files

First, find all files that define FastAPI routers:

```bash
# Find all router files
ls app/api/
# Or for nested structures:
find app/api/ -name '*.py' | sort
```

### Step 2: Count endpoints per file and find auth patterns

For each endpoint file, count the total endpoints and determine whether auth is applied:

```bash
# Count total route decorators (endpoints)
grep -n 'router\.\(get\|post\|put\|delete\|patch\)(' app/api/**.py

# Identify auth pattern — is it applied via dependency injection?
grep -rn 'Depends' app/api/**.py | grep -v 'Depends()' | grep -i 'auth\|user\|token\|session\|current'

# Check for middleware-level auth
grep -rn 'middleware\|Middleware' app/api/**.py
grep -rn 'add_middleware' app/main.py app/core/**.py
```

**Key insight**: Look for whether auth is per-endpoint (`Depends(get_current_user)`) or middleware-based. In a per-endpoint setup, endpoints without a `Depends(get_current_user)` parameter are **unauthenticated**.

### Step 3: Find endpoints with a `user_id` query parameter instead of auth

A common anti-pattern: endpoints accept `user_id` as a query parameter without authentication, which lets any caller impersonate any user:

```bash
# Find endpoints with user_id as a query param (likely unauthenticated)
grep -rn 'user_id:' app/api/**.py | grep -v 'path\|route\|response'
```

### Step 4: Categorize by severity

For each file found in Steps 2-3, categorize:

| Severity | Label | Criteria |
|----------|-------|----------|
| **P0 — Critical** | `no-auth` | Endpoint accepts `user_id` as query param but has zero auth checks. Any caller can access/modify any user's data. |
| **P1 — High** | `no-validation` | No `ge`/`le`/`min_length`/`max_length` constraints on query params. No format validation on ISO dates. |
| **P2 — Medium** | `bad-error-handling` | `except Exception` returning `str(e)`, unhandled `ValueError` from `datetime.fromisoformat()`, no limits on aggregation queries. |
| **P3 — Low** | `missing-guardrails` | No rate limiting on auth-sensitive endpoints (login, register), missing webhook signature verification, placeholder endpoints always returning success. |

### Step 5: Deep-dive each category

#### P0 — Missing Authentication

For each unauth'd file, enumerate specific endpoints:

```bash
# List all endpoints in a file with their route and method
grep -n 'router\.\(get\|post\|put\|delete\|patch\)(' app/api/fasting.py
```

Examine each endpoint's function signature for `Depends()` calls:

```bash
# Show function signatures to check for auth dependency
grep -A1 'def ' app/api/some_file.py | grep -v '^--$'
```

Document findings as a table with: File, Endpoints count, Issue description.

#### P1 — Missing Input Validation

Check for these patterns:

```bash
# No ge/le constraints on numeric params — grep for parameters with : int but no Ge/Le
grep -n 'limit:\|offset:\|skip:\|window_minutes:' app/api/**.py | grep -v 'Ge\|Le\|Field'

# Missing max_length on string params
grep -n 'str =' app/api/**.py | grep -v 'max_length\|Path('

# Missing min_length on search queries
grep -n 'q:\|query:\|search:' app/api/**.py | grep -v 'min_length\|max_length'

# Raw datetime.fromisoformat without validation
grep -rn 'fromisoformat' app/api/**.py
```

#### P2 — Weak Error Handling

```bash
# Bare except Exception returning str(e) — leaks internal details
grep -n 'except.*:' app/api/**.py | grep -v 'HTTPException\|ValidationError\|pass\|log\|logger' | head -30

# No limit on aggregation queries (OOM risk)
grep -rn '\.all()\|fetchall' app/api/**.py | grep -v 'limit\|offset'
```

#### P3 — Missing Guardrails

```bash
# Check for rate limiting
grep -rn 'limiter\|rate_limit\|throttle\|slowapi' app/**.py

# Check for webhook signature verification
grep -rn 'signature\|verify\|secret\|webhook' app/api/*webhook*.py app/api/garmin*.py app/api/withings*.py

# Check placeholder auth endpoints
grep -rn 'verify-email\|reset-password\|forgot-password' app/api/**.py
```

### Step 6: Calculate security score

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 🔴 **Critical** (0–20%) | Any P0 finding (unauth'd endpoints with user_id) |
| 🟠 **Poor** (20–40%) | P0 found without user_id, or >50% endpoints unauth'd |
| 🟡 **Fair** (40–60%) | All endpoints have auth but P1/P2 findings exist |
| 🟢 **Good** (60–80%) | Only P3 findings remain |
| ✅ **Excellent** (80–100%) | No findings |

### Step 7: Generate actionable findings

Create a structured report with these sections:

1. **Executive Summary**: Overall security score and key findings
2. **Critical (P0)** — Authentication gaps: File-by-file breakdown with endpoint count
3. **High (P1)** — Input validation gaps: Numeric constraints, string limits, date parsing
4. **Medium (P2)** — Error handling gaps: Exception leaks, OOM risks
5. **Low (P3)** — Missing guardrails: Rate limiting, webhook verification, placeholder endpoints
6. **Action items**: Convert each finding into a tracked task with priority label

For each finding:
- File path and line number
- Short description of the vulnerability
- The specific pattern that needs fixing
- Priority label (P0/P1/P2/P3)

## Pitfalls

### User_id query param is a false sense of security

If an endpoint accepts `user_id: int` as a query parameter but has **no authentication dependency**, any caller can query any user's data just by guessing IDs. This is the most common P0 vulnerability in FastAPI apps that use per-endpoint auth patterns.

**Prevention**: Auth must verify that `user_id` matches the authenticated user's ID, or that the caller has admin privileges.

### Middleware auth can be overlooked

Some endpoints rely on middleware for auth (e.g., `TrustedHostMiddleware`), but this only checks the host header — it does NOT provide user identity. Verify that middleware auth actually validates tokens/sessions, not just origin.

### Router prefix doesn't mean auth

A file like `app/api/auth.py` might define endpoints like `POST /auth/login` — these endpoints deliberately have no auth dependency (you can't be logged in before you log in). These are NOT vulnerabilities. Only flag endpoints that expose user-specific data without auth.

### Bare Exception catches leak stack traces

`except Exception as e: raise HTTPException(400, detail=str(e))` returns internal error messages to the client. This can leak SQL query details, file paths, and schema structure. Flag these as P2.

### "Limit" is not a security measure

Some endpoints pass `limit=1000` as a default but never enforce it against large requests. Check whether `limit` is actually used in the SQL query, not just accepted as a parameter.

## Verification

After completing the audit, verify:

- [ ] Every endpoint file has been scanned
- [ ] Each endpoint is categorized as auth'd or unauth'd
- [ ] P0 findings include specific file paths and line numbers
- [ ] P0 findings distinguish between "deliberately unauth'd" (login) and "missing auth" (data endpoints)
- [ ] Input validation gaps are documented with specific missing constraints
- [ ] Error handling gaps reference specific exception patterns
- [ ] Rate limiting is checked on at least: login, register, forgot-password
- [ ] Webhook signature verification is checked on all webhook endpoints
- [ ] Action items are tracked with priority labels (P0/P1/P2/P3)
