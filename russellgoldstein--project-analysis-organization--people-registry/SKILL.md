# People Registry Management

Build and maintain people profiles from document context. The registry grows organically as documents are processed.

## Person Profile Structure

Each person gets a profile at `knowledge/people/<firstname>-<lastname>.md`:

```markdown
---
type: person
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
sources:
  - processed/source1.md
  - processed/source2.md
name_variations:
  - John
  - John S.
  - John Smith
  - jsmith
  - @john.smith
---

# John Smith

## Basic Info

| Field | Value | Confidence | Source |
|-------|-------|------------|--------|
| Role | Senior Engineer | High | sprint-review.md |
| Team | Platform Team | High | team-sync.md |
| Department | Engineering | Medium | inferred |
| Location | San Francisco | Low | mentioned once |

## Expertise Areas

| Area | Evidence |
|------|----------|
| Backend systems | Presented architecture review |
| API design | Led API redesign initiative |
| Python | Mentioned as primary language |

## Responsibilities

- Lead technical design for Project Alpha
- Code review for platform services
- On-call rotation for data pipeline

## Active Projects

| Project | Role | Since |
|---------|------|-------|
| Project Alpha | Tech Lead | 2024-01 |
| API Gateway | Contributor | 2023-10 |

## Document Mentions

| Date | Document | Context |
|------|----------|---------|
| 2024-01-15 | sprint-review.md | Led sprint review presentation |
| 2024-01-10 | team-sync.md | Discussed migration timeline |
| 2024-01-05 | 1-on-1-notes.md | Performance review mentioned |

## Working Relationships

| Relationship | Person | Context |
|--------------|--------|---------|
| Works with | Jane Doe | Same project team |
| Reports to | Bob Wilson | Mentioned as manager |
| Collaborates | Sarah Kim | API design partner |

## Notes

- Prefers async communication
- Usually presents in sprint reviews
- Expert on legacy migration
```

## Name Recognition

### Identifying the Same Person

Track name variations to recognize the same person:

**Matching Criteria:**
- Same full name (case-insensitive)
- First name matches with contextual confirmation
- @mention username maps to known name
- Email prefix matches known name

**Variation Examples:**
```
John Smith
├── John
├── John S.
├── J. Smith
├── jsmith
├── @john.smith
├── john.smith@company.com
└── JS (initials, if contextually clear)
```

### Handling Ambiguity

When name is ambiguous:
1. Check context clues (team, project, role)
2. If still ambiguous, create separate entry with note
3. Flag for human review
4. Later merges can consolidate

```markdown
## Review Needed

- "John" mentioned without last name - could be John Smith or John Davis
- Context suggests Platform team, likely John Smith
```

## Information Extraction

### Role Detection

Look for role indicators:
- Explicit titles: "John, our Tech Lead..."
- Action indicators: "John will present the architecture"
- Responsibility context: "John is handling the deployment"

**Role confidence levels:**
- **High**: Title explicitly stated
- **Medium**: Role inferred from consistent actions
- **Low**: Single mention or ambiguous

### Team Detection

Look for team associations:
- Explicit: "the Platform team's John Smith"
- Meeting context: "Platform team sync" with John speaking
- Project association: If project maps to team

### Expertise Detection

Infer expertise from:
- Topics they present or explain
- Questions directed to them
- "Ask John about X" patterns
- Technologies they discuss in detail

## Profile Updates

### Adding New Information

When new document mentions a known person:
1. Read existing profile
2. Compare new information with existing
3. Add new information with source
4. Update confidence if evidence strengthens
5. Update `updated` date
6. Add document to sources list

### Handling Contradictions

If new info contradicts existing:
```markdown
## Possible Updates

**Role Change?**
- Previous: Senior Engineer (source: doc1.md, 2024-01)
- New: Staff Engineer (source: doc2.md, 2024-03)
- Action: Likely promotion, update role
```

### Information Aging

Note when information might be stale:
- Roles may change over time
- Team assignments shift
- Project involvement ends

Mark old information:
```markdown
## Historical

| Field | Value | Period |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Team | Mobile Team | 2023-01 to 2023-09 |
| Role | Junior Engineer | 2022-06 to 2023-06 |
```

## Cross-Linking

### Link to Projects
```markdown
See also:
- [[project-alpha-status]] - Current project
- [[project-alpha-tasks]] - Active tasks
```

### Link to Other People
```markdown
## Team

- [[jane-doe]] - PM for Project Alpha
- [[bob-wilson]] - Engineering Manager
```

## Quality Guidelines

### Minimum for New Profile
- Full name (or best guess with flag)
- At least one context mention
- Source document reference

### Don't Create Profile For
- Mentioned once with no context
- External people (unless relevant to project)
- Clearly hypothetical mentions

### Flag for Review
- Name conflicts (multiple Johns)
- Inferred information
- Significant role/team changes
- First-name-only mentions

## Registry Maintenance

### Periodic Review Tasks
- Merge duplicate entries
- Update stale information
- Consolidate name variations
- Remove irrelevant entries

### Merge Procedure
When merging two profiles:
1. Keep the more complete profile as base
2. Add unique info from other profile
3. Combine sources lists
4. Update name_variations
5. Archive or delete duplicate
