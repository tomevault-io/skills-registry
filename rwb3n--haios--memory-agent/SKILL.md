# Memory Agent

This skill implements the ReasoningBank pattern for experiential learning. It retrieves relevant past experiences before reasoning and extracts new learnings after task completion.

## Requirement Level

**SHOULD** invoke this skill:
- BEFORE complex tasks to retrieve relevant strategies
- AFTER completing significant work to extract learnings

## When to Use

### BEFORE Answering (Retrieval)
**SHOULD** use when:
- Answering questions about HAIOS architecture, ADRs, or system design
- Implementing features that may have been attempted before
- Debugging issues that may have known solutions
- Any task where past experience could help

### AFTER Completing (Extraction)
**SHOULD** use when:
- A complex task was successfully completed
- A novel solution was discovered
- An error was encountered and resolved
- Important context should be preserved for future sessions

## Instructions

### Step 1: Retrieve Context (BEFORE Reasoning)

When facing a complex question or task, FIRST search for relevant experience:

```
memory_search_with_experience(
    query="<describe the task or question>",
    space_id="dev_copilot"
)
```

The response includes:
- **results**: Matching concepts and entities from memory
- **relevant_strategies**: Past reasoning traces that succeeded or failed

### Step 2: Apply Retrieved Strategies (INJECT INTO REASONING)

**CRITICAL**: Do not just acknowledge the strategies - APPLY them to your reasoning.

Example injection pattern:
```
Based on past experience in this codebase:
- [Strategy 1 from memory_search_with_experience]
- [Strategy 2 from memory_search_with_experience]

Applying these learnings to the current task:
[Your enhanced reasoning here]
```

### Step 3: Extract Learnings (AFTER Task Completion)

After completing a significant task, extract and store the learning:

```
ingester_ingest(
    content="<what was learned, what worked, what failed>",
    source_path="session:<date>:<brief-context>",
    content_type_hint="techne"  # for practical knowledge
)
```

**MUST NOT** use `memory_store` (deprecated). Use `ingester_ingest` with `content_type_hint` parameter instead.

## Classification Guide

- **episteme**: Facts, definitions, verified truths
- **techne**: Practical knowledge, how-to, skills
- **doxa**: Opinions, beliefs, interpretations

## Example Workflow

### Scenario: Implementing a new feature

1. **BEFORE** - Retrieve context:
```
memory_search_with_experience(
    query="implement embedding generation for concepts",
    space_id="dev_copilot"
)
```

2. **INJECT** - Apply to reasoning:
```
Past experience shows:
- The Gemini API has rate limits of 1500 RPM
- Batch processing with 10-item chunks works well
- Always check for existing embeddings before regenerating

Applying this to current implementation...
```

3. **AFTER** - Store learnings:
```
ingester_ingest(
    content="For embedding generation, use batch_size=10 with 100ms delay between batches to avoid rate limits. Check concept.embedding IS NULL before processing.",
    source_path="session:2025-12-05:embedding-optimization",
    content_type_hint="techne"
)
```

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `ingester_ingest` | **PRIMARY** - Auto-classify and store with entity extraction |
| `memory_search_with_experience` | Retrieve context + strategies |
| `memory_stats` | Check memory system status |
| `extract_content` | Entity/concept extraction |
| `interpreter_translate` | Natural language to directive |
| `memory_store` | **MUST NOT** use - deprecated, use `ingester_ingest` |

## The ReasoningBank Loop

```

         |   NEW QUERY     |
         +--------+--------+
                  |
                  v

    |  ingester_ingest          |
    +-------------+-------------+
                  |
                  v
         +--------+--------+
         |   MEMORY DB     |
         +-----------------+
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always retrieve before complex tasks** - Past failures are as valuable as successes
2. **Be specific in queries** - "embedding generation rate limits" beats "embeddings"
3. **Include context in source_path** - Makes future retrieval easier
4. **Extract both success AND failure** - The paper shows failures are valuable for learning
5. **Use space_id consistently** - "dev_copilot" for development context

## IMPORTANT: Use `ingester_ingest` for Storage

**PRIMARY TOOL:** Always use `ingester_ingest` for storing learnings. It provides:
- Auto-classification (no manual type required)
- Entity extraction
- Provenance tracking
- No parameter format issues

**DEPRECATED:** `memory_store` is deprecated and returns a deprecation warning.
If you see code using `memory_store`, migrate it to `ingester_ingest`.
