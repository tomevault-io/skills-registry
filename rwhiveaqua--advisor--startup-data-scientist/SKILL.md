# Startup Data Scientist

This skill provides data science expertise specifically for startups following Lean Startup and Steve Blank Customer Development methodologies. It helps implement tracking, analyze user behavior, and provide actionable insights for pivot/persevere decisions.

## Core Philosophy

**"In God we trust. All others must bring data."** - W. Edwards Deming

For startups, data isn't just nice to have—it's essential for validating hypotheses, making pivot decisions, and finding product/market fit. This skill bridges the gap between methodology and measurement.

## What This Skill Does

### 1. Analytics Implementation
- Design tracking schemas for startup hypotheses
- Implement event tracking systems
- Set up databases for user behavior
- Create dashboards for key metrics
- Build data pipelines for analysis

### 2. Metrics Analysis
- Calculate Lean Startup metrics (AARRR, LTV, CAC, etc.)
- Perform cohort analysis
- Analyze retention and churn
- Statistical significance testing
- Growth accounting

### 3. Hypothesis Validation
- Translate business hypotheses into measurable metrics
- Design A/B tests and experiments
- Analyze experiment results
- Provide pivot/persevere recommendations
- Customer segmentation analysis

### 4. Data-Driven Advice
- Answer questions from lean-startup and steve-blank-adviser skills
- Provide data to support customer development decisions

### Essential Tracking Schema

Every startup should track these core entities:

#### 1. Users Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    user_id VARCHAR(36) PRIMARY KEY,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255),
    signup_source VARCHAR(50),
    utm_source VARCHAR(100),
    utm_medium VARCHAR(100),
    utm_campaign VARCHAR(100),
    customer_segment VARCHAR(50),
    activated BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    activated_at TIMESTAMP,
    converted_to_paid BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    converted_at TIMESTAMP,
    churned BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    churned_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

#### 2. Events Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE events (
    event_id VARCHAR(36) PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id VARCHAR(36) NOT NULL,
    event_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    event_properties JSON,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    session_id VARCHAR(36),
    device_type VARCHAR(50),
    browser VARCHAR(50),
    country VARCHAR(2),
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(user_id)
);

-- Index for fast queries
CREATE INDEX idx_events_user_date ON events(user_id, created_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_events_name_date ON events(event_name, created_at);
```

#### 3. Sessions Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE sessions (
    session_id VARCHAR(36) PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id VARCHAR(36),
    started_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    ended_at TIMESTAMP,
    duration_seconds INT,
    page_views INT DEFAULT 0,
    events_count INT DEFAULT 0,
    landing_page VARCHAR(255),
    exit_page VARCHAR(255),
    referrer VARCHAR(255)
);
```

#### 4. Experiments Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE experiments (
    experiment_id VARCHAR(36) PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    hypothesis TEXT,
    started_at TIMESTAMP,
    ended_at TIMESTAMP,
    status VARCHAR(20) -- 'running', 'completed', 'stopped'
);

CREATE TABLE experiment_variants (
    variant_id VARCHAR(36) PRIMARY KEY,
    experiment_id VARCHAR(36),
    variant_name VARCHAR(50),
    description TEXT,

    experiment_id VARCHAR(36),
    variant_id VARCHAR(36),
    assigned_at TIMESTAMP,
    PRIMARY KEY (user_id, experiment_id)
);
```

### Critical Events to Track

**For Lean Startup Metrics:**

```javascript
// Acquisition
trackEvent('user_signed_up', {
  source: 'google_ads',
  utm_campaign: 'spring_2024',
  landing_page: '/features'
});

// Activation
trackEvent('user_activated', {
  activation_action: 'completed_first_project',
  time_to_activation_minutes: 12
});

// Retention
trackEvent('user_returned', {
  days_since_signup: 7,
  return_session_number: 3
});

// Revenue
trackEvent('user_upgraded', {
  plan: 'pro',
  price: 49,
  billing_cycle: 'monthly'
});

// Referral
trackEvent('user_referred', {
  referral_method: 'email_invite',
  referred_user_id: 'user_xyz'
});
```

**For Customer Development:**

```javascript
// Problem validation
trackEvent('problem_survey_completed', {
  problem_severity: 8,
  current_solution: 'excel',
  willingness_to_pay: 'yes'
});

// Feature usage (validates solution)
trackEvent('feature_used', {
  feature_name: 'invoice_generator',
  usage_count: 1,
  time_spent_seconds: 120
});

// Customer feedback
trackEvent('feedback_submitted', {
  type: 'feature_request',
  sentiment: 'positive',
  text: '...'
});
```

## Part 2: Core Metrics Calculation

### Acquisition Metrics

#### 1. Conversion Rate by Channel

```sql
-- Signups by source
SELECT
    signup_source,
    COUNT(*) as signups,
    DATE(created_at) as date

WHERE created_at >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE, INTERVAL 30 DAY)
GROUP BY signup_source, DATE(created_at)
ORDER BY date DESC, signups DESC;
```

#### 2. Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

```sql
-- CAC by channel (requires marketing spend data)
WITH channel_spend AS (
    SELECT channel, SUM(spend) as total_spend
    FROM marketing_spend
    WHERE month = '2024-01'
    GROUP BY channel
),

    SELECT signup_source as channel, COUNT(*) as signups
    FROM users
    WHERE DATE_FORMAT(created_at, '%Y-%m') = '2024-01'
    GROUP BY signup_source
)
SELECT
    s.channel,
    s.total_spend,
    u.signups,

        WHEN TIMESTAMPDIFF(HOUR, created_at, activated_at) <= 24 THEN '1-24 hours'
        ELSE '24+ hours'
    END as time_bucket,
    COUNT(*) as users,
    ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(*) / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER(), 2) as pct
FROM users
WHERE activated = TRUE
    AND created_at >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE, INTERVAL 30 DAY)

        DATE_FORMAT(created_at, '%Y-%m-%d') as activity_date
    FROM events
    WHERE event_name IN ('user_logged_in', 'feature_used', 'page_viewed')
)
SELECT
    c.cohort_date,
    COUNT(DISTINCT c.user_id) as cohort_size,
    ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN DATEDIFF(a.activity_date, c.cohort_date) BETWEEN 0 AND 0 THEN a.user_id END) / COUNT(DISTINCT c.user_id), 2) as day_0,
    ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN DATEDIFF(a.activity_date, c.cohort_date) BETWEEN 1 AND 1 THEN a.user_id END) / COUNT(DISTINCT c.user_id), 2) as day_1,
    ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN DATEDIFF(a.activity_date, c.cohort_date) BETWEEN 7 AND 7 THEN a.user_id END) / COUNT(DISTINCT c.user_id), 2) as day_7,
    ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN DATEDIFF(a.activity_date, c.cohort_date) BETWEEN 30 AND 30 THEN a.user_id END) / COUNT(DISTINCT c.user_id), 2) as day_30
FROM cohorts c
LEFT JOIN activity a ON c.user_id = a.user_id
WHERE c.created_at >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE, INTERVAL 60 DAY)
GROUP BY c.cohort_date
ORDER BY c.cohort_date DESC;
```

#### 6. Churn Rate

```sql

    ) as viral_coefficient
FROM referrals r;
```

## Part 3: Analysis Frameworks

### Framework 1: Hypothesis Testing

**Template for validating startup hypotheses:**

```
HYPOTHESIS: [Statement to test]
NULL HYPOTHESIS: [Opposite statement]
METRIC: [What to measure]
TEST: [How to measure it]
SAMPLE SIZE: [Minimum users needed]
SIGNIFICANCE LEVEL: [Usually p < 0.05]
DURATION: [How long to run test]
```

**Example:**

```
HYPOTHESIS: Adding onboarding tutorial will increase activation rate from 40% to 50%
NULL HYPOTHESIS: Tutorial has no effect on activation
METRIC: Activation rate (% who complete first core action)
TEST: A/B test - 50% see tutorial, 50% don't
SAMPLE SIZE: Minimum 385 users per variant (for 80% power)
SIGNIFICANCE LEVEL: p < 0.05
DURATION: 2 weeks or until sample size reached
```

**Statistical Significance SQL:**

```sql
-- A/B test results with statistical significance
WITH variant_results AS (
    SELECT
        ea.variant_name,
        COUNT(DISTINCT ea.user_id) as users,
        SUM(CASE WHEN u.activated = TRUE THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as conversions,
        ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN u.activated = TRUE THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(DISTINCT ea.user_id), 2) as conversion_rate
    FROM experiment_assignments ea
    JOIN users u ON ea.user_id = u.user_id
    WHERE ea.experiment_id = 'onboarding_tutorial_test'
    GROUP BY ea.variant_name
)
SELECT
    variant_name,
    users,
    conversions,
    conversion_rate,
    -- Chi-square test would be computed in application layer
    CASE
        WHEN users < 100 THEN 'Insufficient sample size'
        ELSE 'Use chi-square test for significance'
    END as statistical_note
FROM variant_results;
```

### Framework 2: Cohort Analysis

**Purpose:** Track how groups of users behave over time

**Key Questions:**
- Are newer cohorts performing better? (Product improving)
- Where is retention curve flattening? (Core user base)
- Which cohorts have best LTV? (Target similar users)

**Advanced Cohort Query:**

```sql
-- Cohort retention with revenue
WITH cohorts AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        DATE_FORMAT(created_at, '%Y-W%u') as cohort_week,
        created_at
    FROM users
),
weekly_activity AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        DATE_FORMAT(created_at, '%Y-W%u') as activity_week,
        COUNT(*) as actions
    FROM events
    WHERE event_name IN ('feature_used', 'page_viewed')
    GROUP BY user_id, DATE_FORMAT(created_at, '%Y-W%u')
),
weekly_revenue AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        DATE_FORMAT(payment_date, '%Y-W%u') as revenue_week,
        SUM(amount) as revenue
    FROM payments
    GROUP BY user_id, DATE_FORMAT(payment_date, '%Y-W%u')
)
SELECT
    c.cohort_week,
    COUNT(DISTINCT c.user_id) as cohort_size,
    -- Retention
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN wa.activity_week = c.cohort_week THEN wa.user_id END) as week_0_active,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN WEEK(STR_TO_DATE(CONCAT(wa.activity_week, '-1'), '%Y-W%u-%w')) = WEEK(c.created_at) + 1 THEN wa.user_id END) as week_1_active,
    -- Revenue
    SUM(CASE WHEN wr.revenue_week = c.cohort_week THEN wr.revenue ELSE 0 END) as week_0_revenue,
    SUM(wr.revenue) as total_revenue,
    ROUND(SUM(wr.revenue) / COUNT(DISTINCT c.user_id), 2) as revenue_per_user
FROM cohorts c
LEFT JOIN weekly_activity wa ON c.user_id = wa.user_id
LEFT JOIN weekly_revenue wr ON c.user_id = wr.user_id
GROUP BY c.cohort_week
ORDER BY c.cohort_week DESC
LIMIT 12;
```

### Framework 3: Funnel Analysis

**Purpose:** Identify where users drop off in key workflows

```sql
-- Signup to activation funnel
WITH funnel_steps AS (
    SELECT
        u.user_id,
        u.created_at as step_1_signup,
        MIN(CASE WHEN e.event_name = 'profile_completed' THEN e.created_at END) as step_2_profile,
        MIN(CASE WHEN e.event_name = 'first_action_completed' THEN e.created_at END) as step_3_first_action,
        u.activated_at as step_4_activated
    FROM users u
    LEFT JOIN events e ON u.user_id = e.user_id
    WHERE u.created_at >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE, INTERVAL 7 DAY)
    GROUP BY u.user_id, u.created_at, u.activated_at
)
SELECT
    COUNT(*) as step_1_signups,
    COUNT(step_2_profile) as step_2_completed,
    COUNT(step_3_first_action) as step_3_completed,
    COUNT(step_4_activated) as step_4_completed,
    -- Conversion rates
    ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(step_2_profile) / COUNT(*), 2) as signup_to_profile_pct,
    ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(step_3_first_action) / COUNT(step_2_profile), 2) as profile_to_action_pct,
    ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(step_4_activated) / COUNT(step_3_first_action), 2) as action_to_activated_pct,
    ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(step_4_activated) / COUNT(*), 2) as overall_conversion_pct
FROM funnel_steps;
```

### Framework 4: Segmentation Analysis

**Purpose:** Identify which customer segments perform best

```sql
-- Performance by customer segment
SELECT
    u.customer_segment,
    COUNT(DISTINCT u.user_id) as users,
    ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN u.activated = TRUE THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 2) as activation_rate,
    ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN u.converted_to_paid = TRUE THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 2) as conversion_rate,
    ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN u.converted_to_paid = TRUE THEN DATEDIFF(u.converted_at, u.created_at) END), 1) as avg_days_to_convert,
    ROUND(SUM(p.amount) / COUNT(DISTINCT u.user_id), 2) as revenue_per_user
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN payments p ON u.user_id = p.user_id
WHERE u.created_at >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE, INTERVAL 90 DAY)
GROUP BY u.customer_segment
ORDER BY revenue_per_user DESC;
```

## Part 4: Implementation Guides

### PHP Implementation for Event Tracking

**IMPORTANT - Project Logging Structure:**
- **All log files** must be stored in the `/_logs/` directory
- **The logging function** is centralized in `_fun/function_logs.php`
- **Always use** the centralized logging function for consistency across the application

**Simple Event Logger:**

```php
<?php
// config/database.php
class Database {
    private static $instance = null;
    private $conn;

    private function __construct() {
        $this->conn = new PDO(
            "mysql:host=" . DB_HOST . ";dbname=" . DB_NAME,
            DB_USER,
            DB_PASS
        );
        $this->conn->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION);
    }

    public static function getInstance() {
        if (self::$instance === null) {
            self::$instance = new Database();
        }
        return self::$instance;

## Part 5: Reporting & Dashboards

### Daily Metrics Dashboard (SQL Views)

```sql
-- Create view for daily dashboard
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW daily_metrics AS
SELECT
    DATE(created_at) as date,
    -- Acquisition
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN table_name = 'users' THEN id END) as new_signups,
    -- Activation
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN activated = TRUE AND DATE(activated_at) = DATE(created_at) THEN user_id END) as activated_same_day,
    -- Engagement
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN event_name IN ('feature_used', 'page_viewed') THEN user_id END) as active_users,
    -- Revenue
    SUM(CASE WHEN event_name = 'payment_completed' THEN JSON_EXTRACT(event_properties, '$.amount') ELSE 0 END) as revenue
FROM (
    SELECT user_id, created_at, activated, activated_at, NULL as event_name, NULL as event_properties, 'users' as table_name, user_id as id FROM users
    UNION ALL
    SELECT user_id, created_at, NULL as activated, NULL as activated_at, event_name, event_properties, 'events' as table_name, event_id as id FROM events
) combined
GROUP BY DATE(created_at);
```

### Weekly Executive Summary

```sql
-- Weekly summary for leadership
SELECT
    DATE_FORMAT(created_at, '%Y-W%u') as week,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN u.user_id IS NOT NULL THEN u.user_id END) as new_users,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN u.activated = TRUE THEN u.user_id END) as activated_users,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN u.converted_to_paid = TRUE THEN u.user_id END) as paid_users,
    COUNT(DISTINCT e.user_id) as active_users,
    SUM(CASE WHEN p.amount IS NOT NULL THEN p.amount ELSE 0 END) as total_revenue,
    ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN u.converted_to_paid = TRUE THEN DATEDIFF(u.converted_at, u.created_at) END), 1) as avg_days_to_convert
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN events e ON u.user_id = e.user_id AND DATE_FORMAT(e.created_at, '%Y-W%u') = DATE_FORMAT(u.created_at, '%Y-W%u')
LEFT JOIN payments p ON u.user_id = p.user_id AND DATE_FORMAT(p.payment_date, '%Y-W%u') = DATE_FORMAT(u.created_at, '%Y-W%u')
WHERE u.created_at >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE, INTERVAL 12 WEEK)
GROUP BY DATE_FORMAT(created_at, '%Y-W%u')
ORDER BY week DESC;
```

## Part 6: Providing Insights

### How to Answer Common Questions

#### "Should we pivot or persevere?"

**Data to analyze:**
1. **Retention curve:** Is it flattening or declining?
2. **Cohort trends:** Are newer cohorts better or worse?
3. **Conversion rates:** Improving or plateaued?
4. **Engagement:** Are activated users using product regularly?

**SQL to run:**
```sql
-- Trend analysis for pivot decision
WITH monthly_metrics AS (
    SELECT
        DATE_FORMAT(created_at, '%Y-%m') as month,
        COUNT(*) as signups,
        ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN activated = TRUE THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 2) as activation_rate,
        ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN converted_to_paid = TRUE THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 2) as conversion_rate
    FROM users
    GROUP BY DATE_FORMAT(created_at, '%Y-%m')
)
SELECT
    *,
    LAG(activation_rate) OVER (ORDER BY month) as prev_activation_rate,
    activation_rate - LAG(activation_rate) OVER (ORDER BY month) as activation_change
FROM monthly_metrics
ORDER BY month DESC
LIMIT 6;
```

**Recommendation framework:**
- **Persevere if:** Metrics improving month-over-month, retention curve flattening
- **Pivot if:** Metrics flat/declining for 3+ months, retention curve keeps dropping

#### "Which customer segment should we focus on?"

```sql
-- Segment performance comparison
SELECT
    customer_segment,
    COUNT(*) as users,
    ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN activated = TRUE THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 2) as activation_rate,
    ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN converted_to_paid = TRUE THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 2) as conversion_rate,
    ROUND(AVG(days_active), 1) as avg_days_active,
    ROUND(SUM(total_revenue) / COUNT(*), 2) as revenue_per_user,
    -- Calculate LTV/CAC if CAC data available
    ROUND(SUM(total_revenue) / SUM(acquisition_cost), 2) as ltv_cac_ratio
FROM (
    SELECT
        u.user_id,
        u.customer_segment,
        u.activated,
        u.converted_to_paid,
        DATEDIFF(COALESCE(u.churned_at, CURRENT_DATE), u.created_at) as days_active,
        COALESCE(SUM(p.amount), 0) as total_revenue,
        100 as acquisition_cost -- Replace with actual CAC
    FROM users u
    LEFT JOIN payments p ON u.user_id = p.user_id
    GROUP BY u.user_id
) user_metrics
GROUP BY customer_segment
ORDER BY revenue_per_user DESC;
```

**Recommendation:** Focus on segment with highest LTV/CAC ratio and good activation rate.

#### "Is our MVP working?"

**Key metrics to check:**
1. **Activation rate:** >40% is good for B2B, >25% for B2C
2. **Day 1 retention:** >40% is good
3. **Day 7 retention:** >20% is good
4. **Willingness to pay:** >10% trial-to-paid conversion

```sql
-- MVP health check
SELECT
    'Activation Rate' as metric,
    ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN activated = TRUE THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 2) as value,
    CASE
        WHEN ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN activated = TRUE THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 2) >= 40 THEN '✓ Good'
        WHEN ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN activated = TRUE THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 2) >= 25 THEN '→ Acceptable'
        ELSE '✗ Needs work'
    END as assessment
FROM users
WHERE created_at >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE, INTERVAL 30 DAY)

UNION ALL

SELECT
    'Conversion Rate' as metric,
    ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN converted_to_paid = TRUE THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 2) as value,
    CASE
        WHEN ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN converted_to_paid = TRUE THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 2) >= 10 THEN '✓ Good'
        WHEN ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN converted_to_paid = TRUE THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 2) >= 5 THEN '→ Acceptable'
        ELSE '✗ Needs work'
    END as assessment
FROM users
WHERE created_at >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE, INTERVAL 90 DAY);
```
