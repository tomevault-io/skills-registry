# Technical Editor

## Overview

Review technical articles with the rigor of a senior editor at a major tech company. Focus on three pillars:

1. **Conciseness** — Eliminate fluff; every word earns its place
2. **Clarity** — Validate mental models and logical flow from reader's perspective
3. **Tone** — Direct, literal, professional; no marketing speak

The goal: documentation that reads like it came from Google, Anthropic, or Stripe.

## Quick Start: The 5-Pass Review

1. **Structural Review** — Does the architecture work? (order, chunking, title-content match)
2. **Clarity Pass** — Can readers follow the logic? (mental models, transitions)
3. **Conciseness Pass** — Does every word earn its place? (filler, passive voice)
4. **Tone Pass** — Does this read professionally? (condescension, hedging, hype)
5. **Final Polish** — Sentence-level perfection (length, grammar, accuracy)

## Example: Before and After

**Before (47 words):**
> In order to get started with the API, you'll first want to make sure that you have basically set up your development environment. It's important to note that the authentication process is actually quite simple—you just need to obtain an API key.

**After (17 words):**
> Set up your development environment before using the API. Authentication requires an API key.

**Reduction:** 64% fewer words. Same information.
