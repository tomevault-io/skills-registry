# Research

## When to Use

1. **Planning features** - "How do I implement..." or "help me plan..."
2. **Technology research** - Compare libraries, frameworks, approaches
3. **API/library docs** - Specific API references, versions, usage
4. **Implementation patterns** - Best practices, design patterns
5. **Requirement clarification** - Ambiguous or incomplete requirements
6. **Architecture decisions** - Evaluate different approaches

## Research Decision Tree

```
User requests feature implementation
│
├─ Requirements clear? NO → Clarifying Requirements Workflow
├─ Specific library/API? YES → API Documentation Workflow
├─ General "how to"? YES → General Implementation Workflow
└─ Compare options? YES → Comparative Research Workflow
```

## Four Core Workflows

### 1. Clarifying Requirements

**When**: Requirements ambiguous, incomplete, or multiple interpretations

**Process**:
1. Identify ambiguities (scope, tech choices, performance, security)
2. Structure 1-4 most important questions using AskUserQuestion
3. Present options with trade-offs in descriptions
4. Proceed with research after clarification

**Question patterns**:
- **Scope**: Scale? Performance requirements? Timeline?
- **Technical**: Integrate with existing systems? Tech preferences? Complexity acceptable?
- **Feature**: Core vs optional features? Error handling? Edge cases?

**Example**:
```
AskUserQuestion:
  Question: "Which authentication approach for this API?"
  Header: "Auth method"
  Options:
    - "JWT tokens" - Stateless, scalable, requires refresh logic
    - "Session cookies" - Traditional, stateful, simpler
    - "OAuth2" - Industry standard, third-party auth, complex
```

### 2. API Documentation Research

**When**: Need specific API docs, library usage, version info

**Process**:
```bash
# 1. Resolve library ID
mcp__context7__resolve-library-id: "library-name"

# 2. Get documentation
mcp__context7__get-library-docs: "/org/project"
  topic: "specific-feature"
  mode: "code"  # or "info" for concepts
  page: 1       # Try 2-4 if insufficient

# 3. Review multiple pages if needed
# 4. Document findings with code examples
```

**Mode selection**:
- `mode: "code"` - API references, code examples, function signatures
- `mode: "info"` - Architectural concepts, guides, explanations

### 3. General Implementation Research

**When**: Understand how to implement, find best practices, compare approaches

**Process**:
1. **Formulate 2-4 search queries**:
   ```
   "how to implement <feature> in <technology> <current-year>"
   "<feature> best practices <current-year>"
   "<technology> <feature> patterns examples"
   ```

2. **Execute WebSearch** (in parallel when possible)

3. **Analyze results** - Extract: approaches, code examples, trade-offs, patterns

4. **Synthesize findings**:
   - Available approaches (2-4 main options)
   - Recommended approach (based on requirements)
   - Key considerations (gotchas, requirements)
   - Code examples (concrete examples)
   - Next steps (decisions needed)

5. **Present with sources** (CRITICAL):
   ```markdown
   Sources:
   - [Source Title 1](url1)
   - [Source Title 2](url2)
   ```

### 4. Comparative Research

**When**: Compare libraries, frameworks, or implementation approaches

**Process**:
1. **Identify comparison criteria**: Functionality, performance, DX, ecosystem, maturity, maintenance, compatibility, learning curve

2. **Research each option**:
   - Context7 for library-specific info
   - WebSearch for comparisons: `"<tech-a> vs <tech-b> comparison 2025"`

3. **Create comparison matrix**:
   ```markdown
   | Criteria | Option A | Option B | Option C |
   |----------|----------|----------|----------|
   | Functionality | ... | ... | ... |
   | Performance | ... | ... | ... |
   | Ecosystem | ... | ... | ... |
   ```

4. **Make recommendation**: Which fits best? Why? Trade-offs? Migration path?

5. **Present with sources**

## Tool Selection Quick Reference

| Need | Primary Tool | Secondary | Ask Questions? |
|------|--------------|-----------|----------------|
| Unclear requirements | AskUserQuestion | - | Yes |
| API docs | Context7 | WebSearch | If needed |
| How to implement | WebSearch | Context7 | If unclear |
| Compare options | WebSearch | Context7 | If criteria unclear |
| Library versions | Context7 | WebSearch | No |

## Common Query Patterns

### By Technology

**Kubernetes**:
```
"kubernetes <feature> implementation 2025"
"kubernetes operator <use-case> example"
"kubernetes client-go <feature> example"
```

**Python/FastAPI**:
```
"fastapi <feature> implementation 2025"
"fastapi <pattern> best practices"
"python <library> <feature> example"
```

**Go**:
```
"golang <feature> implementation"
"go <pattern> best practices 2025"
"golang <library> example"
```

**React**:
```
"react <feature> implementation 2025"
"react <pattern> best practices"
"react hooks <use-case>"
```

**Database**:
```
"postgresql <feature> implementation"
"database <pattern> best practices"
"<database> <use-case> optimization"
```

### By Use Case

**Authentication**:
```
"<tech> authentication implementation 2025"
"JWT vs session authentication comparison"
"<auth-method> security best practices"
```

**API Design**:
```
"REST API design best practices 2025"
"API versioning strategies comparison"
"API rate limiting implementation <tech>"
```

**Background Jobs**:
```
"task queue comparison <language> 2025"
"<queue> <language> production setup"
"<queue> retry strategy patterns"
```

**Caching**:
```
"caching strategies <use-case> 2025"
"redis vs memcached comparison"
"cache invalidation patterns"
```

**Database**:
```
"<use-case> database comparison 2025"
"<database> <language> best practices"

```

## Context7 Topics by Library Type

**Web Frameworks**: routing, middleware, authentication, validation, error handling
**Database Clients**: connection, queries, transactions, migrations, relationships
**Kubernetes Clients**: resources, watch, informers, create update delete, custom resources
**React/Frontend**: hooks, state management, routing, forms, data fetching
**Testing**: fixtures, mocking, assertions, async testing

## Best Practices

### Research Quality
1. **Use current year** - Always include year from `<env>` in searches
2. **Multiple sources** - Verify across 2-3 sources
3. **Prefer official docs** - Use Context7 for authoritative API docs
4. **Recent information** - Prioritize within 1-2 years
5. **Cite sources** - Always include "Sources" section with links

### Asking Questions
1. **Be specific** - Concrete details, not vague preferences
2. **Provide context** - Explain trade-offs in option descriptions
3. **Limit questions** - Ask 1-4 most important, can follow up
4. **Actionable options** - Clear, distinct choices

### Presenting Research
1. **Start with summary** - 2-3 sentence overview
2. **Organize clearly** - Headers, lists, tables
3. **Show code examples** - Concrete implementation when available
4. **Highlight trade-offs** - Not just features, explain implications
5. **Recommend path** - Clear recommendation when possible
6. **Always cite sources** - Users need to verify and dive deeper

## Common Patterns

**Unknown library version**:
1. Use Context7 (gets latest by default)
2. Present version found
3. Ask if specific version needed

**Multiple related questions**:
1. Execute WebSearch in parallel for different aspects
2. Use Context7 concurrently for library items
3. Synthesize into cohesive presentation

**Insufficient Context7 results**:
1. Try `page: 2`, `page: 3`, etc.
2. Try different `topic` keywords
3. Switch between `mode: "code"` and `mode: "info"`
4. Fall back to WebSearch

**Feature implementation plan**:
1. Clarify requirements (use questions if needed)
2. Research approaches (General Implementation)
3. Research specific APIs (API Documentation)
4. Synthesize into structured plan with sources

## Integration with Planning

When used during feature planning:

**Before Planning**:
- Clarify requirements
- Research approaches
- Gather API docs
- Make tech recommendations

**Plan Structure**:
```markdown
# Feature Implementation Plan

## Research Summary
[2-3 sentence overview]

## Recommended Approach
[What to build and why]

## Technology Choices
[Libraries, frameworks, patterns]

## Implementation Steps
1. [Step with details]
2. [Step with details]

## Key Considerations
[Important details, gotchas]

## Code Examples
[Relevant examples from research]

## Resources
- [Source 1](url1)
- [Source 2](url2)
```

## Common Pitfalls

**Too broad research**:
```
❌ "authentication implementation"
✅ "FastAPI JWT authentication with refresh tokens 2025"
```

**Ignoring current year**:
```
❌ "kubernetes best practices"
✅ "kubernetes best practices 2025"
```

**Not using Context7 for libraries**:
```
❌ WebSearch: "fastapi authentication example"
✅ Context7: "fastapi" topic: "security" mode: "code"
```

**Asking too many questions**:
```
❌ Ask 10 questions about every detail
✅ Ask 2-3 critical questions, note assumptions
```

**No sources**:
```
❌ "Based on research, use approach X"
✅ "Based on research, use approach X

Sources:
- [Article 1](url)"
```

## Research Checklist

Before presenting research:
- [ ] Requirements clarified (or assumptions stated)
- [ ] Multiple sources consulted (2-3 minimum)
- [ ] Recent information prioritized (check year)
- [ ] Code examples included (when available)
- [ ] Trade-offs explained (not just features)
- [ ] Recommendation provided (with rationale)
- [ ] Sources cited (markdown links)
- [ ] Next steps identified

## Quick Tool Selection

```
Need authoritative API docs? → Context7
Need implementation examples? → WebSearch + Context7
Need to compare technologies? → WebSearch (multiple queries)
Need to understand concepts? → Context7 (mode: "info")
Need to clarify requirements? → AskUserQuestion
Need recent information? → WebSearch with current year
Need version-specific docs? → Context7 (latest or specified)
```

## Troubleshooting

**Context7 library not found**:
- Try alternative names
- Try broader terms
- Fall back to WebSearch
- Ask user for exact library name

**WebSearch irrelevant results**:
- Add more specific terms (tech, version, year)
- Try different phrasing
- Add filters: `site:stackoverflow.com` or `site:github.com`
- Combine with Context7

**Insufficient user answers**:
- Ask 1-2 follow-up questions
- Make reasonable assumptions (state them explicitly)
- Provide multiple plan variations
- Proceed with most common approach, note alternatives

**Research takes too long**:
- Focus on specific question, not comprehensive coverage
- Start with Context7 for authoritative source
- Limit WebSearch to 2-3 targeted queries
- Present summary first, offer to research deeper
