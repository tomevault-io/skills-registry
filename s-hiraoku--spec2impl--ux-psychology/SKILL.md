# UX Psychology for Frontend Design

Apply psychological principles to create more effective, engaging user interfaces.

## Workflow

### 1. Identify Design Goal

Determine the primary objective:
- **Conversion**: Pricing, signup, checkout
- **Engagement**: Retention, time-on-site, repeat visits
- **Usability**: Task completion, error reduction
- **Trust**: Credibility, security perception

### 2. Select Relevant Concepts

Based on goal, consult the appropriate reference file:

| Goal | Reference File | Key Concepts |
|------|---------------|--------------|
| Conversion | `references/cognitive-biases.md` | Anchoring, Loss Aversion, Framing |
| Engagement | `references/engagement.md` | Gamification, Variable Reward, Social Proof |
| Usability | `references/behavioral-patterns.md` | Cognitive Load, Progressive Disclosure, Default Effect |
| Visual Appeal | `references/visual-design.md` | Aesthetic-Usability, Visual Hierarchy |

### 3. Apply Concepts to Design

For each selected concept:
1. Read the detailed pattern from reference file
2. Identify specific UI elements to apply it to
3. Implement with code examples provided

## Quick Reference: 43 Concepts

### Cognitive Biases (→ `references/cognitive-biases.md`)
Anchoring Effect, Confirmation Bias, Expectation Bias, Familiarity Bias, Framing Effect, Halo Effect, Loss Aversion, Sunk Cost Effect, Survey Bias

### Behavioral Patterns (→ `references/behavioral-patterns.md`)
Cognitive Load, Decision Fatigue, Default Effect, Foot-in-the-Door, Goal Gradient Effect, Intentional Friction, Nudge Effect, Progressive Disclosure, Reactance, Reactive Onboarding, Selective Attention, Temptation Bundling, Zeigarnik Effect

### Visual Design (→ `references/visual-design.md`)
Aesthetic-Usability Effect, Banner Blindness, Visual Hierarchy, Visual Anchor, Skeuomorphism, Serial Position Effect, Priming Effect

### Engagement (→ `references/engagement.md`)
Curiosity Gap, Decoy Effect, Doherty Threshold, Empathy Gap, Endowment Effect, Gamification, Hawthorne Effect, Labor Illusion, Peak-End Rule, Pygmalion Effect, Scarcity, Social Proof, User Delight, Variable Reward

## Common Design Patterns

### Pricing Page
```
Applied concepts:
- Anchoring: Show highest-priced plan first
- Decoy Effect: Make middle plan look like best value
- Social Proof: "Most Popular" badge
- Visual Anchor: Highlight recommended plan visually
```

### Signup Flow
```
Applied concepts:
- Foot-in-the-Door: Start with email only, ask details later
- Cognitive Load: One task per screen
- Goal Gradient: Show progress bar
- Default Effect: Pre-select recommended options
```

### E-commerce Product Page
```
Applied concepts:
- Scarcity: "Only 3 left in stock"
- Social Proof: Reviews and ratings
- Loss Aversion: "Don't miss out..."
- Aesthetic-Usability: High-quality product images
```

## Ethical Guidelines

### Dark Patterns to Avoid
- False scarcity claims
- Hidden fees
- Difficult cancellation flows
- Manipulative loss aversion messaging
- Forced opt-ins

### Ethical UX Design
- Prioritize user benefit
