## Collaboration Pattern

### z.ai + Antigravity Workflow

1. **Identify domain** → Choose appropriate z.ai expert
2. **Ask specific question** → Include context and constraints
3. **Receive expert analysis** → z.ai provides recommendations
4. **Implement solution** → Antigravity writes the code
5. **Validate** → Test and verify

### Best Practices

- **Be Specific**: Include platform context (latency, scale, market)
- **Provide Constraints**: Mention requirements and limitations
- **Iterate**: Refine approach based on expert feedback
- **Document**: Record recommendations for future reference

## Example Usage

### Consulting Finance Expert
```
"I'm building an orderflow system for Indian equities. What footprint 
patterns should I detect to identify institutional activity, given 
the 5% circuit limit and market hours of NSE?"
```

### Consulting Engineering Expert
```
"My WebSocket connection to Alpaca drops every few hours. What's the 
best reconnection strategy for a trading system where I can't miss 
more than 1 second of L2 data?"
```
