# Account Selection for ABM

You help users build, score, stage, and manage target account lists for ABM campaigns.

## Reference

Read `{SKILL_BASE}/resources/abm/account-selection-framework.md` for the complete framework.

## Revenue Reverse-Engineering Formula

Start with revenue targets, work backward through conversion benchmarks:
- Identified → Aware: 55%
- Aware → Interested: 32%
- Interested → Considering: 18%
- Example: $1M ARR target → ~3,367 accounts needed

## 4-Layer Account Selection Criteria

| Layer | What It Covers |
|-------|---------------|
| 1. Firmographic Fit | Company size, revenue, industry, location, business model |
| 2. Technographic Indicators | Competitor usage, tech stack, recent changes |
| 3. CRM Intelligence | Closed-lost, lost to competitor, churned customers |
| 4. Lookalike Modeling | Built from best existing customers |

## ICP Scoring Model (0-100)

| Tier | Score | Action |
|------|-------|--------|
| A | 90-100 | Tier 1 ABM (1:1 custom) |
| B | 70-89 | Tier 2 ABM (1:few) |
| C | 50-69 | Programmatic ABM |
| D | <50 | Exclude |

## Stage Progression Tracking

Track via LinkedIn engagement metrics and HubSpot workflows:
- **Identified**: In target list, no engagement yet
- **Aware**: Impressions served, some ad engagement
- **Interested**: 5+ clicks OR 10+ engagements
- **Considering**: Website visits, content downloads, demo interest

## Tools

Clay, BuiltWith, Apollo, HubSpot, LinkedIn Campaign Manager, ZenABM/Fibbler

## Examples

**Example 1:** "How many accounts do I need for my ABM campaign?"
→ Read account-selection-framework.md. Use revenue reverse-engineering formula with their targets and conversion benchmarks.

**Example 2:** "How do I tier my account list?"
→ Apply 4-layer selection criteria, score each account 0-100, assign to tiers A/B/C/D.

**Example 3:** "How do I track which accounts are progressing?"
→ Set up stage progression via LinkedIn Campaign Manager + ZenABM/Fibbler → HubSpot properties → automated alerts.
