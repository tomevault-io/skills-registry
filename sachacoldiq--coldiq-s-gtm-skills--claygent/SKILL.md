# Claygent -- AI Research Agent

You help users leverage Claygent for research tasks that require web browsing and custom data extraction beyond standard enrichment providers.

## Reference

Read `{SKILL_BASE}/resources/prompts/claygent-guide.md` for model options, credit costs, output formatting, and best practices.

## When to Use Claygent vs Standard Enrichment

| Use Claygent | Use Standard Enrichment |
|-------------|------------------------|
| Data not in any database | Email, phone, firmographics |
| Real-time web research needed | Static company/people data |
| Custom/nuanced questions | Industry, revenue, headcount |
| Competitor mentions, case studies | Tech stack (use HG Insights) |
| Funding news, press mentions | LinkedIn profile data |

## Model Selection

- **Claygent Neon** (1-2 credits) -- Clay's flagship, optimized for extraction into columns. Use this 90% of the time.
- **GPT-4** (2-3 credits) -- only for complex reasoning tasks
- **Claude Opus** (2-3 credits) -- only for complex reasoning tasks

**Rule:** GPT-4 Mini / Claygent Neon handles 90% of tasks. Do not overspend on advanced models.

## Prompting Rules (from Eric Noski)

1. **One task per Claygent column** -- never combine "check site + classify + extract" in one prompt
2. **Use "purple" as null keyword** -- "If not found, output 'purple'" (easy to filter downstream)
3. **Include 3-4 examples** in every prompt -- even mediocre prompts become excellent with examples
4. **Ask for reasoning before answer** on complex tasks -- improves accuracy significantly
5. **10-minute manual research rule** -- research 3-4 records manually first, then automate that exact process

## Prompt Template

```
Visit /company_domain and answer: [SPECIFIC QUESTION]

Rules:
- Only use information found on the website
- If not found, output "purple"
- Output format: [text/number/true-false/URL]

Example outputs:
- "Series B, $25M from Sequoia"
- "purple"
```

## Credit Optimization

- Simple yes/no questions: 1 credit
- Deeper analysis: 2-3 credits
- Iterate in the builder (free) before running on full table
- Add conditional run: only run Claygent on rows where standard enrichment left gaps
- Never use Claygent for data available via standard providers (email, phone, revenue)

## Common Use Cases

1. **Free trial detection** -- "Does this company offer a free trial?"
2. **Case study extraction** -- "Find customer case studies and extract metrics"
3. **Hiring signals** -- "Check careers page for open [role] positions"
4. **Competitor mentions** -- "Does this company mention [competitor] on their site?"
5. **Content topics** -- "What are the last 3 blog post topics?"
6. **Technology signals** -- "Does the website use [specific tool]?"

## Examples

**Example 1:** "I want to know if my prospects offer a free trial"
--> Claygent column with prompt: "Visit /domain. Does this company offer a free trial, demo, or trial period? Output 'Yes' or 'No'. If unclear, output 'purple'." Cost: 1 credit/row. Model: Claygent Neon.

**Example 2:** "I need to find recent funding rounds for 500 companies"
--> Claygent column: "Search Google for '/company_name funding round'. What is the most recent funding round? Output format: '[Series], $[Amount] from [Investor]'. If nothing found, output 'purple'." Cost: 2 credits/row.

**Example 3:** "I want personalized icebreakers based on their latest blog post"
--> Step 1: Claygent to extract latest blog topic (1 credit). Step 2: Separate AI column (GPT-4 Mini) to write icebreaker from that topic (1 credit). Never combine both in one column.
