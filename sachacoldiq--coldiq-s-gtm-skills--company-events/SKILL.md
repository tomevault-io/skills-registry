# Company Event Signals

Company events are firmographic triggers from the signal taxonomy (Category V). They indicate organizational change, new priorities, and buying windows. These include M&A activity, geographic expansion, product launches, leadership changes, and public market events.

## Reference Files

- Read `{SKILL_BASE}/resources/signal-taxonomy.md` for Category V: Firmographic Triggers (15 triggers)
- Read `{SKILL_BASE}/resources/buying-signals.md` for expansion signal (#5 by purchase correlation)

## 15 Firmographic Triggers

### Financial Events
1. **IPO** - Major transformation, compliance needs, new reporting requirements
2. **Funding raised** - See funding sub-skill for detailed playbook
3. **Financial reports released** - Public data on priorities and challenges

### M&A Activity
4. **Acquired another company** - Integration pain, tech consolidation, new headcount
5. **Was acquired** - Leadership change, vendor review, stack consolidation
6. **Merged** - Duplicate tools, standardization mandate, new org structure

### Growth Signals
7. **Hypergrowth** - Scale pain, process breaks, need for automation
8. **Started hiring** - See hiring sub-skill for detailed playbook
9. **Headquarters move** - New market, possible rebrand, vendor re-evaluation
10. **New locations opened** - Geographic expansion, regional needs

### Product and Marketing
11. **New product released** - GTM needs, new team formation
12. **New feature released** - Engineering investment signals priorities
13. **New integration released** - Tech ecosystem expansion, partnership signals
14. **Impactful marketing move** - Budget available, growth mindset
15. **Competitor made impactful move** - Competitive pressure, urgency to respond

## Scoring by Event Type

| Event | Points | SLA | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| Acquisition (acquirer) | 35 | < 72h | Integration creates tool needs |
| Was acquired | 40 | < 72h | Vendor review inevitable |
| Merger | 40 | < 72h | Stack consolidation |
| IPO | 50 | < 72h | Compliance + transformation |
| New location | 25 | This week | Regional expansion needs |
| HQ move | 20 | This week | Possible vendor switch |
| New product launch | 30 | < 72h | GTM team forming |
| Competitor move | 15 | This week | Urgency catalyst |

## Detection Sources

- **Press releases** - TechCrunch, PR Newswire, company blogs
- **Crunchbase / PitchBook** - M&A data, funding
- **LinkedIn** - Leadership announcements, company updates
- **Clay enrichment** - Auto-detect company news events
- **Google Alerts** - Set up for target accounts
- **SEC filings** - IPO, financial reports (public companies)

## Key Rules

- Company events are public information - no privacy concerns
- M&A signals have a 2-6 week optimal outreach window after announcement
- IPO = highest-scoring company event (50pts) due to transformation scope
- Stack with leadership changes (job-changes skill) for compound scoring
- Always reference the business challenge the event creates, not the event itself

## Examples

Example 1: "A target account just acquired a company"
-> 35pts signal. Outreach within 72h. Reference integration pain (duplicate tools, process alignment, new headcount onboarding). Position your solution as the consolidation layer. Check for new leadership hires post-acquisition

Example 2: "Monitor M&A activity in my target market"
-> Clay: Set up Crunchbase/news monitoring on ICP accounts, filter for acquisition/merger events, enrich with decision-maker contacts, trigger SDR alerts for qualified matches within 72h

Example 3: "A company just opened a new office in EMEA"
-> 25pts signal. Reference regional expansion challenges (compliance, local processes, team coordination). Lighter touch - this week SLA. Stack with any hiring signals for the new location
