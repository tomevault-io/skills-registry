# Job Change Signals

Job changes are the #2 buying signal by purchase correlation. New leaders have a mandate for early wins, vendor amnesty period, and budget air cover. Response rate is 3x higher than cold outreach, with peak engagement at days 14-45.

## Reference Files

- Read `{SKILL_BASE}/resources/timing/job-change-tracking.md` for Clay setup and tracking methods
- Read `{SKILL_BASE}/resources/buying-signals.md` for signal ranking and benchmarks

## Why Job Changes Work

- **3x higher response rate** vs cold outreach
- **Peak engagement: days 14-45** after the change (vendor amnesty period)
- New leaders actively build their stack in first 90 days
- Trust already established with former champions
- Champion job change to target account = 75 points (Tier 1 signal)

## Clay Setup - Two Methods

### Method 1: Monitor Existing Table
1. Go to Actions > Monitor for Job Changes
2. Specify the LinkedIn URL column
3. Save and run - new row created for each detected change

### Method 2: Create New Tracking Table
1. +Create New > Table > Track Job Changes
2. Include "Person LinkedIn URL" for future monitoring
3. Include "Company LinkedIn URL" to detect if they already changed

### Historical vs Future
- **Historical**: Include both Person + Company LinkedIn URLs - checks if contact already changed
- **Future**: Only Person LinkedIn URL - monitors ongoing changes

## Timing Framework

| Window | Multiplier | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Days 0-13 | Too early | Monitor only - they are still settling in |
| Days 14-45 | Peak (1.5x) | Immediate outreach - vendor amnesty window |
| Days 46-90 | Good (1.0x) | Standard outreach - still building stack |
| Days 90+ | Declining (0.7x) | Lower priority - stack likely set |

## Outreach Template

```
Hey congrats on the new role at {{company}}.

As you are taking over {{department}}, curious how you are
currently handling {{relevant_problem}}?

We helped {{similar_company}} with exactly that.
```

## Key Rules

- Do NOT mention you tracked their job change ("I saw you moved to...")
- Reference the role/department naturally, not the signal itself
- Former champions get AE-owned outreach (warm relationship)
- New contacts at target accounts get SDR sequence
- Stack with other signals for compound scoring: job change (75pts) + website visit (50pts) = Hot

## Examples

Example 1: "Track when my past customers change jobs"
-> Set up Clay historical tracking with Person + Company LinkedIn URLs, filter to ICP companies, trigger AE outreach within 24h

Example 2: "Someone just started as VP Sales at a target account"
-> Day 14-45 window = peak timing. Send congratulations + reference relevant problem for their new role. AE owns if former champion, SDR if new contact

Example 3: "Build a job change signal workflow in Clay"
-> Create tracking table with Person LinkedIn URLs, add enrichment columns (new company, title, start date), filter ICP match, calculate days-since-change, route to Slack alerts for day 14+ changes
