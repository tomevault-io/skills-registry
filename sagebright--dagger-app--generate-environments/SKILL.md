# Generate Daggerheart Environments

Create mechanically sound, narratively rich environments for the `daggerheart_environments` table. Follows the Daggerheart Homebrew Kit v1.0 creation order with structural validation.

## Creation Order

Execute these steps sequentially. Each step depends on the previous.

### Step 1: Tier + Difficulty

Determine tier (1-4) and difficulty from Improvised Statistics table (see below). Difficulty sets the baseline for feature thresholds and damage dice.

### Step 2: Type

Choose one: **Exploration** | **Social** | **Traversal** | **Event**

| Type | Focus | Example |
|------|-------|---------|
| Exploration | Discovering, investigating, navigating unknown spaces | Fungal Cavern, Sunken Ruin |
| Social | Negotiation, intrigue, relationships, politics | Imperial Court, Outpost Town |
| Traversal | Movement through hazardous terrain, journey-focused | Blighted Mire, Mountain Pass |
| Event | Time-bound occurrences, festivals, battles, rituals | Siege, Harvest Festival |

### Step 3: Impulses

Write 2 impulses (text[] array). These are the environment's behavioral drives -- what it "wants" to do to the PCs. Use active, threatening verbs.

**Pattern from SRD:** `"Drive the desperate to certain doom"`, `"seduce rivals with promises of power and comfort"`, `"Justify and perpetuate imperial rule"`

### Step 4: Features (with Throughline)

Generate 3-6 features as JSONB array. Each feature object:

```json
{
  "name": "Feature Name",
  "desc": "Mechanical description with roll types, outcomes, and consequences.",
  "type": "Passive | Action | Reaction",
  "fear_cost": 0,
  "gm_questions": ["Evocative question for the GM?", "Second question?"]
}
```

**Feature Ordering Rules:**
1. Passive features first, then Action, then Reaction
2. Categories may be omitted (HALLOWED TEMPLE has no Actions; ABANDONED GROVE has no Reactions)
3. Minimum 3 features, maximum 6
4. At least 1 feature must have `fear_cost >= 1`

**Feature Counts by Tier:**

| Tier | Typical Features | Passives | Actions | Reactions |
|------|-----------------|----------|---------|-----------|
| 1 | 3-5 | 2-3 | 0-1 | 1-2 |
| 2 | 4-5 | 2-3 | 0-2 | 1-2 |
| 3 | 4-6 | 2-3 | 1-2 | 1-2 |
| 4 | 5-6 | 2-3 | 1-2 | 1-2 |

**Fear Costs:**
- Passive features: always `fear_cost: 0`
- Action features: `fear_cost: 0` or `fear_cost: 1` (spend a Fear to activate)
- Reaction features: `fear_cost: 0` or `fear_cost: 1` (triggered on results with Fear)

**Asymmetric Design:** Environments are adversarial -- they challenge PCs. Features should pressure, tempt, threaten, or constrain. Even "helpful" features (like A Place of Healing) come with conditions or trade-offs.

**Throughline:** After writing features, compose a 1-2 sentence `throughline` (stored in `throughline` column) that captures the dramatic question the environment poses. This is the narrative thread connecting all features.

Example: "Can the party resist the gravitational pull of imperial power long enough to accomplish their mission, or will the court's seductions compromise their purpose?"

### Step 5: Potential Adversaries

List 3-6 adversary names (text[] array) appropriate for the tier and type. These are suggestions, not strict requirements.

**Soft validation only:** Check that adversary names plausibly exist at this tier. Do NOT validate against the adversaries table row-by-row -- generated environments may reference adversaries not yet in the DB.

### Step 6: Description

Write a 2-4 sentence description. This is the environment's "read-aloud" text -- evocative, sensory, and atmospheric.

## Improvised Statistics by Tier

Reference table from Daggerheart Homebrew Kit v1.0 pp.3-4, 15, 18-20.

| Tier | Difficulty | Damage Dice | Thresholds (Minor/Major/Severe) | HP Range | Stress |
|------|-----------|-------------|--------------------------------|----------|--------|
| 1 | 10-13 | d6-d8 | 3/7/13 | 4-8 | 2-3 |
| 2 | 12-16 | d8-d10 | 5/11/17 | 6-14 | 3-5 |
| 3 | 15-19 | d10-d12 | 7/15/21 | 10-20 | 4-6 |
| 4 | 18-23 | d12-d20 | 9/19/27 | 14-30 | 5-8 |

**Note:** Environment difficulty values for features that require rolls should reference the difficulty column (not thresholds, which are for adversaries). Use damage dice when a feature deals damage.

## Batch Generation

Generate multiple environments per invocation. Default batch size is **5**. The user may request fewer (e.g., "generate 2 environments").

### Count

Ask the user how many environments to generate during the initial conversation. If unspecified, default to 5.

### Diversity Strategy

Auto-diversify **type** within the batch while keeping the user's chosen **tier** constant. Spread across environment types to fill coverage gaps:

- If generating 4-5: aim for all 4 types (Exploration, Social, Traversal, Event), with extras doubling up on the type with fewest existing entries
- If generating fewer: prioritize types with zero coverage at the chosen tier
- If the user specified a type, generate all entries of that type but vary impulses, features, and thematic identity
- Query the Coverage Gaps section (below) to inform type selection

### Per-Entry Creation

Run the full 6-step creation order independently for each entry. Each environment gets its own name, type, impulses, features, throughline, adversaries, and description. Ensure no duplicate names within the batch or against existing DB entries.

## Structural Invariants

These rules must hold for every generated environment:

1. **Feature ordering:** Passive -> Action -> Reaction (categories may be omitted, never reordered)
2. **Feature counts:** 3-6 features per environment
3. **Fear cost rules:** Passives = 0; Actions/Reactions = 0 or 1
4. **Impulse count:** Exactly 2 impulses
5. **Description length:** 2-4 sentences
6. **Adversary format:** Array of name strings, 3-6 entries
7. **Type:** One of Exploration, Social, Traversal, Event
8. **Tier + Difficulty alignment:** Difficulty must fall within the Improvised Statistics range for the tier
9. **PC-targeting:** Features target PCs, not NPCs or abstract entities
10. **Throughline coherence:** Throughline reflects the dramatic tension created by the features

## Validation Checklist

Before presenting the environment for review, verify all 13 items:

| # | Check | Rule |
|---|-------|------|
| 1 | Feature ordering | Passive -> Action -> Reaction (no reordering) |
| 2 | Difficulty range | Within Improvised Statistics bounds for tier |
| 3 | Damage dice | Any damage in features uses tier-appropriate dice |
| 4 | Impulse count | Exactly 2 impulses |
| 5 | Description length | 2-4 sentences |
| 6 | Adversary format | Array of 3-6 name strings (soft check -- names plausible for tier) |
| 7 | Feature fields | Every feature has: name, desc, type, fear_cost, gm_questions |
| 8 | Feature types | Each type is Passive, Action, or Reaction |
| 9 | source_book | Set to `'Generated'` |
| 10 | Name uniqueness | No duplicate of existing environment name in DB |
| 11 | Throughline coherence | Throughline reflects the dramatic tension of the features |
| 12 | PC-targeting | Features target PCs, not abstract entities |
| 13 | Fear-cost appropriateness | Passives = 0; at least 1 feature with fear_cost >= 1 |

## Human Review Protocol

After generation and validation, present all environments for batch review.

### Present

1. **Summary table** of all entries:

| # | Name | Type | Tier | Difficulty | Features | Validation |
|---|------|------|------|-----------|----------|------------|
| 1 | ... | ... | ... | ... | 3-6 | Pass/Fail |

2. **Full stat block** for each entry as formatted JSON (name, tier, type, difficulty, impulses, features, potential_adversaries, description, throughline)
3. **Throughline** highlighted separately for each entry
4. **Validation checklist** results per entry (all 13 items, pass/fail)

### Options

- **Approve All** -- insert all entries
- **Approve Selected** -- specify entry numbers to insert (e.g., "approve 1, 3, 5")
- **Revise** -- specify entry number and which fields to change; re-validate after
- **Reject** -- specify entries to discard

## Insert Workflow

After human approval, insert each approved environment into the database. Repeat steps 1-3 for each approved entry.

### Step 1: Compute searchable_text

Concatenate for full-text search:

```
searchable_text = name + ' ' + description + ' ' + impulses.join(' ') + ' ' + features.map(f => f.name + ' ' + f.desc + ' ' + f.gm_questions.join(' ')).join(' ')
```

### Step 2: Generate Embedding

Call the `embed` Edge Function to generate the embedding vector:

```sql
-- Via Supabase Edge Function (not direct SQL)
-- POST to: {SUPABASE_URL}/functions/v1/embed
-- Body: { "input": searchable_text }
-- Returns: { "embedding": [float array] }
```

### Step 3: Insert via execute_sql

Use `execute_sql` (not `apply_migration` -- this is content data, not schema):

```sql
INSERT INTO daggerheart_environments (
  name, tier, type, description, impulses, difficulty,
  potential_adversaries, features, throughline,
  searchable_text, embedding, source_book
) VALUES (
  'ENVIRONMENT NAME',
  1,                              -- tier
  'Exploration',                  -- type
  'Description text...',          -- description
  ARRAY['Impulse 1', 'Impulse 2'],
  12,                             -- difficulty
  ARRAY['Adversary 1', 'Adversary 2', 'Adversary 3'],
  $features_json$::jsonb[],      -- features array
  'Throughline text...',          -- throughline
  'computed searchable text...',  -- searchable_text
  '[embedding vector]'::vector,   -- embedding
  'Generated'                     -- source_book
);
```

### Step 4: Report Results

After all approved entries are inserted, present a summary:

| # | Name | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | ... | Inserted / Skipped / Failed |

## Coverage Gaps (Current)

Query to check current coverage:

```sql
SELECT tier, type, COUNT(*) as count
FROM daggerheart_environments
GROUP BY tier, type
ORDER BY tier, type;
```

**Priority gaps to fill:**
- Social T3: 0 environments
- Traversal T3: 0 environments
- All T2 types: only 1 each
- All T3 types: 0-2 each

## Exemplar Query

Pull a real environment as a structural reference:

```sql
SELECT name, tier, type, difficulty, impulses, features, throughline, description, potential_adversaries
FROM daggerheart_environments
WHERE source_book = 'Daggerheart Core Rulebook'
ORDER BY tier, type
LIMIT 1;
```
