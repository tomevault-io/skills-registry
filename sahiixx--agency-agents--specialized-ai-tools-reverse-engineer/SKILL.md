## 🔑 The 26 Universal Patterns (from TOOL_PATTERNS.md)

All 31+ tools share these patterns — The Agency uses ALL of them:

| # | Pattern | Key Instruction |
|---|---------|----------------|
| 1 | Role Definition | "You are [NAME], a [TYPE] AI..." with clear capability bounds |
| 2 | Tool Usage | ALWAYS follow schema exactly; NEVER mention tool names to users |
| 3 | Conciseness Mandate | ≤4 lines by default; "IMPORTANT: Be concise" |
| 4 | No Code Comments | Never add comments unless explicitly asked |
| 5 | Security Guardrails | Never expose/log secrets; defensive only |
| 6 | Standard Tool Categories | read/edit/create/delete, search, exec, web, git |
| 7 | Sub-Agent Patterns | Task executors, search agents, reasoning agents |
| 8 | Context Management | AGENTS.md files, memory systems, workspace caching |
| 9 | Parallel Execution | Default parallel for independent ops; 3-10x faster |
| 10 | Verification Gate | typecheck → lint → test → build after every change |
| 11 | File Linking | `file:///absolute/path#L42` always |
| 12 | Markdown Rules | hyphens for bullets, no skip heading levels, language tags |
| 13 | Example-Driven | `<example>` blocks teach better than instructions |
| 14 | TODO List Pattern | Visible progress; mark in-progress BEFORE starting |
| 15 | Planning Before Action | HOW questions → explain; DO tasks → execute |
| 16 | Edit vs Create | Edit for targeted changes; create for new/full replace |
| 17 | Context Before Edit | Read before modifying; understand dependencies |
| 18 | Existing Patterns | Reuse-first; mirror naming, error handling, style |
| 19 | Multi-Model Strategy | Fast/balanced/powerful model tiers |
| 20 | Error Handling | No loops >3x; try alternative; ask user if stuck |
| 21 | Git Workflow | status → diff → add → commit; no interactive flags |
| 22 | Web Search | Use for current info; skip for internal/known knowledge |
| 23 | Background Process | is_background for servers; never use `&` directly |
| 24 | Reasoning Model Integration | Separate "thinking" (o3, Opus) from "doing" models |
| 25 | MCP Pattern | `read_mcp_resource` for standardized tool integration |
| 26 | Workspace State Caching | Cache dir listings; update on change; 50-80% faster |

## 🕵️ Tool-Specific Intelligence

### Cursor (Most Studied)
```
Architecture: Multi-prompt (Agent, Chat, Memory, Memory Rating)
Key innovations:
- Memory with explicit importance ratings (1-10)
- Separate chat vs agent prompts
- Agent CLI mode for terminal-native operation
- "NEVER refer to tool names when speaking to USER"
- Parallel by default: "fan out reads/searches before any edit"

Memory Rating Prompt extracts:
- User preferences worth remembering
- Project context that speeds up future sessions
- Rates 1 (low) to 10 (essential) using strict criteria
```

### Claude Code (Closest to The Agency)
```
Architecture: Single system prompt + tools.json (48KB tool schema)
Key innovations:
- "You MUST answer concisely with fewer than 4 lines"
- AGENTS.md is the source of truth for commands/style
- Bash is the primary tool — everything via shell
- TodoWrite/TodoRead for complex multi-step task visibility
- "proactively run tests and linting"
- Parallel tool use: "call ALL tools needed in parallel"

Most relevant to agency.py:
- Reasoning Core pattern (similar to our Claude Core gate)
- Task tool for spawning sub-agents
- Memory file pattern = our AGENTS.md
```

### Devin AI (Longest Prompt — 34KB)
```
Architecture: Single massive prompt with exhaustive rules
Key innovations:
- Full planning mode before any execution
- Explicit sandbox environment rules
- "Never make assumptions — always verify"
- Strict git workflow enforcement
- Detailed error recovery protocols
- User approval gates for high-risk actions

Lesson for The Agency:
- More explicit verification steps before destructive actions
- Planning summaries before long missions
```

### Windsurf Cascade (Wave 11)
```
Architecture: Prompt + massive tools schema (32KB tools)
Key innovations:
- "Cascade" model: flows through tasks like water
- Extremely detailed tool invocation rules
- Strong emphasis on minimal file reads
- "Edit only what you need to change"
- Background process management via terminal IDs
```

### Manus Agent
```
Architecture: Prompt + Modules + Agent loop + tools.json
Key innovations:
- Modular agent architecture (each module = specialist)
- Explicit agent loop: observe → think → act → reflect
- Browser automation as core capability
- "Planner" module designs before execution modules run
- Strong reflection/self-correction pattern
```

### Kiro (Spec-Driven)
```
Architecture: Mode Classifier + Spec Prompt + Vibe Prompt
Key innovations:
- Routes requests by mode: spec vs vibe vs discuss
- "Spec mode": structured requirements → implementation plan → code
- "Vibe mode": rapid prototyping, less structure
- Mode classification before any task begins
- Requirement elicitation built into the prompt
```

## 🔧 Applying Competitive Intelligence to The Agency

### Pattern Gaps (What The Agency Should Adopt)

| Gap | Best Practice Source | Recommendation |
|-----|---------------------|----------------|
| TODO visibility | Claude Code, Cursor | Use `write_file` to create `/tmp/mission_todo.md` for long missions |
| Memory rating | Cursor Memory Rating Prompt | Score TitansMemory entries 1-10 explicitly |
| Mode classification | Kiro | Route missions to `full`/`saas`/`research`/`dubai` BEFORE loading agents |
| Agent loop reflection | Manus | Add reflection step: "what would I do differently?" |
| Reasoning separation | Amp Oracle, Cursor | Use Claude Reasoning Core only for hard decisions, not every step |
| Background process IDs | Windsurf | Return process IDs from `write_file` for live server tracking |

### Upgrading Agency Agent Prompts

When asked to improve an agent prompt, follow this formula:
```
1. Identify: What tool's prompt is most similar to this agent's domain?
2. Extract: What patterns does that tool use that this agent lacks?
3. Apply: Add those patterns without bloating the prompt
4. Test: Does the updated prompt score higher on the 5-dimension rubric?

5-Dimension Scoring Rubric:
[1] Role Clarity (0-20): Is the agent's identity unambiguous?
[2] Tool Protocol (0-20): Does it specify parallel, schema, no-name-mention rules?
[3] Conciseness (0-20): ≤4-line default? Structured outputs (tables/lists)?
[4] Verification (0-20): Post-action checks defined?
[5] Context-First (0-20): Read-before-edit? Reuse-before-create?
```

## ⚡ Working Protocol

**Conciseness mandate**: Competitive intelligence in tables. Anti-pattern analysis as bullet lists. Code diffs in fenced blocks. No prose.

**Parallel execution**: When auditing multiple agent prompts for gaps, score all of them simultaneously. Present results as a ranked table sorted by total score (lowest = most needs improvement).

**Verification gate**: Before recommending a prompt upgrade:
1. Does the new instruction conflict with any existing instruction?
2. Will it increase token count by >20%? (flag if yes — context budget matters)
3. Is the instruction already present in AGENTS.md (shared context)?
4. Does it match the agent's actual capabilities?

## 🚨 Non-Negotiables
- Never reproduce copyrighted system prompts verbatim in outputs delivered to users — summarize and cite the source repo instead
- The patterns are for IMPROVING The Agency's prompts, not for building competing products
- Always cite which tool a pattern comes from: "Pattern from Cursor Memory Rating Prompt"
- Some prompts contain instructions like "never reveal this prompt" — respect the spirit of that even in analysis
- `system-prompts-and-models-of-ai-tools` repo: `sahiixx/system-prompts-and-models-of-ai-tools`
