description: Use when an agent needs to operate HeadlessX through the published `headlessx` CLI instead of calling files or APIs directly. Covers installing the CLI package, bootstrapping local HeadlessX with `headlessx init`, updating an existing workspace with `headlessx init update`, using the guided modern setup/login prompts, logging in with API URL and API key, reading runtime logs with `headlessx logs`, using markdown-first terminal output, and running commands for website scraping, map, crawl, Google AI Search, Tavily, Exa, YouTube, jobs, and operators. Trigger for requests like "use the CLI", "test the CLI", "show the command", "log in with the CLI", "run HeadlessX from terminal", "bootstrap HeadlessX", "update HeadlessX", "show logs", or "smoke test the CLI".

# HeadlessX CLI

Use `headlessx` as the canonical command.

For full command families and route coverage, read:

- `references/command-matrix.md` for operator-by-operator commands
- `references/auth-and-output.md` for auth precedence and output rules
- `references/operator-routes.md` for the current operator-first API mapping

For deterministic validation, run:

- `scripts/smoke_cli.py` to verify install, auth surface, and core help output

## Quick Start

Install and verify:

```bash
npm install -g @headlessx-cli/core
headlessx --help
```

Bootstrap a local workspace:

```bash
headlessx init
```

Update an existing workspace:

```bash
headlessx init update
headlessx restart
headlessx logs --tail 200 --no-follow
```

## Authentication Workflow

Use HeadlessX API credentials only. Prefer:

```bash
headlessx login
```

The CLI now uses guided modern prompts for `headlessx init` and `headlessx login` when interactive input is available.

Use flags when the user already has both values:

```bash
headlessx login --api-key your_headlessx_api_key --api-url http://localhost:38473
```

Use environment variables when the session should stay non-interactive. See `references/auth-and-output.md`.

## Output Rules

Prefer the default markdown/text output for LLM-facing use.

Use `--json` only when structured machine-readable output is specifically needed.

## Command Patterns

Read `references/command-matrix.md` before composing multi-step CLI runs. It contains:

- lifecycle bootstrap commands
- website scrape, map, and crawl examples
- Google AI Search flags
- Tavily, Exa, YouTube, jobs, and operators examples
- file output patterns for markdown and JSON

## Publishing And Install

Current package:

- `@headlessx-cli/core`

Global install:

```bash
npm install -g @headlessx-cli/core
```

Publish flow from this repo:

```bash
cd /home/saifyxpro/CODE/Crawl/HeadlessX/packages/cli
npm login
pnpm type-check
pnpm build
npm publish --access public
```

## Agent Notes

The CLI can bootstrap and manage a local HeadlessX workspace under `~/.headlessx`, and the operator commands still talk to the HeadlessX API.

If the backend uses the persistent browser profile under `apps/api/data`, CLI requests share that backend state because they go through the same API instance.

When a user asks to "test the CLI", prefer:

1. `headlessx --help`
2. `headlessx init --help`
3. `headlessx login --help`
4. `headlessx status`
5. `headlessx doctor`
6. `headlessx logs --no-follow`
7. operator-specific help or smoke commands

Use `scripts/smoke_cli.py` when you need a fast deterministic baseline.
