# Session Token Analysis

Analyse Claude Code session logs for token usage efficiency, cache performance, and context growth patterns.

## Overview

This skill parses JSONL session logs from `~/.claude/projects/` and produces a detailed efficiency report covering per-session metrics, cross-session comparisons, and actionable recommendations.

## When to Use

- After a long coding session to review token spend
- When sessions feel slow or expensive and you want data
- To compare efficiency across recent sessions
- To decide when to use `/compact` more aggressively
- To identify patterns in tool use and context growth

## How to Run

Run the analysis script. By default it analyses the 5 most recent sessions:

```bash
python3 skills/session-token-analysis/scripts/analyze_sessions.py
```

To analyse a different number of sessions:

```bash
python3 skills/session-token-analysis/scripts/analyze_sessions.py --sessions 10
```

To analyse a specific session file:

```bash
python3 skills/session-token-analysis/scripts/analyze_sessions.py --file ~/.claude/projects/some-project/session.jsonl
```

## What It Reports

### Per-Session Metrics

| Metric               | Description                                                                     |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Session overview     | Start time, end time, duration, model, project directory                        |
| Effective input      | cache_read + cache_creation + uncached input (real context processed)           |
| Token breakdown      | Cache read, cache creation, uncached input shown separately with cost weighting |
| Estimated cost       | Per-category cost breakdown using model-specific API pricing                    |
| Cache hit rate       | cache_read / effective_input \* 100                                             |
| Turn count           | Number of assistant messages (API calls)                                        |
| Avg context/turn     | Average effective input per turn (real context window size)                     |
| Tool use count       | Content blocks with type: "tool_use"                                            |
| Tool-to-turn ratio   | Tool uses / turns                                                               |
| Context growth curve | Effective input at 1st, middle, and last turn + peak context and peak turn      |
| Compaction events    | Detected auto-compaction (>50% context drop between consecutive turns)          |

### Cross-Session Comparison

Side-by-side table of all sessions with duration, effective input, cache rates, turns, peak context, growth, and estimated cost.

### Efficiency Recommendations

Based on the data, the script flags:

- **High estimated cost (>$5):** Identifies biggest cost driver, suggests model selection and compaction
- **Low cache hit rate (<50%):** Review prompt structure or use `/compact`
- **High context growth (>5x peak):** Uses peak context (not last turn) to catch growth hidden by compaction
- **High turn count (>60):** Shows cost-per-turn to illustrate the compounding effect
- **High tool-to-turn ratio (>3):** Potential inefficiency from excessive tool calling
- **High avg output tokens/turn (>2000):** Expensive turns, outputs could be more targeted
- **Large context without compaction (>100K):** Context never compacted despite exceeding 100K tokens

## Technical Details

- **No external dependencies** — uses only Python standard library
- **Input format:** JSONL files with `message` field containing role, usage, content, and timestamp
- **Output format:** ASCII tables to stdout
- **Session discovery:** Finds `.jsonl` files in `~/.claude/projects/` sorted by modification time

## Key Concepts

### Cache Hit Rate

Higher is better. When Claude reads the same context repeatedly, cached reads are cheaper than fresh processing. A rate above 70% is good; below 50% suggests context is changing too often.

### Context Growth

Measured as `peak_effective / first_effective` — the peak context size relative to the starting context. Uses peak rather than last turn to catch growth that was masked by auto-compaction. Values above 5x indicate the context window is growing fast and `/compact` should be used. Values above 10x suggest the session should have been split.

### Compaction Events

Detected when effective input drops by more than 50% between consecutive turns. Shows the before/after context size and reduction percentage. Late compaction (after context exceeds 100K+) is a major cost driver — proactive `/compact` at 60-80K is far cheaper.

### Estimated Cost

Calculated using model-specific API pricing (auto-detected from session logs):

- **Opus 4:** $15/M input, $75/M output, $18.75/M cache write, $1.875/M cache read
- **Sonnet 4.5:** $3/M input, $15/M output, $3.75/M cache write, $0.30/M cache read
- **Haiku 4.5:** $0.80/M input, $4/M output, $1/M cache write, $0.08/M cache read

Cache creation (writing new context to cache) is the most expensive input category — 1.25x the base input price. High cache creation costs indicate frequent context changes or growth.
