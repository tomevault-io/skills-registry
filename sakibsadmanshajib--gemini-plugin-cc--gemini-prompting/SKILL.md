# Gemini Prompting Guide

## When to Use

Use this skill only to shape the prompt text before forwarding it to the `gemini-companion` runtime. Do not use it to do independent work, inspect the repository, or draft solutions.

## Model Selection

The default model is **`auto-gemini-3`**. Only override it when the action type has a clear reason to use a different tier.

### Action-based routing

| Action type | Examples | Recommended model |
|-------------|----------|-------------------|
| Deep reasoning / root-cause diagnosis | Multi-file bug investigation, security audit, architecture review | `pro` (`gemini-3.1-pro-preview`) |
| Complex implementation | Refactor across many files, design a new subsystem, write an algorithm | `pro` (`gemini-3.1-pro-preview`) |
| Standard code tasks | Fix a specific bug, implement a well-scoped feature, write tests | `auto-gemini-3` (default — omit `--model`) |
| Code review / adversarial review | `/gemini:review`, `/gemini:adversarial-review` | `auto-gemini-3` (default — omit `--model`) |
| Quick lookup / simple edit | One-liner fix, rename, trivial grep-and-replace | `flash` (`gemini-3-flash-preview`) |
| Latency-critical / high-volume | CI pre-check, tight feedback loop, batch summarisation | `flash-lite` (`gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview`) |
| Production-stable (no previews) | Workloads that must avoid preview model churn | `auto-gemini-2.5` |

### Decision rule

1. User explicitly named a model → use it, pass as `--model <name>`.
2. Task involves deep reasoning, complex multi-file implementation, or security analysis → use `--model pro`.
3. Task is a standard code fix, feature, or review → omit `--model` (defaults to `auto-gemini-3`).
4. User asked for speed or the task is trivially small → use `--model flash` or `--model flash-lite`.
5. User requires preview-free stability → use `--model auto-gemini-2.5`.

## Gemini Model Characteristics

- **Long context**: Gemini models handle up to 1M tokens of context. Lean into providing full file contents rather than snippets.
- **System instructions**: Gemini's primary steering mechanism. Place behavioral constraints, output format requirements, and role definitions in system instruction blocks.
- **Thinking**: Gemini models support configurable thinking budgets. Use `--thinking-budget` for complex reasoning tasks.
- **Grounding**: Gemini can use Google Search for grounding. For tasks requiring up-to-date information, mention this in the prompt.
- **Structured output**: Request JSON output by describing the schema in the prompt. Gemini follows schema instructions well when given clear examples.

## Prompt Structure

Use XML tags to structure prompts for clarity:

```xml
<role>
Define the persona and operating stance.
</role>

<task>
State what needs to be done. Be specific about inputs and expected outputs.
</task>

<context>
Provide repository context, file contents, error messages, or other relevant information.
</context>

<constraints>
List hard boundaries: what NOT to do, scope limits, safety rules.
</constraints>

<output_contract>
Define the exact output shape. Use JSON schema descriptions or examples.
</output_contract>
```

## Key Principles

1. **Be specific, not vague**: "Fix the null pointer in `auth.go:142`" beats "Fix the bug".
2. **Include output contracts**: Always specify what the response should look like.
3. **Provide full context**: Gemini handles long context well — give it complete files, not snippets.
4. **Use system instructions for behavior**: Role, tone, constraints go in system instruction blocks.
5. **One task per prompt**: Don't mix unrelated jobs. Split into separate runs.
6. **Include verification steps**: Ask Gemini to verify its own work before finalizing.
