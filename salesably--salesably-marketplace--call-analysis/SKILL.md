# Call Analysis

This skill analyzes sales call transcripts to extract strategic insights, capture action items, and assess opportunity health using the POWERFUL deal qualification framework.

## Objective

Transform raw call transcripts into structured, actionable summaries that capture key discussion points, identify next steps, and provide objective opportunity assessments.

## Analysis Structure

### 1. Next Steps
Clear action items extracted from the conversation.

**Format:**
- **Action**: What needs to happen
- **Owner**: Who is responsible (us or them)
- **Timeline**: When it needs to happen
- **Priority**: High/Medium/Low

**Example:**
```
1. [Us] Send proposal with pricing options - by Friday - High
2. [Them] Get budget approval from finance - by next week - High
3. [Us] Schedule demo with technical team - within 2 weeks - Medium
```

### 2. POWERFUL Framework Analysis

Extract insights for each dimension:

#### Pain
- What challenges or frustrations did they mention?
- Include direct quotes when available
- Note the severity and impact

#### Opportunity Cost
- What happens if they don't solve this?
- Any timelines or deadlines mentioned?
- Financial or business impact of inaction?

#### Wants, Needs, Desires
- What outcomes are they looking for?
- What does success look like to them?
- Any specific requirements or criteria?

#### Executive Level Influence
- Who else is involved in the decision?
- What's the approval process?
- Any stakeholder dynamics revealed?

#### Resources/Budget
- Was budget discussed?
- What's their expected investment range?
- Any competing priorities for funds?

#### Fear of Failure
- What concerns or objections came up?
- Past negative experiences mentioned?
- Risk factors they're worried about?

#### Unequivocal Trust
- How did they hear about us?
- Were they transparent and open?
- Any trust-building moments?

#### Little Things
- Communication preferences mentioned?
- Scheduling constraints?
- Personal details or rapport builders?

### 3. Key Discussion Points
Important topics that don't fit neatly into the framework:
- Technical requirements discussed
- Competitive mentions
- Timeline drivers
- Internal politics
- Integration needs

### 4. Opportunity Rating
Objective assessment of deal health.

**Rating Scale:**
- **0-40%**: Early stage, significant unknowns
- **40-60%**: Developing, some validation
- **60-80%**: Promising, strong signals
- **80-100%**: High confidence, clear path

**Qualitative Assessment:**
One paragraph explaining the rating with evidence from the call.

### 5. Potential Concerns
Red flags or issues that might hinder the deal:
- Unresolved objections
- Missing stakeholders
- Competitive threats
- Timeline misalignment
- Budget constraints
- Technical gaps

### 6. Strategic Suggestions
3-5 actionable recommendations based on the analysis:
- What to do next
- What to clarify
- Who else to engage
- How to address concerns
- Ways to accelerate the deal

## Transcript Quality Requirements

### Minimum Standards
- At least 5 minutes of substantive conversation
- Identifiable speakers (not just one-sided notes)
- Readable/parseable format
- Contains actual sales dialogue (not just administrative chat)

### Information to Flag
- When something is unclear or ambiguous
- When important context seems missing
- When speakers are hard to distinguish
- When audio quality affected transcription

## Analysis Guidelines

### Be Objective
- Report what was actually said, not what you wish was said
- Include both positive and negative signals
- Don't over-interpret vague statements
- Flag uncertainty when present

### Be Specific
- Use direct quotes when possible
- Include specific numbers, dates, names
- Reference specific moments in the conversation
- Avoid generic summaries

### Be Actionable
- Every insight should connect to a potential action
- Prioritize what matters for deal advancement
- Focus on what can be verified or addressed
- Highlight time-sensitive items

### Be Honest About Gaps
- Note what wasn't discussed that should have been
- Identify questions that weren't asked
- Flag POWERFUL dimensions with no information
- Suggest what to cover in the next conversation

## Output Format

When analyzing a call, produce:

### Call Summary Header
```
Call: [Prospect Name] - [Company]
Date: [Date of call]
Duration: [Approximate length]
Participants: [List of participants]
Stage: [Pipeline stage]
```

### Structured Analysis
1. **Next Steps**: Action items with owners and timelines
2. **POWERFUL Analysis**: Findings for each dimension
3. **Other Key Notes**: Important points outside framework
4. **Opportunity Rating**: Percentage and qualitative assessment
5. **Potential Concerns**: Red flags and risks
6. **Strategic Suggestions**: 3-5 actionable recommendations

### Information Gaps
- POWERFUL dimensions with insufficient information
- Questions that should be asked next
- Stakeholders not yet engaged

## Cross-References

- Feed extracted POWERFUL data into `powerful-framework` scorecard
- Use insights to inform `follow-up-emails` content
- Guide `multithread-outreach` based on stakeholder mentions
- Update `prospect-research` profiles with new information
- Inform `account-qualification` tier adjustments
