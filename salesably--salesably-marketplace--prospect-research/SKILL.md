**Daily Reality:**

**Company Context:**

## Knowledge Capsule Format

Create a condensed, actionable profile:

```
## [Name] - [Title] at [Company]

### Quick Facts
- Location: [City, Time Zone]
- Tenure: [X years at company, Y months in role]
- Background: [1-2 sentence career summary]

### Role Focus
[2-3 sentences on what they're responsible for and measured on]

### Recent Activity
- [Relevant recent event or news item]
- [Another relevant item]

### Connection Points
- [Mutual connection or shared context]
- [Common interest or background]

### Conversation Starters
1. [Specific talking point based on their interests]
2. [Reference to recent news or activity]
3. [Question about their priorities]

### Potential Pain Points
Based on role and industry:
- [Likely challenge #1]
- [Likely challenge #2]
- [Likely challenge #3]
```

## Research Sources

### Primary Sources
- LinkedIn profile and activity
- Company website (about page, team page)
- Professional bio from conferences or publications
- Personal website or blog

### Secondary Sources
- News articles mentioning the prospect
- Company press releases
- Industry publications
- Podcast appearances or interviews

### Social Intelligence
- Twitter/X presence
- LinkedIn posts and comments
- Published articles or thought leadership
- Conference presentations (SlideShare, YouTube)

## Research Process

### Step 1: Basic Profile (5 minutes)
1. Find LinkedIn profile
2. Capture basic info (title, company, location)
3. Note tenure and career history
4. Identify reporting structure

### Step 2: Deep Dive (10 minutes)
1. Review LinkedIn activity (posts, comments, shares)
2. Search for news mentions
3. Find any published content
4. Check for mutual connections

### Step 3: Synthesis (5 minutes)
1. Identify 2-3 key connection points
2. Draft conversation starters
3. Hypothesize likely pain points
4. Create knowledge capsule

## Personalization Guidelines

### What Makes Research Actionable

**Specific over generic:**
- Not: "They're a VP of Sales"
- But: "They've grown the sales team from 5 to 25 in 18 months"

**Recent over historical:**
- Not: "They worked at Salesforce"
- But: "They just posted about hitting 150% of quota last quarter"

**Relevant over interesting:**
- Not: "They went to Stanford"
- But: "They mentioned struggling with rep onboarding in a recent post"

### Red Flags to Note

- Very limited online presence (harder to personalize)
- Recent job change (may not be decision-maker yet)
- Negative company news (tread carefully)
- Previous bad experience with similar vendors

## Output Format

When researching a prospect, produce:

1. **Knowledge Capsule**: Condensed profile in standard format
2. **Research Confidence**: How complete is the picture (High/Medium/Low)
3. **Best Approach**: Recommended outreach strategy based on research
4. **Conversation Hooks**: 3-5 specific talking points
5. **Questions to Answer**: What we still need to learn

## Available Tools
