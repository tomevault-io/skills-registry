# MultiCloudJ End-to-End Feature Development

## Overview

Implements a new feature across the multicloudj SDK through structured phases: requirements gathering via user interview, cross-cloud research for semantic uniformity, client/driver API design, provider implementations, unit tests, and conformance tests with WireMock record/replay.

## Provider Isolation Principle

**CRITICAL:** Each provider implementation (AWS, GCP, Alibaba) is completely independent and must NEVER reference another provider in any way.

### The Rule

Providers are isolated islands that:
- Each independently implements the abstract driver contract (e.g., `AbstractBlobStore`, `AbstractDocstore`)
- Have NO knowledge of other provider implementations
- Have NO dependencies on other provider modules
- Have NO comparisons or references to other providers in code OR comments

### What This Means in Practice

**NEVER:**
- Import classes from another provider module (e.g., `AwsBlobStore` importing from `blob-gcp`)
- Add dependencies between provider modules in `pom.xml`
- Write comments like "Unlike GCP, AWS does X" or "Similar to Alibaba's approach"
- Write comments like "GCP handles this differently" or "AWS uses a different pattern"
- Copy code between providers with comments referencing the source
- Compare implementation approaches in javadoc or inline comments

**DO:**
- Each provider implements the driver contract independently
- Document WHY a provider does something based on that provider's SDK behavior
- Focus comments on the cloud provider's native SDK, not other multicloudj providers
- Let conformance tests verify behavioral parity, not implementation similarity

### Example: WRONG ❌

```java
// AWS implementation
@Override
protected PutObjectResponse doPutObject(PutObjectRequest request) {
    // Unlike GCP which uses resumable uploads, AWS uses multipart
    // Similar to how AliOss handles large objects
    return s3Client.putObject(...);
}
```

### Example: CORRECT ✅

```java
// AWS implementation
@Override
protected PutObjectResponse doPutObject(PutObjectRequest request) {
    // S3 automatically handles objects up to 5GB in a single PUT operation
    return s3Client.putObject(...);
}
```

### Why Provider Isolation Matters

1. **Maintainability:** Each provider evolves independently based on its cloud SDK changes
2. **Testability:** Provider tests don't break when other providers change
3. **Clarity:** Implementation decisions are based on the provider's SDK, not other providers
4. **Extensibility:** New providers can be added without touching existing ones
5. **Semantic Uniformity:** The driver contract (abstract class) defines the unified behavior, not cross-provider comparisons

The driver contract and conformance tests ensure all providers behave the same for the end user. Providers achieve this independently, not by copying or comparing with each other.

## When to Use

- Adding a new operation or capability to an existing service (blob, docstore, pubsub, sts)
- Adding a new service module end-to-end
- User says "add feature", "implement X operation", "support Y across providers"

## When NOT to Use

- Bug fixes to existing implementations (use systematic-debugging)
- Refactoring without behavior change
- Documentation-only changes (use docs-guides)

    M --> N
    N --> O([Done])
```

## Phase 1: User Interview

Gather requirements before any code. Ask the user:

1. **What service?** (blob, docstore, pubsub, sts, or new)
2. **What operation?** (e.g., "object versioning", "batch delete with filters", "topic dead-letter queue")
3. **What's the user-facing behavior?** (what should the end-user SDK call look like?)
4. **Which providers?** (AWS/GCP/Ali - default is all three)
5. **Are there known provider differences?** (the user may already know gotchas)
6. **Any constraints?** (backwards compatibility, performance, specific SDK versions)

Do NOT proceed until you have clear answers to at least questions 1-3.

## Phase 2: Cross-Cloud Research

Research how each cloud provider implements this feature natively. For each provider (AWS, GCP, Alibaba):

1. **Read the cloud SDK documentation** - understand the native API surface
2. **Identify the SDK classes/methods** that implement this feature
3. **Note semantic differences** between providers:
   - Different parameter names or types
   - Different behavior for edge cases (nulls, empty lists, limits)
   - Features supported by some providers but not others
   - Different error codes/conditions for the same failure

**Present findings to user as a comparison table:**

| Aspect | AWS | GCP | Alibaba |
|--------|-----|-----|---------|
| API method | `s3.putObjectRetention()` | `storage.objects().update()` | `oss.setBucketLifecycle()` |
| Supports X | Yes | Partial | No |
| Error on Y | 403 | 404 | 400 |

### Resolving Semantic Differences

If providers differ, present the user with options:

- **Option A: Lowest common denominator** - only expose what all providers support
- **Option B: Best-effort with capability flags** - expose all, throw `UnsupportedOperationException` where unavailable
- **Option C: Semantic translation** - map different provider behaviors to a unified model

Interview the user on which approach to take. The goal is **semantic uniformity for the end user** - they should not need to know which cloud they're running on.

## Phase 3: API Design

Design the cloud-agnostic API. This involves changes to the `-client` module:

### 3a. Request/Response Objects

Create in the client module's appropriate package:

```
{service}/{service}-client/src/main/java/com/salesforce/multicloudj/{service}/driver/
```

Follow existing patterns:
- Request objects use Builder pattern with `Builder` inner class
- Response objects are immutable with getters
- Use `@Getter` from Lombok where the module already uses it

### 3b. Abstract Driver Method

Add the abstract `do*` method to the abstract class (e.g., `AbstractBlobStore`):

```java
protected abstract {ResponseType} do{OperationName}({RequestType} request);
```

### 3c. Public Client Method

Add the public method to the client class (e.g., `BucketClient`):

```java
public {ResponseType} {operationName}({RequestType} request) {
    return multiCloudJLogger.traceOperation(
        "{operationName}",
        () -> blobStore.{operationName}(request)
    );
}
```

### 3d. Validation

Add validation rules to the validator class (e.g., `BlobStoreValidator`) if inputs need validation.

**Present the API design to the user for approval before implementing providers.**

## Phase 4: Provider Implementations

For each provider (aws, gcp, ali):

### 4a. Implement the `do*` Method

In the provider's main class (e.g., `AwsBlobStore`):

```java
@Override
protected {ResponseType} do{OperationName}({RequestType} request) {
    // 1. Transform multicloudj request → provider SDK request
    // 2. Call provider SDK
    // 3. Transform provider SDK response → multicloudj response
    // 4. Handle provider-specific exceptions via getException()
}
```

### 4b. Add Transformer Methods

In the provider's transformer class (e.g., `AwsTransformer`):
- `to{ProviderRequest}({MulticloudRequest})` - converts outgoing request
- `to{MulticloudResponse}({ProviderResponse})` - converts incoming response

### 4c. Exception Mapping

Update `ErrorCodeMapping` (or equivalent) if the new operation introduces new error conditions.

### 4d. Build and Verify

```bash
mvn clean install -DskipTests
mvn test -pl {service}/{service}-{provider}
```

## Phase 5: Unit Tests

Write unit tests that verify real behavior, not fake coverage.

### What Makes a Real Unit Test

- **Tests behavior, not implementation** - verify the output given an input
- **Mocks the cloud SDK client** (S3Client, Storage, etc.), NOT internal classes
- **Covers error paths** - exception mapping, validation failures, edge cases
- **Tests transformer logic** - correct field mapping between types

### What Is Fake Coverage (DO NOT WRITE)

- Tests that only verify a method was called without checking correctness
- Tests that pass null/empty and assert no exception (unless that's the contract)
- Tests that duplicate the implementation logic in assertions
- Tests with no meaningful assertions

### Run Unit Tests

```bash
mvn clean install -DskipTests
mvn test -pl {service}/{service}-aws -Dtest={TestClassName}
mvn test -pl {service}/{service}-gcp -Dtest={TestClassName}
```

## Phase 6: Conformance Tests

Conformance tests ensure all providers behave identically for the same operation.

### 6a. Abstract Conformance Test

Add test methods to the existing abstract IT class in the client module (e.g., `AbstractBlobStoreIT`):

```
{service}/{service}-client/src/test/java/.../Abstract{Service}StoreIT.java
```

Every conformance test must include both **positive** and **negative** scenarios:

- **Positive scenario**: Happy path — the operation succeeds with valid inputs and the result is correct
- **Negative scenario**: Error path — the operation fails gracefully with invalid inputs (e.g., nonexistent key, invalid parameters) and throws the expected exception

This ensures all providers handle both success and failure consistently.

### 6b. Run in Record Mode (Local with Credentials)

Record mode captures real HTTP interactions with the cloud provider.

**Ask the user for credentials:**

- **AWS:** `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`
- **GCP:** `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` (path to service account JSON)
- **Alibaba:** Handled separately on special machines - skip record mode for Ali and override in the Ali{Service}IT and add @Disabled so they are not executed.

**Only run the specific tests impacted by your change** - never record the entire IT suite. This keeps the PR minimal and avoids regenerating unrelated mapping files.

```bash
# AWS record - only the new/changed test method
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="{from_user}"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="{from_user}"
export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN="{from_user}"
mvn test -pl {service}/{service}-aws -Dtest="{Provider}{Service}StoreIT#{testMethodName}" -Drecord

# GCP record - only the new/changed test method
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="{path_from_user}"
mvn test -pl {service}/{service}-gcp -Dtest="{Provider}{Service}StoreIT#{testMethodName}" -Drecord
```

After recording:
- Verify new mapping files appear in `src/test/resources/mappings/`
- Verify no sensitive credentials leaked into mapping files
- **NEVER manually edit or create mapping files** - all mappings must be generated by WireMock recording. If stale files exist from a failed run, delete them and re-record.
- Commit the mapping files (they enable CI replay mode)

### 6c. Run in Replay Mode (CI - Default)

```bash
# No credentials needed - uses recorded WireMock stubs
mvn test -pl {service}/{service}-aws -Dtest="{Provider}{Service}StoreIT#{testMethodName}"
mvn test -pl {service}/{service}-gcp -Dtest="{Provider}{Service}StoreIT#{testMethodName}"
```

### 6d. Alibaba Conformance Tests

Write the abstract conformance test (it runs for all providers). The Ali-specific IT class extends it just like AWS/GCP, but recording happens on dedicated machines. The IT harness class already exists (e.g., `AliBlobStoreIT`) — do not attempt to record locally for Ali.

## Phase 7: Create Pull Request

After implementation and testing are complete, create a PR following MultiCloudJ conventions.

### 7a. Commit Changes

```bash
# Stage all changes
git add -A

# Create commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "{service}: {brief description of feature}

{Detailed description of what was changed and why}

- Added X to Y
- Updated Z for compatibility
- Tests: {description of tests added}
"
```

### 7b. Push Branch

```bash
# Push to origin
git push origin {branch-name}
```

### 7c. Create PR with Proper Title

**PR Title Format:** `{service}: {concise description}`

Examples:
- `sts: onboard proxy configurations for sts interface`
- `blob: add object versioning support`
- `docstore: implement batch delete with filters`
- `pubsub: add dead-letter queue configuration`

**PR Description Template:**

```markdown
## Summary
{1-2 sentence overview of the feature}

## Changes
- Added `{MethodName}` to `{ClassName}`
- Implemented {feature} for AWS, GCP, and Alibaba Cloud
- Added unit tests for {components}
- {If applicable} Added conformance tests with WireMock recording

## API Example
```java
// Show how users will call the new API
{ServiceClient} client = {ServiceClient}.builder("aws")
    .withRegion("us-west-2")
    .{newMethod}({parameters})
    .build();
```

## Testing
- Unit tests: `mvn test -pl {service}/{service}-{provider}`
- {If applicable} Conformance tests: recorded for AWS/GCP, replay mode verified

## Cross-Cloud Compatibility
- AWS: {describe implementation or limitations}
- GCP: {describe implementation or limitations}  
- Alibaba: {describe implementation or limitations}
```

### 7d. Verify PR Checklist

## File Checklist

For a feature added to an existing service (e.g., blob), you will typically touch:

| Layer | File | Change |

| Public API | `{service}-client/.../client/{Client}.java` | Add public method |
| Validator | `{service}-client/.../driver/{Validator}.java` | Add validation (if needed) |
| AWS impl | `{service}-aws/.../Aws{Store}.java` | Implement `do*` |
| AWS transformer | `{service}-aws/.../AwsTransformer.java` | Add conversion methods |

## Common Mistakes

- **Adding provider-specific types in client module** - the client module must never import AWS/GCP/Ali SDKs
- **Skipping the user interview** - assumptions about semantics lead to rework
- **Implementing before researching all three clouds** - discovering a provider can't support the feature after implementation is costly
- **Writing conformance tests that are provider-specific** - the abstract IT must work for ALL providers
- **Leaking credentials in WireMock recordings** - always verify mapping files before committing
- **Writing unit tests that only test happy path** - error mapping and edge cases are where bugs hide
- **Not running `mvn clean install -DskipTests` before running individual module tests** - inter-module dependencies need to be built first
- **Manually editing or creating WireMock mapping files** - all mappings must be produced by WireMock recording only. If a recording is stale or corrupt, delete it and re-record.
- **Recording the entire IT suite instead of just the new test** - only run the specific impacted test method in record mode to keep the PR diff minimal

## Red Flags - STOP and Reconsider

- You're implementing a provider without having researched how the other providers handle it
- You're adding a method to the abstract class without a corresponding public client method
- You're writing a conformance test that uses provider-specific setup
- You're importing `software.amazon.awssdk` or `com.google.cloud` in a `-client` module
- You're writing a unit test with no assertions about returned values or thrown exceptions
- You're running record mode without asking the user for credentials first
- You're about to manually edit a WireMock mapping JSON file - STOP: delete and re-record instead
- You're running the full IT class in record mode when only one test method is new/changed - use `#testMethodName` filter
- **You're writing a comment in a provider that references another provider** (e.g., "Unlike GCP", "Similar to AWS") - STOP: providers must be isolated
- **You're importing classes from another provider module** (e.g., `blob-aws` importing from `blob-gcp`) - STOP: providers cannot depend on each other
