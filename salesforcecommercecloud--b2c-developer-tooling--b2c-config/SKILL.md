# B2C Config Skill

The B2C CLI (`@salesforce/b2c-cli`) is a command-line tool for Salesforce B2C Commerce development. It provides commands organized by topic: `auth`, `code`, `webdav`, `sandbox`, `mrt`, `scapi`, `slas`, `ecdn`, `job`, `logs`, `sites`, `content`, `cip`, `setup`, and more. Use `b2c --help` or `b2c <topic> --help` for a full list.

> **Tip:** If `b2c` is not installed globally, use `npx @salesforce/b2c-cli` instead (e.g., `npx @salesforce/b2c-cli setup inspect`).

## Authentication

Most commands that interact with a B2C Commerce instance require authentication. The CLI supports several methods:

- **Client credentials (API client):** Configure `clientId` and `clientSecret` in dw.json or environment variables. This is the default for automated/CI use.
- **Browser-based (implicit OAuth):** Use `--user-auth` on any OAuth-enabled command to authenticate interactively via the browser. This opens Account Manager in your default browser for login.
- **Basic auth:** Configure `username` and `password` for WebDAV operations.
- **Stateful sessions:** Use `b2c auth login` for persistent browser-based login sessions.

### `--user-auth` Flag

Many commands support `--user-auth` to use browser-based implicit OAuth instead of client credentials. This is useful when:

- You don't have a `clientSecret` configured
- You need user-level permissions (e.g., Account Manager admin roles)
- You're working interactively

```bash
# Interactive browser-based auth for any OAuth command
b2c sandbox list --user-auth
b2c scapi schemas list --user-auth
b2c auth token --user-auth
```

Coding agents can also use `--user-auth` — the browser flow works in any environment where a browser can be opened. The flag is exclusive with `--auth-methods`.

**Running behind a proxy:** If `localhost:8080` isn't reachable by the browser (e.g., running in a container or behind a reverse proxy), set `SFCC_REDIRECT_URI` to the proxy URL. The local OAuth server still listens on the default port (or `SFCC_OAUTH_LOCAL_PORT`), but the redirect URI sent to Account Manager will use your proxy URL. Add the proxy URL to the API client's redirect URLs in Account Manager.

## Tenant ID and Organization ID

B2C Commerce uses two related identifiers:

- **Tenant ID** — the short form (e.g., `zzxy_prd` or `zzxy-prd`)
- **Organization ID** — the SCAPI form with `f_ecom_` prefix (e.g., `f_ecom_zzxy_prd`)

The CLI automatically normalizes and translates between these formats. You can provide either form in configuration or flags — the CLI handles the conversion. It also extracts tenant IDs from hostnames (e.g., `zzxy-prd.dx.commercecloud.salesforce.com` resolves to `zzxy_prd`).

In dw.json or environment variables, use the `tenantId` config key. The CLI will add the `f_ecom_` prefix when making SCAPI calls.

## Inspecting Configuration

Use `b2c setup inspect` to view the resolved configuration and understand where each value comes from. Use `b2c setup instance` commands to manage named instance configurations.

> **Note:** `b2c setup config` works as an alias for `b2c setup inspect`.

### When to Use

Use `b2c setup inspect` when you need to:

- Verify which configuration file is being used
- Check if environment variables are being read correctly
- Debug authentication failures by confirming credentials are loaded
- Understand credential source priority (dw.json vs env vars vs plugins)
- Identify hostname mismatch protection issues
- Verify MRT API key is loaded from ~/.mobify

### View Current Configuration

```bash
# Display resolved configuration (sensitive values masked by default)
b2c setup inspect

# View configuration for a specific instance from dw.json
b2c setup inspect -i staging

# View configuration with a specific config file
b2c setup inspect --config /path/to/dw.json
```

### Debug Sensitive Values

```bash
# Show actual passwords, secrets, and API keys (use with caution)
b2c setup inspect --unmask
```

### JSON Output for Scripting

```bash
# Output as JSON for parsing in scripts
b2c setup inspect --json

# Pretty-print with jq
b2c setup inspect --json | jq '.config'

# Check which sources are loaded
b2c setup inspect --json | jq '.sources'
```

## IDE Integration (Prophet)

Use `b2c setup ide prophet` to generate a `dw.js` bridge script for the Prophet VS Code extension.

```bash
# Generate ./dw.js in the current project
b2c setup ide prophet

# Overwrite existing file
b2c setup ide prophet --force

# Custom path
b2c setup ide prophet --output .vscode/dw.js
```

The generated script runs `b2c setup inspect --json --unmask` at runtime, so Prophet sees the same resolved config as CLI commands, including configuration plugins. It maps values to `dw.json`-style keys and passes through Prophet fields like `cartridgesPath`, `siteID`, and `storefrontPassword` when present.

## Managing Instances

### List Configured Instances

```bash
# Show all instances from dw.json
b2c setup instance list

# Output as JSON
b2c setup instance list --json
```

### Create a New Instance

```bash
# Interactive mode - prompts for all values
b2c setup instance create staging

# With hostname
b2c setup instance create staging --hostname staging.example.com

# Create and set as active
b2c setup instance create staging --hostname staging.example.com --active

# Non-interactive mode (for scripts)
b2c setup instance create staging \
  --hostname staging.example.com \
  --username admin \
  --password secret \
  --force
```

### Switch Active Instance

```bash
# Set staging as the default instance
b2c setup instance set-active staging

# Now commands use staging by default
b2c code list  # Uses staging
```

### Remove an Instance

```bash
# Remove with confirmation prompt
b2c setup instance remove staging

# Remove without confirmation
b2c setup instance remove staging --force
```

## Understanding the Output

The `setup inspect` command displays configuration organized by category:

- **Instance**: hostname, webdavHostname (if set), codeVersion
- **Authentication (Basic)**: username, password (for WebDAV)
- **Authentication (OAuth)**: clientId, clientSecret, scopes, authMethods, accountManagerHost (if set), sandboxApiHost (if set)
- **TLS/mTLS**: certificate, certificatePassphrase, selfSigned (only shown when configured)
- **SCAPI**: shortCode, tenantId
- **Managed Runtime (MRT)**: mrtProject, mrtEnvironment, mrtApiKey, mrtOrigin (if set)
- **Metadata**: instanceName (from multi-instance configs)
- **Sources**: List of all configuration sources that were loaded

Each value shows its source in brackets:

- `[DwJsonSource]` — Value from dw.json file
- `[EnvSource]` — Value from an SFCC_* environment variable
- `[MobifySource]` — Value from ~/.mobify file
- `[PackageJsonSource]` — Value from package.json `b2c` key
- Plugin-provided source names (e.g., a credential plugin)

## Configuration Priority

Values are resolved with this priority (highest to lowest):

1. CLI flags and environment variables
2. Plugin sources (high priority)
3. dw.json file
4. ~/.mobify file (MRT API key only)
5. Plugin sources (low priority)
6. package.json `b2c` key

When troubleshooting, check the source column to understand which configuration is taking precedence.

## Common Issues

### Missing Values

If a value shows `-`, it means no source provided that configuration. Check:

- Is the field spelled correctly in dw.json?
- Is the environment variable set?
- Does the plugin provide that value?

### Wrong Source Taking Precedence

If a value comes from an unexpected source:

- Higher priority sources override lower ones
- Credential groups (username+password, clientId+clientSecret) are atomic
- Hostname mismatch protection may discard values

### Sensitive Values Masked

By default, passwords and secrets show partial values like `admi...REDACTED`. Use `--unmask` to see full values when debugging authentication issues.

## Getting Admin OAuth Tokens

Use `b2c auth token` to get an admin OAuth access token for Account Manager credentials (OCAPI and Admin APIs). This is useful for testing APIs, scripting, or CI/CD pipelines.

```bash
# Get access token (outputs raw token to stdout)
b2c auth token

# Get token with browser-based auth
b2c auth token --user-auth

# Get token with specific scopes
b2c auth token --auth-scope sfcc.orders --auth-scope sfcc.products

# Get token as JSON (includes expiration and scopes)
b2c auth token --json

# Use in curl for OCAPI calls
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $(b2c auth token)" \
  "https://your-instance.dx.commercecloud.salesforce.com/s/-/dw/data/v24_1/sites"
```

The token is obtained using the `clientId` and `clientSecret` from your configuration (dw.json or environment variables). If only `clientId` is configured, or `--user-auth` is used, an implicit OAuth flow is used (browser-based).

**Note:** This command returns **admin** tokens for OCAPI/Admin APIs. For **shopper** tokens (SLAS), see the [b2c-slas skill](../b2c-slas/SKILL.md).
