# B2C MRT Skill

Use the `b2c` CLI to manage Managed Runtime (MRT) projects, environments, bundles, and deployments for PWA Kit storefronts.

> **Tip:** If `b2c` is not installed globally, use `npx @salesforce/b2c-cli` instead (e.g., `npx @salesforce/b2c-cli mrt bundle deploy`).

# Deploy existing bundle by ID
b2c mrt bundle deploy 12345 -p my-storefront -e production
```

### Manage Environments

```bash
# List environments
b2c mrt env list -p my-storefront

# Create a new environment
b2c mrt env create qa -p my-storefront --name "QA Environment"

# Get environment details
b2c mrt env get -p my-storefront -e production

# Invalidate CDN cache
b2c mrt env invalidate -p my-storefront -e production
```

### Environment Variables

# List variables
b2c mrt env var list -p my-storefront -e production

# Set variables
b2c mrt env var set API_KEY=secret DEBUG=true -p my-storefront -e staging

# Delete a variable
b2c mrt env var delete OLD_VAR -p my-storefront -e production
```

### View Deployment History

```bash
# List bundles in project
b2c mrt bundle list -p my-storefront

# View deployment history for environment
b2c mrt bundle history -p my-storefront -e production

# Download a bundle artifact
b2c mrt bundle download 12345 -p my-storefront
```

### Project Management

```bash
# List projects
b2c mrt project list

# Get project details
b2c mrt project get -p my-storefront

# List project members
b2c mrt project member list -p my-storefront

# Add a member
b2c mrt project member add user@example.com -p my-storefront --role developer
```

### URL Redirects

```bash
# List redirects
b2c mrt env redirect list -p my-storefront -e production

# Create a redirect
b2c mrt env redirect create -p my-storefront -e production \
  --from "/old-path" --to "/new-path"

# Clone redirects between environments
b2c mrt env redirect clone -p my-storefront --source staging --target production
```

## Configuration
