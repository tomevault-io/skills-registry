description: Transition from static LLM chats to autonomous agents that execute multi-step tasks. Use this when you need to automate cross-platform reports (e.g., Snowflake to Google Docs), build self-service tools for non-technical teams, or create "anticipatory" engineering workflows that draft PRs based on Slack discussions. Use when this capability is needed.

# Agentic Workflow Automation

Transform AI from a chat interface into a proactive teammate with "arms and legs." By using the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and agentic frameworks, you can move beyond "vibe coding" to autonomous execution that saves 8–10 hours of manual work per week.

## Core Principles

- **Give the Brain "Arms and Legs"**: An LLM is just a brain; use standardized wrappers (MCP) to give it the ability to touch your data (Snowflake), your communication (Slack), and your production environment (GitHub).
- **Start Small, Then Extend**: Don't boil the ocean. Automate one specific, repetitive task (like a weekly marketing report) before attempting to build a general-purpose assistant.
- **Value Over Code Quality**: Focus on whether the agent solves the merchant or customer problem. Use AI to build "disposable" tools that solve immediate needs rather than over-engineering for long-term maintenance.

## Implementation Workflow

### 1. Identify "High-Friction" Integration Points
Look for tasks where humans act as the "glue" between systems.
- **Example**: Taking data from a SQL database, analyzing it in Excel, and pasting it into a Slide deck.
- **Criteria**: The task should be well-defined, repetitive, and involve digital tools with APIs.

### 2. Wrap Tools in Model Context Protocol (MCP)
Instead of writing custom code for every AI interaction, use MCP to create standardized connectors.
- **Step 1**: Identify the tool (e.g., Salesforce, Jira, Snowflake).
- **Step 2**: Create a formalized wrapper that exposes the tool's capabilities to the LLM.
- **Step 3**: Enable the agent to "browse" these tools to decide which one to use for a specific prompt.

### 3. Deploy Anticipatory Agents
Move from reactive (waiting for a prompt) to proactive (watching for context).
- **Setup**: Give the agent "read" access to a specific Slack channel or meeting transcript.
- **Instruction**: "Monitor this discussion. If a feature request is finalized, draft a PR in the repository and link it in the thread."
- **Review**: Humans act as the "taste filter" and final approval, but the AI does the 0-to-1 drafting overnight.

### 4. Enable Non-Technical Self-Service
Empower departments like Legal, Risk, or Marketing to build their own automation without waiting for the Engineering roadmap.
- **Process**: Provide a low-code agent interface (like Goose) where users can describe a workflow in plain English.
- **Outcome**: A Risk team building their own automated self-service portal in hours instead of waiting months for a dev ticket.

## Examples

**Example 1: The Multi-Platform Marketing Report**
- **Context**: A PM needs a weekly summary of user growth vs. ad spend.
- **Input**: "Goose, pull last week's spend from Snowflake, get conversion rates from Looker, and create a PDF summary in the Marketing folder."
- **Application**: The agent writes SQL to Snowflake, processes the CSV with a local Python script to generate charts, and uses a Google Drive MCP to upload the final PDF.
- **Output**: A formatted report delivered to the team folder with zero human manual data entry.

**Example 2: The "Anticipatory" Developer PR**
- **Context**: A team is debating a bug fix in Slack.
- **Input**: Agent monitors the Slack thread: "We should probably just null-check the user_id in the auth controller."
- **Application**: The agent identifies the file, applies the fix, runs the test suite to ensure no regressions, and opens a GitHub PR.
- **Output**: A message in Slack: "I've drafted a PR for that null-check we just discussed. View it here: [Link]."

## Common Pitfalls

- **Waiting for the Vendor**: Don't wait for a SaaS company to add AI features. Use MCP to build your own agentic layer on top of their existing APIs today.
- **The "Over-Optimizing" Trap**: Before automating a process, ask if the process is even necessary. Deleting a useless step is more productive than automating it.
- **Ignoring the "Long Tail"**: AI is great at the 80% case but can fail on edge cases (e.g., double-tipping at gas stations in a fintech app). Always keep a "human in the loop" for the final 20% of edge-case judgment.
- **Treating AI as a "Chatbot" Only**: If you are only using AI to answer questions, you are missing 90% of the value. If the AI doesn't have the power to *act* (create files, send emails, move data), it's not an agent.
