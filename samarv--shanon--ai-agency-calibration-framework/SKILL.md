# Continuous Calibration & Development (CCCD) Framework

Traditional software is deterministic; AI is non-deterministic on both the input (natural language) and output (LLM response). Because of this, you cannot "set and forget" an AI product. This framework, developed by Aishwarya Reganti and Kiriti Badam, uses a "Rungs of Agency" approach to build user trust and system reliability through iterative calibration.

## The Three Rungs of Agency

Do not jump to full autonomy (V3) immediately. Start at V1 to build a data flywheel that informs your evaluation metrics for later stages.

### Rung 1: High Control / Low Agency (The Router)
The AI performs classification or organization but takes no action. It reduces the user's cognitive load without removing their decision-making power.
*   **Goal:** Validate the data layer and taxonomy.
*   **Example:** A customer support agent that routes tickets to the right department but doesn't reply.

### Rung 2: Medium Control / Medium Agency (The Copilot)
The AI suggests a draft or a path forward. The human remains the "approver" who reviews, edits, and sends the output.
*   **Goal:** Log "human-in-the-loop" corrections. Every time a human edits the AI’s draft, you have captured a high-quality data point for your evaluation dataset.
*   **Example:** A marketing assistant that drafts an email campaign for a human to review.

### Rung 3: Low Control / High Agency (The Autonomous Agent)
The AI performs end-to-end tasks with minimal human intervention. It only reaches this stage after the "Copilot" phase shows high alignment between AI suggestions and human approvals.
*   **Goal:** Full workflow automation and efficiency.
*   **Example:** A coding assistant that autonomously fixes bugs and opens Pull Requests.

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### 1. Scope the Workflow and Taxonomy
Identify the specific problem, not the model. Map out the messy "tech debt" in your data.
*   **Audit your data layers:** Check for "dead nodes" (outdated categories) or messy taxonomies (e.g., "Men's Shoes" and "Shoes for Men" existing as separate categories).
*   **Define the non-negotiables:** What must the AI *never* do?

### 2. Build the Initial Evaluation Dataset
Before writing code, create a "Golden Set" of 10–20 inputs and their ideal outputs.
*   **Focus on Diversity:** Include edge cases, slang, and common user errors.
*   **Subject Matter Expert (SME) Input:** Have your domain experts (lawyers, doctors, support leads) define what "correct" looks like.

### 3. Deploy at Rung 2 (Copilot Mode)
Deploy the system so it assists a human rather than replacing them. 
*   **Log Everything:** Track exactly what the human changes in the AI's output.
*   **Spot Error Patterns:** Don't just look for "thumbs up/down." Look for *why* the human changed a specific word or tool call.

### 4. Continuous Calibration
Use the production logs to "calibrate" the system's behavior.
*   **Identify Emerging Patterns:** Look for user behaviors you didn't anticipate in your initial evaluation set (e.g., users asking deep historical questions instead of simple lookups).
*   **Update Metrics:** If you see a new failure mode, turn that failure into a new evaluation metric.
*   **Fix and Regress:** Apply a fix (prompt change, tool definition, or RAG update) and run your golden set to ensure you haven't broken previous successes.

### 5. Graduate to Rung 3
Only move to autonomy when your logs show that humans are accepting AI suggestions without modification >90% of the time (or your specific reliability threshold).

## Examples of Progression

**Example 1: Coding Assistant**
*   **V1 (Router):** Suggest inline code completions or boilerplate snippets based on the file name.
*   **V2 (Copilot):** Generate a full unit test suite for a specific function for the engineer to review.
*   **V3 (Agent):** Scan a repository for security vulnerabilities, write the fix, run tests, and open a PR.

**Example 2: Customer Support**
*   **V1 (Router):** Categorize incoming tickets by intent (e.g., "Refund," "Technical Bug," "Pricing") and assign to the right team.
*   **V2 (Copilot):** Search the knowledge base and draft a response for the support agent to send.
*   **V3 (Agent):** Autonomously process refunds for users who meet specific, pre-authorized criteria.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

*   **Jumping to V3 Immediately:** This leads to "hot-fixing to death." When the agent makes a mistake in an autonomous multi-step workflow, it is incredibly difficult to debug.
*   **The "One-Click Agent" Myth:** Avoid vendors or internal promises of "instant" agents. Enterprise data is too messy for out-of-the-box autonomy to work safely.
*   **Obsessing over Model Evals vs. Product Evals:** Checking a model's performance on a public benchmark (like MMLU) is not the same as evaluating your specific product workflow.
*   **Fearing the SME:** Don't build in a vacuum. If Subject Matter Experts feel their jobs are threatened, they won't give you the honest feedback needed to calibrate the system. Position AI as a tool to remove their "busy work."
*   **Ignoring Implicit Signals:** In V2, if a user hits "Regenerate," that is a clear "Thumbs Down," even if they didn't explicitly click a feedback button. Log these signals.
