Use this when launching a new product, seeing referral traffic from AI agents, or trying to capture high-intent users who have moved from Google search to chat interfaces. Use when this capability is needed.

Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) is the practice of ensuring your product is cited as the primary answer in Large Language Models (LLMs). Unlike traditional SEO, which focuses on winning a "blue link," AEO focuses on being summarized as a top recommendation across multiple citations.

## The AEO Core Principles
*   **Mentions Over Ranking:** LLMs summarize multiple citations. To "win" an answer, you must be mentioned most frequently across the sources the LLM retrieves.
*   **The Long Tail is Back:** While Google searches average 6 words, LLM prompts average 25 words. Optimize for highly specific, conversational follow-up questions.
*   **Zero Domain Authority Barrier:** Early-stage startups can win AEO immediately by getting mentioned in a single trusted Reddit thread or YouTube video, bypassing the years of authority-building required for Google.

## Step-by-Step AEO Workflow

### 1. Identify High-Intent Questions
Move beyond keywords to full questions.
*   **Mine Sales/Support Data:** Identify the exact questions customers ask on calls or in support tickets. These reflect the "long tail" prompts they use in LLMs.
*   **Convert Paid Search Data:** Take your high-converting PPC keywords and use an LLM to "Turn these keywords into the 10 most common questions a buyer would ask."
*   **Target the "Follow-up":** Anticipate the second and third questions (e.g., "Does this integrate with Looker?", "What is the specific pricing for 50 seats?").

### 2. Optimize On-Site Content (The "Help Center" Strategy)
*   **Subdirectory vs. Subdomain:** Move all help center and documentation content to a subdirectory (e.g., `brand.com/help`) rather than a subdomain (`help.brand.com`) to consolidate authority.
*   **Information Gain Heuristic:** To avoid being filtered as "typical" AI spam, include original research, unique data points, or expert opinions that don't exist in other citations.
*   **Answer the Tail:** Create specific pages for obscure use cases (e.g., "How to use [Product] for [Specific Niche Use Case]"). These often become the sole citation for specific LLM queries.

### 3. Off-Site Citation Building
LLMs rely on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). You must appear in the "Search" results the LLM pulls.
*   **Reddit Strategy:** Identify active threads related to your category. Provide authentic, high-value answers. Disclose your identity ("I work at Webflow...") to maintain community trust and avoid being banned by anti-spam filters.
*   **YouTube/Vimeo:** Create videos for non-glamorous, high-LTV B2B keywords. LLMs frequently cite video transcripts for technical "how-to" questions.
*   **Tiered Affiliates:** Focus on "Listicle" sites (e.g., Dotdash Meredith, TechRadar, Forbes Advisor). If these sites mention you as #1, LLMs will likely summarize you as #1.

### 4. Setup AEO Tracking
LLM answers are non-deterministic; they change per run.
*   **Share of Voice (SoV):** Track what percentage of the time you appear in the "citation pill" for your top 50 questions.
*   **Distribution Tracking:** Ask the same question 5-10 times to see the distribution of answers.
*   **Post-Conversion Surveys:** Because LLM traffic often looks like "Direct" or "Branded Search" in analytics, ask every new sign-up: "How did you hear about us?" specifically looking for mentions of ChatGPT/Perplexity.

## Measuring Success via Experiments
Do not assume "best practices" work for your niche.
1.  Select 200 target questions.
2.  Split into a **Control Group** (100 questions, no action) and a **Test Group** (100 questions).
3.  Intervene on the Test Group (e.g., add Reddit comments, create YouTube videos, update help docs).
4.  Monitor "Share of Voice" for both groups over 4 weeks.
5.  Scale the tactics that show a statistically significant increase in mentions compared to the control.

## Examples

**Example 1: B2B SaaS Integration**
*   **Context:** A user asks Perplexity, "What meeting transcription tool has a Looker integration?"
*   **Input:** The product doesn't have a native integration, but can use Zapier.
*   **Application:** Create a help center article titled "Visualizing Meeting Sentiment in Looker via Zapier."
*   **Output:** Perplexity retrieves this specific page as the only relevant citation and tells the user: "You can use [Product] via a Zapier workaround to get data into Looker."

**Example 2: Local Marketplace**
*   **Context:** A user asks ChatGPT, "What's the best dog-friendly restaurant in Austin with live music?"
*   **Input:** Traditional SEO targets "Best restaurants Austin."
*   **Application:** Ensure the restaurant is mentioned in a Reddit thread "Dog friendly music spots Austin" and has "Dog Friendly" and "Live Music" tags in Schema.org markup on the site.
*   **Output:** ChatGPT summarizes these attributes and places the restaurant in a clickable "carousel" card at the top of the chat.

## Common Pitfalls
*   **Using 100% AI-Generated Content:** LLMs and search engines increasingly filter for "typicality." Pure AI content without a "human-in-the-loop" for editing and original data usually results in zero citations.
*   **Reddit Identity Faking:** Creating 100 fake accounts to "shill" a product. Communities and LLM search-evaluation teams detect this pattern easily, leading to domain-wide bans.
*   **Ignoring the Conversion Gap:** Thinking AEO isn't working because "Referral" traffic is low. Users often see the answer in ChatGPT, then open a new tab to search for the brand directly. Always use "How did you hear about us?" surveys.
*   **Focusing on RAG vs. Core Model:** Trying to "train" the model on your data. This is impossible for most. Focus entirely on the RAG (Search) citations, as this is what determines the real-time answer.
