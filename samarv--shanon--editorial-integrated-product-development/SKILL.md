# Editorial-Integrated Product Development

In high-stakes industries like news, health, or finance, relying solely on engagement-driven algorithms leads to low-quality outcomes and brand erosion. This framework bridges the gap between expert intuition and scalable software by embedding domain experts (editors) directly into the product development lifecycle and using their judgment as the primary signal for algorithmic ranking.

## The Mission-Function Matrix Structure

Organize the product organization into two axes to balance craft excellence with speed:

- **Functions:** (Product, Design, Engineering, Data) Focus on standards of craft, career frameworks, and skill development.
- **Missions:** (Consumer, Monetization, Platform) Cross-functional "wartime" teams that include PMs, designers, and—crucially—**embedded domain experts/editors**.

## The Editorial Algorithmic Workflow

Instead of training models purely on clicks or time-spent, use expert judgment to "scale" quality across the user experience.

### 1. Identify the "Solar System" Hierarchy
- **The Sun:** Define the core product that provides the brand heritage and trust (e.g., News).
- **Satellite Planets:** Build adjacent products that share the same DNA but serve different life needs (e.g., Games, Cooking, Shopping).
- **The Connection:** Ensure the satellites feed back into the core via a shared subscription or account system.

### 2. Define Editorial Importance Scores
Work with domain experts to create structured data from their intuition.
- **The Signal:** Ask experts to assign "importance" or "quality" scores to content or features.
- **The Training:** Feed these editorial scores into the ranking algorithm as a weighted variable alongside engagement metrics.
- **The Outcome:** The system scales expert curation to millions of users, ensuring that "most important" content is seen, even if it isn't "most viral."

### 3. Transition Experiments to Platforms
Avoid the "tyranny of the roadmap" for high-impact, one-off events by using a two-speed delivery model:
- **Mode 1 (The Newsroom Experiment):** Deploy autonomous, small teams (journalist + dev + designer) to build a bespoke, one-off feature (e.g., a real-time productivity tracker or a live election map).
- **Mode 2 (The Platform Team):** Analyze successful one-offs to extract repeatable patterns. Build these into the "Storytelling Platform" so any expert can use the format without a dedicated developer.

## Managing Acquisitions for "Core Magic"

When integrating a new product (like a game or tool), prioritize the "user's emotional relationship" over immediate technical alignment.

1. **Protect the Core Loop:** Identify the "social currency" of the product (e.g., streaks, stats, or shares). Ensure these remain unchanged during migration.
2. **Seamless Backend Integration:** Rewrite the tech stack to allow for account-based persistence (so users don't lose data across devices) but keep the frontend UI identical to the original version.
3. **Transparent Communication:** If a technical coincidence occurs (e.g., a game solution accidentally mirrors a controversial news event), release a "technical post-mortem" to explain the backend automation and preserve brand neutrality.

## Examples

### Example 1: Home Screen Curation
- **Context:** A news app wants to personalize the feed without creating an echo chamber.
- **Input:** Editorial Importance Score (1-10) provided by the newsroom for every story.
- **Application:** The PM designs an algorithm where the "Importance Score" acts as a floor. No matter how much a user likes "soft news," a story with an Importance Score of 10 (e.g., a major global event) is pinned to the top.
- **Output:** A personalized feed that maintains institutional authority and keeps the user informed on essential facts.

### Example 2: Scaling Visual Storytelling
- **Context:** An investigative reporter wants a "scrolling visual" to show data.
- **Input:** A bespoke interactive feature built by a one-off graphics team.
- **Application:** The Storytelling Product Team identifies the "scrollytelling" component as a high-value asset. They build a component in the CMS (Content Management System) that allows any reporter to drag-and-drop data to create the same effect.
- **Output:** The "bespoke" feel is scaled across the entire organization without requiring a developer for every story.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Confusing Distribution with Content:** PMs at platforms often think they only control the software. In mission-driven products, you must "own the full stack"—the content, the distribution, and the software—to ensure quality.
- **Engagement Blindness:** Optimizing for clicks often suppresses the high-quality, "mission-critical" content that builds long-term subscriber value. If the mission and the metric conflict, the mission must win.
- **Breaking the "Core Magic":** During technical migrations of acquired products, developers often prioritize "clean code" or "standardized UI" over the quirky features that users love. Never change the frontend until the backend migration is proven stable.
