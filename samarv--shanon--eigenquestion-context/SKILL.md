# Eigenquestion Context Gathering

Gather missing context through high-leverage questions that maximize information gain. One question at a time.

## Core Concept

An **Eigenquestion** is the single question that, when answered, also answers the largest number of subsequent questions.

Instead of asking many clarifying questions, identify the ONE question with the most **discriminating power**—the question that establishes a fundamental principle and eliminates the need to debate every downstream decision.

## When to Activate

**Use this skill when:**
- Context is missing or ambiguous
- User request requires assumptions you shouldn't make
- Starting work on a brain without recent context
- Making strategic decisions with multiple valid paths
- You're tempted to ask 3+ clarifying questions (find the eigenquestion instead)

**Do NOT use when:**
- Context is already sufficient in brain CLAUDE.md
- Question is operational, not strategic
- User has explicitly provided the needed context

## The Eigenquestion Protocol

### Step 1: Identify the Uncertainty Space

Before asking, map what you don't know:

```
What decisions depend on this context?
- Decision A: [what it affects]
- Decision B: [what it affects]
- Decision C: [what it affects]

Which single piece of information would resolve the most decisions?
```

### Step 2: Formulate the Eigenquestion

**Good eigenquestions are:**
- **Binary or categorical** (not open-ended): "Is this more about X or Y?"
- **Discriminating**: The answer changes the entire approach
- **Future-oriented**: Often about market direction, user behavior, or strategic bets
- **Testable**: You can imagine concrete implications of each answer

**Bad questions (avoid):**
- "Can you tell me more about...?" (too vague)
- "What do you want?" (puts burden on user)
- "What are the requirements?" (information-gathering, not discriminating)

### Step 3: Ask ONE Question

Format:

> To [achieve goal / create output], I need to understand one thing:
>
> **[Eigenquestion]?**
>
> This will determine [what it unlocks].

Wait for answer. Do not ask multiple questions.

### Step 4: Persist the Answer

After receiving the answer:

1. **If working in a brain**: Update `Brains/[name]/CLAUDE.md`
   - Add to "Key Decisions & Rationale" if strategic
   - Mark resolved in "Open Questions" if applicable

2. **If cross-brain context**: Update `CLAUDE.local.md` under "Preferences Discovered"

3. **Confirm persistence**: "✓ Captured: [brief summary of decision]"

### Step 5: Iterate or Proceed

If more context needed, return to Step 1. Identify the NEXT eigenquestion.

If context is now sufficient, proceed with the task.

## Eigenquestion Patterns

| Uncertainty Domain | Eigenquestion Pattern | What It Unlocks |
|-------------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| **Scope** | "Is this more about [solving X] or [enabling Y]?" | Feature prioritization, success metrics |
| **User priority** | "If we could only serve one user perfectly, [persona A] or [persona B]?" | Design decisions, messaging, trade-offs |
| **Timeline vs quality** | "Is shipping by [date] more important than [quality attribute]?" | Scope cuts, resource allocation |
| **Market bet** | "In 2 years, is this market more likely to value [consistency] or [comprehensiveness]?" | Platform strategy, partnership decisions |
| **Core identity** | "Are we fundamentally a [X] or a [Y]?" | Product direction, what to say no to |
| **Resource allocation** | "If we had to cut half the scope, what's the non-negotiable core?" | MVP definition, phasing |
| **Integration** | "Should this [stand alone] or [integrate deeply with X]?" | Architecture, dependencies, timeline |

## Examples

### Example 1: Vague Feature Request

**User**: "We need to add collaboration features to Board."

**Uncertainty space**:
- Real-time or async collaboration?
- Internal team or external stakeholders?
- Light commenting or deep co-authoring?

**Eigenquestion**:
> To shape the right collaboration features, I need to understand one thing:
>
> **Is Board collaboration primarily about teams working together in real-time (like Figma), or about asynchronous review and feedback (like Google Docs comments)?**
>
> This determines the entire technical architecture and UX model.

### Example 2: Strategic Direction

**User**: "Help me write a pitch for the betting table."

**Uncertainty space**:
- What problem are we solving?
- Which customer segment?
- What's the appetite (small/medium/large batch)?

**Eigenquestion**:
> To write a compelling pitch, I need to understand one thing:
>
> **Is this pitch addressing a known pain point we've validated, or exploring a new opportunity we believe in but haven't proven?**
>
> This determines whether we lead with user evidence or strategic vision.

### Example 3: Prioritization Decision

**User**: "We're behind on the Global Launch timeline. What should we cut?"

**Uncertainty space**:
- What's the must-have for launch?
- What defines "launch" vs "post-launch"?
- Which stakeholders care about which features?

**Eigenquestion**:
> To recommend scope cuts, I need to understand one thing:
>
> **Is the Global Launch deadline immovable (we ship whatever's ready), or is it the feature set that's immovable (we slip if needed)?**
>
> This determines whether we're cutting features or negotiating timeline.

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Instead |
|--------------|--------------|---------|
| Asking 5 questions at once | Overwhelms user, loses discriminating power | Find the ONE eigenquestion |
| "Tell me more about..." | Puts burden on user, vague | Offer binary/categorical choice |
| Asking about details before strategy | Wastes effort if direction changes | Start with strategic eigenquestion |
| Not persisting answers | Loses context, re-asks later | Always update CLAUDE.md |
| Asking questions you can answer yourself | Wastes user time | Check existing context first |

## Quality Check

Before asking, verify:
- [ ] I checked brain CLAUDE.md for existing context
- [ ] This question has discriminating power (answer changes approach)
- [ ] It's binary or categorical, not open-ended
- [ ] I'm asking ONE question, not bundling multiple
- [ ] I know where I'll persist the answer
