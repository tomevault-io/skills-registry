# Fixed-Appetite Product Cycles

Stop asking "How long will this take?" and start asking "How much is this worth to us?" By setting a fixed budget (an appetite) rather than a variable estimate, you force teams to find the simplest, most effective version of a feature that fits within a set timeframe.

## The Shape Up Framework

### 1. Set the Appetite
Instead of estimating work, decide how much time you are willing to spend on a problem. 
- **Small Batch:** 1–2 weeks for minor tweaks or small features.
- **Big Batch:** Up to 6 weeks for significant features or infrastructure.
- **The Hard Limit:** Never commit to a project longer than 6 weeks. If it’s bigger, break it down or "shape" it into a smaller version.

### 2. Form Small Teams
Assign work to the smallest possible unit: **one designer and one engineer.**
- Small teams reduce communication overhead and meetings.
- They have full autonomy to "trade concessions"—reducing the scope of the "how" to meet the deadline of the "what."

### 3. The "Circuit Breaker" Rule
If a project is not finished within its allotted 6-week cycle, it is canceled by default.
- This prevents "zombie projects" that drain morale for months.
- If the feature is truly important, it can be re-shaped and re-pitched for a future cycle, but it does not get an automatic extension.

### 4. Use Hill Charts for Progress
Move away from linear checklists or "percent complete" metrics, which are often lies. Track work based on two phases:
- **Uphill (Figuring it out):** You are still pushing against uncertainty. You don't yet know all the tasks required.
- **Downhill (Execution):** You have solved the unknowns. You can see the finish line and just need to put in the hours.

### 5. Mandatory Cool-Down
After every 6-week cycle, schedule a **2-week cool-down.**
- No scheduled projects or pitches.
- Teams use this time to fix bugs, explore new ideas, or handle administrative tasks.
- This prevents "sprint exhaustion" and allows leaders time to "shape" the work for the next cycle.

## Execution Guide

1.  **Shape the Pitch:** Before the cycle starts, a lead "shapes" the work by defining boundaries, rough sketches, and what is *out* of scope. Do not provide a 50-page spec; provide a "fat marker" sketch.
2.  **The Betting Table:** Leaders look at the shaped pitches and "bet" their 6-week cycle on the ones with the highest perceived value.
3.  **The Hand-off:** Give the team the pitch and the 6-week deadline. They are responsible for discovering the tasks and defining the work.
4.  **Trade Concessions:** As the deadline nears, the team must aggressively cut "nice-to-have" details to ensure the "must-have" core is polished and shipped.

## Examples

**Example 1: Adding a "Thank You" Note Feature**
- **Context:** A PM wants to add personalized thank-you notes for customers.
- **Input:** "I think we need a full HTML editor for notes."
- **Application of Appetite:** The leader says, "We have a 1-week appetite for this." 
- **Output:** The team realizes an HTML editor is too complex for 1 week. They instead ship a plain-text field with three pre-set templates. It solves 90% of the need in 10% of the time.

**Example 2: Updating the Billing System**
- **Context:** The internal billing system is slow and needs an overhaul.
- **Input:** "This is a 6-month project."
- **Application of Appetite:** The leader says, "We only bet in 6-week increments. What is the most critical 6-week version of this?"
- **Output:** The team identifies that 80% of the slowness comes from one specific database query. They spend 6 weeks refactoring only that part. The system becomes "fast enough" without a total rewrite.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Breaking the Circuit Breaker:** Granting "just one more week" to a failing project. This destroys the integrity of the system and teaches the team that deadlines don't matter.
- **Over-specifying the Work:** If you give a team a list of 50 sub-tasks, you’ve removed their ability to trade concessions. They will focus on checking boxes instead of shipping the best version that fits the time.
- **Skipping Cool-Downs:** Moving immediately from one 6-week cycle to the next leads to burnout and prevents long-term strategic "shaping" of the product.
- **Promising "By End of Year":** Avoid long-term promises. The further away the date, the easier it is to promise, and the more likely you are to be wrong. Only commit to the next 6 weeks.
