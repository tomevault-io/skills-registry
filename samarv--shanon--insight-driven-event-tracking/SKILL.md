# Insight-Driven Event Tracking

Most analytics efforts fail because they track "entertainment" (data that is interesting but doesn't change behavior) rather than "news" (information that forces a change in the real world). This framework shifts instrumentation from simple event logging to capturing the context necessary to explain user intent.

## The Core Principles

### 1. Observation vs. Insight
*   **Observation:** A raw fact from the database (e.g., "Power users book 4x more than new users"). This has no context and offers no clear action.
*   **Insight:** An observation plus the "Why" (e.g., "Power users convert at 2x the rate when they see at least 5 drivers on the map"). This tells you exactly what lever to pull (increase supply density).

### 2. The Physics of the Growth Model
Before tracking, define the "physics" of your specific universe to identify where levers actually exist:
*   **Market:** Who are the users and suppliers?
*   **Product:** What is the core value proposition?
*   **Model:** How do you charge or capture value?
*   **Channel:** How do users find you? (e.g., In Southeast Asia, Gojek’s physical drivers in green jackets were a primary growth channel).

## The Instrumentation Workflow

### Step 1: Identify the "Step Before"
Instead of focusing solely on the conversion event (e.g., "Purchased"), focus on the step immediately preceding it. This is where the most friction exists. 
*   **Goal:** Identify the "Hand-Raiser" approach—actions where a user signals intent but hasn't committed.

### Step 2: Define Contextual Properties
A bad tracking spec has many unique event names with zero properties. A high-value spec has few events with many properties. For every core action, you must track the context:
*   **Supply state:** What did the user see? (e.g., Number of drivers, items in stock).
*   **Friction state:** Was there a voucher? Was the API slow?
*   **User state:** Is this a first-time user? Are they connected via social?

### Step 3: Run the "News Test"
For every event/property in your spec, ask: "If this number changes by 20%, what specific action will I take tomorrow?" If you don't have an answer, you are tracking entertainment, not news.

## Examples

**Example 1: Ride-Hailing Map Load**
*   **Context:** A user opens the app to book a ride.
*   **Bad Tracking:** Event: `map_loaded`.
*   **Insight-Driven Tracking:** Event: `map_viewed`
    *   Property `drivers_visible`: 2 (Critical for understanding conversion)
    *   Property `surge_multiplier`: 1.5x
    *   Property `estimated_pickup_time`: 8 mins
    *   Property `is_new_user`: True
*   **Output:** Analysis reveals users with `drivers_visible` < 3 have a 50% drop in conversion. Action: Re-route supply to those specific GPS coordinates.

**Example 2: Social App Onboarding**
*   **Context:** A user is prompted to find friends on a social app.
*   **Bad Tracking:** Event: `search_clicked`.
*   **Insight-Driven Tracking:** Event: `friend_search_performed`
    *   Property `api_latency_ms`: 1200ms
    *   Property `results_count`: 0
    *   Property `search_query_length`: 3
*   **Output:** Data shows a 30% drop-off when `api_latency_ms` > 800ms. Action: Invest in search API optimization rather than changing the UI.

## Benchmarks for Success
When analyzing the resulting data, use these "Decacorn" benchmarks to evaluate health:
*   **Free Products:** Aim for ~60% Week 1 retention. The curve should flatten high.
*   **Paid Products:** Aim for 20-30% Week 1 retention.
*   **The "Friend Test":** For early startups, retention among friends and family should be near 80%. If you can't retain people who care about you, you won't retain strangers.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
*   **Tracking OKRs instead of Journeys:** Knowing your North Star metric is down is "entertainment." Knowing it's down because of a 40% failure rate in the SMS OTP provider is "news."
*   **Ignoring the "Pause" Option:** In subscription models, users often churn because they have "too much" of a product. Adding a "Pause/Snooze" button is often more effective than reactivation emails.
*   **Waiting for Scale to Experiment:** You can run experiments with a sample size as low as 30. The results won't be as precise, but the underlying trends and "direction of travel" are usually visible and actionable.
*   **Over-complicating Tools:** Don't spend 6 months integrating a complex CRM if a Python script hitting a Twilio API and a CSV can validate the hypothesis in 4 hours.
