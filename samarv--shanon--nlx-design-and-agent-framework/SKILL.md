# NLX Design and Agent Framework

In the AI era, Natural Language Interface (NLX) is the new UX. While traditional GUIs are rigid, NLX is elastic. However, a conversational interface is not a "no-design" zone; it requires a new set of invisible grammars, structures, and UI constructs to prevent the creation of "Frankenstein products."

## 1. Defining the Agent (The 3-Part Test)
When building an AI agent rather than a simple assistant, evaluate it against these three criteria:
*   **Autonomy:** Move from "human-in-the-driver's-seat" to delegation. It should operate on a spectrum of independence where you provide a goal, and the agent determines the path.
*   **Complexity:** The task must be multi-step and non-linear. If it is a "one-shot" task (e.g., "summarize this"), it is an assistant. If it is "build a prototype for this idea," it is an agent.
*   **Asynchronous Nature:** The agent should work when the user is not working. It should be able to join meetings, perform deep research, or execute background processes without constant human monitoring.

## 2. The NLX Design Construct
Treat natural language as a designed interface using these specific elements:
*   **The Prompt as the New PRD:** Use prompts to define the product’s logic and constraints. If you cannot prototype the behavior via a prompt set, the product is not yet defined.
*   **Editable Plans:** When a user provides a high-level goal, the agent should return a "Plan" construct. This plan must be visible and editable by the user before execution to build trust.
*   **Showing the Work (Thinking Aloud):** Design the "inference time" experience. 
    *   *Too verbose:* Feels like a technical script/cron job.
    *   *Too terse:* Creates a "black box" that reduces user confidence.
    *   *The Sweet Spot:* Provide enough breadcrumbs to show the agent is on the right path without overwhelming the user.
*   **Proactive Follow-ups:** Design the "happy path" by suggesting the next logical steps (e.g., if an image is generated, suggest "Make this high-resolution" or "Change the style to watercolor").

## 3. The "Frontier" Prototyping Workflow
Operationalize a "one-year-in-the-future" mindset by forcing the following workflow:
1.  **Demos Before Memos:** Never present a static document for a new AI feature. Present a live prototype or a prompt set.
2.  **The "WWXD" Test:** Use reasoning models to stress-test your strategy. (e.g., "What would [Target Stakeholder] think of this pitch? Identify the gaps in my persuasion.")
3.  **Solve Before Scale:** In the 0-to-1 phase, prioritize "the sound of the click" (qualitative delight) over traditional metrics like CTR or Retention, which are "grown-up metrics" that provide false precision early on.

## Examples

**Example 1: Designing a Research Agent**
*   **Context:** A PM needs to prepare for a leadership meeting regarding a roadmap change.
*   **Input:** "Research the public views and past internal statements of everyone in this meeting regarding AI agents."
*   **Application of NLX:** The agent provides an **Editable Plan**: "1. Identify attendees. 2. Scan internal docs for their project history. 3. Search public interviews. 4. Synthesize a persuasion pitch." The user edits step 4 to "Focus specifically on cost-efficiency."
*   **Output:** A structured briefing document with a "confidence score" on each insight.

**Example 2: Rapid Prototyping a New Feature**
*   **Context:** A designer wants to add a "Smart Budgeting" tool to a finance app.
*   **Input:** A prompt set that simulates the AI's logic for categorizing "messy" transactions.
*   **Application:** Instead of a Figma mock, the team builds a functional "Prompt-PRD" in a playground environment to see if the model can actually handle the reasoning required for edge-case transactions (e.g., "Venmo for rent" vs "Venmo for dinner").
*   **Output:** A functional demo that proves technical feasibility before any "bowels of the app" code is written.

## Common Pitfalls
*   **The Black Box Trap:** Assuming the "model eats the product" and therefore doesn't need UI. Conversations have grammar; if you don't design it, the user will feel lost.
*   **Stale Priors:** Relying on what AI couldn't do six months ago. The "baby grows up in a month"—always test the latest reasoning models before dismissing a feature as "impossible."
*   **Premature Scaling:** Moving to high-scale infrastructure before you have "Solved" the core user problem.
*   **The "Frankenstein" Product:** Allowing too many people to add AI "features" without a central "Tastemaker" or "Editor" role to maintain a cohesive product voice.
