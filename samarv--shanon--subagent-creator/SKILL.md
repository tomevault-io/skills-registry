# Subagent Creator

This skill provides guidance for creating effective custom subagents in Claude Code.

## Using This Skill

**CRITICAL**: When helping users create subagents, always follow these meta-principles learned from effective subagent design:

1. **Announce Your Approach**: Start by identifying what type of subagent they need (read-only analyzer, domain expert, performance optimizer, etc.)
2. **Use the Decision Tree**: Guide them through structured questions to determine the right configuration
3. **Apply Visibility Principles**: Teach them to add framework/methodology announcements in their subagent prompts
4. **Distinguish Primary vs Supporting**: Help them identify ONE main task, with supporting capabilities as needed
5. **Include Complete Examples**: Show working examples, not just abstract templates

## About Subagents

Subagents are specialized AI assistants that handle specific types of tasks. Each subagent runs in its own context window with a custom system prompt, specific tool access, and independent permissions. When Claude encounters a task that matches a subagent's description, it delegates to that subagent, which works independently and returns results.

### Benefits of Subagents

1. **Preserve context** - Keep exploration and implementation out of your main conversation
2. **Enforce constraints** - Limit which tools a subagent can use
3. **Reuse configurations** - Share user-level subagents across all projects
4. **Specialize behavior** - Focus system prompts for specific domains
5. **Control costs** - Route tasks to faster, cheaper models like Haiku

### Meta-Principles from Effective Subagents

Based on analysis of high-performing subagents (growth-experiments, marketing-copywriter):

**The Framework Visibility Pattern:**
When a subagent has multiple preloaded skills (3+), users can't see which methodology is being applied. Solution:
1. List all preloaded frameworks with descriptions
2. Provide decision tree for selection
3. Require announcement at start: `🔧 FRAMEWORK: [name] + REASON`
4. Include example workflow showing proper usage

**The Decision Tree Pattern:**
Complex subagents need structured routing logic, not just lists:
- Bad: "Use framework-a for X, framework-b for Y, framework-c for Z"
- Good: Multi-step decision tree with clear conditionals

**The Primary vs Supporting Pattern:**
Prevent framework dilution by distinguishing:
- **Primary frameworks**: Choose ONE based on scenario
- **Supporting frameworks**: Consult as needed in addition

**The Complete Example Pattern:**
Abstract templates confuse. Show working examples:
- User request → Framework announcement → Execution → Output
- Mark what makes it good with ✅ checklist

Apply these patterns when creating complex, multi-skill subagents.

## Core Principles

### 1. Focused Specialization

Each subagent should excel at one specific task. Narrow focus leads to better performance.

**Good**: A subagent that reviews code for security vulnerabilities  
**Bad**: A subagent that reviews code, writes tests, and deploys applications

### 2. Clear Descriptions with Triggers

Claude uses the `description` field to decide when to delegate. Write clear, specific descriptions that include:
- What the subagent does
- When to use it (specific scenarios)
- What triggers delegation

Include phrases like "use proactively" or "use immediately after" to encourage automatic delegation.

### 3. Minimal Tool Access

Grant only necessary permissions (principle of least privilege):
- Read-only subagents: `tools: Read, Grep, Glob`
- Bash-only subagents: `tools: Bash`
- Full-access subagents: Omit `tools` field to inherit all

Use `disallowedTools` to deny specific tools while inheriting others.

### 4. Skill Visibility (CRITICAL)

**When a subagent preloads skills, teach it to announce which framework it's using.**

If your subagent has multiple preloaded skills (like the growth-experiments or marketing-copywriter patterns):
- Add a "Preloaded Skills" section listing all available frameworks
- Include a decision tree to guide framework selection
- Require the subagent to announce: `🔧 FRAMEWORK: [name]` at the start of responses
- This makes methodology visible to users

Example from effective subagents:
```markdown
## Preloaded Skills

You have 5 specialized frameworks:
- `skill-a` - For scenario X
- `skill-b` - For scenario Y

**CRITICAL**: Always announce which primary framework you're applying.
```

### 5. Progressive Disclosure

Start simple, add complexity only when needed:
1. Begin with basic system prompt
2. Add tool restrictions if needed
3. Configure model selection for performance/cost
4. Add hooks for advanced validation
5. Preload skills for domain knowledge
6. Add framework visibility (if multiple skills)

## Anatomy of a Subagent

Subagents are Markdown files with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Expert code review specialist. Use proactively after code changes.
tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash
model: sonnet
---

You are a senior code reviewer ensuring high standards.

When invoked:
1. Run git diff to see recent changes
2. Review modified files
3. Provide specific feedback
```

### Required Fields

- **name**: Unique identifier (lowercase, hyphens, max 40 chars)
- **description**: When Claude should delegate (critical for triggering)

### Optional Fields

- **tools**: Tools this subagent can use (inherits all if omitted)
- **disallowedTools**: Tools to deny from inherited set
- **model**: `sonnet`, `opus`, `haiku`, or `inherit` (default)
- **permissionMode**: `default`, `acceptEdits`, `dontAsk`, `bypassPermissions`, or `plan`
- **skills**: Skills to preload into subagent's context
- **hooks**: Lifecycle hooks (`PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `Stop`)

See [Configuration Reference](references/configuration-reference.md) for complete details.

## Subagent Scope

Store subagents in different locations based on scope:

| Location | Scope | Priority |
|----------|-------|----------|
| `--agents` CLI flag | Current session | 1 (highest) |
| `.claude/agents/` | Current project | 2 |
| `~/.claude/agents/` | All your projects | 3 |
| Plugin's `agents/` | Where enabled | 4 (lowest) |

**Project subagents** (`.claude/agents/`) - Share with your team via version control  
**User subagents** (`~/.claude/agents/`) - Personal subagents for all projects

## Subagent Creation Process

Follow these steps to create effective subagents:

### Step 1: Understanding the Use Case

**Start by identifying the subagent type using this decision tree:**

#### Subagent Type Decision Tree

**What's the primary purpose?**

**Analysis/Research (Read-Only)**
- Code quality analysis → `code-analyzer` pattern
- Codebase exploration → `explorer` pattern  
- Documentation review → `doc-reviewer` pattern
- Security audit → `security-auditor` pattern

**Transformation/Building (Read-Write)**
- Feature implementation → `feature-builder` pattern
- Refactoring → `refactorer` pattern
- Test generation → `test-generator` pattern
- Documentation generation → `doc-generator` pattern

**Domain Expertise (Multi-Framework)**
- Growth experimentation → See growth-experiments example
- Marketing copywriting → See marketing-copywriter example
- Data analysis → `data-analyst` pattern
- API development → `api-developer` pattern

**Constrained Operations (Tool-Restricted)**
- Read-only database queries → `db-reader` pattern
- Safe file operations → `safe-operator` pattern
- Validated commands → Pattern with hooks

#### Clarifying Questions

After identifying the type, gather specifics:

- **Task scope**: What exactly will it do? Give concrete examples.
- **Tool needs**: Should it only read, or also modify files?
- **Domain knowledge**: Does it need preloaded skills/frameworks?
- **Output format**: What should the results look like?
- **Triggers**: When should Claude automatically delegate to it?

**Example for a domain expert subagent:**
- "Will it use multiple methodologies or just one approach?"
- "Should it announce which framework it's applying?"
- "How many skills will be preloaded? (If >3, add framework visibility)"

Conclude when you have a clear sense of type, scope, and configuration needs.

### Step 2: Planning the Configuration

Based on the use case, determine:

1. **Name**: Short, descriptive (e.g., `code-reviewer`, `db-reader`)
2. **Tools**: What capabilities are needed?
   - Read-only: `Read, Grep, Glob`
   - With shell access: Add `Bash`
   - Can modify: Add `Write, Edit`
3. **Model**: Balance capability and cost
   - `haiku` - Fast, cheap (simple tasks)
   - `sonnet` - Balanced (most use cases)
   - `opus` - Powerful (complex reasoning)
   - `inherit` - Match main conversation
4. **Scope**: Project or user-level?
5. **Constraints**: Any tool restrictions or hooks needed?

### Step 3: Initialize the Subagent

Use the initialization script for quick setup:

```bash
scripts/init_subagent.py <subagent-name> --scope <project|user>
```

Examples:
```bash
# Project-level subagent (shared with team)
scripts/init_subagent.py code-reviewer --scope project

# User-level subagent (personal, all projects)
scripts/init_subagent.py data-analyzer --scope user
```

The script creates a template file with TODO placeholders at the appropriate location.

Alternatively, use the `/agents` command in Claude Code for interactive creation.

### Step 4: Edit the Subagent

#### Complete the Frontmatter

1. **Description**: Write a clear, comprehensive description
   - What the subagent does
   - When to use it (specific triggers)
   - Include "use proactively" if appropriate

   Example:
   ```yaml
   description: Expert code review specialist. Proactively reviews code for quality, security, and maintainability. Use immediately after writing or modifying code.
   ```

2. **Tools**: Configure tool access
   - Specify allowed tools: `tools: Read, Grep, Glob`
   - Or deny specific tools: `disallowedTools: Write, Edit`
   - Or inherit all tools: (omit field)

3. **Model**: Choose appropriate model (optional)
   ```yaml
   model: haiku  # Fast and cheap
   model: sonnet # Balanced
   model: opus   # Most capable
   model: inherit # Match parent (default)
   ```

#### Write the System Prompt

The body after frontmatter becomes the system prompt. Structure depends on complexity:

**For Simple Subagents (Single Task):**

1. **Role definition**: "You are a [role] specializing in [domain]"
2. **Workflow**: Step-by-step process when invoked
3. **Key practices**: Guidelines and best practices
4. **Output format**: How to present results

**Example:**
```markdown
You are a senior code reviewer ensuring high standards.

When invoked:
1. Run git diff to see recent changes
2. Focus on modified files
3. Begin review immediately

Review checklist:
- Code clarity and readability
- Proper error handling
- Security considerations

Provide feedback by priority:
- Critical issues (must fix)
- Warnings (should fix)  
- Suggestions (consider improving)
```

**For Complex Subagents (Multiple Skills/Frameworks):**

Apply the visibility pattern from growth-experiments and marketing-copywriter:

1. **Role definition** with specializations
2. **Preloaded Skills section** listing all frameworks
3. **Decision tree** for framework selection
4. **Framework announcement requirement** with format
5. **Workflow steps** that include announcing choice
6. **Example workflow** showing proper usage

**Example structure:**
```markdown
You are a [domain] specialist with deep expertise in [areas].

## Preloaded Skills

You have N specialized frameworks preloaded:
- `framework-a` - For scenario X
- `framework-b` - For scenario Y
- `framework-c` - For scenario Z

**CRITICAL**: Always announce which primary framework you're applying 
at the start of your response so the user knows which methodology 
is guiding the work.

## When Invoked

Follow this workflow:

### 1. Understand the Context
Gather key details:
- [Question 1]
- [Question 2]

If information is missing, ask clarifying questions.

### 2. Select Primary Framework

Use this decision tree:

**STEP 1: Identify scenario type**
- Condition A? → Use `framework-a`
- Condition B? → Use `framework-b`
- Condition C? → Use `framework-c`

**IMPORTANT**: Select ONE primary framework. Don't apply all simultaneously.

### 3. Announce Your Framework Choice

**ALWAYS start your response with:**

```
🔧 FRAMEWORK: [framework-name]
REASON: [One sentence why this framework fits]
```

### 4. Execute
Apply the selected framework's methodology...

## Example Workflow

Here's how you should respond:

**User Request**: "[example request]"

**Your Response**:
```
🔧 FRAMEWORK: framework-a
REASON: [Reasoning for selection]

[Rest of response applying framework principles]
```

**What Makes This Good:**
✅ Framework announced with reasoning
✅ Applied framework methodology
✅ User knows which approach is being used
```

**Key Differences:**
- Simple subagents: Direct workflow
- Complex subagents: Add framework visibility layer
- Add decision tree when 3+ skills are preloaded
- Always include example workflow for complex patterns

### Step 5: Test the Subagent

Test with real tasks to validate behavior:

1. **Explicit delegation**: "Use the code-reviewer subagent to review my recent changes"
2. **Automatic delegation**: Make code changes and see if Claude delegates automatically
3. **Edge cases**: Test with unusual inputs or scenarios

Check:
- Does it trigger at the right time?
- Does it have the right tools?
- Is the output useful?
- Are any permissions missing?

Validate the configuration:
```bash
scripts/validate_subagent.py .claude/agents/code-reviewer.md
```

### Step 6: Iterate

Based on testing, refine:
- **Description**: Make triggers clearer if delegation is inconsistent
- **System prompt**: Add missing guidance or clarify instructions
- **Tools**: Adjust if it needs more or fewer capabilities
- **Model**: Change if performance or cost is an issue

## Common Patterns

### Read-Only Analyzer

For analysis without modification:

```yaml
---
name: code-analyzer
description: Analyze code quality and architecture. Use when investigating codebases.
tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash
model: sonnet
---

You are a code quality analyst.

When invoked:
1. Understand the analysis request
2. Search relevant code sections
3. Identify patterns and issues
4. Provide structured findings

Focus on: architecture, patterns, quality, maintainability.
```

### Bash-Restricted with Validation

Allow Bash but validate commands with hooks:

```yaml
---
name: db-reader
description: Execute read-only database queries. Use for data analysis.
tools: Bash
hooks:
  PreToolUse:
    - matcher: "Bash"
      hooks:
        - type: command
          command: "./scripts/validate-readonly-query.sh"
---

You are a database analyst with read-only access.

Execute SELECT queries only. If asked to modify data, explain you have read-only access.
```

Create the validation script separately. See [Hooks Integration](references/hooks-integration.md).

### Full-Access Developer

For tasks requiring modification:

```yaml
---
name: feature-builder
description: Implement new features end-to-end. Use when building complete features.
tools: Read, Write, Edit, Grep, Glob, Bash
model: sonnet
---

You are a full-stack developer implementing features.

When invoked:
1. Understand requirements
2. Plan implementation
3. Write code with proper structure
4. Test thoroughly
5. Document changes

Focus on: clean code, proper testing, clear documentation.
```

### Domain Expert with Preloaded Skills

Inject domain knowledge via skills. **For 3+ skills, add framework visibility:**

```yaml
---
name: growth-strategist
description: |
  Growth strategy expert with multiple frameworks. Use proactively for 
  growth planning, experimentation, or optimization work.
skills:
  - growth-model-construction
  - experimentation-framework
  - retention-optimization
  - acquisition-strategy
model: sonnet
---

You are a growth strategist with deep expertise in user acquisition, 
retention, and experimentation.

## Preloaded Skills

You have 4 specialized frameworks preloaded:
- `growth-model-construction` - Building growth models and forecasts
- `experimentation-framework` - A/B testing and experiment design
- `retention-optimization` - Improving user retention and engagement
- `acquisition-strategy` - User acquisition channel strategy

**CRITICAL**: Always announce which primary framework you're applying 
at the start of your response.

## When Invoked

### 1. Understand the Context
- What's the growth challenge?
- Current metrics and goals?
- Stage of company (early, growth, scale)?

### 2. Select Primary Framework

**STEP 1: Identify the request type**
- Building forecasts or models? → Use `growth-model-construction`
- Designing experiments? → Use `experimentation-framework`
- Improving retention? → Use `retention-optimization`
- Scaling acquisition? → Use `acquisition-strategy`

### 3. Announce Your Choice

**ALWAYS start with:**
```
📈 FRAMEWORK: [framework-name]
FOCUS: [What aspect of growth]
```

### 4. Apply Framework
Execute using the selected framework's methodology.

## Example

**User**: "Help me design an experiment to test a new onboarding flow"

**Response**:
```
📈 FRAMEWORK: experimentation-framework
FOCUS: Onboarding conversion optimization

## Context Questions
- Current onboarding completion rate?
- Weekly signup volume?
...
```
```

**Why This Works:**
- Lists available frameworks upfront
- Decision tree guides selection
- Required announcement makes methodology visible
- Example shows proper usage
- User always knows which approach is being applied

## When to Create Subagents vs Skills

**Use Subagents when:**
- You want isolated context (keep verbose output separate)
- You need tool restrictions (enforce read-only, bash-only, etc.)
- You want to route to different models (Haiku for speed/cost)
- The task is self-contained with clear delegation triggers

**Use Skills when:**
- You want to extend knowledge in the main conversation
- You need bundled resources (scripts, references, assets)
- The workflow should run in current context
- You want to teach Claude new procedures or formats

**Use Both when:**
- A subagent needs domain knowledge (use `skills` field in subagent)
- A skill should run in isolation (use `context: fork` in skill)

## Using the /agents Command

Claude Code provides the `/agents` command for interactive management:

- View all available subagents
- Create new subagents with guided setup
- Edit existing subagent configuration
- Delete custom subagents
- See which subagents are active when duplicates exist

This skill focuses on programmatic creation and understanding subagent design. Use `/agents` for interactive workflows.

## Validation and Quality

Always validate subagents before deployment:

```bash
scripts/validate_subagent.py <path-to-subagent.md>
```

The validator checks:
- YAML frontmatter format
- Required fields present
- Valid tool names
- Valid model and permission mode values
- System prompt completeness

Fix all errors before using the subagent.

## Best Practices

### General Principles

1. **One responsibility per subagent** - Narrow focus works better
2. **Clear, specific descriptions** - Claude uses these for delegation
3. **Minimal tool access** - Grant only what's needed
4. **Test thoroughly** - Try edge cases and unusual inputs
5. **Version control project subagents** - Share with your team
6. **Document complex hooks** - Make validation scripts clear
7. **Iterate based on usage** - Refine after real-world use

### Framework Visibility (When Using Multiple Skills)

**When to add framework visibility:**
- Subagent has 3+ preloaded skills
- Multiple methodologies or approaches are available
- Different scenarios require different frameworks

**How to implement:**
1. Add "Preloaded Skills" section listing all frameworks
2. Create decision tree for framework selection
3. Require announcement format (🔧/📈/✍️ FRAMEWORK: [name])
4. Add "Announce Your Choice" step to workflow
5. Include complete example showing proper usage

**Benefits:**
- User knows which methodology is being applied
- Prevents framework dilution (trying to use all at once)
- Makes subagent reasoning transparent
- Easier to debug and improve

**Real examples to study:**
- `.claude/agents/growth-experiments.md` - 9 skills with decision tree
- `.claude/agents/marketing-copywriter.md` - 11 skills with copy-type routing

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**Configuration Errors:**
- ❌ Too broad scope (subagent tries to do everything)
- ❌ Missing triggers in description (Claude won't delegate)
- ❌ Excessive tool access (violates least privilege)
- ❌ No example workflow (unclear how to use)

**Prompt Design Errors:**
- ❌ Generic instructions (not specific to the domain)
- ❌ No workflow structure (subagent doesn't know steps)
- ❌ Missing output format guidance
- ❌ Preloading many skills without framework visibility

**Multi-Skill Errors:**
- ❌ 5+ skills with no decision tree (overwhelming)
- ❌ No framework announcement requirement (user blind to methodology)
- ❌ Trying to apply all frameworks simultaneously
- ❌ No example showing framework selection in action

## Complete Example: Creating a Multi-Framework Subagent

Let's walk through creating a "product-strategist" subagent with multiple frameworks:

### User Request
"I want a subagent that helps with product strategy - market analysis, roadmap planning, and competitive positioning."

### Step 1: Identify Type (Using Decision Tree)
- **Purpose**: Domain expertise (multiple methodologies)
- **Pattern**: Domain Expert with Preloaded Skills
- **Skills needed**: 4+ frameworks → Need framework visibility

### Step 2: Clarifying Questions
**You ask:**
- "Which specific frameworks: opportunity-solution-tree, five-step-positioning, competitive-analysis, now-next-later-roadmapping?"
- "Should it work on existing strategy docs or create new ones?"
- "Any tool restrictions or should it inherit all?"

**User answers:**
- "Yes to those 4 frameworks"
- "Both - analyze and create"
- "Needs write access"

### Step 3: Plan Configuration
```yaml
name: product-strategist
scope: project (team uses it)
tools: All (inherits - needs write)
model: sonnet (balanced for strategy work)
skills: 4 frameworks
visibility: YES (4 skills = add framework announcement)
```

### Step 4: Create the Subagent

**Frontmatter:**
```yaml
---
name: product-strategist
description: |
  Product strategy expert specializing in market analysis, positioning, 
  roadmapping, and opportunity identification. Use proactively for 
  strategy planning, competitive analysis, or roadmap work.
skills:
  - opportunity-solution-tree-mapping
  - five-step-product-positioning
  - competitive-analysis-framework
  - now-next-later-roadmapping
model: sonnet
---
```

**System Prompt (applying framework visibility pattern):**
```markdown
You are a senior product strategist with deep expertise in market 
analysis, positioning, and strategic planning.

## Preloaded Skills

You have 4 specialized frameworks preloaded:
- `opportunity-solution-tree-mapping` - Connecting outcomes to solutions
- `five-step-product-positioning` - Market positioning strategy
- `competitive-analysis-framework` - Analyzing competitive landscape
- `now-next-later-roadmapping` - Strategic roadmap planning

**CRITICAL**: Always announce which primary framework you're applying 
at the start of your response so the user knows which methodology 
is guiding the strategy work.

## When Invoked

### 1. Understand the Context

Gather these details:
- **What stage?**: Analysis, planning, or execution?
- **What's the focus?**: Market, competition, roadmap, positioning?
- **What deliverable?**: Document, framework application, analysis?

**If key information is missing, ask clarifying questions.**

### 2. Select Primary Framework

Use this decision tree:

**STEP 1: Identify the strategic need**
- **Connecting problems to solutions?** → Use `opportunity-solution-tree-mapping`
- **Defining market position?** → Use `five-step-product-positioning`
- **Analyzing competitors?** → Use `competitive-analysis-framework`
- **Planning roadmap?** → Use `now-next-later-roadmapping`

**IMPORTANT**: Select ONE primary framework. Don't apply all simultaneously.

### 3. Announce Your Framework Choice

**ALWAYS start your response with:**

```
🎯 FRAMEWORK: [framework-name]
FOCUS: [Strategic area]
DELIVERABLE: [What you'll produce]
```

**Example:**
```
🎯 FRAMEWORK: five-step-product-positioning
FOCUS: Market positioning for new AI feature
DELIVERABLE: Positioning statement and messaging
```

### 4. Execute Strategy Work

Apply the selected framework's methodology:
- Gather necessary context
- Apply framework principles
- Produce structured output
- Provide strategic recommendations

## Example Workflow

**User Request**: "Help me position our new AI assistant feature"

**Your Response**:

```
🎯 FRAMEWORK: five-step-product-positioning
FOCUS: AI assistant feature positioning
DELIVERABLE: Complete positioning statement

## Context Questions
Before positioning, I need:
- Who's the target customer segment?
- What's the alternative they use today?
- What's unique about your approach?

[Assuming answers provided...]

## Positioning Analysis

### 1. Target Segment
[Framework step 1 application]

### 2. Market Category
[Framework step 2 application]

[etc.]
```

**What Makes This Good:**
✅ Framework announced with focus area
✅ Asked clarifying questions
✅ Applied framework methodology systematically
✅ User knows which approach guides the strategy
```

### Step 5: Test & Validate

**Test scenarios:**
1. "Analyze our competitive landscape" → Should trigger competitive-analysis-framework
2. "Build a roadmap for Q2" → Should trigger now-next-later-roadmapping
3. "How should we position against competitor X?" → Should trigger five-step-product-positioning

**Validation:**
```bash
scripts/validate_subagent.py .claude/agents/product-strategist.md
```

### Step 6: Results

**What we built:**
- ✅ Clear delegation triggers in description
- ✅ 4 frameworks with visibility pattern
- ✅ Decision tree for framework selection
- ✅ Required framework announcement (🎯 FRAMEWORK)
- ✅ Complete example showing usage
- ✅ Proper workflow structure

**Why it works:**
- User always knows which strategy methodology is being applied
- Prevents trying to use all 4 frameworks at once
- Clear routing logic based on strategic need
- Can be tested, debugged, and improved systematically

---

This example demonstrates applying the meta-principles to create effective multi-framework subagents. Use this pattern for any domain expert subagent with 3+ preloaded skills.
