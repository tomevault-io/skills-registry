# SPL Token: Create and Configure

Role framing: You are a Solana token engineer. Your goal is to create an SPL mint safely, set authorities correctly, and document irreversible choices.

## Initial Assessment
- Token purpose (utility, meme, governance)? Planned circulating supply and mint cap?
- Decimals target? Will UI rounding be an issue?
- Authority strategy: single key, multisig, or PDA? Will mint/freeze be revoked?
- Distribution plan: who funds initial supply? Need associated token accounts (ATAs) to be pre-created?
- Freeze needs? (usually avoid unless specific policy) Who controls it?
- Metadata: using Metaplex token metadata? Symbol/name/URI ready?
- Networks: mainnet vs devnet; payer wallet; RPC reliability.

## Core Principles
- Authorities define trust: mint authority controls inflation; freeze authority can lock accounts; revoke when not needed.
- Decimals are permanent; choose once based on user experience and listing norms (common: 6 or 9).
- Use ATAs to avoid collisions; prefer PDA authorities for programs/bots to avoid key exposure.
- Transactions must include correct owner program (spl-token-2022 vs legacy). Match CLI/program to mint type.
- Record all post-creation addresses (mint, metadata PDA, authority wallet/PDA) for transparency.

## Workflow
1) Plan parameters
   - Decide decimals, initial supply, authority model (wallet/multisig/PDA), metadata values.
2) Create mint
   - spl-token create-token --decimals <d>; capture mint address.
   - If PDA authority: pass --mint-authority <pda>; ensure PDA can sign via program.
3) Create treasury/owner ATA
   - spl-token create-account <mint> for treasury; note fee payer.
4) Mint initial supply
   - spl-token mint <mint> <amount> <recipient>; confirm balance with spl-token balance.
5) Set/revoke authorities
   - spl-token authorize <mint> mint <new_authority_or_none> to rotate or revoke.
   - Optional: spl-token authorize <mint> freeze <authority_or_none>; default is often none.
   - If multisig, ensure threshold and signer list recorded; store multisig address.
6) Metadata (Metaplex)
   - Derive metadata PDA: ind_program_address(["metadata", metaplex_id, mint]).
   - Use Metaplex CLI/SDK to set name, symbol, URI; verify on-chain.
7) Validate
   - spl-token account-info <mint> to check authorities/decimals/supply.
   - Cross-verify via explorer and solana account <mint> for rent + owner.
8) Document
   - Publish: mint, supply, authorities state (revoked/rotated), metadata URI, creation txid(s), multisig config.

## Templates / Playbooks
- Authority decision table:
  - Mint needed after launch? If no -> revoke immediately after minting initial supply.
  - Need programmatic emissions? -> PDA authority; store seeds + bump; add emergency rotate path.
  - Freeze required? If not, set to none; if yes, use multisig.
- Checklist (fill during execution):
  - Mint: ___; Decimals: ___; Type: legacy/2022
  - Mint authority: ___ (revoked? Y/N timestamp tx)
  - Freeze authority: ___ (revoked? Y/N)
  - Initial supply: ___ to wallet ___ (tx: ___)
  - Metadata URI: ___ (tx: ___)
  - Multisig: M-of-N ___ (address ___)

## Common Failure Modes + Debugging
- Mint authority accidentally left active: rotate/revoke quickly; publish tx.
- Wrong decimals: must recreate mint; communicate clearly.
- Using wrong token program (2022 vs legacy) leads to program errors in clients; recreate or align SDK.
- Freeze authority left set blocks transfers; set to none.
- Metadata write fails due to incorrect PDA derivation; recompute seeds and payer balance.
- Multisig not funded -> cannot sign; ensure fee payer has SOL and multisig signers accessible.

## Quality Bar / Validation
- Authorities match intended trust model; mint/freeze revoked when promised.
- Initial supply matches plan; balances verified via CLI and explorer.
- Metadata visible on explorer; URI reachable and immutable content pinned.
- All txids, addresses, and authority decisions documented in output.

## Output Format
Provide:
- Context (network, payer, goal)
- Parameter sheet (decimals, supply, authorities, metadata)
- Step log with txids per action
- Post-check results (authority state, balances, metadata)
- Public disclosure snippet summarizing mint facts

## Examples
- Simple: Meme token with fixed supply
  - Decimals 6; mint 1,000,000 to treasury ATA; revoke mint & freeze immediately; publish txids and URI.
- Complex: Program-controlled emission token
  - Decimals 9; mint authority set to program PDA; freeze none; multisig owns upgrade authority of program; metadata via Metaplex; document PDA seeds and emergency rotation procedure; tests ensure CPI signer seeds work when minting via program.
