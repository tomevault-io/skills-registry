# Coding Standards

Standards drawn from production service patterns. The goal is consistency — any engineer should read any service in your repository and immediately understand the patterns.

**Bundled references** (read when you need detailed configs or complete code examples):
- `references/checklist.md` — Universal pre-commit and code review checklist
- `references/<language>/checklist.md` — Language-specific checklist
- `references/<language>/examples.md` — Full code examples for every pattern below
- `references/<language>/tooling-config.md` — Build config, Dockerfile, CI/CD, environment settings

Where `<language>` is `python`, `java`, `csharp`, or `react` — determined by the project's `lao.config.yaml` or auto-detected at pipeline start. Multi-language projects load all detected packs; apply each to files of its language.

## Naming Conventions

Consistent naming makes code self-documenting. Apply the conventions of your language:

| What | Principle | Python | Java | C# | React/TS |
|------|-----------|--------|------|-----|----------|
| Functions/methods | Verb-first, descriptive | `snake_case` | `camelCase` | `PascalCase` | `camelCase` |
| Components | Noun, descriptive | N/A | N/A | N/A | `PascalCase` |
| Classes | Noun, descriptive | `PascalCase` | `PascalCase` | `PascalCase` | `PascalCase` |
| Interfaces | Describe capability | N/A | `PascalCase` | `IPascalCase` | `PascalCase` |
| Variables | Descriptive, no abbreviations | `snake_case` | `camelCase` | `camelCase` | `camelCase` |
| Constants | Immutable values | `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` | `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` | `PascalCase` | `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` |
| Booleans | Prefix with `is`/`has`/`can` | `is_active` | `isActive` | `IsActive` | `isActive` |
| Files | Match primary type | `snake_case.py` | `PascalCase.java` | `PascalCase.cs` | `PascalCase.tsx` |
| Private members | Indicate non-public scope | `_leading_underscore` | `private` keyword | `_camelCase` field | `private` keyword / `#` |
| Exception classes | Suffix `Error`/`Exception` | `AuthorizationError` | `AuthorizationException` | `AuthorizationException` | `AuthorizationError` |

**Universal rules regardless of language:**
- Variable names reflect purpose, not type (`userId` not `str1`)
- Boolean names are predicate-style (`isAuthenticated`, `hasPermission`)
- No single-letter variables outside loops
- If you need a comment to explain what a variable holds, the variable needs a better name

---

## Exception and Error Handling

Three-layer pattern: **define typed exceptions → catch specific → centralized handlers**.

### 1. Typed exception hierarchy

Never throw/raise generic exceptions. Define domain-specific error types for each failure category:
- Service-level errors (auth, validation, rate limiting)
- Domain-level errors (business rule violations, calculation failures)
- Infrastructure errors (external service failures, timeouts)

Each error type has a defined behavior: **retry-then-degrade**, **log-and-skip**, or **fail-fast**.

### 2. Catch specific first, generic last

Always catch the most specific exception type first. Generic catch should be a safety net only. Always log before re-raising.

### 3. Centralized error-to-response mapping

Map all exception types to HTTP status codes in one place. Error responses contain:
- Machine-readable error code (e.g., `bad_request`, `rate_limit_exceeded`)
- Human-readable message
- Never: stack traces, internal state, PII, field values

### Error propagation

- Engine/domain layer raises typed error
- Service boundary catches, logs full detail, returns user-safe summary
- API layer surfaces structured error response — never exposes internals

### Error tracking conventions

- Track errors that affect users or reliability (retries exhausted, auth failures, infrastructure failures)
- Don't track expected/handled conditions (successful retries, cache misses)
- Context on every tracked error: correlation ID, error type, relevant identifiers, stack trace. No PII.
- Severity: **P1** (pages on-call) for infrastructure-wide failures, **P2** (creates ticket) for isolated errors

---

## Structured Logging

Use your language's structured logging framework (Python: `structlog`, Java: SLF4J+Logback, C#: Serilog, React/TS: structured console + error tracking service).

**Log level decision matrix:**

| Level | When | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| `ERROR` | Unrecoverable failure needing attention | External service permanently unreachable, data corruption detected |
| `WARNING` | Degraded but continuing | Validation failed (retrying), resource not found (creating new) |
| `INFO` | Operational lifecycle event | Component registered, state saved, app startup |
| `DEBUG` | Detailed tracing (local dev only) | Truncated snippets, check values — **never** sensitive content in staging/production |

**Universal rules:**
- JSON output in production for machine-parseable logging
- Human-readable output in local dev
- Context binding at service entry points — inject correlation ID at minimum
- No PII in logs — log identifiers, never values. See **Security skill** for the full allowlist.
- No `print()` / `System.out.println()` / `Console.WriteLine()` in production code

---

## Tracing

Observability tracing provides visibility over request lifecycle and LLM execution paths.

- Trace ID correlates with the request's correlation ID
- Spans follow the request lifecycle hierarchy
- No PII or sensitive data content in traces — identifiers only
- Errors need a separate aggregation tool (see Error Tracking above)

See PROJECT.md for service-specific span hierarchy and tracing configuration.

---

## Project Structure

Separation of concerns — consistent layering regardless of language:

```
<root>/
    router/           # Route definitions only — no business logic
    service/          # Business logic, orchestration
    models/           # Data transfer objects, request/response schemas
    adapters/         # External service clients
    persistence/      # State storage (databases, caches)
    utils/            # Shared utilities
    config/           # Environment-based configuration
    test/
        unit/         # Fast, isolated, no external dependencies
        integration/  # Needs running services or mocked infrastructure
```

**Key principles:**
- Routes in router layer, logic in service layer. Never mix them.
- Models live in the models layer, not scattered across service files.
- External service clients are adapters — isolate them for testability.
- Configuration hierarchy based on deployment environment.

See `references/<language>/tooling-config.md` for the language-specific project layout.

---

## Configuration: Environment-Based Settings

Settings adapt per deployment stage using a hierarchy pattern:

```
BaseSettings          # All environments — shared defaults
├── PreProdSettings   # Pre-production defaults
│   ├── LocalSettings # Local dev overrides
│   └── CISettings    # CI overrides
└── ProdSettings      # Production overrides
```

**Universal rules:**
- Settings resolved from environment variables at startup
- Factory function returns the correct settings class based on environment identifier
- Singleton pattern — settings created once, cached for the process lifetime
- Secrets never stored as literal values — store references, resolve at runtime

---

## Secrets Management

Never hardcode secrets. Store references (secret paths, vault names, or key identifiers) in configuration; resolve actual values at runtime via a secrets manager.

**Rules:**
- Secrets stored as reference strings in settings, never as literal values
- Runtime retrieval via a secrets client with lazy caching
- Pre-warm secrets during app startup to fail fast if the backend is unreachable
- Never put secrets in environment variables, container layers, config files, or source code
- Lock files committed for reproducible dependency resolution

For security policy and secret-handling conventions, see the **Security skill** (`skills/security/`).

---

## App Initialization & Lifecycle

Key principle: **optional features fail softly without crashing startup**.

- Initialize required dependencies first (config, secrets, database connections)
- Optional integrations (observability, auth clients, caches) use graceful degradation — log the failure, continue without the feature
- Resource cleanup on shutdown via lifecycle management (context managers, shutdown hooks)

---

## Async Patterns

For languages/frameworks that support async I/O:

- **Never block the event loop.** Synchronous I/O or CPU-heavy work in async context stalls all concurrent requests.
- **Offload blocking work** to thread pools or background tasks.
- **Connection pooling** for HTTP clients with appropriate limits.
- **Shared resources** protected from race conditions (locks, atomic operations).
- **Singleton pattern** for expensive shared resources (HTTP sessions, database pools).

---

## Code Quality Tooling

Every project must have:

| Tool Category | Purpose | Enforcement |
|---|---|---|
| Formatter | Consistent code style | Pre-commit hook + CI |
| Linter / Static analysis | Catch bugs and anti-patterns | CI pipeline |
| Type checker | Type safety | CI pipeline (or IDE integration) |
| Test runner | Automated testing | CI pipeline |
| Dependency lock | Reproducible builds | Committed lock file |

See `references/<language>/tooling-config.md` for language-specific tool configuration.

Before committing or reviewing, consult `references/checklist.md` and `references/<language>/checklist.md` for the full verification checklist.
