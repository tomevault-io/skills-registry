# brain-review: Weekly Review

Walk the user through a comprehensive review of their entire workspace. This is the "reflect" phase — the practice that keeps the system trustworthy. Inspired by GTD's weekly review: get clear, get current, get creative.

## Trigger Phrases

- "Weekly review", "Let's review", "Review my projects"
- "How did this week go?", "What's the state of everything?"
- "End of week check-in", "Friday review"
- "What did I accomplish this week?"

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Gather Everything

Make these calls to build the full picture:

1. `get_brain_overview` — all projects and their stats
2. `query_todos` with `status: done` and `completed_after: [7 days ago]` — recent completions
3. `query_todos` with `status: open` — all open tasks
4. `query_todos` with `status: blocked` — blocked items
5. `get_dump_items` — inbox state

### Step 2 — Celebrate Progress

Start positive. Present what was accomplished this week:

> "This week you completed [N] tasks across [X] projects."

List the completed tasks grouped by project. Acknowledge effort — this is what keeps people motivated.

### Step 3 — Review Each Active Project

For each project with open tasks:

1. Show project name, open task count, and any in-progress/blocked items
2. Ask: "Is this still active? Anything changed?"
3. Look for signals:
   - **Stale tasks**: open tasks with no recent activity — ask if they're still relevant
   - **Blocked tasks**: surface them prominently — "This has been blocked. Can we unblock it?"
   - **Missing deadlines**: overdue tasks — "This was due [date]. What's the status?"

Keep this conversational, not interrogative. If a project is on track, a quick "Looks good, moving on" is fine.

### Step 4 — Identify Stale Work

Query for tasks that have been open a long time without progress:
- Tasks created > 2 weeks ago with status still `open` (never moved to `in-progress`)
- Flag these specifically:

> "These tasks have been sitting for a while. Want to reprioritize, defer, or drop any of them?"

Options for each:
- **Keep as-is** — still relevant, just not yet
- **Reprioritize** — change priority or add a due date to create urgency
- **Drop** — mark as done or delete if no longer needed
- **Break down** — maybe the task is too big; split into smaller tasks

### Step 5 — Process Inbox

If the inbox has items:
> "You have [N] items in your inbox. Want to do a quick triage?"

If yes, transition to the `brain-triage` workflow. If not, note it as a todo for next session.

### Step 6 — Look Ahead

Ask about the coming week:

> "Anything coming up next week? New deadlines, priorities, or projects?"

Create any new tasks or adjust priorities based on the response.

### Step 7 — Generate Review Note

Offer to create a weekly review note:

Call `create_daily_note` (or `create_project_note` in a "reviews" project) with a summary:
- Tasks completed this week
- Key decisions made during review
- Focus areas for next week
- Any items deferred or dropped

## Tool Sequence

```
get_brain_overview()
query_todos(status: done, completed_after: [7 days ago])
query_todos(status: open)
query_todos(status: blocked)
get_dump_items()
  → celebrate completions
  → review each project
  → surface stale/blocked work
  → (optionally) triage inbox
  → look ahead
  → update_todo() / delete_todo() / create_todo_in_project() as needed
  → create_daily_note() or create_project_note() with summary
```

## Notes

- The weekly review should take 5-15 minutes, not 45. Keep it moving.
- Do not read back every single task — summarize and highlight what needs attention
- If a project has > 10 open tasks, suggest the user focus on the top 3-5 rather than reviewing all
- Respect "skip" — if the user says a project is fine, move on without drilling in
- Tone: reflective and supportive — like a good coach checking in, not an auditor
- This is the most important skill for long-term system trust. If reviews happen, the system stays current.
