# CrushData AI - Data Analyst Skill

A data analyst intelligence skill that guides you through structured, professional data analysis workflows.

## How to Use This Skill

When user requests data analysis work (analyze, query, dashboard, metrics, EDA, cohort, funnel, A/B test), follow this workflow:

### Step 1: Discovery Protocol (MANDATORY)

**Before writing any code, ask the user:**

```
## Discovery Questions

1. **Business Context**
   - What business question should this analysis answer?
   - Who is the audience? (Executive, Analyst, Engineer)
   - What action will this analysis inform?

2. **Data Context**
   - Which tables/databases contain the relevant data?
   - What time range should I analyze?
   - Any known data quality issues?

3. **Metric Definitions**
   - How does YOUR company define the key metrics?
   - Any filters to apply? (exclude test users, internal accounts?)
   - What timezone should I use for dates?

4. **Script Organization**
    - Save all analysis scripts in an `analysis/` folder.
    - Create this folder if it does not exist.
   
5. **Python Environment**
   - Check for `venv` or `.venv`. If missing, `python3 -m venv venv`.
   - Install dependencies in venv (`venv/bin/pip install`).
   - Run scripts using venv python (`venv/bin/python`).

6. **Reports**
   - Save all profiling, validation, and findings to `reports/` folder.
   - Create this folder if it does not exist.
```

### 1b. Secure Data Access

> **Credentials are stored in the project's `.env` file** - never hardcoded.

- **Check Connections**: Run `npx crushdataai connections` first.
- **Missing Data?**: If the data source is not listed, **INSTRUCT** the user to run:
  `npx crushdataai connect`
- **Discover Schema**: Use `npx crushdataai schema <connection> [table]` to see available tables and columns.
- **Get Code**: **ALWAYS** use `npx crushdataai snippet <name>` to get loading code (uses env vars).
- **Load .env**: Scripts use `os.environ["VAR"]`. Ensure `python-dotenv` is installed and `.env` is loaded.
- **Security**: **DO NOT** ask user to copy/move files to `data/`. Treat connected data as read-only.

### Step 2: Search Relevant Domains

Use `search.py` to gather comprehensive information:

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/data-analyst/scripts/search.py "<query>" --domain <domain> [-n 3]
```

**Available domains:**
| Domain | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| `workflow` | Step-by-step analysis process |
| `metric` | Metric definitions and formulas |
| `chart` | Visualization recommendations |
| `cleaning` | Data quality patterns |
| `sql` | SQL patterns (window functions, cohorts) |
| `python` | pandas/polars code snippets |
| `database` | PostgreSQL, BigQuery, Snowflake tips |
| `report` | Dashboard UX guidelines |
| `validation` | Common mistakes to avoid |

**Industry-specific search:**
```bash
python3 .claude/skills/data-analyst/scripts/search.py "<query>" --industry saas|ecommerce|finance|marketing
```

**Recommended search order:**
1. `workflow` - Get the step-by-step process for this analysis type
2. `metric` or `--industry` - Get relevant metric definitions
3. `sql` or `python` - Get code patterns for implementation
4. `chart` - Get visualization recommendations
5. `validation` - Check for common mistakes to avoid

### Step 3: Data Profiling (MANDATORY Before Analysis)

Before any analysis, run profiling:

**Python:**
```python
print(f"Shape: {df.shape}")
print(f"Date range: {df['date'].min()} to {df['date'].max()}")
print(f"Missing values:\n{df.isnull().sum()}")
print(f"Sample:\n{df.sample(5)}")
```

**SQL:**
```sql
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_rows,
    COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as unique_users,
    MIN(date) as min_date,
    MAX(date) as max_date
FROM table;
```

**Report findings to user before proceeding:**
> "I found X rows, Y unique users, date range from A to B. Does this match your expectation?"

### Step 3b: Data Cleaning & Transformation (ETL)

**Address data quality issues found in Step 3:**
1. **Cleaning**: Handle missing values, remove invalid duplicates, fix types.
2. **Transformation**: Standardize categories, parse dates, normalize text.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create calculated columns needed for metrics.

*Tip: Save cleaning scripts to `etl/` folder. Save processed data to `data/processed/`.*

### Step 4: Execute Analysis with Validation

**Before JOINs:**
- Run on 100 rows first
- Check: Did row count change unexpectedly?
- Ask: "The join produced X rows from Y. Expected?"

**Before Aggregations:**
- Check for duplicates that could inflate sums
- Verify granularity: "Is this one row per user per day?"
- Ask: "Total = $X. Does this seem reasonable?"

**Before Delivery:**
- Sanity check order of magnitude
- Compare to benchmark or prior period
- Present for user validation before finalizing

## Workflow Reference

| Analysis Type | Search Command |
|--------------|----------------|
| EDA | `--domain workflow` query "exploratory data analysis" |
| Dashboard | `--domain workflow` query "dashboard creation" |
| A/B Test | `--domain workflow` query "ab test" |
| Cohort | `--domain workflow` query "cohort analysis" |
| Funnel | `--domain workflow` query "funnel analysis" |
| Time Series | `--domain workflow` query "time series" |
| Segmentation | `--domain workflow` query "customer segmentation" |
| Data Cleaning | `--domain workflow` query "data cleaning" |

## Common Rules

1. **Always ask before assuming** - Metric definitions vary by company
2. **Profile data first** - Never aggregate without understanding the data
3. **Validate results** - Check totals, compare to benchmarks
4. **Document assumptions** - State what filters and definitions you used
5. **Show your work** - Explain the logic behind complex queries

---

## Step 5: Generate Dashboard Output

**After analysis, save results for dashboard visualization:**

1. **Search for best chart type:**
   ```bash
   python3 .claude/skills/data-analyst/scripts/search.py "<metric description>" --domain chart
   ```

2. **Create dashboard JSON:**
   ```python
   from pathlib import Path
   import json
   from datetime import datetime
   
   Path("reports/dashboards").mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
   
   dashboard = {
       "metadata": {
           "title": "Analysis Dashboard",
           "generatedAt": datetime.now().isoformat(),
           "dataRange": f"{start_date} to {end_date}"
       },
       "kpis": [
           {"id": "kpi-1", "label": "Total Revenue", "value": "$50,000", "trend": "+12%", "trendDirection": "up"}
       ],
       "charts": [
           {
               "id": "chart-1",
               "type": "line",  # line, bar, pie, area, scatter, donut, table
               "title": "Monthly Trend",
               "data": {
                   "labels": ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar"],
                   "datasets": [{"label": "Revenue", "values": [10000, 15000, 25000]}]
               }
           }
       ]
   }
   
   with open("reports/dashboards/dashboard.json", "w") as f:
       json.dump(dashboard, f, indent=2)
   ```

### 5b. Making Charts Refreshable (Recommended)

To allow the user to refresh data directly from the dashboard:
1. Include a `query` object in the chart definition.
2. Run `npx crushdataai connections` to list available connection names (this is secure - no passwords shown).
3. Set `connection` to one of the listed names.
4. Set `sql` to the query used to generate the data.

> **SECURITY**: Never read `.env` directly to find connection names. Always use `npx crushdataai connections`.

```json
"query": {
    "connection": "my_postgres_db",
    "sql": "SELECT date, revenue FROM sales WHERE..."
}
```

**Database Specifics:**
- **SQL/Databases**: Provide the full SQL query.
- **Shopify**: Provide the resource name (e.g. `orders`).
- **CSV**: Provide the connection name. `sql` is ignored but required (set to "default").
- **MongoDB**: Provide the collection name in the `sql` field.

**Script-Based Refresh (for Python-aggregated charts):**

If your chart requires Python aggregation (e.g., grouping, custom calculations), use `script` instead of `connection`:

```json
"query": {
    "script": "analysis/my_dashboard_script.py"
}
```

When the user clicks Refresh, the CLI will **re-run your Python script**. The script should update the dashboard JSON file with fresh aggregated data.

> **TIP**: Use `script` for Shopify/API charts that need aggregation. Use `connection` + `sql` only for SQL databases where the query returns pre-formatted chart data.

3. **Tell user:**
   > "Dashboard ready! Run `npx crushdataai dashboard` to view."
