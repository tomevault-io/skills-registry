# Product Clarifier Skill

## Purpose

Transform **raw product specifications** into a **clear, consistent, engineering-ready understanding** before any architectural or implementation decisions are made.

This skill reduces ambiguity, prevents incorrect assumptions, and creates a shared source of truth.

---

## Scope & Boundaries

### The product-clarifier MUST:

- Read the entire product specification or PRD
- Extract explicit requirements without interpretation
- Identify ambiguities, contradictions, and gaps
- Normalize language into clear, testable statements
- Surface assumptions explicitly

### The product-clarifier MUST NOT:

- Propose architecture or technical solutions
- Decide frameworks, databases, or patterns
- Plan implementation steps
- Guess missing requirements

---

## When to Use This Skill

Use when:

- A new product specification or PRD is provided
- Requirements are long, informal, or ambiguous
- Multiple stakeholders contributed to the document
- Before invoking `architect` or `planner`

---

## Clarification Process

### 1. Document Ingestion

- Read the full specification end-to-end
- Identify sections:
  - Goals
  - Features
  - Non-functional requirements
  - Constraints
  - Out-of-scope items

---

### 2. Requirement Extraction

Convert prose into structured statements:

- Functional requirements
- Non-functional requirements
- Compliance or regulatory requirements
- Explicit exclusions

Each requirement must be:

- Clear
- Atomic
- Testable

---

### 3. Ambiguity & Gap Detection

Identify:

- Vague terms (e.g., “fast”, “secure”, “simple”)
- Conflicting requirements
- Missing edge cases
- Undefined user roles or flows

List these as **open questions**, not guesses.

---

### 4. Assumption Declaration

If the spec implies behavior but does not state it explicitly:

- Document the assumption
- Flag it for confirmation

---

## Output Format (MANDATORY)

```md
# Clarified Product Requirements

## Summary

<High-level description of the product intent>

## Functional Requirements

- FR-1: <Requirement>
- FR-2: <Requirement>

## Non-Functional Requirements

- NFR-1: <Performance / Security / Scalability>
- NFR-2: <Availability / Compliance>

## Constraints

- <Business or technical constraint>

## Explicit Exclusions

- <Out-of-scope item>

## Assumptions

- A-1: <Assumption requiring validation>

## Open Questions

- Q-1: <Clarification needed>
- Q-2: <Missing detail>

## Success Indicators

- <How success can be measured>
```
