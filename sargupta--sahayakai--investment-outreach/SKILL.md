# Investment Outreach Skill

This skill provides a structured workflow for generating high-impact outreach materials tailored to investors, academic collaborators, and strategic partners.

## Core Directives

1.  **Context-First Drafting**: Before drafting any content, you MUST reference the core project documentation. Use the [DOCUMENT_LOOKUP_META.md](file:///Users/sargupta/SahayakAIV2/sahayakai/outputs/investment_and_proposals/internal_reviews/DOCUMENT_LOOKUP_META.md) as your primary index to find the most relevant data.
2.  **Metadata-Aware Search**: Use the metadata guidelines in `DOCUMENT_LOOKUP_META.md` to identify whether a query requires "Technical Due Diligence" (e.g., `CHALLENGING_QUESTIONS.md`) or "Financial Projections" (e.g., `INVESTOR_MATERIALS.md`).
3.  **External Validation**: Use `search_web` to find the latest updates on the recipient or their firm to create a relevant and personalized "Hook."
4.  **Term Consistency**: Maintain the high-fidelity, Berkeley-standard tone established in the project's summit proposals.

## Workflow: Drafting Outreach

### Step 1: Metadata Lookup
Consult [DOCUMENT_LOOKUP_META.md](file:///Users/sargupta/SahayakAIV2/sahayakai/outputs/investment_and_proposals/internal_reviews/DOCUMENT_LOOKUP_META.md) to identify the "Primary Audience" and "Key Content" for the specific outreach target.

### Step 2: Internal Deep Dive (Selective)
Based on Step 1, read the targeted files. **SahayakAI_Whitepaper_2026.md** is the DEFAULT reference for all high-level narrative and vision.

Common combinations:
- **General/Vision Pitch**: [SahayakAI_Whitepaper_2026.md](file:///Users/sargupta/SahayakAIV2/sahayakai/outputs/investment_and_proposals/SahayakAI_Whitepaper_2026.md).
- **Financial Pitch**: [SahayakAI_Whitepaper_2026.md](file:///Users/sargupta/SahayakAIV2/sahayakai/outputs/investment_and_proposals/SahayakAI_Whitepaper_2026.md) + [INVESTOR_MATERIALS.md](file:///Users/sargupta/SahayakAIV2/sahayakai/outputs/investment_and_proposals/internal_reviews/INVESTOR_MATERIALS.md).
- **Technical/Research**: [SahayakAI_Whitepaper_2026.md](file:///Users/sargupta/SahayakAIV2/sahayakai/outputs/investment_and_proposals/SahayakAI_Whitepaper_2026.md) + [CHALLENGING_QUESTIONS.md](file:///Users/sargupta/SahayakAIV2/sahayakai/sahayakai-main/CHALLENGING_QUESTIONS.md).
- **Regional/Policy**: [SahayakAI_Whitepaper_2026.md](file:///Users/sargupta/SahayakAIV2/sahayakai/outputs/investment_and_proposals/SahayakAI_Whitepaper_2026.md) + [RURAL_INDIA_ROADMAP.md](file:///Users/sargupta/SahayakAIV2/sahayakai/sahayakai-main/RURAL_INDIA_ROADMAP.md).

### Step 2: Recipient Research
Use `search_web` to identify:
- Recent investments or public statements made by the individual/firm.
- Specific interest areas (e.g., EdTech, Emerging Markets, Decentralized AI).
- Any existing connections or overlapping interests with SARGVISION AI.

### Step 3: Content Synthesis
Construct the email or proposal using this structure:
- **Subject**: Compelling, high-context, and professional.
- **Hook**: A personalized observation based on Step 2.
- **Proof**: Specific, data-driven metrics from SARGVISION (e.g., 92% alignment, 68% cache hits).
- **The Ask**: A clear, low-friction next step (e.g., a 15-minute briefing).

## Standardized Terms

Use these terms consistently to maintain the SARGVISION identity:
- **Universal Learning Equity**: The core social mission.
- **Sovereign AI**: The resilient, localized technical framework.
- **Agent Garden**: The multi-agent orchestration topology.
- **Frugal Innovation**: Efficiency and cost-reduction at the network edge.
