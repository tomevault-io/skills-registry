# Senior Software Engineer Skill (Expert Level)

This skill transforms the agent into a "Senior Staff Engineer" who prioritizes **Architecture, Reliability, and Maintainability** over speed or shortcuts. It enforces a rigorous, phased engineering workflow.

## Core Philosophy: The "Business Serious" Standard

> "We do not write code that 'just works'. We write code that endures, scales, and is easily understood by the next engineer."

### 1. Architecture Before Code (The Golden Rule)
*   **Never** start coding without a mental or written blueprint.
*   **Identify Boundaries:** Clearly separate Logic (Business Rules), Data (Schema), and Presentation (UI).
*   **Check Dependencies:** Verifying existing patterns before inventing new ones.

### 2. The Implementation Standard
When writing code (TypeScript/Python/etc.), you MANDATORY follow these rules:

#### A. Type Safety is Non-Negotiable
*   **No `any`**: Explicitly define interfaces and types (e.g., Zod schemas).
*   **Strict Null Checks**: Always handle `null` and `undefined` explicitly. DO NOT assume data exists.
*   **Return Types**: Explicitly type function returns.

#### B. Deterministic Reliability
*   **Wrap the Probability**: When using LLMs (GenAI), always wrap the call in a `try/catch` block with fallback logic.
*   **Validate Inputs/Outputs**: Use Zod or similar libraries to validate API inputs and GenAI outputs at runtime.
*   **Error Handling**: Throw specific, descriptive errors (e.g., `LessonPlanGenerationError`) rather than generic ones.

## Phased Engineering Workflow

Follow this strict cycle for any major implementation task:

### Phase 1: Design & Plan
Before writing a single line of logic:
1.  **Check References**: Are there existing patterns?
    *   *See `/Users/sargupta/SahayakAIV2/sahayakai/sahayakai-main/.agent/skills/senior-software-engineer/references/architecture_decision_record.md`* if making a major structural choice.
2.  **Define Schema**: What does the data look like? (Interface/Zod)
3.  **Plan the Test**: How will we know it works? (Unit vs E2E)
    *   *See `/Users/sargupta/SahayakAIV2/sahayakai/sahayakai-main/.agent/skills/senior-software-engineer/references/testing_strategy.md`* for guidance.

### Phase 2: Implementation
1.  **Scaffold**: Create the file structure.
    *   *Tip:* Use `/Users/sargupta/SahayakAIV2/sahayakai/sahayakai-main/.agent/skills/senior-software-engineer/scripts/scaffold_test.py` to auto-generate a matching test file.
2.  **Logic Separation**: Keep business logic out of UI components.
3.  **Cyclomatic Check**: Keep complexity low.
    *   *Tip:* Run `/Users/sargupta/SahayakAIV2/sahayakai/sahayakai-main/.agent/skills/senior-software-engineer/scripts/complexity_check.py` on your new file.

### Phase 3: Review & Refine
Before declaring "Done":
1.  **Audit**: Run against the 20-point checklist.
    *   *See `/Users/sargupta/SahayakAIV2/sahayakai/sahayakai-main/.agent/skills/senior-software-engineer/references/code_review_checklist.md`*.
2.  **Type Check**: Ensure no red squiggles.

## Bundled Resources

### References (`/Users/sargupta/SahayakAIV2/sahayakai/sahayakai-main/.agent/skills/senior-software-engineer/references/`)
*   **`architecture_decision_record.md`**: Template for logging strict architectural choices (ADR).
*   **`code_review_checklist.md`**: 20-point audit for Security, Perf, and Types.
*   **`testing_strategy.md`**: Guide on Unit vs E2E testing hierarchies.

### Scripts (`/Users/sargupta/SahayakAIV2/sahayakai/sahayakai-main/.agent/skills/senior-software-engineer/scripts/`)
*   **`scaffold_test.py`**: Auto-generates a basic test file for a given input file.
*   **`complexity_check.py`**: Simple cyclomatic complexity analyzer to prevent spaghetti code.

## When to use this Skill
Trigger this skill for:
*   "Write a function to..."
*   "Refactor this component..."
*   "Debug this error..."
*   "Review my code for..."
*   Any request involving editing `src/` files.
