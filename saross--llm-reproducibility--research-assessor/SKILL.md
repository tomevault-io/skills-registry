# Research Assessor

Systematic extraction and assessment framework for research methodology, claims, and evidence in HASS disciplines (archaeology, biology, ethnography, ecology, literary studies, philology, etc.).

## What This Skill Does

This skill enables comprehensive extraction of research methodology and argumentation from academic papers through a structured multi-pass workflow:

1. **Claims & Evidence Extraction** (Pass 1 & 2) - Extract observations, measurements, claims, and implicit arguments
2. **RDMAP Explicit Extraction** (Pass 3) - Extract documented Research Designs, Methods, and Protocols from Methods section
3. **RDMAP Implicit Extraction** (Pass 4) - Extract undocumented or inferred RDMAP items from Results/Discussion
4. **RDMAP Rationalisation** (Pass 5) - Consolidate and refine all RDMAP items
5. **Validation** (Pass 6) - Verify structural integrity and cross-reference consistency

The extracted data enables assessment of research transparency, replicability, and credibility.

## When to Use This Skill

Use when users request:
- "Extract methodology from this paper"
- "Assess research transparency"
- "Extract claims and evidence"
- "Evaluate replicability"
- "Extract research designs and methods"
- Any task involving systematic analysis of research papers for methodology, argumentation, or credibility assessment

## Core Workflow

The complete extraction follows this sequence:

```
Blank JSON Template
    ↓
Claims/Evidence Pass 1 (liberal extraction)
    ↓
Claims/Evidence Pass 2 (rationalisation)
    ↓
RDMAP Pass 3 - Explicit (liberal extraction from Methods)
    ↓
RDMAP Pass 4 - Implicit (scan for undocumented items)
    ↓
RDMAP Pass 5 (rationalisation)
    ↓
Validation Pass 6 (integrity checks)
    ↓
Assessment-Ready Extraction
```

**Key principle:** Single JSON document flows through all passes. Each pass populates or refines specific arrays, leaving others untouched.

## Using This Skill

### Architecture: Skill + Runtime Prompts

This skill provides:
- **Core decision frameworks** (how to distinguish evidence/claims, assign tiers, consolidate items)
- **Schema definitions** (object structures, field requirements)
- **Reference materials** (checklists, examples)

The user provides:
- **Extraction prompts** (detailed instructions for each pass, provided at runtime)
- **Source material** (research paper sections to extract from)
- **JSON document** (template or partially populated from previous passes)

**Why this separation?** Extraction prompts evolve frequently through testing and refinement. This architecture allows prompt tuning without modifying the skill package, minimizing versioning conflicts.

### Step 1: Identify the Task

Users will typically request extraction at a specific pass. Listen for:
- "Extract claims/evidence Pass 1" → Liberal claims extraction
- "Rationalise the claims" → Claims Pass 2
- "Extract explicit RDMAP" → RDMAP Pass 3 (explicit only)
- "Extract implicit RDMAP" → RDMAP Pass 4 (implicit only)
- "Extract methodology" → RDMAP Pass 3 & 4
- "Rationalise RDMAP" → RDMAP Pass 5
- "Validate the extraction" → Pass 6

### Step 2: Receive the Extraction Prompt

The user will provide the extraction prompt for the specific pass they want. These prompts are:

**Claims/Evidence Extraction:**
- **Pass 1:** Liberal extraction prompt (comprehensive capture with over-extraction)
- **Pass 2:** Rationalisation prompt (consolidation and refinement)

**RDMAP Extraction:**
- **Pass 3:** Explicit extraction prompt (documented methodology from Methods section)
- **Pass 4:** Implicit extraction prompt (undocumented items from Results/Discussion)
- **Pass 5:** Rationalisation prompt (consolidation and verification of all RDMAP)

**Validation:**
- **Pass 6:** Unified validation prompt (structural integrity checks across all arrays)

The prompts contain detailed instructions, examples, and decision frameworks for that specific extraction pass. Follow the prompt provided.

### Step 3: Consult Supporting References As Needed

If you encounter uncertainty during extraction, consult:

**Core Extraction Principles:**
- `references/extraction-fundamentals.md` - Universal sourcing requirements, explicit vs implicit extraction, systematic implicit RDMAP patterns, systematic implicit arguments patterns with 6 recognition patterns (ALWAYS read first for all extraction passes)
- `references/verbatim-quote-requirements.md` - Strict verbatim quote requirements (prevents 40-50% validation failures)
- `references/verification-procedures.md` - Source verification for Pass 6 validation

**Schema & Structure:**
- `references/schema/schema-guide.md` - Complete object definitions with inline examples

**Decision Frameworks:**
- `references/checklists/tier-assignment-guide.md` - Design vs Method vs Protocol decisions
- `references/research-design-operational-guide.md` - Operational patterns for finding all Research Designs (4-6 expected)
- `references/checklists/consolidation-patterns.md` - When to lump vs split items, cross-reference repair procedure (CRITICAL for Pass 2 & Pass 5)
- `references/checklists/expected-information.md` - Domain-specific completeness checklists

**Examples:**
- `references/examples/sobotkova-example.md` - Complete worked example

### Step 4: Execute and Return

Follow the workflow guidance to:
1. Extract or rationalize content
2. Populate appropriate arrays in JSON
3. Leave other arrays untouched
4. Return the updated JSON document

## Key Extraction Principles

### Iterative Accumulation
- Single JSON document flows through all passes
- Each pass handles specific arrays only
- No merging step needed
- Flexible ordering (claims first OR RDMAP first)

### Liberal Then Rationalize
- **Pass 1:** Over-extract (40-50% more items expected) - comprehensive capture
- **Pass 2:** Consolidate (15-20% reduction target) - refined quality

### Separation of Concerns
- **Claims/Evidence passes (Pass 1 & 2):** Touch evidence, claims, implicit_arguments arrays ONLY
- **RDMAP passes (Pass 3, 4, & 5):** Touch research_designs, methods, protocols arrays ONLY
- **Validation pass (Pass 6):** Reads all, modifies none

### Cross-Reference Architecture
- Simple string ID arrays: `["M003", "M007"]`
- Bidirectional consistency enforced
- Works across object types (methods reference claims, protocols reference evidence)

## Core Decision Frameworks

### Evidence vs. Claims

**Evidence** = Raw observations requiring minimal interpretation
- Direct measurements, observations, data points
- Someone could verify by checking the source
- Example: "125.8 person-hours" or "12 students owned smartphones"

**Claims** = Assertions that interpret or generalize
- Require reasoning or expertise to assess
- Make inferences beyond direct observation
- Example: "The platform was efficient" or "Data quality was high"

**Test:** "Does this require expertise to assess or just checking sources?"

### RDMAP Three-Tier Hierarchy

Research Designs (WHY), Methods (WHAT), Protocols (HOW).

**For complete tier assignment guidance:** See `references/checklists/tier-assignment-guide.md`

### Consolidation Logic

Evidence items with **identical claim support patterns** that are **never cited independently** should be consolidated.

**For complete algorithm, examples, and cross-reference repair:**
→ See `references/checklists/consolidation-patterns.md`

## Important Notes

**For testing/debugging:**
- Can validate partial extractions (RDMAP-only or claims-only)
- Each pass can be tested independently
- Start with blank template OR pre-populated arrays

**Expected outcomes:**
- Pass 1 & 3: Comprehensive (intentional over-capture)
- Pass 2 & 5: ~15-20% reduction through consolidation
- Pass 4: Implicit items added (typically 20-40% of RDMAP total)
- Pass 6: Validation report (no modifications)

**Token efficiency:**
- Only load workflow file needed for current pass
- Schema/examples load only when uncertain
- Minimal context bloat

## Quick Reference

**Common user patterns:**
- User provides extraction prompt + source material → Extract according to prompt
- "Help me understand this extraction" → Consult schema and examples
- "Should I consolidate these?" → Check consolidation-patterns.md
- "Is this a Design, Method, or Protocol?" → Check tier-assignment-guide.md
- "What information is expected?" → Check expected-information.md

**Working with prompts:**
- User provides the full extraction prompt for the current pass
- Follow the prompt's instructions precisely
- Use skill references to resolve ambiguities
- Document uncertainties in extraction_notes

**Always:**
- Preserve other arrays unchanged
- Document consolidations with metadata
- Flag uncertainties in extraction_notes
- Return complete JSON document

**The user will provide the detailed extraction prompt for each pass. Use this skill's reference materials to support decision-making during extraction.**
