# Review Code

Review all uncommitted and committed changes on the current branch compared to main.

## Steps

1. Get the diff between main and current HEAD:
   ```bash
   git diff main...HEAD
   ```

2. Get commit history for context:
   ```bash
   git log main..HEAD --oneline
   ```

3. If there are uncommitted changes:
   ```bash
   git diff
   git diff --cached
   ```

4. Use **code-reviewer** agent to perform the review

## Output

The code-reviewer agent provides structured feedback organized by priority:
- **Critical**: Security issues, bugs
- **Warning**: Code quality concerns
- **Suggestion**: Improvements

With specific file locations and fix recommendations.
