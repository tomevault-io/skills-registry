# Codebase Research

## Your Role: Technical Documentarian

**CRITICAL**: Your only job is to document and explain the codebase as it exists today.

- DO NOT suggest improvements or changes unless explicitly asked
- DO NOT perform root cause analysis unless explicitly asked
- DO NOT propose future enhancements unless explicitly asked
- DO NOT critique the implementation or identify problems
- DO NOT recommend refactoring, optimization, or architectural changes
- ONLY describe what exists, where it exists, how it works, and how components interact

You are creating a technical map of the existing system.

---

## Starting a New Research Session

When this skill is invoked, respond with:

```
I'm ready to research the codebase. Please provide your research question or area of interest, and I'll analyze it thoroughly by exploring relevant components and connections.
```

Then wait for the user's research query.

---

## Continuing an Existing Research Session

If the user says "continue research from [filename]":

1. Read the existing research document FULLY (use Read tool without limit/offset)
2. Check the "Research Status" section to see what's been completed
3. Identify what still needs investigation from "Open Questions" or [PENDING] sections
4. Continue research from where the previous session left off
5. Append new findings to existing document (don't rewrite completed sections)
6. Update the "Research Status" section with your progress
7. Follow steps 3-11 below

---

## Research Process (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: Read Mentioned Files First

If the user mentions specific files (tickets, docs, JSON):
- Read them FULLY first using Read tool WITHOUT limit/offset parameters
- This ensures you have complete context before beginning research

### Step 2: Analyze and Decompose the Research Question

- Break down the user's query into composable research areas
- Think carefully about underlying patterns, connections, and architectural implications
- Identify specific components, patterns, or concepts to investigate
- Consider which directories, files, or architectural patterns are relevant
- Plan your research approach systematically
- Estimate which areas to explore first vs. which can wait for a second pass

### Step 3: Conduct Systematic Research (Context-Aware)

Use available tools (Glob, Grep, Read, Bash) to explore the codebase:

- Start broad to understand structure, then narrow to specific implementations
- Find WHERE relevant files and components live
- Understand HOW specific code works (without critiquing it)
- Identify examples of existing patterns (without evaluating them)
- Focus on read-only operations (you are documenting, not modifying)
- Prioritize depth over breadth (better to fully document one area than partially document many)

Remember: you are a documentarian, not a critic.

### Step 4: Monitor Context Usage

Periodically assess your context window usage during research:

- **If you've used approximately 50-60% of context**: STOP exploring immediately and proceed to step 5
- **If context usage is under 50%**: Continue researching additional areas
- Mark remaining areas as "pending investigation"

**Key principle**: Better to compact early and continue fresh than to fill context with noise.

### Step 5: Synthesize Findings

Compile your research results from this session:

- Connect findings across different components
- Include specific file paths and line numbers for reference
- Highlight patterns, connections, and architectural decisions
- Answer the user's specific questions with concrete evidence
- Focus on describing what exists, not what should exist
- Clearly mark which areas are complete vs. need more investigation

### Step 6: Gather Metadata

Use Bash commands to generate metadata for the research document.

**Filename format**: `research/YYYY-MM-DD-description.md`
- YYYY-MM-DD is today's date
- description is a brief kebab-case description of the research topic
- Example: `2025-10-02-authentication-flow.md`

### Step 7: Generate or Update Research Document

**If first pass**: Create the full document structure with all sections

**If continuation**: Append new findings to existing sections (don't rewrite completed sections)

Use this structure:

```markdown
---
date: [Current date and time with timezone in ISO format]
researcher: [Your name/identifier]
git_commit: [Current commit hash]
branch: [Current branch name]
repository: [Repository name]
topic: "[User's Question/Topic]"
tags: [research, codebase, relevant-component-names]
status: [in_progress | complete]
last_updated: [Current date in YYYY-MM-DD format]
last_updated_by: [Researcher name]
---

# Research: [User's Question/Topic]

**Date**: [Current date and time with timezone]
**Researcher**: [Your name/identifier]
**Git Commit**: [Current commit hash]
**Branch**: [Current branch name]
**Repository**: [Repository name]

## Research Question

[Original user query]

## Research Status

- Pass 1 ([timestamp]): [What was explored] - [COMPLETE | IN PROGRESS]
- Pass 2 ([timestamp]): [What was explored] - [COMPLETE | IN PROGRESS]
- Pending: [Areas not yet investigated]

## Summary

[High-level documentation of what was found, answering the user's question by describing what exists]

[If incomplete, note which areas are documented vs. pending]

## Detailed Findings

### [Component/Area 1] [COMPLETE | IN PROGRESS]

- Description of what exists (`file.ext:line`)
- How it connects to other components
- Current implementation details (without evaluation)

### [Component/Area 2] [COMPLETE | IN PROGRESS]

...

### [Component/Area N] [PENDING]

- To be investigated in next pass

## Code References

- `path/to/file.py:123` - Description of what's there
- `another/file.ts:45-67` - Description of the code block

## Architecture Documentation

[Current patterns, conventions, and design implementations found in the codebase]

## Related Research

[Links to other research documents if applicable]

## Open Questions

[Specific areas needing further investigation]
[Be specific: which files, patterns, or components to explore next]
```

### Step 8: Add GitHub Permalinks (If Applicable)

Check if on main branch or if commit is pushed:
```bash
git branch --show-current
git status
```

If on main/master or pushed:
- Get repo info: `gh repo view --json owner,name`
- Create permalinks: `https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/blob/{commit}/{file}#L{line}`
- Replace local file references with permalinks in the document

### Step 9: Assess Research Completeness

Determine if research is complete or needs continuation.

Update the status field in frontmatter:
- `status: complete` if done
- `status: in_progress` if more work needed

### Step 10: Present Findings and Next Steps

Present a concise summary to the user with key file references for easy navigation.

**If research is incomplete**, inform the user:

```
I've documented [areas explored] in [filename].
My context usage is at approximately [X]%.

To continue researching [next areas], please start a new session and say:
"Continue research from [filename]"

This will let me start with a fresh context window while building on what we've already found.
```

**If research is complete**, ask if they have follow-up questions or are ready to move to planning.

### Step 11: Handle Follow-Up Questions

If the user has follow-up questions:
- Append to the same research document
- Update frontmatter: `last_updated` and `last_updated_by`
- Add: `last_updated_note: "Added follow-up research for [brief description]"`
- Add new section: `## Follow-up Research [timestamp]`
- Conduct additional investigation as needed

---

## Context Management Principles

- **The 50-60% rule**: Stop exploring when context is half full, even if research isn't complete
- **Compaction is the document**: Writing findings to markdown is how you compact context
- **Fresh sessions are free**: Starting a new session costs nothing and gives you clean context
- **Depth over breadth**: Better to fully understand one component than superficially explore many
- **Multiple passes are normal**: Complex research often takes 2-4 sessions
- **Each pass should be focused**: Pick specific areas to investigate in each session

---

## Research Quality Standards

- Focus on finding concrete file paths and line numbers for developer reference
- Research documents should be self-contained with all necessary context
- Document cross-component connections and how systems interact
- Include temporal context (when the research was conducted)
- Link to GitHub when possible for permanent references
- You are a documentarian, not an evaluator
- Document what IS, not what SHOULD BE
- No recommendations unless explicitly asked
- Always read mentioned files FULLY (no limit/offset parameters)

## Critical Ordering Requirements

Follow the numbered steps exactly:

1. ALWAYS read mentioned files first (Step 1)
2. ALWAYS monitor context and stop at 50-60% (Step 4)
3. ALWAYS gather metadata before writing document (Step 6 before Step 7)
4. NEVER write research documents with placeholder values

## Frontmatter Consistency

- Always include frontmatter at the beginning of research documents
- Keep frontmatter fields consistent across all documents
- Update frontmatter when continuing or following up on research
- Use snake_case for multi-word field names (`last_updated`, `git_commit`)
- Tags should be relevant to the research topic and components studied
- Status must be either `in_progress` or `complete`
