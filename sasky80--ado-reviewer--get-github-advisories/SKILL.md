# Get GitHub Advisories

## Platform Note

- Clean-install path: use the Go command from `.github/tools/skills-go`.

## Authentication

Set `GH_SEC_PAT` to a GitHub Personal Access Token.

- Fine-grained PATs work and do not require extra permissions for this endpoint.
- Public unauthenticated calls are possible, but this skill intentionally requires `GH_SEC_PAT` to avoid stricter anonymous rate limits.

## Arguments

| # | Name | Required | Description |
|---|------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | ecosystem | Yes | Package ecosystem (`npm`, `pip`, `maven`, `nuget`, `go`, `rust`, etc.) |
| 2 | package | Yes | Package name in the selected ecosystem |
| 3 | version | No | Package version to check (`affects=package@version`) |
| 4 | severity | No | Advisory severity filter (`low`, `medium`, `high`, `critical`, `unknown`) |
| 5 | per_page | No | Max advisories to return (1..100, default: 30) |

## Examples

```bash
go run ./.github/tools/skills-go/cmd/skills-go get-github-advisories npm lodash 4.17.20 high 20
```

## Output

Returns a JSON array of advisory objects from `https://api.github.com/advisories`, including fields like `ghsa_id`, `cve_id`, `severity`, `summary`, and `vulnerabilities`.
