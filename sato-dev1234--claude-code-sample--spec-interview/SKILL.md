## Steps

1. Resolve ticket:

   - Else → invoke ticket-reader list, ask user to select via AskUserQuestion → TICKET_PATH

2. Read `<TICKET_PATH>/requirements.md`

3. Conduct detailed interview using AskUserQuestion about:
   technical implementation, UI/UX, concerns, tradeoffs, etc.
   Avoid obvious questions; focus on clarifying ambiguities and edge cases.

4. Continue interviewing in-depth until specification is complete.

5. Write the spec to `<TICKET_PATH>/requirements.md`

6. Regenerate knowledge-refs.md:
   - Extract keywords from updated requirements
   - Read $KNOWLEDGE_DIR/tag-index.json
   - Match keywords against tags
   - Determine workflow sections
   - Generate KNOWLEDGE_REFS_DATA JSON
   - Invoke ticket-writer:
     ```
     OPERATION=add-knowledge-ref
     TICKET_PATH=$TICKET_PATH
     KNOWLEDGE_REFS_DATA=$KNOWLEDGE_REFS_DATA
     ```

7. Report spec-interview summary in Japanese

8. Create /design task:
   - TaskCreate:
     - subject: "Run /design"
     - description: "Generate design document from requirements for ticket $TICKET_ID"
     - activeForm: "Running /design"
     - metadata: {skill: "design", args: "ticket=$TICKET_ID", autoRun: true}
