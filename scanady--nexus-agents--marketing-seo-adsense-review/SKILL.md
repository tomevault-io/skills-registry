# AdSense Site Review

Perform a comprehensive review of a live website that mimics the Google AdSense human review process. Produces a detailed pass/fail report with specific, actionable remediation steps.

## Purpose

Simulate Google's AdSense site approval review by crawling and analyzing a live website against all known approval criteria — with special emphasis on "low value content" signals, the #1 rejection reason.

---

## Execution Logic

**Check $ARGUMENTS first to determine execution mode:**

### If $ARGUMENTS is empty or not provided:
Respond with:
"marketing-seo-adsense-review loaded. Provide the URL of the site you want reviewed (e.g., https://example.com)"

Then wait for the user to provide the URL in the next message.

### If $ARGUMENTS contains a URL:
Extract the URL and proceed immediately to Task Execution.

### If $ARGUMENTS contains content but no URL:
Ask the user to provide the site URL before proceeding.

---

## Task Execution

When a URL is available (either from initial $ARGUMENTS or follow-up message):

### 1. MANDATORY: Read Reference Files FIRST
**BLOCKING REQUIREMENT — DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP**

Before doing ANYTHING else, you MUST use the Read tool to read every file in `./references/`. This is non-negotiable.

Reference files to read:
- `./references/review-criteria.md` — Complete review criteria checklist
- `./references/low-value-content-signals.md` — Deep-dive on low value content detection
- `./references/common-rejections.md` — Common rejection reasons and fixes
- `./references/sources.md` — Official Google source URLs

**DO NOT PROCEED** to Step 2 until you have read all reference files and have their content in context.

### 2. Gather Site Context

If the user has provided additional context (e.g., rejection emails, error messages, site type, niche), note it. The specific rejection reason guides which areas to prioritize.

Common rejection reasons to watch for:
- **Low value content** (most common — triggers deep content analysis)
- **Insufficient content**
- **Site navigation issues**
- **Content policy violations**
- **Traffic source issues**

### 2a. Identify Site Type (BEFORE Crawling)

Before beginning the crawl, classify the site into one of these types based on the URL, homepage, and any user-provided context:

- **Editorial/Blog** — Article-driven content, news, commentary
- **Tool/Calculator** — Single or multi-function utility (converters, generators, calculators)
- **Database/Directory** — Entity-based pages (recipes, products, companies, places, apps, ingredients)
- **E-commerce** — Product listings and purchases
- **Portfolio/Business** — Services, credentials, case studies
- **Hybrid** — Combination of the above

**If the site type is Database, Directory, or Tool**, activate a specific analysis branch for Step 4:
- Are the entity/detail pages substantive? Do they contain **meaningful prose blocks** beyond structured data fields (names, prices, ratings, tags)?
  - If **yes (substantive prose exists):** Flag the **repositioning path** — detail pages may already qualify as informational content with proper title tags, meta descriptions, and schema markup. Do not default to "add a blog" until you have evaluated whether the detail pages satisfy content depth requirements.
  - If **no (mostly structured fields, minimal prose):** Flag **content enrichment** as the primary fix — entity pages need added descriptions, context, and editorial commentary before AdSense submission.
- Record the site type in the report header. It will affect which diagnostic questions apply in Step 4.

### 3. Crawl the Live Site

**This step is critical. You must actually visit and analyze the live site.**

Use browser tools (Playwright MCP `browser_navigate`, `browser_snapshot`, `browser_click`) or `fetch_webpage` to systematically crawl the site. You need to visit and analyze **multiple pages**, not just the homepage.

#### 3a. Homepage Analysis
- Navigate to the provided URL
- Take a snapshot of the full page
- Document: page title, meta description, visible content, navigation structure, footer links
- Note: word count estimate, content depth, visual layout

#### 3b. Discover and Map Site Structure
From the homepage, identify and list ALL navigable pages:
- Main navigation links
- Footer links
- Sidebar links
- Internal content links
- Sitemap (check /sitemap.xml)

**You must visit a minimum of 10 pages** (or all pages if fewer than 10 exist). Prioritize:
1. All main navigation pages
2. Content/blog pages (at least 3-5 if they exist)
3. About page
4. Contact page
5. Privacy policy page
6. Terms of service page
7. Any "thin" looking pages from navigation

#### 3c. Per-Page Deep Analysis
For EACH page visited, document:
- **URL**: Full page URL
- **Title**: Page title tag content
- **Word Count Estimate**: Approximate word count of substantive content (exclude nav, footer, boilerplate)
- **Content Type**: Article, landing page, product page, about page, etc.
- **Content Depth**: Shallow (< 100 words), Thin (100-300 words), Adequate (300-600 words), Rich (600+ words)
- **Originality Assessment**: Does this appear to be original content or templated/generic?
- **Value Assessment**: Would a user find this page genuinely useful?
- **Navigation Working**: Can the user easily navigate to/from this page?
- **Ads Present**: Any existing ad placements visible?
- **Issues Found**: Specific problems detected

#### 3d. Blog Content Pattern Check (Required for sites with blog or article sections)

If the site has blog or article content, perform this check across ALL blog posts found before proceeding to Step 4:

- **Publication date spread**: Note the date of every post. **Flag** if all or most posts were published within a 2-week window, regardless of how recent they are.
- **Byline attribution**: Note the author name(s). **Flag** if all posts use a generic byline (e.g., "Team," "Admin," "Staff," site name, or no byline at all) with no linked author bio or credentials.
- **Post length consistency**: Estimate content length across posts. **Flag** if every post is approximately the same length (±15%), suggesting batch generation rather than organic editorial production.
- **Voice and experience signals**: Does any post include personal anecdotes, specific real-world experience, first-person perspective, or original opinion? **Flag** if none do.

If **2 or more** of these patterns are present simultaneously, include a `WARN: AI Batch Content Pattern Detected` finding in the report that lists each triggered signal. This pattern is one of the most reliable AI-content flags Google's systems use and is a high-risk rejection signal even when the content reads as acceptable in isolation.

#### 3e. Technical Checks
Visit these specific URLs:
- `{domain}/ads.txt` — Check existence and validity
- `{domain}/privacy-policy` or `{domain}/privacy` — Check existence and completeness
- `{domain}/terms` or `{domain}/terms-of-service` — Check existence
- `{domain}/sitemap.xml` — Check existence
- `{domain}/robots.txt` — Check for issues

### 4. Run the Full Review

Using the data gathered in Step 3, systematically evaluate the site against EVERY criterion in `references/review-criteria.md`. Score each category.

#### Phase 1: Content Quality Assessment (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
This is the #1 reason sites get rejected. Be brutally honest.

**Minimum Content Requirements:**
- Does the site have enough pages with substantive content?
- Google typically wants to see **at least 15-30 pages of quality content** for a new site
- Each content page should have **at least 300-500+ words of original, useful text**
- Content must be in complete sentences and paragraphs, not just headlines or bullet points

**Content Value Signals (what Google reviewers look for):**
- Is there a clear niche/topic focus?
- Does the content demonstrate expertise, experience, authoritativeness, or trustworthiness (E-E-A-T)?
- Would a user bookmark or share this content?
- Does the site offer something competitors don't?
- Is there a reason for users to return?
- Is content regularly updated (check dates if visible)?

**Low Value Content Red Flags (what triggers rejection):**
- Pages with mostly images/video and little text
- Pages with only a few sentences
- Template/boilerplate content that looks auto-generated
- Content that exists solely to host ads
- Duplicate or near-duplicate content across pages
- Thin affiliate content without original value-add
- "Coming soon" or placeholder pages
- Pages behind login walls inaccessible to Google
- Content scraped or copied from other sites
- Pages optimized for keywords rather than users
- AI-generated content without human editorial value-add

**Content Depth Scoring:**
- Score each page: PASS (sufficient), WARN (borderline), FAIL (insufficient)
- Calculate overall site content score

#### Phase 2: User Experience & Navigation
- Is the site navigation clear, intuitive, and functional?
- Can users find content within 2-3 clicks?
- Is the menu/navigation bar well-organized?
- Are there broken links?
- Is the site mobile-responsive?
- Does the page load quickly?
- Is the layout clean and readable?
- Are there excessive pop-ups or interstitials?

#### Phase 3: Site Identity & Trust
- Is there a clear About page explaining who runs the site?
- Is there a Contact page with real contact information?
- Is the site purpose/niche immediately obvious?
- Does the site look professional and trustworthy?
- Is there an author/publisher identity established?

#### Phase 4: Technical Compliance
- **ads.txt**: Present, valid format, correct publisher ID?
- **Privacy Policy**: Exists, accessible, discloses cookies/tracking/third-party ads, mentions Google, opt-out info?
- **Terms of Service**: Present?
- **Cookie Consent**: Present for EU visitors?
- **HTTPS**: Is the site served over HTTPS?
- **Sitemap**: Does sitemap.xml exist?
- **Robots.txt**: Is it blocking important content?

#### Phase 5: Policy Compliance
- No prohibited content categories
- No ads on error pages, under-construction pages, or low-content pages
- Ad-to-content ratio (if ads already placed)
- Better Ads Standards compliance
- No deceptive/misleading content
- Content in a supported language
- **Restricted category check**: Is the site in a sensitive-but-legal niche (alcohol, gambling, pharmaceuticals, dating, firearms)? If yes, note that the site may pass content review but receive near-zero ad fill if the publisher has not opted in to restricted categories in AdSense Blocking Controls. Flag this as an action item in the remediation roadmap even if content quality is otherwise good.

#### Phase 6: Search Engine Presence
- Does the site appear to be indexed by Google?
- Is there evidence of organic traffic potential?
- Are pages structured for discoverability (proper titles, meta descriptions, headings)?

### 5. Generate the Review Report

Produce a comprehensive, structured report:

## Writing Rules

### Core Rules
- Be brutally honest — false passes waste the user's time and another rejection cycle
- Every finding must reference the specific Google policy it relates to
- Every issue must have a specific, actionable fix — not vague advice
- Score conservatively — if in doubt, flag it as a warning
- The #1 goal is to prevent another "low value content" rejection

### Assessment Rules
- Judge content as a Google reviewer would, not as a friend
- A page with 50 words of text and a large image is THIN content, period
- Template/framework boilerplate does NOT count as content
- Navigation text, footer text, and sidebar text do NOT count toward content word count
- "Coming soon", placeholder, and under-construction pages are automatic FAILs
- A site with fewer than 10 substantive content pages is almost certainly going to be rejected

### Report Rules
- Always include the page-by-page analysis table — this is the most actionable section
- Always include the remediation roadmap with priorities
- Always include specific "when to resubmit" criteria
- Never recommend resubmitting immediately unless the site genuinely passes all checks

---

## Output Format

The output should be the complete Review Report as specified in Step 5 above. The report uses markdown formatting with tables, headers, and checklists.

---

## References

**These files MUST be read using the Read tool before task execution (see Step 1):**

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `./references/review-criteria.md` | Complete scored review criteria matching Google's evaluation |
| `./references/low-value-content-signals.md` | Deep-dive on detecting and fixing "low value content" — the #1 rejection reason |
| `./references/common-rejections.md` | All common AdSense rejection reasons with specific fixes |
| `./references/sources.md` | Official Google documentation URLs for policy references |

**Why these matter:** The reference files encode the actual Google AdSense review criteria derived from official documentation, rejection patterns, and Google's own guidance. They ensure the review covers exactly what Google checks and that recommendations map directly to policy requirements.

---

## Quality Checklist (Self-Verification)

Before finalizing the review report, verify ALL of the following:

### Pre-Execution Check
- [ ] I read all reference files before starting
- [ ] I have the reference content in context

### Crawling Check
- [ ] I visited the homepage and took a snapshot
- [ ] I visited at least 10 pages (or all pages if fewer than 10)
- [ ] I checked ads.txt, privacy policy, sitemap.xml, robots.txt
- [ ] I documented word count and content depth for every page visited

### Assessment Check
- [ ] Content quality scored honestly, not generously
- [ ] Every score justified with specific evidence
- [ ] Low value content signals checked thoroughly
- [ ] Technical compliance fully verified
- [ ] Policy compliance checked against all categories

### Report Check
- [ ] Report follows the Output Format template exactly
- [ ] Every critical issue has a specific fix
- [ ] Page-by-page analysis table is complete
- [ ] Remediation roadmap is prioritized
- [ ] "When to resubmit" criteria are specific and measurable
- [ ] Overall verdict is justified by the scores

**If ANY check fails → revise before presenting.**

---

## Defaults & Assumptions

- **Target standard:** New site applying for AdSense (stricter review than established site)
- **Content minimum:** At least 15-30 pages of substantive (300+ word) original content
- **Privacy policy:** Must exist, be accessible, and mention third-party advertising/cookies
- **ads.txt:** Must exist at domain root with valid Google publisher entry
- **Navigation:** Must have clear, working navigation accessible from every page
- **Mobile:** Site must be mobile-responsive (Google reviews from mobile too)
- **Language:** Content must be primarily in an AdSense-supported language
- **Age of site:** Newer sites face stricter scrutiny — flag if domain appears very new
- **If no rejection reason provided:** Assume "low value content" and run full review
- **If specific rejection reason provided:** Prioritize that area but still run full review
