# EEGPrep Feature Development

Use this workflow when building a new EEGPrep feature.

## Workflow

1. Switch to `origin/develop`, pull from `origin`, and create a new branch with
   an appropriate name.

2. For every feature to be developed, look at EEGLAB first and find equivalent
   implementations if they exist. Go through those implementations thoroughly.
   Match functionality and UX where relevant, and inspect every plausible user
   flow and edge case.

3. As you work maintain a running .notes/implementation-notes.html file that captures anything I should know about how the implementation diverges from or interprets the spec, including:
- Design decisions: choices you made where the spec was ambiguous
- Deviations: places where you intentionally departed from the spec, and why
- Tradeoffs:  alternatives you considered and why you picked what you did
- Open questions: anything you'd want me to confirm or revise

4. Plan how to build the features within EEGPrep's existing structure. Read and
   follow `AGENTS.md`. Plan thoroughly, and break down the work into steps.

5. Execute the plan and write code. Do not take shortcuts. Maintain current coding conventions and
   follow `AGENTS.md`. Write tests as described there. Aim for more than 90%
   coverage for the changed feature code, and ensure the tests pass.
   Remember, while we are doing a porting project, EEGPrep must work well standalone and must be a delight to use for EEG Researchers.
   For user-facing `pop_*` or menu actions, preserve the `eegprep-console`
   workspace contract: return `(EEG, com)` with `return_com=True`, update
   GUI state through `EEGPrepSession`, and keep `EEG`/`ALLEEG`/history visible
   from both the GUI and the console. Make the GUI-plus-console workflow feel
   seamless for researchers who switch between menus/dialogs, command history,
   and workspace inspection.
   Whenever a user-facing API, GUI, console, workflow, plugin, or help behavior
   changes, update the relevant Sphinx docs and packaged help resources in the
   same branch. The docs should describe EEGPrep as a standalone Python/Qt
   application first, with EEGLAB comparisons only where they help users
   migrate, understand parity decisions, or handle file/indexing boundaries.
   For mixed GUI plus `eegprep-console` features, document both the user
   workflow and the `EEGPrepSession` state that stays synchronized.

6. For features that involve a GUI component, use the
   [`eeglab-gui-visual-parity`](../eeglab-gui-visual-parity/SKILL.md) skill to
   iteratively develop the GUI so the UI/UX is familiar to EEGLAB users. Follow
   EEGPrep's current GUI conventions, keep performance and user experience high,
   and do not take shortcuts. You must ensure that there is visual parity with EEGLAB for GUI based features; alignment, arrangement, button placement, labels, text fields, default values, enabled states, and control flow are important.

7. Simulate how users would exercise each feature with the
   [`gui-agent-flow-qa`](../gui-agent-flow-qa/SKILL.md) skill and Codex's GUI
   Agent. Cover typical user flows, including loading data from `sample_data`,
   and use every feature developed in the branch as a user would. Also cover
   edge cases that are likely from a user's point of view. For interactive
   features, include mixed GUI plus `eegprep-console` flows: act in the GUI,
   inspect/use `EEG` in the console, then run a console command and verify the
   GUI/history refresh. Wherever relevant use the cursor and keyboard like the user would actually use the app.  Fix any bugs that surface.

8. After implementation and GUI parity/QA work, write additional regression
   tests and integration tests for behaviors discovered during testing,
   including `tests/test_console_workspace.py` when shared workspace sync or
   console wrappers are affected.

9. Review the current feature branch against `origin/develop`. Use the
   [`github-pr-review`](../github-pr-review/SKILL.md) skill when appropriate.

10. Act on review findings. Do not take shortcuts while addressing findings. If any findings are
    not fixed, report them to the user at the end. If GUI features are involved,
    return to Step 5, then repeat Step 8 until the branch looks good.

11. When implementation matches the plan and all required tests succeed, create
    a draft PR to `origin/develop` as described in `AGENTS.md`. The PR must include
    all features requested by the user.

12. After creating the PR, tell the user everything that was done, especially
    anything that should be flagged for their attention.
