# Skill Factory 🏭

**Meta-skill for generating domain-specific Claude Skills for your team.**

This skill helps you create production-ready skills tailored to the Dual-Domain LLM Platform (AI Dev Cockpit + Enterprise).

## How It Works

When you say something like:
- "Create a skill for deploying models to RunPod"
- "I need a skill to manage Supabase auth flows"
- "Build a skill that helps with theme consistency"
- "Automate cost optimization analysis"

I will:
1. **Analyze** your codebase to understand the domain
2. **Generate** a complete skill with YAML frontmatter and instructions
3. **Add supporting files** (scripts, templates, references) if needed
4. **Test** the skill description for Claude's discovery
5. **Document** how to use it

## Project Context

This factory knows about your platform:

### **Architecture**
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
- **Services**: RunPod (deployment, vLLM), HuggingFace (model discovery)
- **Auth**: Supabase with MFA, RBAC, organizations
- **Testing**: Playwright E2E, chaos engineering, performance tests
- **Themes**: Dual-domain (AI Dev Cockpit dark/terminal, Enterprise light/corporate)

### **Key Service Areas**
```
src/services/
  ├── runpod/          # 7 services (client, deployment, monitoring, rollback, cost, vllm)
  ├── huggingface/     # 11 services (api, cache, circuit-breaker, webhooks, unified-llm)
  ├── inference/       # Streaming and model management
  └── monitoring/      # Observability and metrics
```

### **Common Workflows**
1. Model deployment (HuggingFace → RunPod → vLLM)
2. Cost estimation and optimization
3. Auth operations (user, org, RBAC)
4. Theme management (dual-domain consistency)
5. E2E testing and validation
6. Performance monitoring and chaos testing

## Skill Generation Process

### Step 1: Understand the Need
Ask clarifying questions:
- What workflow are you trying to automate?
- What files/services are involved?
- Who will use this skill? (you, team, specific role)
- What's the expected frequency? (daily, per-feature, rarely)

### Step 2: Analyze the Codebase
Search for relevant files:
```bash
# Find services
find src/services -name "*keyword*"

# Search for patterns
grep -r "specific function" src/

# Check existing components
ls src/components/[area]/
```

### Step 3: Generate the Skill

Create `SKILL.md` with:
```yaml
---
name: descriptive-skill-name
description: Clear description of what it does AND when to use it. Include trigger keywords.
allowed-tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob

# Skill Name

Brief overview of what this skill does.

## When to Use This Skill

- Specific scenario 1
- Specific scenario 2
- Specific scenario 3

## Instructions

Step-by-step workflow:

1. **First step** - Clear action
2. **Second step** - What to check
3. **Third step** - How to proceed

## Examples

### Example 1: Common Use Case
\`\`\`bash
# Command to run
\`\`\`

Expected outcome: ...

### Example 2: Edge Case
...

## Files Involved

- `src/services/[service]/file.ts` - Purpose
- `src/components/[area]/Component.tsx` - Purpose

## Best Practices

- Do this
- Don't do that
- Watch out for...

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Common problem
**Solution**: How to fix it
```

### Step 4: Add Supporting Files (if needed)

**Reference docs** (`REFERENCE.md`):
- Detailed API documentation
- Complex workflows
- Advanced configurations

**Scripts** (`scripts/helper.sh`):
- Automation utilities
- Validation scripts
- Quick commands

**Templates** (`templates/template.ts`):
- Code templates
- Configuration files
- Boilerplate

**Examples** (`examples/example.md`):
- Real-world usage
- Complete workflows
- Before/after comparisons

### Step 5: Test Discovery

Ensure the description triggers correctly:
- Include **action verbs**: "deploy", "manage", "analyze", "create"
- Add **domain terms**: "RunPod", "vLLM", "Supabase", "Qwen"
- Specify **when to use**: "Use when...", "Activates when..."
- List **trigger phrases**: "model deployment", "cost optimization"

### Step 6: Document Usage

Add to team CLAUDE.md:
```markdown
## Available Skills

### skill-name
**Purpose**: Brief description
**When to use**: Trigger conditions
**Example**: "Deploy Qwen model to RunPod"
```

## Skill Templates

See [templates/](templates/) for common patterns:
- `service-skill.md` - Wrapping a service layer
- `workflow-skill.md` - Multi-step process automation
- `analysis-skill.md` - Code analysis and reporting
- `testing-skill.md` - Test generation and validation

## Examples

See [examples/](examples/) for complete skills:
- `runpod-deployment-example.md` - Full deployment skill
- `theme-management-example.md` - Theme consistency skill
- `cost-analysis-example.md` - Cost optimization skill

## Skill Naming Conventions

✅ **Good names**:
- `runpod-deployment` - Clear, specific
- `supabase-auth-ops` - Domain + action
- `cost-optimization` - Descriptive

❌ **Avoid**:
- `helper` - Too vague
- `utils` - Not descriptive
- `misc-tools` - Unfocused

## Best Practices for Skills

### Keep Skills Focused
One skill = one capability
- ✅ "Deploy models to RunPod"
- ❌ "Do everything with models"

### Write Clear Descriptions
Include both **what** and **when**:
```yaml
description: Deploy Chinese LLM models (Qwen, DeepSeek, ChatGLM) to RunPod serverless with vLLM. Use when deploying models, checking deployment status, or configuring vLLM settings.
```

### Use Progressive Disclosure
- Core instructions in SKILL.md (< 200 lines)
- Details in REFERENCE.md
- Complex workflows in separate docs
- Claude reads additional files only when needed

### Test with Real Questions
Ask questions that should trigger the skill:
- "How do I deploy a Qwen model?"
- "Check the status of my RunPod deployment"
- "Optimize vLLM configuration for DeepSeek"

### Version Your Skills
Add version history in SKILL.md:
```markdown
## Version History
- v1.1.0 (2025-11-06): Added support for ChatGLM-4
- v1.0.0 (2025-11-05): Initial deployment skill
```

## Skill Discovery Tips

### High-Priority Skills Needed

Based on your codebase, create skills for:

1. **runpod-deployment** (CRITICAL)

## Maintenance

### Updating Skills
When project evolves, update skills:
```bash
# Review skill effectiveness
grep -r "skill-name" .claude/skills/

# Update description for better discovery
# Add new examples
# Update file references
```

### Deprecating Skills
If a skill is no longer needed:
1. Add deprecation notice to SKILL.md
2. Suggest replacement skill
3. Keep for 2 weeks
4. Then remove directory

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Morning Routine
```
User: "What should I work on today?"
→ Uses task management skills
→ Prioritizes based on complexity
→ Suggests relevant skills to use
```

### Feature Development
```
User: "Implement authentication for org management"
→ Uses supabase-auth-ops skill
→ Reads existing auth patterns
→ Generates consistent code
→ Updates tests
```

### Code Review
```
User: "Review this deployment code"
→ Uses runpod-deployment skill
→ Checks best practices
→ Validates cost optimization
→ Suggests improvements
```

## Ready to Build?

Say something like:
- "Create a skill for deploying models"
- "I need a skill to help with auth"
- "Build me a theme management skill"
- "What skills should we create first?"

I'll guide you through the creation process! 🏭
