<objective>
Provide a comprehensive mapping from task types to the optimal agent, skill, model tier, and fallback strategy. Eliminates guesswork when choosing which agent to use for a given task.
</objective>

<quick_start>
**Find the right agent:**
1. Identify your task type (debug, review, build, explore, etc.)
2. Look up the primary agent in the matrix below
3. If primary fails, use the fallback
4. Match model tier to task complexity
</quick_start>

<success_criteria>
- Task routed to the correct primary agent on first attempt
- Fallback agent identified if primary is unavailable or insufficient
- Model tier matched to task complexity (Haiku for search, Sonnet for code, Opus for architecture)
- Zero-cost tools (TaskCreate, TeamCreate) used for progress tracking instead of API calls
- Agent selection justified by the matrix rather than ad-hoc guessing
</success_criteria>

<triggers>
- "which agent", "route task", "agent for this", "best agent"
- "capability matrix", "agent selection", "what tool should I use"
- "task routing", "agent routing"
</triggers>

## Model Tier Guide

| Tier | Model | Cost/1M In | Best For |
|------|-------|-----------|----------|
| **Fast** | Haiku 4.5 | $1.00 | Search, classify, review, simple tasks |
| **Standard** | Sonnet 4.6 | $3.00 | Code generation, reasoning, most tasks |
| **Premium** | Opus 4.6 | $5.00 | Architecture, complex decisions, planning |
| **Free** | TaskCreate | $0 | Progress tracking (local UI, not an API call) |

**Default to Sonnet** unless:
- Task is search/classify → use Haiku (5x cheaper)
- Task requires deep reasoning → use Opus (5x more capable)
- Task is progress tracking → use TaskCreate with `activeForm` for live spinners (zero cost)

**Cross-references:** [subagent-teams](../subagent-teams-skill/SKILL.md) for in-session parallel agents, [agent-teams](../agent-teams-skill/SKILL.md) for worktree-isolated parallel agents.

**Deep dive:** See `reference/matrix-table.md`, `reference/selection-flowchart.md`

## Emit Outcome Sidecar

As the final step, write to `~/.claude/skill-analytics/last-outcome-agent-capability-matrix.json`:
```json
{"ts":"[UTC ISO8601]","skill":"agent-capability-matrix","version":"1.0.0","variant":"default",
 "status":"[success|partial|error]","runtime_ms":[estimated ms from start],
 "metrics":{"tasks_routed":[n],"agents_matched":[n],"fallbacks_used":[n]},
 "error":null,"session_id":"[YYYY-MM-DD]"}
```
Use status "partial" if some stages failed but results were produced. Use "error" only if no output was generated.
