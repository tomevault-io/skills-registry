<objective>
Build revenue analytics infrastructure on HubSpot API + SQL data warehouse. Covers ICP validation, ML lead scoring, competitive intelligence, activity analysis, and pipeline forecasting — bridging CRM data into actionable intelligence products.
</objective>

<quick_start>
1. Create a HubSpot Private App with required CRM scopes (contacts, companies, deals, owners, timeline)
2. Confirm SQL replica access and schema prefix for your data warehouse
3. Run ICP validation query (UC1) to segment conversion rates
4. Build pipeline forecast (UC5) using stage-specific historical win rates
</quick_start>

<success_criteria>
- HubSpot Private App authenticated with all required scopes
- SQL warehouse connected and data freshness validated (sync lag < 24h)
- At least one use case (ICP, scoring, competitive, activity, forecast) producing results
- Lead scoring model trained on 200+ historical closed deals with measurable AUC
- Enrichment pipeline writing scores back to HubSpot without duplicates
</success_criteria>

# HubSpot RevOps Analytics

Revenue analytics infrastructure on HubSpot API + SQL data warehouse.
Bridges CRM data → analytics → intelligence products → revenue impact.

**Scope:** HubSpot-specific analytics stack. For basic CRM CRUD, use `crm-integration-skill`. For generic dashboards, use `data-analysis-skill`.

## Setup Checklist

### 1. HubSpot Private App

**Note:** Tim's HubSpot is accessed via the Epiphan CRM MCP connector — no Private App setup needed. All hubspot_* tools are available directly.

Create at Settings → Integrations → Private Apps:

| Scope | Permission | Why |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| `crm.objects.contacts.read/write` | Read/Write | Contact enrichment |
| `crm.objects.companies.read` | Read | Company data |
| `crm.objects.deals.read/write` | Read/Write | Pipeline analytics |
| `crm.schemas.custom.read` | Read | Custom objects |
| `crm.objects.owners.read` | Read | Rep attribution |
| `timeline` | Read | Activity data |

### 2. SQL Replica Access

Discovery questions for your data warehouse:

| Question | Options |
|----------|---------|
| Where is HubSpot data replicated? | Snowflake / BigQuery / Postgres / Redshift |
| What ETL tool syncs it? | Fivetran / Airbyte / Stitch / HubSpot Data Sync |
| Sync frequency? | Real-time / Hourly / Daily |
| Schema prefix? | `hubspot.` / `raw_hubspot.` / custom |

### 3. Python Environment

```bash
pip install hubspot-api-client pandas scikit-learn requests
```

```python
# SDK initialization
from hubspot import HubSpot
client = HubSpot(access_token="pat-na1-xxxxx")

# Or raw requests
import requests
HEADERS = {"Authorization": "Bearer pat-na1-xxxxx", "Content-Type": "application/json"}
BASE = "https://api.hubapi.com"
```

## Core Use Cases

| # | Use Case | Input | Output | Tools |
|---|----------|-------|--------|-------|
| 1 | ICP Validation | Contact + company data | Segment conversion rates | SQL + Clay |
| 2 | Lead Scoring | Historical deals | Win probability per lead | SQL + ML + API |
| 3 | Competitive Intel | Deal close reasons | Win/loss by competitor | SQL + webhook |
| 4 | Activity Analysis | Engagement data | Activity→outcome correlation | SQL |
| 5 | Pipeline Forecast | Open deals + stage history | Weighted revenue forecast | SQL |

### Use Case Details

**UC1 — ICP Validation:** Join contacts + companies + deals in SQL, segment by industry/size/geo, compute conversion rates per segment. Feed results to Clay MCP waterfall for enrichment:
   1. `find-and-enrich-company` or `find-and-enrich-contacts-at-company` to identify target contacts
   2. `add-contact-data-points` / `add-company-data-points` to queue enrichment jobs
   3. `get-existing-search` to poll for results and check `state: completed`
   4. Write enriched data back to HubSpot via API or Epiphan CRM integration
   
   Alternative: Use Apollo MCP (`apollo_people_match`) for direct enrichment without waterfall wait.

**UC2 — Lead Scoring:** Train GradientBoostingClassifier on historical won/lost deals. Features: company size, industry, engagement score, days in pipeline. Deploy scores back to HubSpot as custom property.

**UC3 — Competitive Intel:** Extract competitor mentions from deal `closed_lost_reason`. Build win/loss matrix by competitor. Trigger webhook alerts on competitive displacement patterns.

**UC4 — Activity Analysis:** Correlate email opens, meetings booked, calls logged with deal outcomes. Identify which activities actually move deals forward.

**UC5 — Pipeline Forecast:** Calculate weighted forecast using stage-specific win rates from historical data. Factor in deal age, velocity, and rep performance.

> **Reference:** See `reference/sql-analytics.md` for complete SQL templates per use case.

## Golden Rules for Prospect Quality

**Tim's BDR targeting criteria (as of March 2026)** — Apply these filters before outreach:

```sql
-- Exclude existing customers and channels
WHERE lifecyclestage NOT IN ('customer')
  AND custom.first_conversion NOT LIKE '%Pearl%' 
  AND custom.first_conversion NOT LIKE '%setup%'
  AND custom.first_conversion NOT LIKE '%Connect%'
  AND custom.first_conversion NOT LIKE '%signup%'
  AND device_count < 1
  AND is_channel = false

-- Target only AE territories (Lex Evans, Ron Epstein, Phillip Sandler)
  AND hubspot_owner_id IN (82625923, 423155215, 190030668)

-- Optionally segment by company size, industry, location
```

**Use this filter in:**
- ICP Validation queries (UC1) before Clay enrichment
- Lead scoring model (UC2) training data
- Prospect research cadence (prospect-research-to-cadence-skill)

**Note:** See `phone-verification-waterfall-skill` for full Golden Rules implementation with Clay MCP integration.

## Quick Reference: HubSpot API Endpoints

| Object | Endpoint | Key Operations |
|--------|----------|----------------|
| Contacts | `/crm/v3/objects/contacts` | Search, create, update, batch |
| Companies | `/crm/v3/objects/companies` | Search, associate to contacts |
| Deals | `/crm/v3/objects/deals` | Pipeline, stage history |
| Engagements | `/crm/v3/objects/engagements` | Emails, calls, meetings |
| Properties | `/crm/v3/properties/{object}` | Custom property CRUD |
| Associations | `/crm/v4/associations/{from}/{to}` | Object linking |
| Search | `/crm/v3/objects/{object}/search` | Filter + sort (max 10k) |

> **Reference:** See `reference/api-guide.md` for auth, SDK patterns, batch operations.

## Quick Reference: SQL Object Model

| HubSpot Object | SQL Table (typical) | Key Columns | Join Key |
|----------------|---------------------|-------------|----------|
| Contacts | `hubspot.contacts` | email, lifecycle_stage, lead_score | contact_id |
| Companies | `hubspot.companies` | domain, industry, employee_count | company_id |
| Deals | `hubspot.deals` | amount, stage, close_date, pipeline | deal_id |
| Deal Stages | `hubspot.deal_stage_history` | stage, timestamp, duration | deal_id |
| Engagements | `hubspot.engagements` | type, created_at, contact_id | engagement_id |
| Owners | `hubspot.owners` | email, first_name, team | owner_id |

**Join pattern:** contacts → associations → companies/deals (via association tables)

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Exceeding 100 requests/10s rate limit | Use batch endpoints, add exponential backoff |
| Using Search API for >10k results | Switch to SQL warehouse for bulk analytics |
| Hardcoded property internal names | Fetch property definitions first: `GET /crm/v3/properties/{object}` |
| Missing association API for object links | Use v4 associations: `POST /crm/v4/associations/{from}/{to}/batch/read` |
| SQL `DATEDIFF` in Postgres | Use `AGE()` or `EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM ...)` — see dialect notes |
| Not handling HubSpot's `hs_object_id` | Always include `hs_object_id` in property requests |
| Missing phone numbers after enrichment | Use Clay waterfall after Apollo: Apollo first (fast, free), then Clay MCP (`find-and-enrich-contacts-at-company` → `add-contact-data-points` → `get-existing-search`) for phone verification. Clay aggregates 50+ data providers for high match rates. |
| Scoring model trained on small dataset | Need 200+ closed deals minimum for reliable ML scores |
| Apollo-only enrichment missing data | Clay MCP as fallback: Create taskId with `find-and-enrich-company`, then `add-contact-data-points` for Email/phone/work history, poll results with `get-existing-search` |

## Emit Outcome Sidecar

As the final step, write to `~/.claude/skill-analytics/last-outcome-hubspot-revops.json`:
```json
{"ts":"[UTC ISO8601]","skill":"hubspot-revops","version":"1.0.0","variant":"default",
 "status":"[success|partial|error]","runtime_ms":[estimated ms from start],
 "metrics":{"queries_executed":[n],"reports_generated":[n],"insights_found":[n]},
 "error":null,"session_id":"[YYYY-MM-DD]"}
```
Use status "partial" if some stages failed but results were produced. Use "error" only if no output was generated.
