<objective>
Manage parallel development across ALL projects using git worktrees with Claude Code agents. Each worktree is an isolated copy of the repo on a different branch, stored centrally at `~/tmp/worktrees/`. This enables multiple agents to work simultaneously without conflicts.
</objective>

<quick_start>
**Create a single worktree with agent:**
```
/worktree create feature/auth
```

Claude will:
1. Allocate ports (8100-8101)
2. Create worktree at `~/tmp/worktrees/[project]/feature-auth`
3. Install dependencies
4. Create WORKTREE_TASK.md for the agent
5. Launch terminal with Claude Opus 4.6 agent
</quick_start>

## Native --worktree Flag (Claude Code v2.1.49+)

Claude Code now has built-in worktree support:

```bash
# Named worktree
claude --worktree feature-auth   # or: claude -w feature-auth

# Auto-generated name
claude -w
```

### What It Does

- Creates worktree at `<repo>/.claude/worktrees/<name>/`
- Branch: `worktree-<name>` (auto-created from default remote branch)
- On exit: auto-cleanup if no changes; prompts to keep/remove if changes exist

**Tip:** Add `.claude/worktrees/` to `.gitignore`

### When to Use Native vs This Skill

| Scenario | Use |
|----------|-----|
| Quick isolated work, single agent | `claude -w feature-name` |
| Multi-agent teams, port allocation, registry | This skill (worktree-manager) |
| Subagent isolation | `isolation: "worktree"` in Task tool param |
| Non-git VCS (Perforce, SVN) | WorktreeCreate/WorktreeRemove hooks |

### WorktreeCreate / WorktreeRemove Hooks

New hook events for VCS-agnostic worktree lifecycle. These replace the default git worktree behavior when configured:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "WorktreeCreate": [{
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "bash -c 'INPUT=$(cat); NAME=$(echo \"$INPUT\" | jq -r .name); mkdir -p /tmp/worktrees/$NAME && echo $NAME'"
      }]
    }],
    "WorktreeRemove": [{
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "bash -c 'INPUT=$(cat); PATH=$(echo \"$INPUT\" | jq -r .path); rm -rf $PATH'"
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```

**When to use hooks vs native:** Use hooks when working with non-git VCS systems or when you need custom isolation logic (e.g., Docker containers, remote dev servers). For standard git repos, the native `claude -w` flag or this skill's workflow is preferred.

**Note:** These hooks do NOT support matchers. They fire once per worktree lifecycle event. The hook receives `{name, path}` via stdin JSON.

<success_criteria>
A worktree setup is successful when:
- Worktree created at `~/tmp/worktrees/[project]/[branch-slug]`
- Ports allocated and registered globally
- Dependencies installed
- Agent launched in terminal (Ghostty/iTerm2/tmux)
- Entry added to `~/.claude/worktree-registry.json`
</success_criteria>

<current_state>
Git repository:
!`git status --short --branch 2>/dev/null`

Existing worktrees:
!`git worktree list 2>/dev/null`

Worktree registry:
!`cat ~/.claude/worktree-registry.json 2>/dev/null | jq -r '.worktrees[] | "\(.project)/\(.branch) → \(.status)"' | head -10`

Available ports:
!`cat ~/.claude/worktree-registry.json 2>/dev/null | jq '.portPool.allocated | length' || echo "0"` allocated
</current_state>

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `~/.claude/worktree-registry.json` | **Global registry** - tracks all worktrees across all projects |
| `~/.claude/skills/worktree-manager/config.json` | **Skill config** - terminal, shell, port range settings |
| `~/.claude/skills/worktree-manager/scripts/` | **Helper scripts** - optional, can do everything manually |
| `~/tmp/worktrees/` | **Worktree storage** - all worktrees live here |
| `.claude/` (per-project) | **Project config** - CLAUDE.md, hooks, permissions, custom agents |
| `.claude/worktree.json` (per-project) | **Project config** - optional custom settings |
| `WORKTREE_TASK.md` (per-worktree) | **Auto-loaded task prompt** - agent reads on startup |

</file_locations>

<core_concepts>

## Core Concepts

### Centralized Worktree Storage

All worktrees live in `~/tmp/worktrees/<project-name>/<branch-slug>/`

```
~/tmp/worktrees/
├── obsidian-ai-agent/
│   ├── feature-auth/           # branch: feature/auth
│   ├── feature-payments/       # branch: feature/payments
│   └── fix-login-bug/          # branch: fix/login-bug
└── another-project/
    └── feature-dark-mode/
```

### Branch Slug Convention

Branch names are slugified for filesystem safety:
- `feature/auth` → `feature-auth`
- `fix/login-bug` → `fix-login-bug`

**Slugify manually:** `echo "feature/auth" | tr '/' '-'`

### Port Allocation

- **Global pool**: 8100-8199 (100 ports total)
- **Per worktree**: 2 ports allocated (for API + frontend patterns)
- **Globally unique**: Ports tracked to avoid conflicts across projects

**See:** `reference/port-allocation.md` for detailed operations.

### Required Defaults

**CRITICAL**: These settings MUST be used when launching agents:

| Setting | Value | Reason |
|---------|-------|--------|
| Terminal | Ghostty or iTerm2 | Auto-detected, configurable in config.json |
| Model | `--model opus` | Opus 4.6 alias (most capable) |
| Flags | `--dangerously-skip-permissions` | Required for autonomous file ops |

**Launch command pattern:**
```bash
# Recommended: agent inherits .claude/ config (CLAUDE.md, hooks, permissions)
claude --model opus --dangerously-skip-permissions

# Or with explicit permission allowlist (safer, from .claude/settings.json):
claude --model opus --allowedTools "Bash(npm test),Bash(npm run build),Edit,Write,Read,Glob,Grep"
```

### Subagent Worktree Isolation

Subagents can be configured to run in isolated worktrees:

```yaml
# In subagent frontmatter:
---
name: my-subagent
isolation: worktree
---
```

The subagent runs in a temporary worktree. On completion:
- If no changes: auto-cleanup
- If changes exist: changes preserved for review

</core_concepts>

<config>

## Skill Config

Location: `~/.claude/skills/worktree-manager/config.json`

```json
{
  "terminal": "ghostty",
  "terminalPreference": "auto",
  "enableNumberedTabs": true,
  "shell": "zsh",
  "defaultModel": "opus",
  "claudeCommand": "claude --model opus --dangerously-skip-permissions",
  "portPool": { "start": 8100, "end": 8199 },
  "portsPerWorktree": 2,
  "worktreeBase": "~/tmp/worktrees",
  "defaultCopyDirs": [".claude"],
  "envFilePriority": [".env.local", ".env", ".env.example"],
  "autoCleanupOnMerge": true
}
```

### .claude/ Directory Propagation

When creating worktrees, the entire `.claude/` directory is copied so agents inherit project-level config:

```
.claude/
├── CLAUDE.md              # Project instructions (auto-loaded by Claude Code)
├── settings.json          # Hooks and permissions
│   ├── hooks.PostToolUse  # Auto-format on Write|Edit (e.g., "bun run format || true")
│   └── permissions.allow  # Whitelisted bash commands for agents
├── agents/                # Custom subagent definitions
│   ├── build-validator.md # Validates builds pass
│   ├── code-architect.md  # Plans implementation
│   ├── code-simplifier.md # Refactors for clarity
│   └── verify-app.md      # End-to-end verification
└── PROJECT_CONTEXT.md     # Session continuity (project-context-skill)
```

**Why this matters:**
- **CLAUDE.md**: Agent reads project conventions, dev commands, tech stack
- **Hooks**: Auto-formatting runs after every Write/Edit, keeping code consistent across agents
- **Permissions**: Agents can run pre-approved commands without prompting (e.g., `npm test`, `bun run build`)
- **Custom agents**: Agents can dispatch subagents (e.g., `verify-app.md` for end-to-end checks)

**Hook example (settings.json):**
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Write|Edit",
        "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "bun run format || true" }]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

</config>

## Workflows

### Create Multiple Worktrees

**User says:** "Spin up 3 worktrees for feature/auth, feature/payments, and fix/login-bug"

**You do (can parallelize with subagents):**

```
For EACH branch (can run in parallel):

1. SETUP
   PROJECT=$(basename $(git remote get-url origin 2>/dev/null | sed 's/\.git$//') || basename $(pwd))
   REPO_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
   BRANCH_SLUG=$(echo "feature/auth" | tr '/' '-')
   WORKTREE_PATH=~/tmp/worktrees/$PROJECT/$BRANCH_SLUG

2. ALLOCATE PORTS
   Find 2 unused ports from 8100-8199, add to registry

3. CREATE WORKTREE
   mkdir -p ~/tmp/worktrees/$PROJECT
   git worktree add $WORKTREE_PATH -b $BRANCH

4. COPY PROJECT CONFIG (.claude/ directory)
   cp -r .claude $WORKTREE_PATH/ 2>/dev/null || true
   Copy .env.local or .env as appropriate

5. CREATE WORKTREE_TASK.md
   Create detailed task file for agent

6. INSTALL DEPENDENCIES
   Detect package manager, run install command

7. VALIDATE (optional)
   Start server, health check, stop

8. REGISTER IN GLOBAL REGISTRY
   Update ~/.claude/worktree-registry.json with entry

9. LAUNCH AGENT
   ghostty -e "cd $WORKTREE_PATH && claude --model opus --dangerously-skip-permissions"

AFTER ALL COMPLETE:
- Report summary table to user
```

### Check Status

**With script:**
```bash
~/.claude/skills/worktree-manager/scripts/status.sh
~/.claude/skills/worktree-manager/scripts/status.sh --project my-project
```

**Manual:**
```bash
cat ~/.claude/worktree-registry.json | jq -r '.worktrees[] | "\(.project)\t\(.branch)\t\(.ports | join(","))\t\(.status)"'
```

### Cleanup Worktree

**See:** `reference/cleanup-operations.md` for full cleanup procedure.

**Quick cleanup:**
```bash
~/.claude/skills/worktree-manager/scripts/cleanup.sh <project> <branch> --delete-branch
```

</workflows>

<safety_guidelines>

## Safety Guidelines

1. **Before cleanup**, check PR status:
   - PR merged → safe to clean everything
   - PR open → warn user, confirm before proceeding
   - No PR → warn about unsubmitted work

2. **Before deleting branches**, confirm if:
   - PR not merged
   - No PR exists
   - Worktree has uncommitted changes

3. **Port conflicts**: If port in use by non-worktree process, pick different port

4. **Environment files**: Never commit `.env` or `.env.local` to git

</safety_guidelines>

<example_session>

## Example Session

**User:** "Spin up 2 worktrees for feature/dark-mode and fix/login-bug"

**You:**
1. Detect project: `obsidian-ai-agent` (from git remote)
2. Detect package manager: `uv` (found uv.lock)
3. Allocate 4 ports: `8100 8101 8102 8103`
4. Create worktrees:
   ```bash
   git worktree add ~/tmp/worktrees/obsidian-ai-agent/feature-dark-mode -b feature/dark-mode
   git worktree add ~/tmp/worktrees/obsidian-ai-agent/fix-login-bug -b fix/login-bug
   ```
5. Copy .claude/ and .env to each
6. Install deps: `(cd <path> && uv sync)`
7. Register both in `~/.claude/worktree-registry.json`
8. Launch agents:
   ```bash
   ghostty -e "cd ~/tmp/worktrees/.../feature-dark-mode && claude --model opus --dangerously-skip-permissions"
   ```
9. Report:
   ```
   Created 2 worktrees with agents:

   | Branch | Ports | Path | Task |
   |--------|-------|------|------|
   | feature/dark-mode | 8100, 8101 | ~/tmp/worktrees/.../feature-dark-mode | Implement dark mode |
   | fix/login-bug | 8102, 8103 | ~/tmp/worktrees/.../fix-login-bug | Fix login redirect |

   Both agents running in Ghostty windows.
   ```

## Boris Cherny Workflow Integration

iTerm2 notifications, web session handoff (`/teleport`), ralph-loop for autonomous sessions, and daily workflow protocols.

See `reference/advanced-workflows.md` for iTerm2 setup, teleport handoff, ralph-loop patterns, terminal strategy, and daily workflow protocol.

## Emit Outcome Sidecar

As the final step, write to `~/.claude/skill-analytics/last-outcome-worktree-manager.json`:
```json
{"ts":"[UTC ISO8601]","skill":"worktree-manager","version":"1.2.0","variant":"default",
 "status":"[success|partial|error]","runtime_ms":[estimated ms from start],
 "metrics":{"worktrees_created":[n],"agents_launched":[n],"worktrees_cleaned":[n]},
 "error":null,"session_id":"[YYYY-MM-DD]"}
```
Use status "partial" if some stages failed but results were produced. Use "error" only if no output was generated.
