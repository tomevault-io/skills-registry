# Code

Load and apply the user's coding style preferences when producing or reviewing code. Default to test-driven development — write tests first for new features and bug fixes. Use Write (Apply mode) only for changes that don't warrant tests (refactoring under existing coverage, config, glue code, one-liners).

## Operations

### Write
Load preferences and write code — Apply mode (no TDD) for refactoring, config, and glue; Feature mode (red-green-refactor) for new behavior; Fix mode (regression-first) for bug fixes.
MUST read operations/write.md before executing.

### Test
Improve or evaluate test coverage — Coverage mode (characterization tests for untested code) or Mutate mode (mutation testing to find and kill survivors).
MUST read operations/test.md before executing.

### Plan
Decompose a coding task into ordered chunks with TDD structure for testable behavior.
Delegate immediately to the compose skill: `skill: "compose", args: "$ARGUMENTS"`. Pass these constraints: default to TDD structure for chunks with testable behavior; pure refactoring/config/glue chunks skip TDD; use the project's detected test runner and file placement conventions. Compose handles codebase exploration — do not implement before delegating.

### Review
Evaluate code for test gaps, idiomaticity, simplification opportunities, and correctness issues. Automatically decomposes large scopes (>8 files or >500 lines) into parallel review subagents for thorough analysis. Supports an evaluate-fix loop mode for iterative convergence.
MUST read operations/review.md before executing.

### Benchmark
Write a benchmark that captures the performance target, then write or optimize code to meet it.
MUST read operations/benchmark.md before executing.

## Combined Operations

Users often request multiple operations together. Handle these as follows:

**Default: TDD for new behavior.** When the request adds new functionality or fixes a bug, use the TDD operation — don't wait for the user to say "TDD" or "write tests first".

- **plan / design / "how should I implement"** → Plan
- **add feature / write** (new behavior) → Write (Feature mode)
- **implement / full cycle / build and verify** → Write (Feature or Fix mode), then Review (loop mode) on all changed files
- **implement with mutation testing / harden** → Write (Feature or Fix mode), then Test (Mutate mode), then Review (loop mode) on all changed files
- **fix bug / debug** → Write (Fix mode)
- **refactor / clean up / rename / restructure** → Write (Apply mode)
- **ensure / make X do Y / add support for / sync / integrate** → Write (Feature mode) — these add behavior even when they modify existing files
- **write code** (ambiguous) → Write (Feature mode) if it changes runtime behavior; Write (Apply mode) if config/glue/scripting
- **review / code review / check for issues** → Review
- **thorough / deep review** → Review (forces subagent decomposition)
- **backfill tests / add coverage / write tests** (existing code) → Test (Coverage mode)
- **benchmark / optimize** (with perf target) → Benchmark
- **optimize** (no target, general cleanup) → Write (Apply mode)
- **review and fix** → Review, then Write (Apply mode for style/convention changes; Fix mode for behavioral issues). Non-loop mode: thorough path offers a fix plan after reporting findings. When chaining to Fix mode, write the regression test before fixing — do not skip this precondition.
- **review and loop / review and fix loop** → Review (loop mode — drives evaluate-fix cycle until convergence)
- **fix then add coverage** → Write (Fix mode), then Test (Coverage mode)
- **implement and benchmark** → Write (Feature mode), then Benchmark
- **mutate / mutation test / test my tests** → Test (Mutate mode)
- **add coverage then mutate** → Test (Coverage mode), then Test (Mutate mode)
- **skip tests / no tests / just the code** → Write (Apply mode — user opts out of TDD)

**When to use Write (Apply mode) instead of TDD**: Refactoring already-tested code, config file changes, shell scripts, glue code, one-line fixes where a test would be pure overhead, or when the user explicitly opts out.

## Delegation

Global delegation rules apply. Code-skill-specific additions:

- **Mode selection stays inline** — the orchestrator chooses Apply/Feature/Fix before delegating. Reading file lists and checking test infrastructure to inform that choice is fine.
- **Simple changes stay inline** — single-file edits, config changes, and small fixes don't need a subagent. Delegate when the task spans multiple files or benefits from TDD scaffolding.
- **Describe behavior, not code changes** — when delegating, tell the subagent what to add/fix/test and where the code lives. Do NOT prescribe struct fields, function signatures, or file-by-file edit lists.
- **Validate subagent results** — if the result summary is empty or the subagent ran under 30 seconds on a non-trivial task, investigate before reporting success.
