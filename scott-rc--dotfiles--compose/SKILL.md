# Composing for Claude Code

## Operations

### Create Skill
Scaffold a new skill interactively, producing a complete skill directory with SKILL.md, operation files, and reference files.
MUST read operations/create-skill.md before executing.

### Update Skill
Add, modify, or remove operations, reference files, and SKILL.md content in an existing skill.
MUST read operations/update-skill.md before executing.

### Review Skill
Evaluate an existing skill against best practices and report findings grouped by severity.
MUST read operations/review-skill.md before executing.

### Create Rules
Write a CLAUDE.md or scoped rules file, producing clear instructions that configure Claude's behavior for a project.
MUST read operations/create-rules.md before executing.

### Review Rules
Evaluate a CLAUDE.md or scoped rules file against best practices and report findings grouped by severity.
MUST read operations/review-rules.md before executing.

### Create Prompt
Craft a session task prompt interactively, producing a polished prompt ready to paste into a new Claude Code session.
MUST read operations/create-prompt.md before executing.

### Review Prompt
Evaluate a session task prompt against best practices, report findings, and offer to improve it.
MUST read operations/review-prompt.md before executing.

### Create Handoff
Write a self-contained handoff and deliver via plan mode so the user can accept and continue in a fresh context.
MUST read operations/create-handoff.md before executing.

### Plan Task
Decompose a large task into ordered chunks with orchestrated subagent execution.
MUST read operations/plan-task.md before executing.

## Delegation

- Skill files (operations, references, SKILL.md) — write inline; read the authoring specs (references/skill-spec.md, references/skill-template.md, references/quality-checklist.md) and apply them directly
- Rules files (CLAUDE.md, `.claude/rules/`) — write inline using the authoring specs (references/rules-spec.md, references/rules-template.md, references/quality-checklist.md)
- Review-fix cycles — apply all fixes inline using Edit/Write

## Combined Operations

Users often request multiple operations together. Handle these as follows:

- **"create and review"** / **"scaffold"** / **"new skill"** → Run Create Skill, then Review Skill on the new skill
- **"update skill"** / **"add operation"** / **"modify skill"** / **"change skill"** / **"add operation to"** / **"remove operation from"** / **"rename skill"** → Run Update Skill
- **"update and review"** → Run Update Skill (includes review loop)
- **"review skill"** / **"review a skill"** / **"evaluate skill"** → Run Review Skill
- **"improve skill"** / **"fix skill"** → Run Review Skill, apply fixes via the review-fix loop until review passes
- **"write CLAUDE.md"** / **"write rules"** / **"write instructions"** → Run Create Rules
- **"review rules"** / **"review my rules"** / **"review CLAUDE.md"** → Run Review Rules
- **"improve CLAUDE.md"** / **"review my instructions"** / **"fix my rules"** → Run Review Rules, apply fixes via the review-fix loop until review passes
- **"write a prompt"** / **"craft a prompt"** / **"help me prompt"** / **"delegate this"** → Run Create Prompt
- **"review prompt"** / **"improve prompt"** / **"check my prompt"** → Run Review Prompt
- **"write and review prompt"** → Run Create Prompt, then Review Prompt on the result
- **"hand this off"** / **"handoff"** / **"save context"** / **"continue later"** / **"write what's left"** → Run Create Handoff
- **"plan this"** / **"break this down"** / **"chunk this"** / **"decompose this task"** → Run Plan Task
- **"review"** (ambiguous) → Present options via AskUserQuestion: "Review a skill", "Review a rules file", "Review a prompt"
