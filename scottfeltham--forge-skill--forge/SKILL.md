# FORGE Development Framework

FORGE (Focus-Orchestrate-Refine-Generate-Evaluate) is an Intent-Driven Development (IDD) methodology for AI-assisted software development.

## Interactive Workflow: Clarity Before Action

During **Focus, Orchestrate, and Refine** phases, you must gain clarity before proceeding:

1. **Assess clarity** - Are the requirements/inputs clear or vague?
2. **If vague** → Ask targeted clarifying questions (use `prompts/prd-conversation.md` as a guide)
3. **Always** → Summarize your understanding and confirm with the user before advancing

### Phase Confirmation Pattern

| Phase | Summarize & Confirm |
|-------|---------------------|
| **Focus** | "Problem: X. Users: Y. Success: Z. Boundaries: [in/out of scope]. Correct?" |
| **Orchestrate** | "Architecture: N containers/components. Dependencies: [map]. Task breakdown: [list]. Correct?" |
| **Refine** | "Acceptance criteria: [Given-When-Then]. Edge cases: [categories]. Interfaces: [specs]. Correct?" |

Only advance after user confirms. Generate and Evaluate phases may proceed without additional confirmation once Refine is validated.

## Native Tool Integration (Claude Code)

When running in Claude Code, leverage native tools for enhanced workflow:

| Phase | Native Tool | Purpose |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Focus** | `AskUserQuestion` | Gather requirements, clarify scope, confirm problem statement |
| **Orchestrate** | `AskUserQuestion` | Validate architecture decisions, confirm task breakdown |
| **Refine** | `AskUserQuestion` | Confirm acceptance criteria, validate edge cases |
| **Generate** | `TodoWrite` | Track implementation tasks (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR steps) |
| **Evaluate** | `AskUserQuestion` | Confirm verification results, get disposition decision |

**Adaptive behavior:**
- If `AskUserQuestion` is available, use it for structured clarification with options
- If `TodoWrite` is available, use it to track Generate phase tasks
- Fall back to conversational clarification in non-Claude-Code environments

**Example - Using AskUserQuestion in Focus:**
```
When clarifying requirements, present structured options:
- "What is your target user base?" with options like "Internal team", "External customers", "API consumers"
- This provides better UX than open-ended questions
```

**Example - Using TodoWrite in Generate:**
```
Track TDD workflow:
1. [in_progress] Write failing test for feature X
2. [pending] Implement minimal code to pass
3. [pending] Refactor while tests stay green
```

### Resolving Clarity Issues (Any Phase)

If clarity issues arise at any phase, you may:
- Ask targeted clarifying questions
- Invoke specialist agents for guidance
- Recommend returning to an earlier phase

## HIL Mode (Human-in-the-Loop)

HIL mode is a streamlined 3-phase cycle for active development — when you're already in the code, know what you're building, and are iterating on existing capabilities.

### When to Use HIL vs Full FORGE

| Signal | Mode | Reasoning |
|--------|------|-----------|
| Entirely new feature or capability | **Full** | Needs Focus (what/why) and Orchestrate (architecture) |
| Refining/tweaking existing design | **HIL** | Context already established, jump to Refine |
| Bug fix with clear reproduction | **HIL** | Acceptance criteria are the fix; skip planning |
| Design iteration after feedback | **HIL** | Re-enter at Refine with updated criteria |
| New system or major component | **Full** | Needs architectural decisions upfront |
| Updating processes to fit a design | **HIL** | The "what" is known; define "done" and implement |

### HIL Workflow

```
Refine → Generate → Evaluate (→ loop back to Refine if needed)
```

1. **Refine**: Define what "done" looks like for this specific change
   - Acceptance criteria (Given-When-Then)
   - Interface changes (if any)
   - Edge cases for the change
2. **Generate**: Implement via TDD (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR)
3. **Evaluate**: Verify against criteria, decide disposition

### Creating a HIL Cycle

```bash
uv run "$FORGE_TOOLS/forge_cycle.py" new "description of change" --mode hil
```

### Iterative HIL Pattern

For ongoing active development, each update/tweak can be its own HIL cycle:
1. Create HIL cycle describing the change
2. Refine: Specify acceptance criteria for this iteration
3. Generate: Implement with TDD
4. Evaluate: Verify and decide — Accept, or loop back to Refine

This keeps FORGE discipline (specifications before code, TDD, verification) without the overhead of full planning phases when the context is already established.

## Tool Commands

The tool scripts are in the `tools/` subdirectory of this skill. Before running the first command, resolve the skill's install location:

```bash
# Local project install takes priority over global
if [ -d ".claude/skills/forge/tools" ]; then
  FORGE_TOOLS=".claude/skills/forge/tools"
else
  FORGE_TOOLS="$HOME/.claude/skills/forge/tools"
fi
```

Use the resolved path for all commands below. Since shell state does not persist between commands, prefix each invocation: `FORGE_TOOLS=<resolved-path> && uv run "$FORGE_TOOLS/forge_init.py"`, or simply substitute the resolved path directly.

| User Request | Command |
|-------------|---------|
| Initialize FORGE | `uv run "$FORGE_TOOLS/forge_init.py"` |
| Start new cycle | `uv run "$FORGE_TOOLS/forge_cycle.py" new "name"` |
| Start HIL cycle | `uv run "$FORGE_TOOLS/forge_cycle.py" new "name" --mode hil` |
| Check status | `uv run "$FORGE_TOOLS/forge_status.py"` |
| Validate phase | `uv run "$FORGE_TOOLS/forge_status.py" --validate` |
| Advance phase | `uv run "$FORGE_TOOLS/forge_phase.py" advance` |
| Complete task | `uv run "$FORGE_TOOLS/forge_phase.py" complete-task "desc"` |
| Add task | `uv run "$FORGE_TOOLS/forge_phase.py" add-task "desc"` |
| Complete cycle | `uv run "$FORGE_TOOLS/forge_cycle.py" complete <id>` |
| Add learning | `uv run "$FORGE_TOOLS/forge_learn.py" add <cat> "title" "desc"` |
| Retrospective | `uv run "$FORGE_TOOLS/forge_learn.py" retro` |

Learning categories: `pattern`, `anti-pattern`, `decision`, `tool`

## Core Concepts

### Intent-Driven Development Triad

- **Intent** - Why the work exists; the problem being solved
- **Outcomes** - Observable, defensible changes in reality
- **Accountability** - Single owner responsible for consequences

### The Five Phases

| Phase | Purpose | Key Question |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| **FOCUS** | Clarity | What are you actually building? |
| **ORCHESTRATE** | Planning | How do you break this into pieces? |
| **REFINE** | Precision | What specifically does "done" look like? |
| **GENERATE** | Creation | AI produces deliverables matching scope |
| **EVALUATE** | Verification | Does output match intent? |

### Product-Level Cycles

FORGE cycles work at **any scope** - feature, epic, or entire product/MVP. The phases are identical; the **Generated output** changes based on scope.

| Phase | Feature-Level | Product-Level |
|-------|--------------|---------------|
| **Focus** | What feature & why | What product/MVP & why |
| **Orchestrate** | Component architecture, task breakdown | System architecture, feature breakdown |
| **Refine** | Feature acceptance criteria, interfaces | Product success criteria, per-feature scope |
| **Generate** | Code (TDD) | Documentation: PRD, architecture docs, roadmap, feature cycle plan |
| **Evaluate** | Verify code matches intent | Verify plans match intent |

At the product level, Generate produces documentation and plans - not code. Each planned feature then becomes its own FORGE cycle.

**Product-level workflow:**
1. `forge_cycle.py new "mvp-product-name"` - Create a product-level cycle
2. Work through Focus/Orchestrate/Refine at the product level
3. Generate: Produce PRD, architecture docs, and ordered list of feature cycles
4. Evaluate: Verify plans are complete and match intent
5. Each feature becomes its own FORGE cycle with code as output

## Phase Details

### 1. FOCUS - Clarity

**Required Outputs**:
- Problem statement and target users defined
- Testable success criteria (not vague aspirations)
- System Context diagram (C4 Level 1)
- Clear boundaries on what you WON'T build

### 2. ORCHESTRATE - Planning

**Required Outputs**:
- Container architecture (C4 Level 2)
- Component architecture (C4 Level 3)
- Dependency map
- Tasks sized for single AI sessions

### 3. REFINE - Precision

**CRITICAL**: No code in this phase - specifications only.

**Required Outputs**:
- Acceptance criteria in Given-When-Then format
- Interface specifications (inputs, outputs, errors)
- Edge cases by category (empty/null, boundary, invalid, timing, failure, concurrent)
- Constraints vs criteria documented

### 4. GENERATE - Creation

**Process**: RED → GREEN → REFACTOR
1. Write failing test first
2. Minimal code to pass
3. Improve while tests stay green

**Rules**:
- One task per session
- Tests BEFORE implementation
- 80% minimum coverage

### 5. EVALUATE - Verification

**Process**:
- Line-by-line check against acceptance criteria
- Test edge cases (specified AND discovered)
- Security review
- Integration testing

**Dispositions**: Accept | Accept with issues | Revise | Reject

## Document Creation

During each phase, create and maintain documents in `docs/`. Documents are organized per cycle/feature:

```
docs/
├── prd/
│   └── <cycle-name>.md         # Focus: Problem statement, users, success criteria, scope
├── tasks/
│   └── <cycle-name>.md         # Orchestrate: Session-sized task breakdown
└── <cycle-name>/
    ├── system-context.md       # Focus: C4 Level 1 - system boundaries
    ├── containers.md           # Orchestrate: C4 Level 2 - deployable units
    ├── components.md           # Orchestrate: C4 Level 3 - internal structure
    ├── acceptance-criteria.md  # Refine: Given-When-Then scenarios
    ├── interfaces.md           # Refine: inputs, outputs, error contracts
    └── edge-cases.md           # Refine: categorized edge cases
```

**Phase → Document mapping:**
| Phase | Create/Update |
|-------|---------------|
| Focus | `prd/<cycle>.md`, `<cycle>/system-context.md` |
| Orchestrate | `tasks/<cycle>.md`, `<cycle>/containers.md`, `<cycle>/components.md` |
| Refine | `<cycle>/acceptance-criteria.md`, `<cycle>/interfaces.md`, `<cycle>/edge-cases.md` |

Create documents as you complete phase work. These are the source of truth for Generate and Evaluate phases.

## State Management

All cycle state lives in `.forge/`:
```
.forge/
├── config.yaml
├── context.md
├── learnings.md
└── cycles/
    ├── active/
    └── completed/
```

## Phase Blocking

- Cannot write code during Focus, Orchestrate, or Refine
- Cannot advance without completing mandatory items
- Evaluation may send you back to earlier phases

## Commit Cadence

Commit after every meaningful checkpoint — not just at the end of a phase:

- **After each phase checklist item**: When you complete a deliverable (e.g., PRD, acceptance criteria, test suite), commit it immediately.
- **After phase advancement**: Commit `.forge/` state whenever a phase advances so cycle progress is never lost.
- **During Generate**: Commit after each completed TDD cycle (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR), not just at task completion.
- **Commit message convention**: Prefix with the phase name, e.g., `focus: add PRD and system context diagram` or `generate: implement user auth with tests`.

### Hook-Based Enforcement (Claude Code)

For automated phase constraint enforcement, configure hooks in `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Edit|Write",
        "command": [".claude/hooks/forge-phase-guard.sh"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The hook script:
- Reads current phase from `.forge/cycles/active/`
- **Allows** all writes to `docs/` (specs, PRDs, architecture docs)
- **Blocks** code writes during Focus, Orchestrate, Refine phases
- **Allows** code writes during Generate and Evaluate phases

Install the hook:
```bash
mkdir -p .claude/hooks
cp path/to/forge-skill/.claude/hooks/forge-phase-guard.sh .claude/hooks/
chmod +x .claude/hooks/forge-phase-guard.sh
```

## Model Routing

When using Claude Code Agent Teams, assign model tiers based on cognitive demand:

| Agent | Model | Reasoning |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| Architect | opus | Architecture decisions, trade-off analysis |
| Security | opus | Threat modeling, adversarial thinking |
| Developer | sonnet | Well-specified implementation tasks |
| Tester | sonnet | Test writing from specifications |
| DevOps | sonnet | Infrastructure, config patterns |
| Documentation | haiku | Structured writing from existing content |
| Integration Coordinator | sonnet | Cross-component coordination |
| Reviewer | sonnet | Code quality checks against criteria |

**Complexity overrides:**
- Promote to opus when the task involves novel architecture, ambiguous requirements, or security-critical decisions
- Demote to haiku for boilerplate generation, formatting, or simple lookups
- Default tier applies when task complexity matches the agent's typical workload

## Agent Teams

Map FORGE phases to Claude Code Agent Teams compositions:

| Phase | Team Lead | Teammates | Pattern |
|-------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Focus | Architect (opus) | Security (opus), Documentation (haiku) | Lead defines scope; teammates assess risks and draft PRD |
| Orchestrate | Architect (opus) | — | Solo decomposition and dependency analysis |
| Refine | Architect (opus) | Tester (sonnet) | Lead defines interfaces; teammate writes acceptance criteria |
| Generate | Developer (sonnet) | Reviewer (sonnet) | Lead implements via TDD; reviewer checks each task against criteria |
| Evaluate | Tester (sonnet) | Reviewer (sonnet), Security (opus) | Tester verifies criteria; reviewer does final code review; security does adversarial review |

**Generate phase detail:**
- Each task from Orchestrate becomes one teammate session
- Developer receives: task description, acceptance criteria from Refine, interface specs
- Reviewer checks after each TDD cycle: test-first compliance, criteria alignment, code quality
- One task per session prevents context pollution

**Evaluate phase detail:**
- Reviewer performs final holistic review: security posture, integration contracts, overall quality
- Tester verifies acceptance criteria line-by-line and edge case coverage
- Security agent performs adversarial review on security-critical code
- Reviewer disposition feeds into cycle disposition decision

## Key Principle

**Clarity before code** - Time in Focus, Orchestrate, and Refine prevents waste in Generate and Evaluate.
