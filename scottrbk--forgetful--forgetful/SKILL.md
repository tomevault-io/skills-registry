# Exploring the Knowledge Graph

Forgetful stores knowledge as an interconnected graph: memories link to other memories, entities link to memories, and entities relate to each other. Deep exploration reveals context that simple queries miss.

## When to Explore

Explore the knowledge graph when:
- Starting complex work that spans multiple topics
- User asks "what do you know about X"
- Planning requires understanding existing decisions/patterns
- Investigating how concepts connect across projects
- Need comprehensive context, not just top search results

## Exploration Phases

Track visited IDs to prevent cycles. Execute phases sequentially.

### Phase 1: Semantic Entry Point
```
execute_forgetful_tool("query_memory", {
  "query": "<topic>",
  "query_context": "Exploring knowledge graph for comprehensive context",
  "k": 5,
  "include_links": true,
  "max_links_per_primary": 5
})
```

Collect: `primary_memories` + `linked_memories` (1-hop connections).

### Phase 2: Expand Memory Details
For key memories, get full details:
```
execute_forgetful_tool("get_memory", {"memory_id": <id>})
```

Extract: `document_ids`, `code_artifact_ids`, `project_ids`, additional `linked_memory_ids`.

### Phase 3: Entity Discovery
Find entities linked to discovered projects:
```
execute_forgetful_tool("list_entities", {
  "project_ids": [<discovered project ids>]
})
```

You can also explicitly link entities to projects for organizational grouping:
```
execute_forgetful_tool("link_entity_to_project", {
  "entity_id": <id>,
  "project_id": <id>
})
```

### Phase 4: Entity Relationships
For relevant entities, map relationship graph:
```
execute_forgetful_tool("get_entity_relationships", {
  "entity_id": <id>,
  "direction": "both"
})
```

Relationship types: works_for, owns, manages, collaborates_with, etc.

### Phase 5: Entity-Linked Memories
For each entity, find all linked memories:
```
execute_forgetful_tool("get_entity_memories", {
  "entity_id": <id>
})
```

Returns `{"memory_ids": [...], "count": N}`. Fetch any new memories not already visited.

## Presenting Results

Group findings by type:

**Memories**: Primary (direct matches) -> Linked (1-hop) -> Entity-linked (via entities)

**Entities**: Name, type, relationship count, linked memory count

**Artifacts**: Documents and code snippets found via memory links

**Graph Summary**: Total nodes, key themes, suggested follow-up queries

## Depth Control

- **Shallow** (phases 1-2): Quick context, ~5-15 memories
- **Medium** (phases 1-4): Include entities and relationships
- **Deep** (all phases): Full graph traversal, comprehensive context

Match depth to task complexity. Start shallow, go deeper if context insufficient.

## Efficiency Tips

- Check `truncated` flag from query_memory (8000 token budget)
- Skip Phase 3-5 if no entities exist in discovered projects
- Use `project_ids` filter to scope exploration
- Stop expanding when hitting diminishing returns
