description: Git commit workflow that analyzes recent history to match repo-specific message conventions. Use when you don't have recent commit history in context and need to determine the repository's commit message style, or when crafting commit messages that need to match existing conventions. Use when this capability is needed.

# Git Commit Skill

This skill ensures commit messages follow the repository's established conventions by analyzing recent commit history.

## Pre-Commit Workflow

### 1. Analyze Recent Commit History

**Run this when you don't have recent commit history in context**

```sh
git log -10 --oneline --no-decorate
```

**Analyze for patterns:**
- Commit message format (conventional commits, custom format, free-form)
- Prefix/type usage (feat:, fix:, chore:, etc.)
- Capitalization style (sentence case, lowercase, title case)
- Length preferences (short, detailed)
- Scope usage (e.g., `feat(api):` vs `feat:`)
- Special conventions (emoji, ticket numbers, etc.)

### 2. Review Full Recent Messages

For deeper pattern analysis:

```sh
git log -10 --format="%h %s%n%b%n"
```

**Look for:**
- Multi-line message style
- Body content patterns
- Footer conventions (Closes #, Co-authored-by:, etc.)
- Breaking change indicators (BREAKING CHANGE:, !)
- Reference formats (issue numbers, PR links)

### 3. Match the Repository Style

**Use the EXACT same conventions as recent commits:**

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>
```

If commits are free-form, use the same free-form style without prefixes.

### 4. Craft the Commit Message

**Follow repository conventions discovered in steps 1-3:**

```sh
git commit -m "type(scope): description"

# Or with body
git commit -m "type(scope): description" -m "
Detailed explanation of changes and reasoning.

Closes #123"
```

## Commit Message Best Practices

### Content Guidelines

**Focus on WHY, not WHAT:**
- ❌ "Changed login function"
- ✅ "Fix race condition in login flow"

**Be specific and actionable:**
- ❌ "Update code"
- ✅ "Optimize database query performance by 40%"

**Keep subject line concise:**
- Aim for 50-72 characters
- Match the length style of recent commits

**Use imperative mood (if repository does):**
- "Add feature" not "Added feature"
- "Fix bug" not "Fixes bug"
- Unless recent commits use past tense consistently

### Multi-line Messages

When changes are complex:

```sh
git commit -m "feat: add payment processing" -m "
Explain why, impact, and any references."
```

## Verification Before Commit

### Check Staged Changes
```sh
git status
git diff --cached
```

**Ensure:**
- Only intended files are staged
- No debug code or console.logs
- No sensitive data (secrets, keys, tokens)
- Changes are cohesive and atomic

### Review Commit Preview
```sh
# See what will be committed
git diff --cached --stat

# Verify commit message locally
git commit --dry-run
```

## Special Cases

- Amend only if not pushed and fixing a typo/forgotten file.
- Add co-authors in commit body when needed.
- Use empty commits only if explicitly required.

## Integration with Other Skills

**Before committing:**
- Review changes for quality
- Run tests if available
- Check for secrets (part of git-push skill)

**After committing:**
- See `git-push` skill for pre-push checklist

## Checklist

Before running `git commit`:
- [ ] Analyzed last 10 commits for conventions (if not already known)
- [ ] Identified repository's commit message pattern (if not already known)
- [ ] Matched format, style, and conventions
- [ ] Wrote clear, specific message explaining WHY
- [ ] Verified staged changes are correct
- [ ] No secrets or sensitive data in commit
- [ ] Message length matches repository style
- [ ] Used imperative/past tense matching repo style
