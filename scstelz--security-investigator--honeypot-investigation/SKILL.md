## ⚠️ CRITICAL WORKFLOW RULES - READ FIRST ⚠️

**Before starting ANY honeypot investigation:**

1. **ALWAYS calculate date ranges correctly** (use current date from context)
2. **ALWAYS track and report time after each major step** (mandatory per main instructions)
3. **ALWAYS run independent queries in parallel** (drastically faster execution)
4. **ALWAYS save intermediate results to temp/** (enables debugging and auditing)
5. **ALWAYS use `create_file` for reports** (NEVER use PowerShell terminal commands)

**Date Range Rules (from main copilot-instructions):**
- **Real-time/recent searches:** Add +2 days to current date for end range
- **Example:** Current date = Dec 12, 2025; Last 48 hours = `datetime(2025-12-10)` to `datetime(2025-12-14)`

---

## Investigation Parameters

### Required Inputs

| Parameter | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Honeypot Name** | Server/device name | `honeypot-server` |
| **Time Range** | Investigation period | `last 48 hours`, `last 7 days` |

### Automatic Derivations

- **Start Date**: Current date - time range
- **End Date**: Current date + 2 days (per date range rules)
- **Output File**: `reports/honeypot/Honeypot_Report_<hostname>_<timestamp>.md`
- **Temp Files**: `temp/honeypot_ips_<timestamp>.json`, `temp/honeypot_data_<timestamp>.json`

---

## Execution Workflow

### 🚨 MANDATORY: Time Tracking Pattern

**YOU MUST TRACK AND REPORT TIME AFTER EVERY MAJOR STEP:**

```
[MM:SS] ✓ Step description (XX seconds)
```

**Required Reporting Points:**
1. After Phase 1 (failed connection queries)
2. After Phase 2 (IP enrichment + threat intel)
3. After Phase 3 (incident filtering)
4. After Phase 4 (vulnerability scan)
5. After Phase 5 (report generation)
6. Final: Total elapsed time

---

### Phase 1: Query Failed Connections (PARALLEL)

**Execute ALL THREE queries in parallel using `mcp_sentinel-data_query_lake`:**

#### Query 1A: SecurityEvent (Windows Security Logs)
```kql
let start = datetime(<StartDate>);
let end = datetime(<EndDate>);
let honeypot = '<HONEYPOT_NAME>';
SecurityEvent
| where TimeGenerated between (start .. end)
| where Computer contains honeypot  // Use 'contains' for flexible hostname matching
| where EventID in (4625, 4771, 4776)  // Failed logon attempts
| where isnotempty(IpAddress) and IpAddress != "-"  // IpAddress is built-in field
| where IpAddress != "127.0.0.1"  // Exclude localhost (internal honeypot traffic)
| summarize 
    FailedAttempts=count(), 
    FirstSeen=min(TimeGenerated), 
    LastSeen=max(TimeGenerated),
    TargetAccounts=make_set(Account, 10)
    by IpAddress, EventID
| extend EventType = case(
    EventID == 4625, "Failed Logon",
    EventID == 4771, "Kerberos Pre-Auth Failed",
    EventID == 4776, "NTLM Auth Failed",
    "Unknown")
| order by FailedAttempts desc
| take 50
```

#### Query 1B: W3CIISLog (IIS Web Server Logs)
```kql
let start = datetime(<StartDate>);
let end = datetime(<EndDate>);
let honeypot = '<HONEYPOT_NAME>';
W3CIISLog
| where TimeGenerated between (start .. end)
| where Computer =~ honeypot
| where tolong(scStatus) >= 400  // HTTP errors (4xx/5xx) - scStatus is string type
| where cIP != "127.0.0.1" and cIP != "::1"  // Exclude localhost (internal honeypot traffic)
| summarize 
    RequestCount=count(), 
    FirstSeen=min(TimeGenerated), 
    LastSeen=max(TimeGenerated),
    TargetedURIs=make_set(csUriStem, 10),
    StatusCodes=make_set(tolong(scStatus), 5)  // Convert to long for proper aggregation
    by IpAddress = cIP
| order by RequestCount desc
| take 50
```

#### Query 1C: DeviceNetworkEvents (Defender Network Traffic - INBOUND ONLY)
```kql
let start = datetime(<StartDate>);
let end = datetime(<EndDate>);
let honeypot = '<HONEYPOT_NAME>';
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where TimeGenerated between (start .. end)
| where DeviceName =~ honeypot
| where ActionType in ("ConnectionSuccess", "InboundConnectionAccepted", "ConnectionFound")  // Successful inbound TCP connections
| where LocalPort in (3389, 80, 443, 445, 22, 21, 23, 8080, 8443)  // Filter by attacked services (LocalPort = honeypot's listening port)
| where RemoteIP != "127.0.0.1" and RemoteIP != "::1" and RemoteIP != "::ffff:127.0.0.1"  // Exclude localhost
| where RemoteIP !startswith "192.168." and RemoteIP !startswith "10." and RemoteIP !startswith "172.16."  // Exclude RFC1918 private IPs
| where RemoteIP !startswith "fe80:" and RemoteIP !startswith "fc00:" and RemoteIP !startswith "fd00:"  // Exclude IPv6 link-local and ULA
| where RemoteIP !startswith "::ffff:"  // Filter out IPv6-mapped IPv4 addresses (reduces duplicate noise)
| summarize 
    ConnectionCount=count(), 
    FirstSeen=min(TimeGenerated), 
    LastSeen=max(TimeGenerated),
    TargetedPorts=make_set(LocalPort, 10),  // LocalPort = attacked services on honeypot
    Actions=make_set(ActionType, 5)
    by RemoteIP  // RemoteIP = attacker source
| order by ConnectionCount desc
| take 50
```

**IMPORTANT:** This query shows **TCP connection establishment** (network layer), NOT successful authentication. Attackers who appear here may still fail at the authentication layer (SecurityEvent 4625). For honeypots, all inbound connections should be treated as reconnaissance/attack attempts.

**After Phase 1 completes:**
- Merge all three result sets
- **Rank IPs by attack volume** (prioritize SecurityEvent FailedAttempts, then W3CIISLog RequestCount, then DeviceNetworkEvents ConnectionCount)
- **Select top 10-15 IPs** for enrichment (focus on high-volume attackers, not one-off scanners)
- Extract unique IP addresses into array
- Save **prioritized IPs only** to `temp/honeypot_ips_<timestamp>.json` in format: `{"ips": ["1.2.3.4", "5.6.7.8", ...]}`
- Document total unique attacker count separately for report statistics
- Report elapsed time: `[MM:SS] ✓ Failed connection queries completed (XX seconds) - [total_count] unique IPs identified, top [enrichment_count] prioritized for enrichment`

---

### Phase 2: IP Enrichment & Threat Intelligence (PARALLEL)

**Execute IP enrichment script AND Sentinel threat intel query in parallel:**

#### 2A: Run IP Enrichment Script
```powershell
# Read prioritized IPs from JSON file (top 10-15 by attack volume)
# This reduces token consumption by ~80% while maintaining critical intelligence
$env:PYTHONPATH = "<WORKSPACE_ROOT>"
cd "<WORKSPACE_ROOT>"
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe enrich_ips.py --file temp/honeypot_ips_<timestamp>.json
```

**Enrichment provides (for prioritized IPs only):**
- Geolocation (city, region, country)
- ISP/Organization (ASN, org name)
- VPN/Proxy/Tor detection (`is_vpn`, `is_proxy`, `is_tor`)
- Abuse reputation (`abuse_confidence_score`, `total_reports`)
- Shodan intelligence: open ports, CVEs, tags (e.g., `eol-os`, `self-signed`, `c2`), CPEs, hostnames
- Risk level assessment (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)

**Note:** Enrichment script provides aggregated statistics for all IPs - use these summary stats in report narrative instead of listing every IP

#### 2B: Query Sentinel Threat Intelligence
```kql
let target_ips = dynamic(["<IP1>", "<IP2>", "<IP3>", ...]);  // From Phase 1 prioritized list (top 10-15 IPs)
ThreatIntelIndicators
| extend IndicatorType = replace_string(replace_string(replace_string(tostring(split(ObservableKey, ":", 0)), "[", ""), "]", ""), "\"", "")
| where IndicatorType in ("ipv4-addr", "ipv6-addr", "network-traffic")
| extend NetworkSourceIP = toupper(ObservableValue)
| where NetworkSourceIP in (target_ips)
| where IsActive and (ValidUntil > now() or isempty(ValidUntil))
| extend Description = tostring(parse_json(Data).description)
| where Description !contains_cs "State: inactive;" and Description !contains_cs "State: falsepos;"
| extend TrafficLightProtocolLevel = tostring(parse_json(AdditionalFields).TLPLevel)
| extend ActivityGroupNames = extract(@"ActivityGroup:(\S+)", 1, tostring(parse_json(Data).labels))
| summarize arg_max(TimeGenerated, *) by NetworkSourceIP
| project 
    TimeGenerated,
    IPAddress = NetworkSourceIP,
    ThreatDescription = Description,
    ActivityGroupNames,
    Confidence,
    ValidUntil,
    TrafficLightProtocolLevel,
    IsActive
| order by Confidence desc, TimeGenerated desc
```

**After Phase 2 completes:**
- Merge IP enrichment JSON with Sentinel threat intel results
- Save combined data to `temp/honeypot_data_<timestamp>.json`
- Report elapsed time: `[MM:SS] ✓ IP enrichment completed (XX seconds)`

---

### Phase 3: Query Security Incidents (Sentinel KQL)

**Step 3A: Get Device ID from Sentinel**

```kql
let honeypot = '<HONEYPOT_NAME>';
DeviceInfo
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| where DeviceName =~ honeypot or DeviceName contains honeypot
| summarize arg_max(TimeGenerated, *)
| project DeviceId, DeviceName, OSPlatform, OSVersion, PublicIP
```

**Extract `DeviceId` (GUID) from result - returns single most recent device record.**

**Step 3B: Query Security Incidents**

```kql
let targetDevice = "<HONEYPOT_NAME>";
let targetDeviceId = "<DEVICE_ID>";  // REQUIRED: Get from DeviceInfo query (Step 3A)
let start = datetime(<StartDate>);
let end = datetime(<EndDate>);
let relevantAlerts = SecurityAlert
| where TimeGenerated between (start .. end)
| where Entities has targetDevice or Entities has targetDeviceId
| summarize arg_max(TimeGenerated, *) by SystemAlertId
| project SystemAlertId, AlertName, AlertSeverity, ProviderName, Tactics;
SecurityIncident
| where CreatedTime between (start .. end)  // Filter on CreatedTime for incidents created in range
| summarize arg_max(TimeGenerated, *) by ProviderIncidentId  // Get most recent state per ProviderIncidentId
| project ProviderIncidentId, Title, Severity, Status, Classification, CreatedTime, LastModifiedTime, Owner, AdditionalData, AlertIds, Labels
| where not(tostring(Labels) has "Redirected")  // Exclude merged incidents
| mv-expand AlertId = AlertIds
| extend AlertId = tostring(AlertId)
| join kind=inner relevantAlerts on $left.AlertId == $right.SystemAlertId
| extend ProviderIncidentUrl = tostring(AdditionalData.providerIncidentUrl)
| extend OwnerUPN = tostring(Owner.userPrincipalName)
| extend LastModifiedTime = todatetime(LastModifiedTime)
| summarize 
    Title = any(Title),
    Severity = any(Severity),
    Status = any(Status),
    Classification = any(Classification),
    CreatedTime = any(CreatedTime),
    LastModifiedTime = any(LastModifiedTime),
    OwnerUPN = any(OwnerUPN),
    ProviderIncidentUrl = any(ProviderIncidentUrl),
    AlertCount = count(),
    MitreTactics = make_set(Tactics)
    by ProviderIncidentId
| order by LastModifiedTime desc
| take 10
```

**IMPORTANT:** 
- This query joins SecurityIncident with SecurityAlert to provide full incident context
- **Deduplication**: The final `summarize` statement collapses multiple alerts per incident into a single row (groups by ProviderIncidentId)
- **Filter on `CreatedTime`** to find incidents created in the investigation period
- **Use `arg_max(TimeGenerated, *) by IncidentNumber`** to get the most recent update for each incident (includes status changes, comments, etc.)
- **Returns up to 10 unique incidents** (grouped by ProviderIncidentId to ensure one row per external incident ID)

- **⚠️ CHECK STATUS FIELD:** Only report incidents with Status="New" or "Active" as threats. Status="Closed" + Classification="BenignPositive" = expected honeypot activity (do not flag as threat)

**After Phase 3 completes:**
- Report elapsed time: `[MM:SS] ✓ Security incidents query completed (XX seconds)`

---

### Phase 4: Vulnerability Assessment

**⚠️ CRITICAL: TVM tables are snapshot tables — NO time filtering!**
- `DeviceTvmSoftwareVulnerabilities` has NO `Timestamp` or `TimeGenerated` column
- Do NOT add `where Timestamp between (...)` — it will fail with a schema error
- Do NOT use Sentinel Data Lake (`query_lake`) — TVM tables are only available via Advanced Hunting
- Use `RunAdvancedHuntingQuery` MCP tool only

#### Step 4A: Query Vulnerabilities via Advanced Hunting KQL
```kql
let deviceName = '<HONEYPOT_NAME>';
DeviceTvmSoftwareVulnerabilities
| where DeviceName startswith deviceName
| project
    CveId,
    VulnerabilitySeverityLevel,
    SoftwareVendor,
    SoftwareName,
    SoftwareVersion,
    RecommendedSecurityUpdate,
    RecommendedSecurityUpdateId
| summarize by CveId, VulnerabilitySeverityLevel, SoftwareVendor, SoftwareName, SoftwareVersion, RecommendedSecurityUpdate, RecommendedSecurityUpdateId
| order by case(VulnerabilitySeverityLevel == "Critical", 1, VulnerabilitySeverityLevel == "High", 2, VulnerabilitySeverityLevel == "Medium", 3, 4) asc
| take 30
```

**Key columns returned:**
- `CveId` — CVE identifier (e.g., CVE-2025-15467)
- `VulnerabilitySeverityLevel` — String: Critical / High / Medium / Low
- `SoftwareVendor`, `SoftwareName`, `SoftwareVersion` — Affected software details
- `RecommendedSecurityUpdate` — Patch info (may be empty)

**🔴 PROHIBITED:**
- ❌ Adding `Timestamp` or `TimeGenerated` filters (column does not exist)
- ❌ Projecting `CvssScore` (column does not exist — use `VulnerabilitySeverityLevel` instead)
- ❌ Using Sentinel Data Lake MCP (`query_lake`) for TVM tables
- ❌ Using `GetDefenderMachineVulnerabilities` API (requires separate machine ID lookup, less reliable)

**After Phase 4 completes:**
- Report elapsed time: `[MM:SS] ✓ Vulnerability scan completed (XX seconds)`

---

### Phase 5: Generate Executive Report

**Use the Report Template (see section below) to create markdown report.**

**Critical Report Sections:**
1. **Executive Summary** - High-level findings (2-3 paragraphs)
2. **Attack Surface Analysis** - Failed connections by IP, service, pattern
3. **Threat Intelligence Correlation** - Known malicious IPs, APT groups, VPNs
4. **Security Incidents** - Incidents triggered by honeypot activity
5. **Attack Pattern Analysis** - Targeted services, credential attacks, web exploits
6. **Vulnerability Status** - Current CVEs and exploitation risk
7. **Key Detection Insights** - TTPs, MITRE ATT&CK mapping, novel indicators
8. **Honeypot Effectiveness** - Metrics and recommendations
9. **Conclusion** - Summary and next steps

**Report Generation:**
1. Populate template with data from Phases 1-4
2. Use `create_file` to save: `reports/honeypot/Honeypot_Report_<hostname>_<timestamp>.md`
3. Return absolute path to user

**After Phase 5 completes:**
- Report elapsed time: `[MM:SS] ✓ Report generated (XX seconds)`
- **Provide comprehensive timeline breakdown with total elapsed time**

## Error Handling

### Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Missing honeypot in DeviceInfo table** | Verify device name; check if device reports to Defender; try Computer field instead |
| **No SecurityEvent logs** | Device may not be sending Windows Security logs; verify log forwarding configuration |
| **W3CIISLog table not found** | IIS logging may not be enabled; query WebAccessLog or HTTP logs instead |
| **IP enrichment script fails** | Check ipinfo.io token in config.json; verify internet connectivity; check temp file exists |
| **Date range returns no results** | Verify date calculation (current date from context + proper offset); expand time range |
| **KQL timeout** | Reduce `take` limit; narrow time range; remove complex aggregations |

### Validation Checklist

Before delivering report, verify:
- ✅ All Phase timestamps reported to user
- ✅ Total elapsed time calculated and displayed
- ✅ IP enrichment data merged with attack logs
- ✅ Incident filtering correctly applied (only honeypot-related incidents)
- ✅ Vulnerability data retrieved (or documented as unavailable)
- ✅ Report saved to correct path: `reports/honeypot/Honeypot_Report_<hostname>_<timestamp>.md`
- ✅ Absolute path returned to user

---

## Integration with Main Copilot Instructions

This skill follows all patterns from the main `copilot-instructions.md`:
- **Date range handling:** Uses +2 day rule for real-time searches
- **Parallel execution:** Runs independent queries simultaneously
- **Time tracking:** Mandatory reporting after each phase
- **Token management:** Uses `create_file` for all output
- **KQL best practices:** Follows Sample KQL Query patterns
- **IP enrichment:** Uses documented `enrich_ips.py` utility

**Example invocations:**
- "Investigate the honeypot HONEYPOT-01 over the last 48 hours"
- "Run honeypot security analysis for honeypot-server-01 from Dec 10-12"
- "Generate honeypot report for [hostname] last 7 days"

---

## Visualization Options

After completing the investigation, offer to visualize the attack data using the dedicated visualization skills:

### Heatmap Visualization
Use the **heatmap-visualization** skill (`.github/skills/heatmap-visualization/SKILL.md`) to show attack patterns over time with threat intel drill-down.

**When to offer:**
- ✅ After completing honeypot investigation phases
- ✅ When user asks "show me the attack patterns" or "visualize the attacks"
- ✅ For comparing attack volumes across time periods
- ❌ Skip if investigation found minimal activity (<5 unique IPs)

### Geomap Visualization
Use the **geomap-visualization** skill (`.github/skills/geomap-visualization/SKILL.md`) to show attack origins on a world map.

**When to offer:**
- ✅ After completing honeypot investigation phases
- ✅ When user asks "where are the attacks coming from?" or "show on a map"
- ✅ For geographic threat distribution analysis
- ❌ Skip if all IPs are from the same region

**Note:** W3CIISLog includes native `RemoteIPLatitude` and `RemoteIPLongitude` fields - use these directly for geomap visualization without additional enrichment.
