## ⚠️ CRITICAL WORKFLOW RULES - READ FIRST ⚠️

**Before writing ANY KQL query:**

1. **ALWAYS validate table schema FIRST** - Use `mcp_kql-search_get_table_schema` to verify:
   - Table exists in the environment
   - Column names are correct
   - Data types are accurate
   - Common query patterns exist

2. **ALWAYS check schema differences** - Column names vary by platform:
   - **Microsoft Sentinel**: Uses `TimeGenerated` for timestamp
   - **Defender XDR**: Uses `Timestamp` for timestamp
   - **Other differences**: See [Schema Differences](#critical-schema-differences) section

3. **ALWAYS check local query library FIRST** - Before writing from scratch:
   - Search `queries/` and `.github/skills/` for existing verified queries (these are battle-tested and pitfall-aware)
   - See the **KQL Pre-Flight Checklist** in `copilot-instructions.md` for the full priority order
   - If a suitable query exists locally, adapt it instead of building from scratch

4. **ALWAYS use multiple sources** - Combine for best results:
   - Schema validation (authoritative column names)
   - Microsoft Learn code samples (official patterns)
   - Community queries (real-world examples)

5. **ALWAYS test queries using the correct execution tool** - Follow the **Tool Selection Rule** in `copilot-instructions.md`:
   - **Sentinel-native tables** (SigninLogs, AuditLogs, SecurityAlert, etc.) → Data Lake
   - **XDR tables** (Device*, Email*, Identity*, etc.) ≤ 30d → Advanced Hunting (free); > 30d → Data Lake
   - **XDR-only tables** (DeviceTvm*, Exposure*, etc.) → Advanced Hunting only
   - Adapt timestamp column when switching tools (`Timestamp` ↔ `TimeGenerated`)
   - **This is the MOST IMPORTANT validation step**

6. **ALWAYS validate syntax** (if live testing unavailable) - Use `mcp_kql-search_validate_kql_query` as fallback

7. **ALWAYS provide context** - Include:
   - What the query does
   - Expected results
   - Any limitations or notes

8. **ALWAYS read the complete ## Query Authoring Workflow**
   - Read all the steps of the workflow
   - Understand the process and actions you need to take

> **📋 Inherited rules:** This skill inherits the **KQL Pre-Flight Checklist**, **Tool Selection Rule (Data Lake vs Advanced Hunting)**, and **Known Table Pitfalls** from `copilot-instructions.md`. Those rules are authoritative — do not contradict them here.

## Query Authoring Workflow

### Step 1: Understand User Requirements

**Extract key information:**
- **Table(s) needed**: Which data source? (e.g., `SigninLogs`, `EmailEvents`, `SecurityAlert`)
- **Time range**: How far back? (e.g., last 7 days, specific date range)
- **Filters**: What specific conditions? (e.g., user, IP, threat type)
- **Output**: Statistics, detailed records, time series, aggregations?
- **Platform**: Sentinel or Defender XDR? (affects column names)
- **Deployment target**: Custom detection rule? (see below)

**Custom Detection Intent Detection:**

If the user's request mentions any of these, the queries are intended for **custom detection deployment**:
- "custom detection", "detection rule", "deploy as detection", "CD rule"
- "author detections for", "create detections for"
- "Defender XDR detection", "deploy to Defender"

When CD intent is detected:
1. **Read the detection-authoring skill** (`.github/skills/detection-authoring/SKILL.md`) — specifically the [Critical Rules](#) and [CD Metadata Contract](#) sections
2. **Design queries with CD constraints in mind** — row-level output, mandatory columns (`TimeGenerated`, `DeviceName`, `ReportId`), no bare `summarize`
3. **Include `cd-metadata` blocks** in the output file (see [Step 8](#step-8-format-and-deliver-output))
4. **Still write queries in Sentinel format** (with `let` variables, 7d lookback) — the Sentinel version is the source of truth; adaptation to CD format happens at deployment time via the detection-authoring skill

### Step 2: Check Local Query Library

**Before writing from scratch, search for existing verified queries:**

1. `grep_search` in `queries/` for the table name or keyword
2. `grep_search` in `.github/skills/` for related investigation patterns
3. Check the **Ad-Hoc Query Examples** appendix in `copilot-instructions.md`

If a suitable query exists, adapt it (substituting entity values) and skip to Step 6. These queries encode known pitfalls and schema quirks.

### Step 3: Get Table Schema (MANDATORY)

**If no local query found, start here to validate table and columns exist:**

```
mcp_kql-search_get_table_schema("<table_name>")
```

**What this returns:**
- ✅ Category (Sentinel, Defender XDR, Azure Monitor)
- ✅ Description of table purpose
- ✅ **Common columns** (most frequently used)
- ✅ **All columns** with data types
- ✅ **Example queries** (starting point)
- ✅ Keywords for search

**Use this to:**
1. Verify table exists
2. Get correct column names (avoid typos)
3. Understand data types (string, datetime, int, etc.)
4. See example query patterns

### Step 4: Get Official Code Samples

**Query Microsoft Learn for official patterns:**

```
mcp_microsoft-lea_microsoft_code_sample_search(
  query: "Detailed description of what you're trying to accomplish",
  language: "kusto"
)
```

**Best practices for search queries:**
- Include table name: "EmailEvents phishing detection"
- Include scenario: "threat hunting", "user activity", "mail flow"
- Include key concepts: "spam", "failed login", "malware"

**What you get:**
- Official Microsoft-documented patterns
- Production-validated examples
- Links to full documentation
- Best practice implementations

### Step 5: Get Community Examples

**⚠️ NOTE:** The `search_favorite_repos` tool has a known bug (see [Known Issues](#-known-issues)). Use the fallback tool instead.

**Search GitHub for real-world implementations:**

```
mcp_kql-search_search_github_examples_fallback(
  table_name: "EmailEvents",
  description: "Natural language description of query goal"
)
```

**Alternative - Search for KQL repositories:**
```
mcp_kql-search_search_kql_repositories(
  query: "sentinel detection hunting"
)
```

**What this provides:**
- Real-world query patterns from security analysts
- Detection rules from Microsoft Sentinel community
- Advanced techniques and optimizations
- Context from surrounding documentation

### Step 6: Generate Query

**Combine insights from all sources:**

1. **Use schema for column names** (authoritative source)
2. **Use Microsoft Learn for patterns** (official best practices)
3. **Use community examples for techniques** (real-world validation)

**🔥 CRITICAL: Microsoft Learn Examples Use Defender XDR Syntax!**

**⚠️ When using Microsoft Learn code samples:**
- Microsoft Learn examples use **Defender XDR Advanced Hunting** syntax with `Timestamp`
- If testing against **Sentinel**, you MUST convert `Timestamp` → `TimeGenerated` BEFORE testing
- Check the platform context - Sentinel vs Defender XDR - and adjust accordingly

**🔥 CRITICAL: Test queries BEFORE providing them to user - not after they ask!**

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Variables vs Multiple Standalone Queries**

**When user asks for MULTIPLE queries** (different analyses, different questions):
- ✅ **DO:** Start EACH query directly with table name (`EmailEvents`, `SigninLogs`, etc.)
- ❌ **DON'T:** Use shared variables (`let emailData = ...`) across separate queries
- **Why:** Each query is standalone - user runs them independently in separate windows
- **Test:** If you can't copy-paste a query alone and run it successfully, it's wrong

**When providing ONE complex query** (single cohesive analysis):
- ✅ **DO:** Use `let` variables to simplify logic and avoid repetition
- ✅ Example: `let suspiciousIPs = ...; SigninLogs | where IPAddress in (suspiciousIPs)`

**Query structure for standalone queries:**
```kql
// Description: What this query does
// Data source: Table name
// Time range: Lookback period
// Expected results: What you'll get

<TableName>
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)  // Sentinel
// OR
| where Timestamp > ago(7d)       // Defender XDR
| where <filters>
| project <relevant_columns>
| order by TimeGenerated desc
| take 100
```

### Step 7: Validate and Test (MANDATORY - Do This FIRST!)

**⚠️ TEST QUERIES BEFORE USER SEES THEM - NOT AFTER THEY ASK**

**🔴 CRITICAL PRE-TEST STEP: Platform Schema Conversion**

**BEFORE testing against Sentinel, you MUST:**
1. ✅ **Convert `Timestamp` → `TimeGenerated`** if using Microsoft Learn examples (they use Defender XDR syntax)
2. ✅ **Verify all column names** match Sentinel schema (not Defender XDR schema)
3. ✅ **Check the table exists** in Sentinel environment

**Why this matters:** Microsoft Learn code samples use `Timestamp` (Defender XDR Advanced Hunting syntax), but Sentinel uses `TimeGenerated`. Testing will FAIL if you don't convert first.

**Primary validation workflow (if Sentinel MCP available):**

1. ✅ **CONVERT SCHEMA** (Timestamp → TimeGenerated) BEFORE testing
2. ✅ **TEST AGAINST LIVE SENTINEL** using `mcp_sentinel-data_query_lake` with `| take 5`
3. ✅ Verify query returns results (not empty)
4. ✅ Fix any syntax errors or schema mismatches
5. ✅ Re-test until query works correctly
6. ✅ Only then provide query to user with confidence

**Post-test checks:**

1. ✅ Include comments explaining logic
2. ✅ Add `take` or `summarize` to limit results (remove test limits if too restrictive)
3. ✅ Check datetime formatting (see time formatting section below)

**🔥 CRITICAL: Always Test Queries Against Live Data**

**When Sentinel MCP Server is available, ALWAYS run queries to validate:**

```
mcp_sentinel-data_query_lake(
  query: "<your_complete_kql_query>",
  workspaceId: "<workspace_id_if_multiple>"  // Optional
)
```

**Why this is critical:**
- ✅ Validates query syntax against real Sentinel environment
- ✅ Confirms columns exist and are correctly typed
- ✅ Verifies data is present in the table
- ✅ Tests aggregations and calculations work correctly
- ✅ Reveals actual data patterns and edge cases
- ✅ Provides real results to show user what to expect

**Validation workflow:**

1. **Generate query** based on schema, docs, and examples
2. **Test query** using `mcp_sentinel-data_query_lake` with `| take 10` or `| take 5` limit
3. **Verify results** are sensible and expected
4. **Fix issues** if query fails or returns unexpected results
5. **Re-test** until query works correctly
6. **Provide to user** with confidence it will work

**Best practices for testing:**

- **Add `| take 10`** to limit results during testing (remove or adjust for user)
- **Test multiple queries in parallel** if providing multiple standalone queries
- **Check for empty results** - may indicate wrong table, time range, or filters
- **Verify calculations** - check that percentages, counts, and aggregations make sense
- **Review actual data values** - ensure field names and data types match expectations

**Example testing pattern:**

```kql
// Test Query: Sign-ins by user with CA status
SigninLogs
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
| summarize 
    TotalSignIns = count(),
    CASuccess = countif(ConditionalAccessStatus == "success"),
    CAFailure = countif(ConditionalAccessStatus == "failure")
    by UserPrincipalName
| order by TotalSignIns desc
| take 5  // Limit for testing
```

**If query fails:**
- Check error message for column name issues
- Verify table exists in environment
- Confirm time range has data
- Review filter syntax
- Check for typos in field names

**Schema-only validation (fallback):**
```
mcp_kql-search_validate_kql_query("<your_query>")
```
**Note:** This only validates syntax and schema, not against live data. Prefer `mcp_sentinel-data_query_lake` when available.

### Step 8: Format and Deliver Output

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Output Format Based on Query Count**

**For SINGLE query requests:**
- ✅ **DO:** Provide query directly in chat window
- ✅ Include brief explanation and expected results
- ✅ Show sample output if tested against Sentinel
- ❌ **DON'T:** Create a file for single queries

**For MULTIPLE queries (3+ queries or comprehensive query collections):**
- ✅ **DO:** Create a comprehensive markdown file
- ✅ Save to `/queries` directory in workspace root
- ✅ Use descriptive filename: `<topic>_<platform>_queries.md`
- ✅ Include all queries with full documentation
- ✅ Add examples, use cases, and tuning guidance

**File naming convention:**
```
queries/endpoint/endpoint_failed_connections.md
queries/identity/app_credential_management.md
queries/email/email_threat_detection.md
```

**Markdown file structure for multiple queries:**
```markdown
# [Topic] - [Platform] Queries

**Created:** [Date]
**Platform:** Microsoft Sentinel / Defender XDR
**Data Sources:** [Tables used]
**Timeframe:** [Default lookback period]

---

## Overview

[Brief description of query collection purpose]

---

## Query 1: [Descriptive Title]

**Purpose:** [What this query detects/analyzes]

**Thresholds:**
- [Key threshold values]

```kql
// Query code with comments
```

**Expected Results:**
- Column descriptions
- What to look for

**Indicators of [Attack/Issue]:**
- [Key patterns to identify]

**Example Output:**
[Sample results if available]

## Tuning and Customization
[How to adjust queries for environment]

## Alert Rule Recommendations
[How to convert to analytics rules]

## Investigation Workflow
[What to do with results]

---

```

**When to create query files:**
- User requests 3+ different queries
- User asks for "comprehensive" or "complete" query set
- User requests query collection for specific use case (threat hunting, investigation, monitoring)
- Queries are related and form a cohesive analysis workflow

**When to use chat output:**
- User requests 1-2 simple queries
- Quick ad-hoc query for immediate use
- User testing or learning KQL syntax
- Follow-up query to previous investigation

### Custom Detection Query Files (CD-Aware Output)

When the user's intent is custom detection deployment (detected in Step 1), the output file format has additional requirements:

**Per-query cd-metadata block:** Each query MUST include a `<!-- cd-metadata -->` HTML comment block with structured YAML fields. This block is consumed by the **detection-authoring** skill when deploying queries as custom detection rules.

The full schema is defined in `.github/skills/detection-authoring/SKILL.md` under [CD Metadata Contract]. Place the block after `Severity` / `MITRE` / `Tuning Notes` and before the KQL code block:

```markdown
### Query N: [Title]

**Purpose:** [What this detects]
**Severity:** High
**MITRE:** T1053.005

**Tuning Notes:**
- [Environment-specific guidance]

<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: true
schedule: "1H"
category: "Persistence"
title: "Suspicious Scheduled Task on {{DeviceName}}"
impactedAssets:
  - type: device
    identifier: DeviceName
recommendedActions: "Investigate the task XML and decode any encoded payloads."
adaptation_notes: "Remove let blocks, add mandatory columns"
-->

```kql
// Query code (Sentinel format with let variables, 7d lookback)
```
```

**cd-metadata field requirements:**

| Field | Required | Values |
|-------|----------|--------|
| `cd_ready` | Always | `true` or `false` — explicitly declare CD suitability |
| `schedule` | If cd_ready | `"0"` (NRT), `"1H"`, `"3H"`, `"12H"`, `"24H"` |
| `category` | If cd_ready | API category value (e.g., `Persistence`, `LateralMovement`, `Discovery`) |
| `title` | Optional | Dynamic title with `{{ColumnName}}` placeholders. **Max 3 unique `{{Column}}` refs across title + description combined** (Graph API limit; see detection-authoring skill Pitfall 14) |
| `impactedAssets` | If cd_ready | Array of `type` + `identifier` pairs |
| `recommendedActions` | Optional | Triage guidance string |
| `adaptation_notes` | Optional | What needs to change for CD format |

**For queries NOT suitable for CD** (baseline queries, statistical aggregations):
```markdown
<!-- cd-metadata
cd_ready: false
adaptation_notes: "Statistical baseline — requires bare summarize, not CD-compatible"
-->
```

**Summary table:** When creating a CD-aware query file, the Implementation Priority table at the end should include a `CD` column:

```markdown
| # | Query | Severity | MITRE | CD | Priority |
|---|-------|----------|-------|----|----------|
| 1 | ... | Medium | T1069.001 | ✅ 1H | 🟠 High |
| 6 | Baseline | Info | N/A | ❌ | ⬜ Tuning |
```

**File location:**
- **Directory:** `/queries` in workspace root
- **Git:** Already excluded in `.gitignore` (may contain environment-specific info)
- **Purpose:** Reusable query collections for common scenarios

---

## Common Query Patterns

### 1. Basic Filtering and Projection

**Use case:** Get specific records matching criteria

```kql
// Get failed sign-ins for specific user
SigninLogs
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
| where UserPrincipalName =~ "user@domain.com"
| where ResultType != "0"  // 0 = success
| project TimeGenerated, IPAddress, Location, ResultDescription
| order by TimeGenerated desc
| take 100
```

---

### 2. Aggregation and Statistics

**Use case:** Count, summarize, or group data

```kql
// Count emails by threat type
EmailEvents
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
| summarize Count = count() by ThreatTypes
| order by Count desc
```

---

### 3. Time Series Analysis

**Use case:** Trend over time

```kql
// Daily sign-in volume
SigninLogs
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| summarize Count = count() by bin(TimeGenerated, 1d)
| order by TimeGenerated asc
| render timechart
```

---

### 4. Multiple Conditions

**Use case:** Complex filtering logic

```kql
// High-risk sign-ins
SigninLogs
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
| where RiskLevelDuringSignIn in ("high", "medium")
| where RiskState == "atRisk"
| where ConditionalAccessStatus != "success"
| project TimeGenerated, UserPrincipalName, IPAddress, Location, RiskLevelDuringSignIn
| order by TimeGenerated desc
```

---

### 5. Joins Across Tables

**Use case:** Correlate data from multiple sources

```kql
// Email threats with user info
EmailEvents
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
| where ThreatTypes has_any ("Phish", "Malware")
| join kind=inner (
    IdentityInfo
    | distinct AccountUpn, Department, JobTitle
) on $left.RecipientEmailAddress == $right.AccountUpn
| project TimeGenerated, RecipientEmailAddress, Department, JobTitle, ThreatTypes, Subject
```

---

### 6. JSON Parsing

**Use case:** Extract data from dynamic/JSON columns

```kql
// Parse authentication details
SigninLogs
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
| extend AuthDetails = parse_json(AuthenticationDetails)
| mv-expand AuthDetails
| extend AuthMethod = tostring(AuthDetails.authenticationMethod)
| project TimeGenerated, UserPrincipalName, AuthMethod
```

---

### 7. Statistical Analysis

**Use case:** Percentiles, averages, distributions

```kql
// Sign-in duration statistics
SigninLogs
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
| where isnotempty(ProcessingTimeInMilliseconds)
| summarize 
    AvgTime = avg(ProcessingTimeInMilliseconds),
    P50 = percentile(ProcessingTimeInMilliseconds, 50),
    P95 = percentile(ProcessingTimeInMilliseconds, 95),
    P99 = percentile(ProcessingTimeInMilliseconds, 99)
```

### 8. Dynamic Type Casting

**Use case:** Converting dynamic/JSON types to strings for manipulation

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Always convert dynamic types to string BEFORE using string functions**

**❌ Wrong - Will cause "expected string expression" error:**
```kql
EmailEvents
| where isnotempty(ThreatTypes)
| extend ThreatType = split(ThreatTypes, ",")
| mv-expand ThreatType
| extend ThreatType = trim(" ", ThreatType)  // ERROR: ThreatType is still dynamic
```

**✅ Correct - Convert to string first:**
```kql
EmailEvents
| where isnotempty(ThreatTypes)
| extend ThreatType = split(ThreatTypes, ",")
| mv-expand ThreatType
| extend ThreatType = tostring(ThreatType)  // Convert to string first
| extend ThreatType = trim(@"\s", ThreatType)  // Now string functions work
```

**Common scenarios requiring type conversion:**

```kql
// After mv-expand
| mv-expand AuthDetails
| extend AuthMethod = tostring(AuthDetails.authenticationMethod)  // Convert before use

// After parse_json
| extend Details = parse_json(AdditionalFields)
| extend EventType = tostring(Details.EventType)  // Convert before string operations

// After split operations
| extend Parts = split(UserPrincipalName, "@")
| extend Domain = tostring(Parts[1])  // Convert array element to string
```

**Rule of thumb:** If you get "expected string expression" error, add `tostring()` before the problematic operation.

## CRITICAL: Schema Differences

### Timestamp Column Names

**⚠️ MOST COMMON ERROR: Using wrong timestamp column**

| Platform | Column Name | Usage |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| **Microsoft Sentinel** | `TimeGenerated` | All ingested logs |
| **Defender XDR** | `Timestamp` | Advanced Hunting tables |
| **Azure Monitor** | `TimeGenerated` | Log Analytics tables |

**Example differences:**

```kql
// ✅ CORRECT for Sentinel
EmailEvents
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)

// ✅ CORRECT for Defender XDR
EmailEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(7d)
```

**How to avoid errors:**
1. Ask user which platform they're using
2. Check schema with `mcp_kql-search_get_table_schema`
3. Look at example queries in schema output
4. If query fails with "column not found", try alternate name

---

### Time Range Formatting

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Use `ago()` function, NOT datetime literals**

**✅ CORRECT - Use ago() function:**
```kql
SigninLogs
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)   // Last 7 days
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)  // Last 30 days
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1h)   // Last 1 hour
```

**❌ WRONG - Hardcoded datetime strings (will fail or give wrong results):**
```kql
SigninLogs
| where TimeGenerated > "2026-01-06"  // ERROR: String comparison
| where TimeGenerated > 2026-01-06    // ERROR: Invalid syntax
```

**For specific date ranges, use `between()` with `datetime()` function:**
```kql
let start = datetime(2026-01-01);
let end = datetime(2026-01-13);
SigninLogs
| where TimeGenerated between (start .. end)
```

**Common time range patterns:**
```kql
// Relative time ranges (PREFERRED)
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)      // Last 7 days
| where TimeGenerated > ago(24h)     // Last 24 hours
| where TimeGenerated > ago(90d)     // Last 90 days

// Specific date ranges
let startDate = datetime(2026-01-01);
let endDate = datetime(2026-01-31);
| where TimeGenerated between (startDate .. endDate)

// Time window (last X to Y ago)
| where TimeGenerated between (ago(14d) .. ago(7d))  // Between 14 and 7 days ago
```

**Time units for ago():**
- `d` = days
- `h` = hours
- `m` = minutes
- `s` = seconds

**Why ago() is preferred:**
- Always relative to query execution time
- No timezone confusion
- Works across all environments
- No need to calculate dates manually

---

### Other Common Differences

| Column | Sentinel | Defender XDR | Notes |
|--------|----------|--------------|-------|
| User identity | `Identity`, `UserPrincipalName` | `AccountUpn`, `AccountName` | Check schema |
| IP address | `IPAddress` | `RemoteIP`, `LocalIP` | Context-dependent |
| Device name | `DeviceName` | `DeviceName` | Usually consistent |

---

## Validation Rules

### Pre-Execution Checklist

Before providing any query to user:

- [ ] **Schema validated**: All tables exist
- [ ] **Columns verified**: All columns exist with correct names
- [ ] **Time column correct**: `TimeGenerated` vs `Timestamp`
- [ ] **Time filter included**: Always filter on time for performance
- [ ] **Results limited**: Include `take` or `summarize` to avoid huge results
- [ ] **Comments added**: Explain what query does
- [ ] **Data types correct**: String comparisons use `==` or `=~`, not `=`
- [ ] **Syntax valid**: No obvious typos or errors

---

### Common Syntax Errors to Avoid

**❌ Wrong:**
```kql
// Missing time filter
SigninLogs | where UserPrincipalName == "user@domain.com"

// Wrong timestamp column
EmailEvents | where Timestamp > ago(7d)  // If on Sentinel

// No result limit
SecurityAlert | where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)  // Could return 1000s of rows

// Wrong string comparison
SigninLogs | where UserPrincipalName = "user@domain.com"  // Use == or =~
```

**✅ Correct:**
```kql
// Time filter + result limit
SigninLogs 
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
| where UserPrincipalName =~ "user@domain.com"  // =~ is case-insensitive
| take 100

// Correct timestamp for platform
EmailEvents 
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)  // Sentinel
| take 100

// Aggregation instead of raw records
SecurityAlert 
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
| summarize Count = count() by Severity

// Case-insensitive comparison
SigninLogs 
| where UserPrincipalName =~ "user@domain.com"  // =~ for case-insensitive
```

---

## Best Practices

### Performance Optimization

1. **Always filter on time first**
   ```kql
   | where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)  // First filter
   | where UserPrincipalName =~ "user@domain.com"  // Then specific filters
   ```

2. **Use `take` for exploration**
   ```kql
   | take 100  // Limit results during testing
   ```

3. **Use `summarize` instead of raw records**
   ```kql
   // Better
   | summarize Count = count() by Category
   
   // Avoid for large datasets
   | project Category, Details, TimeGenerated
   ```

4. **Project only needed columns**
   ```kql
   | project TimeGenerated, UserPrincipalName, IPAddress  // Only what you need
   ```

5. **Avoid wildcards in filters**
   ```kql
   // Better
   | where UserPrincipalName has "admin"
   
   // Slower
   | where UserPrincipalName contains "admin"
   ```

---

### Security and Privacy

1. **Limit sensitive data exposure**
   ```kql
   // Redact PII if needed
   | extend MaskedEmail = strcat(substring(UserPrincipalName, 0, 3), "***")
   ```

2. **Be careful with `take`**
   ```kql
   // Good for testing
   | take 10
   
   // May miss important data
   | take 1  // Too restrictive
   ```

3. **Filter early, filter often**
   ```kql
   | where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)  // Reduce dataset early
   | where isnotempty(UserPrincipalName)  // Remove nulls
   | where UserPrincipalName !has "service"  // Exclude service accounts
   ```

---

### Code Quality

1. **Always include comments**
   ```kql
   // Get failed sign-ins for admin accounts in last 24 hours
   SigninLogs
   | where TimeGenerated > ago(1d)
   | where UserPrincipalName has "admin"
   | where ResultType != "0"
   | project TimeGenerated, UserPrincipalName, IPAddress, ResultDescription
   ```

2. **Use meaningful variable names**
   ```kql
   let SuspiciousIPs = dynamic(["203.0.113.42", "198.51.100.10"]);
   SigninLogs
   | where IPAddress in (SuspiciousIPs)
   ```

3. **Format for readability**
   ```kql
   // Good formatting
   SigninLogs
   | where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
   | where ResultType != "0"
   | summarize 
       FailedCount = count(),
       UniqueIPs = dcount(IPAddress)
       by UserPrincipalName
   | order by FailedCount desc
   ```

4. **Break complex queries into steps**
   ```kql
   let FailedSignins = SigninLogs
       | where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
       | where ResultType != "0";
   
   let HighRiskUsers = FailedSignins
       | summarize FailCount = count() by UserPrincipalName
       | where FailCount > 10;
   
   HighRiskUsers
   | join kind=inner (FailedSignins) on UserPrincipalName
   | project TimeGenerated, UserPrincipalName, IPAddress, Location
   ```

5. **⚠️ CRITICAL: Use table names directly when providing multiple standalone queries**
   
   **❌ WRONG - Shared variables don't work across separate query executions:**
   ```kql
   // This pattern FAILS when user runs queries separately
   let emailData = EmailEvents | where Timestamp > ago(7d);
   
   // Query 1
   emailData  
   | summarize count() by EmailDirection
   
   // Query 2 - ERROR: 'emailData' is undefined in separate query window
   emailData  
   | summarize count() by ThreatTypes
   ```
   
   **✅ CORRECT - Each query references table directly (standalone/independent):**
   ```kql
   // Query 1: Mail flow by direction
   EmailEvents
   | where Timestamp > ago(7d)
   | summarize count() by EmailDirection
   
   // Query 2: Threats summary (completely independent)
   EmailEvents
   | where Timestamp > ago(7d)
   | summarize count() by ThreatTypes
   ```
   
   **✅ CORRECT - Variables WITHIN a single complex query:**
   ```kql
   // Single unified query - variables work here
   let emailData = EmailEvents | where Timestamp > ago(7d);
   let threatEmails = emailData | where isnotempty(ThreatTypes);
   
   threatEmails
   | summarize 
       TotalThreats = count(),
       BlockedCount = countif(DeliveryAction == "Blocked")
       by ThreatTypes
   ```
   
   **Decision Matrix:**
   
   | User Request | Pattern to Use | Reason |
   |-------------|----------------|---------|
   | "Show me 5 different mail flow analyses" | ❌ NO variables, ✅ Each query starts with `EmailEvents` | User runs each independently |
   | "Analyze mail flow with multiple dimensions" | ❌ NO variables, ✅ Each query starts with `EmailEvents` | Separate questions = separate queries |
   | "Create a comprehensive mail flow report" | ✅ ONE query with variables | Single cohesive analysis |
   | "Build a complex threat hunting query" | ✅ ONE query with variables | Logical flow within single execution |
   
   **Golden Rule:** If you're generating multiple queries separated by blank lines/headers, ALWAYS start each with the table name directly. Variables are ONLY for internal use within a single query.

## Query Output Formats

### 1. Provide Query with Context

**Always include:**
```markdown
## Query Name: [Descriptive Title]

**Purpose:** [What this query does]

**Data Source:** [Table name]

**Time Range:** [Lookback period]

**Platform:** [Sentinel / Defender XDR]

**Expected Results:** [What you'll get]

```kql
// [Query with comments]
```

**Key Columns:**
- `ColumnName`: Description
- `ColumnName`: Description

**Notes:**
- Any caveats or limitations
- Performance considerations
- Customization suggestions
```

---

### 2. Provide Multiple Variations

**Example:**

```markdown
### Option 1: Summary Statistics
```kql
EmailEvents
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
| summarize Count = count() by ThreatTypes
| order by Count desc
```

### Option 2: Detailed Records
```kql
EmailEvents
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
| where isnotempty(ThreatTypes)
| project TimeGenerated, RecipientEmailAddress, SenderFromAddress, ThreatTypes, Subject
| take 100
```

### Option 3: Time Series
```kql
EmailEvents
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
| summarize Count = count() by bin(TimeGenerated, 1d), ThreatTypes
| render timechart
```
```

---

### 3. Include Execution Guidance

**Add instructions:**

```markdown
## How to Run This Query

### In Microsoft Sentinel:
1. Navigate to **Logs** blade
2. Paste query
3. Set time range in picker (if not using `ago()`)
4. Click **Run**

### In Defender XDR:
1. Go to **Advanced Hunting**
2. Paste query
3. Adjust `Timestamp` if needed
4. Click **Run query**

### Via MCP Server:
```
mcp_sentinel-data_query_lake(query: "<query>")
```

## Expected Output Format

[Describe what user will see in results]
```

---

## Error Handling

### Common Errors and Solutions

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `Failed to resolve column 'Timestamp'` | Wrong platform (Sentinel uses `TimeGenerated`) | Change to `TimeGenerated` |
| `Failed to resolve column 'TimeGenerated'` | Wrong platform (XDR uses `Timestamp`) | Change to `Timestamp` |
| `Table 'EmailEvents' not found` | Table not available in environment | Verify table exists with schema tool |
| `Syntax error near '='` | Used `=` instead of `==` | Use `==` or `=~` for comparisons |
| `argument #2 expected to be a string expression` | String function used on dynamic type (after `mv-expand` or `parse_json`) | Add `tostring()` before string operations |
| `'let' statement not recognized` | Using variables across separate query contexts | Reference table name directly in each query |
| Query timeout | Too much data, no time filter | Add `where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)` |
| Too many results | No `take` or `summarize` | Add `| take 100` or aggregate |

---

### Troubleshooting Workflow

**When query fails:**

1. **Check schema**
   ```
   mcp_kql-search_get_table_schema("<table>")
   ```

2. **Validate syntax**
   ```
   mcp_kql-search_validate_kql_query("<query>")
   ```

3. **Verify column names**
   - Look at schema output
   - Check example queries
   - Try `mcp_kql-search_find_column("<column>")`

4. **Check platform**
   - Ask user: Sentinel or XDR?
   - Adjust timestamp column accordingly

5. **Simplify query**
   - Remove complex logic
   - Test basic `| take 10` first
   - Add filters incrementally

---

## Example Workflow

**User asks:** "Write a KQL query to find phishing emails in the last 7 days"

### Step 1: Get Schema
```
mcp_kql-search_get_table_schema("EmailEvents")
```

**Result:** Table exists, has columns `ThreatTypes`, `TimeGenerated` (Sentinel), `RecipientEmailAddress`, etc.

### Step 2: Get Official Examples
```
mcp_microsoft-lea_microsoft_code_sample_search(
  query: "EmailEvents phishing ThreatTypes KQL",
  language: "kusto"
)
```

**Result:** Found pattern: `where ThreatTypes has "Phish"`

### Step 3: Get Community Examples
```
mcp_kql-search_search_github_examples_fallback(
  table_name: "EmailEvents",
  description: "phishing detection delivered"
)
```

**Result:** Found examples with additional filters like `DeliveryAction == "Delivered"`

### Step 4: Generate Query

```kql
// Hunt for phishing emails delivered in last 7 days
// Data source: EmailEvents (Microsoft Defender for Office 365)
// Platform: Microsoft Sentinel
// Time range: Last 7 days

EmailEvents
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
| where ThreatTypes has "Phish"
| where DeliveryAction == "Delivered"
| project 
    TimeGenerated,
    RecipientEmailAddress,
    SenderFromAddress,
    Subject,
    DeliveryLocation,
    DetectionMethods
| order by TimeGenerated desc
| take 100
```

### Step 5: Provide Context

**Purpose:** Find phishing emails that were successfully delivered to users in the last 7 days

**Platform:** Microsoft Sentinel (uses `TimeGenerated`)

**Expected Results:** Up to 100 phishing emails with recipient, sender, subject, and detection details

**Key Columns:**
- `TimeGenerated`: When email was processed
- `RecipientEmailAddress`: Who received the phishing email
- `SenderFromAddress`: Attacker's email address
- `DetectionMethods`: How the phishing was detected
- `DeliveryLocation`: Where email was delivered (Inbox, Junk, etc.)

**Customization:**
- Change `7d` to adjust time range
- Remove `DeliveryAction` filter to see blocked phishing too
- Add `| where RecipientEmailAddress has "domain.com"` to filter by domain

---

## Summary

**Core Workflow:**
1. ✅ Get schema → Validate table and columns
2. ✅ Get Microsoft Learn samples → Official patterns
3. ✅ Get community examples → Real-world validation
4. ✅ Generate query → Combine insights
5. ✅ Validate → Check syntax and schema
6. ✅ Provide context → Explain query to user

**Key Success Factors:**
- Always validate schema first
- Check platform-specific columns (`TimeGenerated` vs `Timestamp`)
- Combine multiple sources (schema + Learn + community)
- Include comments and context
- Add time filters and result limits
- Test before providing to user

**Remember:** The schema is the authoritative source for column names. Microsoft Learn provides official patterns. Community queries show real-world usage. Combine all three for best results.
