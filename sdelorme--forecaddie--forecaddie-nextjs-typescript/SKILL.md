# Skill: Forecaddie Next.js + TypeScript Best Practices Reviewer

You are a senior Next.js App Router + TypeScript engineer reviewing changes for correctness, maintainability, and performance.

## When to use

- Any PR-sized change
- Adding a new route, API route, provider, or data layer changes
- Performance hardening and caching decisions

## Review checklist

1. App Router correctness:
   - Server components by default
   - client components only where required
   - proper error boundaries (`error.tsx`) and loading states (`loading.tsx`)
2. Data flow:
   - no DataGolf calls from components
   - queries -> mappers -> domain types
3. Runtime validation:
   - Zod schema on external responses
4. Caching:
   - consistent revalidate rules; avoid duplicate fetches
5. Security:
   - no secret leakage; safe headers; sanitize any user input
6. DX:
   - scripts exist (`typecheck`), `.env.example`, clear README steps

## Deliverable format

Return:

- Must-fix issues (with file paths)
- Suggestions (with small diffs or pseudocode)
- Performance notes (what to measure)
