# Skill: Vercel Deployment

Complete guide for deploying Next.js applications to Vercel with automatic error fixing, environment configuration, and troubleshooting.

## When to Use

- Deploying Next.js app to Vercel production
- Fixing deployment build errors
- Configuring environment variables
- Setting up image optimization domains
- Troubleshooting production deployment issues
- Automating deploy-fix-redeploy loops

## Domain Knowledge

### Critical Patterns

#### Environment Variables Must Be Set in Dashboard (CRITICAL)

Environment variables for production deployments MUST be configured in the Vercel dashboard, not just in local `.env.local`.

**Where to set:**
1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Settings → Environment Variables
4. Add variables for Production, Preview, and/or Development

**Common variables to set:**
```bash
# Convex
CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=prod:your-deployment
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=https://your-deployment.convex.cloud

# Clerk Auth
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_xxx
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_xxx
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up

# Other services
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_xxx
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_xxx
```

**Why this matters:** Build will fail with "Missing environment variable" errors if not set in dashboard.

#### NEXT_PUBLIC_ Prefix for Client-Side Variables

Environment variables used in the browser MUST have the `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix.

```typescript
// ❌ Wrong - not available in browser
const apiUrl = process.env.API_URL;

// ✅ Correct - accessible in browser
const apiUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL;
```

**Rule:**
- **Server-only**: No prefix (e.g., `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`)
- **Client-accessible**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix (e.g., `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`)

**Why:** Next.js only bundles variables with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix into the client bundle for security.

#### Image Domain Configuration

Next.js Image component requires remote domains to be configured in `next.config.ts`:

```typescript
// next.config.ts
const config = {
  images: {
    remotePatterns: [
      {
        protocol: 'https',
        hostname: 'img.clerk.com',
      },
      {
        protocol: 'https',
        hostname: '*.convex.cloud',
      },
      {
        protocol: 'https',
        hostname: 'your-cdn.com',
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

**Why:** Vercel blocks unconfigured image domains for security and optimization.

#### Git Push Triggers Automatic Deployment

Vercel automatically deploys when you push to connected Git repository:

- **Main branch** → Production deployment
- **Other branches** → Preview deployment
- **Pull requests** → Preview deployment with unique URL

**Manual deployment:**
```bash
vercel --prod  # Deploy to production
vercel         # Deploy to preview
```

### Key Files

- **next.config.ts** - Next.js configuration (images, redirects, env vars)
- **.env.example** - Template for required environment variables
- **vercel.json** - Vercel deployment configuration (optional)
- **package.json** - Build scripts and dependencies

### Build Process

Vercel build process:

1. **Install dependencies** - `npm install` or equivalent
2. **Run build script** - `npm run build`
3. **Generate pages** - Static and dynamic routes
4. **Optimize assets** - Images, fonts, scripts
5. **Deploy** - Upload to CDN

**Build must succeed** for deployment to complete.

## Automatic Deployment Workflow

### Instructions

When requested to deploy to Vercel production with automatic error fixing:

1. **Initial Deployment Attempt**
   - Run `vercel --prod` to start production deployment
   - Wait for deployment to complete

2. **Error Detection & Analysis**
   - **CRITICAL**: Use Vercel MCP tool to fetch detailed logs:
     - The MCP logs provide much more detail than CLI output
   - Analyze the build logs to identify root cause:
     - Build errors (TypeScript, ESLint, compilation)
     - Runtime errors
     - Environment variable issues
     - Dependency problems
     - Configuration issues
   - Extract specific error messages

3. **Error Fixing**
   - Make minimal, targeted fixes to resolve the specific error

4. **Retry Deployment**
   - Run `vercel --prod` again with the fixes applied
   - Repeat steps until deployment succeeds

5. **Success Confirmation**
   - Once deployment succeeds, report:
     - Deployment URL
     - All errors that were fixed
     - Summary of changes made
   - Ask if user wants to commit/push the fixes

## Loop Exit Conditions

- ✅ Deployment succeeds
- ❌ SAME error occurs 5+ times (suggest manual intervention)
- ❌ User requests to stop

## Best Practices
- Make incremental fixes rather than large refactors
- Preserve user's code style and patterns when fixing

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Build Fails with Missing Environment Variables

**Symptoms:**
- Build error: "Environment variable 'X' is not defined"
- Build succeeds locally but fails on Vercel
- Variables set in `.env.local` but not working in production

**Cause:** Environment variables not configured in Vercel dashboard

**Solution:**

1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Select project → Settings → Environment Variables
3. Add missing variables for Production environment
4. Redeploy (or trigger by pushing to Git)

**Check for correct prefix:**
- Client-side vars need `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix
- Server-side vars don't need prefix

**Frequency:** High (very common issue)

### Issue: Images Not Loading in Production

**Symptoms:**
- Images work locally
- Production shows broken image or error
- Console error: "Invalid src prop"

**Cause:** Image domains not configured in `next.config.ts`

**Solution:**

Add remote domains to `next.config.ts`:

```typescript
const config = {
  images: {
    remotePatterns: [
      {
        protocol: 'https',
        hostname: 'your-image-host.com',
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

Common image hosts:
- Clerk: `img.clerk.com`
- Convex: `*.convex.cloud`
- Cloudinary: `res.cloudinary.com`

**Frequency:** Medium

### Issue: Build Succeeds Locally But Fails on Vercel

**Possible Causes:**

**1. TypeScript errors ignored locally**
- Solution: Run `npm run build` locally to catch errors
- Check `next.config.ts` for `typescript.ignoreBuildErrors`

**2. ESLint errors**
- Solution: Run `npm run lint` to check
- Fix errors or configure rules appropriately

**3. Missing dependencies**
- Solution: Ensure all imports are in `package.json` dependencies
- Run `npm install` to verify

**4. Environment-specific code**
- Solution: Check for hardcoded values that differ between environments
- Use environment variables for environment-specific config

**Frequency:** Medium

### Issue: Deployment Stuck or Taking Too Long

**Symptoms:**
- Deployment shows "Building..." for extended period
- No error messages
- Build logs show no progress

**Possible Causes:**

**1. Large dependencies**
- Solution: Check `package.json` for unnecessary large packages
- Consider code splitting or lazy loading

**2. Build timeout**
- Solution: Optimize build process
- Check for infinite loops in build scripts

**3. Vercel platform issue**
- Solution: Check Vercel status page
- Try redeploying after a few minutes

**Frequency:** Low

## Example Flow

**User:** "Deploy to production and fix any errors"


- Vercel MCP build logs are the PRIMARY source of error information
- CLI output alone is insufficient for proper error diagnosis
- Always wait for deployment to complete before fetching logs
- If errors require user input (like API keys), prompt user immediately
