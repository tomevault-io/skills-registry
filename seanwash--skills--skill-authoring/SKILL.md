# Skill Authoring Guide

## Required Structure

```
skill-name/
└── SKILL.md
```

For complex skills with additional resources:

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md           # Main instructions (<500 lines)
├── reference.md       # Detailed docs (loaded as needed)
└── scripts/
    └── utility.py     # Executed, not loaded into context
```

## SKILL.md Format

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: What it does and when to use it. Third person. Max 1024 chars.
---

# Skill Title

[Instructions and examples]
```

### Frontmatter Rules

**name** (required):
- Max 64 characters
- Lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens only
- No "anthropic" or "claude"

**description** (required):
- Max 1024 characters
- Third person ("Processes files..." not "I process...")
- Include WHAT it does AND WHEN to trigger it

## Writing Principles

### Be Concise

Claude is already knowledgeable. Only add context it doesn't have.

```markdown
// 🔴 Too verbose
PDF (Portable Document Format) files are a common format...
There are many libraries available...

// ✅ Concise
Use pdfplumber for text extraction:
```python
with pdfplumber.open("file.pdf") as pdf:
    text = pdf.pages[0].extract_text()
```
```

### Set Appropriate Freedom

| Task Type | Freedom Level | Approach |
|-----------|---------------|----------|
| Fragile/critical operations | Low | Exact scripts, no variation |
| Preferred patterns exist | Medium | Templates with parameters |
| Multiple valid approaches | High | Guidelines, let Claude decide |

### Progressive Disclosure

Keep SKILL.md as overview. Reference detailed content:

```markdown
## Quick start
[Essential instructions here]

## Advanced features
See [ADVANCED.md](ADVANCED.md) for complex workflows.
```

**Keep references one level deep** - don't nest references in referenced files.

## Description Examples

```yaml
# Good - specific, includes triggers
description: Extracts text and tables from PDF files, fills forms, merges documents. Use when working with PDF files or when the user mentions PDFs, forms, or document extraction.

# Good - clear capability and trigger
description: Generates commit messages by analyzing git diffs. Use when the user asks for help writing commit messages or reviewing staged changes.

# Bad - too vague
description: Helps with documents.
```

## Content Patterns

### Decision Tables

```markdown
| Situation | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Need X | Do Y |
| Need Z | Do W |
```

### Anti-Pattern Format

```markdown
### Problem Name

```language
// 🔴 Avoid
[bad code]

// ✅ Better
[good code]
```
```

### Workflows with Checklists

For complex multi-step tasks:

````markdown
## Workflow

Copy and track progress:

```
- [ ] Step 1: Analyze input
- [ ] Step 2: Validate
- [ ] Step 3: Execute
- [ ] Step 4: Verify
```

**Step 1: Analyze input**
[details]
````

### Feedback Loops

```markdown
1. Make changes
2. Run validation: `python validate.py`
3. If errors: fix and return to step 2
4. Only proceed when validation passes
```

## Utility Scripts

Scripts execute without loading into context - more efficient than generated code.

```markdown
**analyze.py**: Extract form fields

```bash
python scripts/analyze.py input.pdf > fields.json
```
```

Make clear whether Claude should **execute** (common) or **read as reference** (rare).

## Avoid

- Time-sensitive information (use "old patterns" section if needed)
- Windows-style paths (`\`) - always use forward slashes
- Multiple equivalent options without a clear default
- Vague descriptions ("helps with things")
- Deeply nested file references
- Magic numbers without explanation

## Checklist

Before publishing:

- [ ] `name`: lowercase, hyphens, ≤64 chars
- [ ] `description`: third person, what + when, ≤1024 chars
- [ ] SKILL.md body <500 lines
- [ ] No unnecessary explanations (Claude knows basics)
- [ ] References one level deep
- [ ] Tested with actual usage scenarios
