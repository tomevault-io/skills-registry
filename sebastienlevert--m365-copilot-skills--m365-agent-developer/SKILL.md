# M365 Agent Developer

This comprehensive skill provides expert guidance on the Microsoft 365 Copilot agent development lifecycle: from architectural design through TypeSpec implementation to deployment and publishing using the Agents Toolkit (ATK) CLI.

⚠️ **For creating new projects, use the m365-agent-scaffolder skill first** ⚠️

🚨 **CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT RULE** 🚨
When using this skill to make edits to an agent, you MUST ALWAYS deploy the agent using `atk provision` before returning to the user. This ensures changes are immediately reflected in M365 Copilot. Never return to the user with undeployed changes.

---

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Designing the architecture for a new M365 Copilot agent
- Implementing TypeSpec code for agent capabilities and API plugins
- Configuring agent instructions and conversation starters
- Provisioning and deploying agents using ATK CLI
- Managing agent lifecycle across environments (dev, staging, production)
- Reviewing existing agent architectures for best practices
- Troubleshooting TypeSpec compilation or deployment issues
- Adding new capabilities or API plugins to existing agents
- Implementing security patterns and compliance requirements
- Packaging and publishing agents for sharing

Do NOT use this skill for creating new empty projects - use the `m365-agent-scaffolder` skill instead.

## Instructions

Follow these step-by-step instructions when working with M365 Copilot agents:

### Step 1: Understand the Requirements

**Action:** Gather and analyze the agent requirements:
- Identify the agent's primary purpose and target users
- Determine required data sources (M365 services, external APIs)
- List necessary actions the agent must perform
- Identify security and compliance requirements

**Why it's important:** Clear requirements drive architectural decisions and ensure the agent meets user needs.

### Step 2: Design the Agent Architecture

**Action:** Create a comprehensive architectural design:
- Select deployment model (personal or shared)
- Choose appropriate M365 capabilities with scoping
- Design API plugin integrations if needed
- Plan authentication and authorization strategy
- Design conversation flow and instructions

**Reference:** Follow the [Architectural Design](#architectural-design) section and [patterns-and-frameworks.md](references/patterns-and-frameworks.md)

### Step 3: Implement TypeSpec Code

**Action:** Write type-safe agent code using TypeSpec:
- Define agent with `@agent` decorator
- Configure capabilities with appropriate scoping
- Implement API plugin actions with authentication
- Write clear instructions and conversation starters
- Document all models and operations with `@doc`

**Reference:** Follow [TypeSpec Best Practices](references/typespec-best-practices.md) and official [typespec-decorators.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MicrosoftDocs/m365copilot-docs/refs/heads/main/docs/typespec-decorators.md)

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** After making any edits to TypeSpec code, you MUST compile and deploy the agent (Steps 4-5) before returning to the user.

### Step 4: Compile and Validate

**Action:** Compile TypeSpec to validate the implementation:
```bash
npm run compile
```

**Why it's important:** Compilation catches syntax errors and validates decorator usage before deployment.

### Step 5: Provision Azure Resources

**Action:** Provision required Azure resources and register the agent:
```bash
npx -p @microsoft/m365agentstoolkit-cli@latest atk provision --env local
```

**Result:** Returns a test URL like `https://m365.cloud.microsoft/chat/?titleId=U_abc123xyz`

### Step 6: Test and Iterate

**Action:** Test the agent in Microsoft 365 Copilot:
- Use the provisioned test URL
- Test all conversation starters
- Verify capability access and scoping
- Test error handling and edge cases
- Validate security controls

### Step 7: Deploy to Environments

**Action:** Deploy to staging/production environments:
```bash
npx -p @microsoft/m365agentstoolkit-cli@latest atk provision --env prod
```

**Reference:** Follow [deployment.md](references/deployment.md) for environment management and CI/CD patterns

### Step 8: Package and Share

**Action:** Package and share the agent:
```bash
# Package the agent
npx -p @microsoft/m365agentstoolkit-cli@latest atk provision --env dev

# Share to tenant (for shared agents)
npx -p @microsoft/m365agentstoolkit-cli@latest atk share --scope tenant --env dev
```

**Reference:** See [deployment.md](references/deployment.md) for sharing strategies

## Critical Workflow Rules

### Always Deploy After Edits

**RULE:** When making any changes to an agent (TypeSpec code, instructions, capabilities, API plugins), you MUST complete the following workflow before returning to the user:

1. Compile the TypeSpec code: `npm run compile`
2. Provision/deploy the agent: `npx -p @microsoft/m365agentstoolkit-cli@latest atk provision --env local`
3. Confirm deployment succeeded and provide the test URL

**Why this is critical:**
- Changes are not reflected in M365 Copilot until the agent is redeployed
- Users expect to test changes immediately after you make them
- Undeployed changes create confusion and waste time
- This ensures a complete, testable solution is always delivered

**Never skip deployment:** Even for minor changes like updating instructions or conversation starters, always redeploy. M365 Copilot only sees the deployed version.

### Always Clean Up Unused Files

**RULE:** Every time you work on an agent project, check for and remove unused or obsolete files:

1. **Check for orphaned files:** Look for files not referenced anywhere in the project
2. **Remove generated artifacts:** Delete old build outputs, temp files, and stale generated code
3. **Clean unused dependencies:** Remove unused imports and dependencies
4. **Delete obsolete documentation:** Remove outdated docs that no longer apply

**Files to check and potentially remove:**
- `TODO.md` or planning files no longer needed
- Old backup files (`.bak`, `.old`, `.orig`)
- Unused TypeSpec files not imported anywhere
- Stale environment files (`.env.old`, `.env.backup`)
- Empty or placeholder files
- Commented-out code blocks that will never be used
- Unused model definitions or operations

**Why this is critical:**
- Clean projects are easier to understand and maintain
- Unused files create confusion about what's active
- Old files may contain outdated patterns or security issues
- Smaller projects are faster to compile and deploy

**Before returning to the user:** Always verify the project contains only necessary, actively-used files.
