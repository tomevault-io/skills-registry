# Parakeet-MLX Audio Transcription

This skill provides instructions for using parakeet-mlx to convert audio files to text using NVIDIA's Parakeet automatic speech recognition model optimized for Apple's MLX framework.

## Overview

Parakeet-MLX brings NVIDIA's Parakeet ASR model to Apple Silicon, enabling fast, high-quality on-device speech-to-text conversion similar to Whisper but optimized for Apple's MLX framework.

**Key Features:**
- High-quality transcription with timestamps
- Fast processing (e.g., 1+ hour audio in ~53 seconds)
- On-device processing (no cloud API required)
- Output in SRT subtitle format
- No installation required - run directly with `uvx`

## Basic Usage

### Transcribe an Audio File

The simplest way to transcribe an audio file is:

```bash
uvx parakeet-mlx /path/to/audio/file.mp3
```

This will:
1. Download the model on first run (~2.5GB)
2. Process the audio file
3. Generate an SRT subtitle file with timestamped transcription

**Example:**

```bash
# Transcribe a podcast episode
uvx parakeet-mlx podcast_episode.mp3

# Transcribe an interview
uvx parakeet-mlx interview.wav

# Transcribe a meeting recording
uvx parakeet-mlx meeting_recording.m4a
```

## Important Notes

### First Run

**The first time you run parakeet-mlx, it will download a ~2.5GB model file.** This may take several minutes depending on your internet connection. Subsequent runs will use the cached model and start immediately.

### Performance

Parakeet-MLX is optimized for Apple Silicon and provides excellent performance:
- A 65MB, 1 hour 1 minute 28 second podcast was transcribed in 53 seconds
- Performance scales with audio duration, not file size
- Processing happens entirely on-device

### Output Format

The tool generates an **SRT (SubRip Subtitle)** file with the same name as your input file:

**Input:** `podcast.mp3`
**Output:** `podcast.srt`

The SRT format includes:
- Sequential subtitle numbers
- Timestamp ranges (start --> end)
- Transcribed text for each segment

**Example SRT output:**
```
1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
Welcome to the podcast. Today we're discussing...

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:08,200
The latest developments in machine learning...
```

### Supported Audio Formats

While the documentation explicitly mentions MP3, parakeet-mlx likely supports common audio formats including:
- MP3
- WAV
- M4A
- FLAC
- OGG

If you encounter format issues, consider converting your audio file to MP3 or WAV first using tools like `ffmpeg`.

## Working with Output

### View the Transcription

```bash
# View the entire transcription
cat output.srt

# View just the text (remove timestamps)
grep -v "^[0-9]*$" output.srt | grep -v "^[0-9][0-9]:[0-9][0-9]:[0-9][0-9]"
```

### Convert SRT to Plain Text

If you need plain text without timestamps:

```bash
# Using the helper script (recommended)
python3 srt_to_text.py output.srt > transcript.txt

# Or with awk
awk 'NF && !/^[0-9]+$/ && !/^[0-9]{2}:[0-9]{2}:[0-9]{2}/' output.srt > transcript.txt
```

## Helper Scripts

### srt_to_text.py

This skill includes a Python helper script for converting SRT files to plain text. Located at `skills/parakeet/srt_to_text.py`.

**Usage:**
```bash
# Basic conversion (outputs to stdout)
python3 srt_to_text.py transcript.srt

# Save to file
python3 srt_to_text.py transcript.srt --output transcript.txt

# Preserve paragraph breaks between subtitle blocks
python3 srt_to_text.py transcript.srt --paragraphs

# Pipe to other tools
python3 srt_to_text.py transcript.srt | llm "Summarize this"
```

**Features:**
- Strips subtitle numbers and timestamps
- Joins text into continuous prose (or preserves paragraphs with `--paragraphs`)
- Supports stdin input for piping
- Clean output suitable for LLM processing

**See also:** The **llm** skill includes an `audio-to-article.yaml` template designed to clean up transcripts from this helper into polished articles.

### Use with Other Tools

The SRT format is widely supported and can be:
- Imported into video editing software
- Used with subtitle players
- Converted to other formats (VTT, ASS, etc.)
- Processed with text analysis tools

## Common Workflows

### Transcribe Multiple Files

```bash
# Process all MP3 files in a directory
for file in *.mp3; do
    echo "Processing $file..."
    uvx parakeet-mlx "$file"
done
```

### Transcribe and Extract Text

```bash
# Transcribe and immediately extract plain text
uvx parakeet-mlx audio.mp3
awk 'NF && !/^[0-9]+$/ && !/^[0-9]{2}:[0-9]{2}:[0-9]{2}/' audio.srt > audio.txt
```

### Check Transcription Quality

After transcription, review the SRT file to verify:
- Proper segmentation of speech
- Accurate timestamps
- Text quality and accuracy

## Troubleshooting

### Model Download Issues

If the model download fails or is interrupted:
1. Check your internet connection
2. Ensure you have ~2.5GB of free disk space
3. Try running the command again (it may resume download)

### Performance Issues

If transcription is slow:
- Ensure you're running on Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3)
- Close other resource-intensive applications
- For very long files, consider splitting them into smaller segments

### Audio Format Not Supported

If you get an error about unsupported format:

```bash
# Convert to MP3 using ffmpeg
ffmpeg -i input.m4a -acodec libmp3lame -ab 192k output.mp3
uvx parakeet-mlx output.mp3
```

## Use Cases

Parakeet-MLX is ideal for:
- **Podcast transcription** - Generate searchable text from episodes
- **Interview documentation** - Convert recorded interviews to text
- **Meeting notes** - Transcribe meeting recordings for reference
- **Content creation** - Generate captions or show notes
- **Accessibility** - Create subtitles for audio/video content
- **Research** - Analyze spoken content at scale

## Advantages Over Other Tools

**vs. Whisper:**
- Optimized specifically for Apple MLX framework
- Potentially faster on Apple Silicon
- Similar quality output

**vs. Cloud APIs:**
- No API costs
- Complete privacy (on-device processing)
- No internet required after model download
- No file size limits

**vs. Manual Transcription:**
- Dramatically faster (hours to minutes)
- Consistent quality
- Includes precise timestamps

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Audio Quality Matters**: Clear audio with minimal background noise produces better results
2. **Speaker Clarity**: Single speaker or well-separated multi-speaker audio works best
3. **Review Output**: Always review the transcription for accuracy, especially for technical terms or names
4. **Use Timestamps**: The SRT format's timestamps are valuable for referencing specific moments
5. **Batch Processing**: Process multiple files in sequence for efficiency
