description: Apply secure coding practices when writing, reviewing, or refactoring code in Java Spring/Spring Boot, Django, Flask, FastAPI, Ruby on Rails, React, Vue, Angular, Go, ASP.NET, C, C++, TypeScript, C#, or Terraform. Use this skill whenever the user adds a new endpoint, handles user input, writes a query, sets up authentication/authorization, configures CORS or session cookies, processes file uploads, calls an external URL, renders user-controlled HTML, deserializes data, builds login flows, writes systems/memory-managed code (C/C++), defines infrastructure (Terraform), or asks for a security review of code in any of these languages or frameworks — even when they don't explicitly say "secure" or "security". Also use when reviewing PRs, modifying middleware/filters/interceptors, configuring framework security settings (Spring Security, Django settings, Rails initializers, ASP.NET Identity), tightening tsconfig/compiler flags, writing code that touches secrets, crypto, subprocess execution, raw pointers, or HTTP headers, or defining cloud resources, IAM policies, or security groups in HCL. Use when this capability is needed.

# Secure Coding

A skill for writing and reviewing secure code in popular web frameworks. Each framework has idiomatic safe patterns and signature footguns; generic OWASP advice is not enough — apply framework-specific guidance.

## When to apply

Trigger this skill when working in any of the following languages or frameworks:

| Reference | Language / Framework |
| --- | --- |
| `references/java-spring.md` | Java Spring / Spring Boot |
| `references/python-django.md` | Python Django |
| `references/python-flask.md` | Python Flask |
| `references/python-fastapi.md` | Python FastAPI |
| `references/ruby-on-rails.md` | Ruby on Rails |
| `references/react.md` | React (incl. Next.js) |
| `references/vue.md` | Vue (incl. Nuxt) |
| `references/angular.md` | Angular |
| `references/go.md` | Go (net/http, Gin, Echo, Fiber, Chi) |
| `references/aspnet.md` | ASP.NET (Core, MVC, Web API, Razor, Blazor) |
| `references/c.md` | C (C99–C23, systems / embedded / kernel-adjacent) |
| `references/cpp.md` | C++ (C++17/20/23) |
| `references/typescript.md` | TypeScript (Node/Express/NestJS/Fastify/Deno/Bun + shared frontend) |
| `references/csharp.md` | C# language (non-web contexts — console, services, desktop, libs) |
| `references/terraform.md` | Terraform / OpenTofu (AWS, Azure, GCP IaC) |

## Workflow

1. **Identify the language/framework(s)** in scope. Look at `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `pom.xml`, `build.gradle`, `requirements.txt`, `Pipfile`, `pyproject.toml`, `Gemfile`, `go.mod`, `*.csproj`, `*.sln`, `Makefile`/`CMakeLists.txt`, `*.tf`/`*.tfvars`, or imports and file extensions in the file at hand. If multiple are present (e.g., a React+TypeScript frontend with a Django backend deployed via Terraform), load each relevant reference.
2. **Load only the relevant reference file(s).** Each reference is self-contained and covers the framework's most common security pitfalls plus the idiomatic safe patterns.
3. **Apply guidance to the specific change.** Don't dump the full checklist into a PR — focus on the categories the change actually touches (e.g., a new endpoint that accepts JSON: input validation, authn/authz, output encoding; a new file upload: storage path, content-type, size limits).
4. **When reviewing code**, walk the changed lines through the reference's "review checklist" section and call out concrete issues with file:line references and a suggested fix.
5. **When writing new code**, prefer the "safe pattern" snippets from the reference over inventing your own.

## What each reference covers

Web-framework references (Spring, Django, Flask, FastAPI, Rails, React, Vue, Angular, Go, ASP.NET) are organized around the same categories:

- **Injection** — SQL, NoSQL, command, LDAP, template, header injection
- **AuthN / AuthZ** — login flows, session/cookie config, password storage, role checks, IDOR
- **CSRF** — when it applies, framework defaults, common ways to disable it accidentally
- **XSS / output encoding** — auto-escaping defaults and how to bypass them safely vs. dangerously
- **CORS** — restrictive defaults, common misconfigurations
- **Secrets & config** — where secrets should and shouldn't live, framework-specific config pitfalls
- **Crypto** — what the framework gives you and what to avoid rolling yourself
- **File upload & path traversal** — safe storage, content-type handling, filename sanitization
- **Deserialization** — safe parsers, dangerous formats (Pickle, Marshal, BinaryFormatter, ObjectInputStream, YAML.load)
- **SSRF** — outbound HTTP calls, URL fetchers, webhooks
- **Security headers** — CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, Referrer-Policy, framework-specific helpers
- **Logging & error handling** — what to log, what NOT to log (PII, secrets, tokens), stack-trace exposure
- **Dependencies** — known-bad versions, advisory database links, upgrade paths
- **Framework-specific footguns** — the gotchas that bite even experienced developers

Language references focus on issues that transcend frameworks:

- **C / C++** — memory safety (buffer/heap overflows, UAF, double-free), integer overflow/underflow, format strings, string/path APIs, TOCTOU, command injection via `system`/`exec`, crypto-library usage, compiler hardening (`-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE`, stack protectors, ASAN/UBSAN/fuzzing)
- **TypeScript** — type safety as a compile-time-only guarantee, runtime validation at trust boundaries (Zod/Valibot/class-validator), strict `tsconfig.json`, `any`-vs-`unknown`, Node-specific topics (Express/NestJS/Fastify middleware, prototype pollution, `eval`/`vm`/`Function(str)`, supply chain)
- **C# (non-web)** — `Process.Start` argv handling, cryptography API usage (RNG, hashing, AEAD), serialization dangers (`BinaryFormatter`, `Newtonsoft.Json` `TypeNameHandling`), XML entity hardening, secret clearing, `HttpClient` TLS, reflection/`CSharpScript` RCE surfaces, ReDoS
- **Terraform** — secrets in `.tf`/state, public-resource misconfigurations (S3, security groups, firewalls), IAM wildcards and trust-policy `Condition` blocks, encryption-at-rest/in-transit defaults, module/provider pinning, dangerous provisioners, policy-as-code in CI (tfsec, checkov, trivy config)

## How to use the references

- For **focused tasks** (e.g., "review this login controller"), load one reference and search for the relevant section.
- For **broad reviews** (e.g., "audit this Spring Boot service"), load the reference and walk the full checklist at the bottom.
- For **multi-stack apps** (e.g., React + FastAPI), load both — frontend and backend security concerns rarely overlap perfectly (CSRF, CORS, and auth-token storage all live at the seam between them).

## Output style for reviews

When reviewing code, structure findings as:

```
[Severity] <Category> — <file>:<line>
What: <one-sentence description of the issue>
Why it matters: <concrete impact>
Fix: <minimal code change or pattern reference from the framework guide>
```

Severity scale: **Critical** (RCE, auth bypass, mass data exposure) / **High** (privilege escalation, IDOR, stored XSS) / **Medium** (reflected XSS, CSRF on state change, info disclosure) / **Low** (missing defense-in-depth, hardening gaps).

Don't pad the report with passing checks — list what's wrong, what's missing, and what to do about it.

## When the language/framework isn't in the list

If the user is working in a language or framework not covered (e.g., Rust, Kotlin, Phoenix, Laravel, NestJS, Pulumi, CloudFormation), apply the closest analogue and tell the user explicitly that you're extrapolating, so they can verify framework-specific behaviors. Rough analogues:

- **Rust** ≈ C/C++ for unsafe blocks / FFI; otherwise memory-safe by default — focus on `unsafe`, crypto crate usage (RustCrypto / ring), and web-framework specifics (Axum/Actix).
- **Kotlin (JVM)** ≈ `java-spring.md` for Spring Boot / Ktor; same crypto & serialization pitfalls as Java.
- **NestJS** ≈ `typescript.md` for the language layer + `angular.md`-style DI/decorator patterns.
- **Phoenix (Elixir)** ≈ `ruby-on-rails.md` — similar defaults (CSRF protection, parameter binding), different idioms.
- **Laravel (PHP)** ≈ `ruby-on-rails.md` — comparable MVC and convention-over-configuration security defaults.
- **Pulumi / CloudFormation / Bicep** ≈ `terraform.md` — same IaC concerns (secrets, state, public resources, IAM).
