# Validate (Skill)

Mirrors the **validate** command: run the full validation pipeline and summarize.

## Steps

1. **Lint:** `npm run lint` (or `npm run lint:fix` if available). Note errors or warnings.
2. **Typecheck:** `npm run typecheck` (or `npm run build` if no typecheck). Note TypeScript errors.
3. **Tests:** `npm run test`, then `npm run test:render` if available. Note failing tests.
4. **Summarize:** List which steps passed or failed and the first few error messages for any failure. Do not commit if any step fails unless the user explicitly asks to ignore.

If `lint` or `typecheck` scripts are missing, say so and suggest adding them (see [STATUS.md](../../STATUS.md)).
