# EXECUTE IMMEDIATELY

## Step 1: Validate Input

```
If args is empty or only whitespace:
  Ask user: "What backend work would you like me to do?"
  STOP and wait for user response

If args length > 2000 characters:
  Truncate to 2000 characters
  Warn user: "Request was truncated to 2000 characters"
```

## Step 2: Execute Task

**Do not read further. Execute this Task NOW:**

```typescript
Task(
  subagent_type="team-shinchan:bunta",
  model="sonnet",
  prompt=`/team-shinchan:backend has been invoked.
