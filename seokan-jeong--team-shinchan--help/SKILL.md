## Commands

| Command | Description |

## Quick Start

```
/team-shinchan:start Add user authentication
```

Shinnosuke orchestrates 15 agents through 4 stages:

1. **Requirements** — Nene interviews you, Misae checks risks
2. **Planning** — Nene creates phased plan with acceptance criteria
3. **Execution** — Bo/Aichan/Bunta/Masao implement, Action Kamen reviews each phase
4. **Completion** — Documentation, retrospective, final verification

## What Happens Automatically

- **Project Ontology** — knowledge graph auto-built on first session, updated incrementally
- **Workflow Guard** — blocks code edits during planning, enforces stage transitions
- **Security Hook** — blocks secrets, destructive git, sensitive files
- **Budget Guard** — token budget with 80%/100% alerts
- **Agent Narration** — Shinnosuke announces every delegation and result
- **Session Wrap** — auto-summary on session end

## 15 Agents

| Layer | Agents |
|-------|--------|
| Orchestration | Shinnosuke (conductor), Himawari (large projects), Midori (debates) |
| Execution | Bo (code), Kazama (deep work) |
| Specialists | Aichan (frontend), Bunta (backend), Masao (devops) |
| Advisors | Hiroshi (architecture), Nene (planning), Misae (requirements), Action Kamen (review) |
| Utility | Shiro (explorer), Masumi (docs), Ume (vision) |

All agents are invoked automatically by Shinnosuke. You just describe your task.
