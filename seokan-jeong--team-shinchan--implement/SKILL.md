# EXECUTE IMMEDIATELY

## Step 1: Validate Input

```
If args is empty or only whitespace:
  Ask user: "What would you like me to implement?"
  STOP and wait for user response

If args length > 2000 characters:
  Truncate to 2000 characters
  Warn user: "Request was truncated to 2000 characters"
```

## Step 2: Domain Detection & Routing

Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/agents/_shared/domain-router.json` to determine the target agent.

**Detection logic** (apply in order):
1. Extract file extensions from args (e.g., "fix Login.tsx" → `.tsx` → frontend)
2. Check args text against domain keywords in domain-router.json
3. Check for path patterns (e.g., ".github/workflows/" → devops)
4. Check for known filenames (e.g., "Dockerfile" → devops)

**Routing decision:**
- Frontend match → `subagent_type="team-shinchan:aichan"`
- Backend match → `subagent_type="team-shinchan:bunta"`
- DevOps match → `subagent_type="team-shinchan:masao"`
- No match → `subagent_type="team-shinchan:bo"` (fallback)

## Step 3: Execute Task

**Do not read further. Execute this Task NOW:**

```typescript
Task(
  subagent_type="{detected_agent from Step 2}",
  model="sonnet",
  prompt=`/team-shinchan:implement has been invoked.

## Implementation Request

Handle coding tasks including:

| Area | Capabilities |
|------|-------------|
| Feature Implementation | New features, functions, classes |
| Bug Fixes | Debugging, error correction |
| Code Modification | Refactoring, updates, changes |
| Utilities | Helper functions, utilities |
| Tests | Unit tests, integration tests |

## Implementation Requirements

- Read existing code first to understand patterns
- Follow project conventions
- Write clean, maintainable code
- Handle errors gracefully
- Keep functions small and focused
- Add comments only for complex logic

## Post-Implementation Verification

After writing code:
1. Run existing tests if available (detect test framework from package.json/config)
2. If tests fail, fix the issues before reporting completion
3. If no tests exist, verify the code compiles/loads without errors

## Output Format

After implementation:
- Summary of changes made
- Files modified with line references
- Test results (pass/fail/skipped)
- Any follow-up recommendations

User request: ${args || '(Please describe what to implement)'}
`
)
```

**STOP HERE. The above Task handles everything.**
