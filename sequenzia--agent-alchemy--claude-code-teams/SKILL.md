# Claude Code Agent Teams Reference

A shared reference for Claude Code's Agent Teams features. Load this skill when building skills or agents that create teams, spawn teammates, coordinate multi-agent workflows, or integrate with team hooks.

This skill covers team lifecycle, tool parameters, spawning mechanics, and file structure. For deeper topics, load the reference files listed in [Loading Reference Files](#loading-reference-files).

> **Cross-reference**: For Claude Code Tasks (TaskCreate, TaskGet, TaskUpdate, TaskList), see the companion skill: `Read ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/claude-code-tasks/SKILL.md`

## TeamCreate Tool

Creates a new named team and registers the caller as team lead.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `team_name` | string | Yes | Unique team identifier. Used in file paths, environment variables, and member discovery. Use kebab-case (e.g., `analysis-team`). |
| `description` | string | No | Human-readable description of the team's purpose. Shown in team config and used by teammates to understand their team's mission. |
| `agent_type` | string | No | The type of agent running as team lead. Informational; stored in config.json for member discovery. |

**Return behavior**: Returns a confirmation with the team name. The team is immediately ready for member spawning after creation. Teams have a 1:1 correspondence with task lists — creating a team also creates a task list at `~/.claude/tasks/{team-name}/`. A `config.json` file is created at `~/.claude/teams/{team-name}/config.json` with team metadata including lead identity, description, and a `members` array where each member has `name`, `agentId`, and `agentType`.

**Constraints**:
- Team names must be unique across all active teams
- The creating agent becomes team lead automatically
- Only team leads can send shutdown requests to members

---

## TeamDelete Tool

Deletes a team and cleans up its resources. Takes no parameters — the team name is determined from the current session's team context.

**Prerequisites**: All team members must be shut down before deletion. Attempting to delete a team with active members will fail.

**Cleanup behavior**: Removes the team directory (`~/.claude/teams/{team-name}/`) and the task directory (`~/.claude/tasks/{team-name}/`), clears inbox directories, and deregisters the team.

---

## Team Lifecycle

The full lifecycle of an agent team follows seven steps:

```
Create Team --> Create Tasks --> Spawn Teammates --> Assign Tasks --> Work --> Shutdown --> Cleanup
```

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Created: TeamCreate
    Created --> TasksReady: TaskCreate
    TasksReady --> Spawning: Agent tool (team_name, name)
    Spawning --> Assigning: TaskUpdate (owner)
    Spawning --> Spawning: Spawn more members
    Assigning --> Working: Teammates active
    Working --> Assigning: More tasks to assign
    Working --> ShuttingDown: All work complete
    ShuttingDown --> Cleanup: All members stopped
    Cleanup --> [*]: TeamDelete

    class Created,TasksReady,Cleanup transition
    class Spawning,Assigning,Working,ShuttingDown active
```

### Step Details

**1. Create team**: Team lead calls `TeamCreate` with a name. The team config file is written, a task list is created, and the lead is registered.

**2. Create tasks**: Team lead uses `TaskCreate` to add tasks. Tasks auto-use the team's task list at `~/.claude/tasks/{team-name}/`.

**3. Spawn teammates**: Team lead uses the `Agent` tool with `team_name` and `name` parameters to spawn teammates. Each teammate runs as an isolated Claude Code session. Members can be spawned incrementally as work demands change.

**4. Assign tasks**: Team lead uses `TaskUpdate` with `owner` to assign tasks to specific teammates.

**5. Teammates work**: Members complete assigned tasks, communicate via `SendMessage`, and report results. The team lead monitors progress, assigns new work, and handles issues. Members go idle between turns — this is normal, not an error.

**6. Shutdown**: When all work is complete, the team lead sends `shutdown_request` messages to each member. Members acknowledge with `shutdown_response` and terminate. The lead waits for all members to confirm shutdown.

**7. Cleanup**: After all members have stopped, the team lead calls `TeamDelete` to remove the team and task directories.

## Teammate Spawning

Teammates are spawned using the **Agent tool** with the `team_name` parameter. Each teammate runs as a separate Claude Code session.

> **Plugin tool name**: In Claude Code plugin frontmatter (`allowed-tools` in skills, `tools` in agents), the Agent tool is listed as `Task`. Both names refer to the same spawning capability with identical parameters (`prompt`, `team_name`, `name`, `description`, `subagent_type`, `run_in_background`). Use `Task` in frontmatter definitions and `Agent` or `Task` in skill/agent body instructions.

### Spawn Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `prompt` | string | Yes | The task/prompt for the teammate. This is the initial instruction the teammate receives. |
| `team_name` | string | Yes | Associates the spawned agent with this team. Must match an existing team name. |
| `name` | string | Yes | Human-readable name for the teammate (e.g., `"researcher-1"`). Appears in team config and messages. |
| `description` | string | Yes | Short (3-5 word) description of the agent's task. |
| `subagent_type` | string | No | Model tier for the teammate: `"default"` (Opus), `"fast"` (Sonnet). Choose based on task complexity. |
| `run_in_background` | boolean | No | If `true`, the spawning agent does not block waiting for the teammate to finish. Essential for parallel teammate workflows. Default: `false`. |

### Subagent Type Selection

| Type | Model Tier | Best For |
|------|-----------|----------|
| `"default"` | Opus | Complex reasoning, synthesis, architecture decisions, autonomous multi-step work |
| `"fast"` | Sonnet | Parallel exploration, data gathering, straightforward implementation, high-volume tasks |

### Isolation

Each teammate runs in its own Claude Code session with:
- Independent context window (no shared memory with other teammates)
- Own tool permissions and approval state
- Own working directory (same project root)
- Communication only through `SendMessage` (file-based inbox delivery)

### Background Spawning Pattern

For parallel teammates, spawn all with `run_in_background: true`:

```
Task(prompt="Analyze module A", team_name="analysis-team", name="analyzer-1",
     description="Analyze module A", run_in_background=true)
Task(prompt="Analyze module B", team_name="analysis-team", name="analyzer-2",
     description="Analyze module B", run_in_background=true)
Task(prompt="Analyze module C", team_name="analysis-team", name="analyzer-3",
     description="Analyze module C", run_in_background=true)
```

Note: In skill/agent instructions, this tool may be referenced as either `Task` or `Agent`. Both are equivalent.

The team lead continues running and can coordinate via messages while teammates work.

---

## Idle State Semantics

Understanding idle state is critical for correct team coordination.

**Idle is normal, not an error.** When a teammate finishes its current task and has no pending messages, it enters an idle state. This is expected behavior between work assignments.

**Key rules**:
- Idle teammates can still receive and process messages
- Claude Code sends automatic idle notifications to the team lead when a teammate becomes idle
- Do NOT interpret idle as "broken" or "stuck" — it means the teammate is waiting for work
- Do NOT react to idle notifications unless you have new work to assign
- Send new work to idle teammates via `SendMessage` when ready
- Only send `shutdown_request` when the teammate's role is fully complete

**Anti-pattern**: Immediately shutting down teammates when they go idle. This wastes the spawning cost and prevents reuse for follow-up tasks.

---

## Environment Variables

Claude Code automatically sets these environment variables in every teammate session:

| Variable | Description | Example Value |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| `CLAUDE_CODE_TEAM_NAME` | Name of the team this agent belongs to | `analysis-team` |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_AGENT_NAME` | This agent's name within the team | `researcher-1` |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_AGENT_TYPE` | Role of this agent (`lead` or `member`) | `member` |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_TASK_LIST_ID` | The task list ID associated with this team | `abc123` |

These variables allow teammates to:
- Know which team they belong to (for SendMessage routing)
- Identify themselves in messages and logs
- Determine if they are lead or member (for permission checks)
- Access the shared task list for the team

---

## Spawn Backends

Claude Code supports multiple backends for running teammate sessions.

| Backend | Environment | Characteristics |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| **in-process** | Default | Runs within the same process group. Simplest setup. No external dependencies. Suitable for most workflows. |
| **tmux** | Terminal | Each teammate runs in a separate tmux pane. Requires tmux installed. Provides visual monitoring of teammate sessions. Good for debugging and development. |
| **iTerm2** | macOS | Each teammate runs in a separate iTerm2 tab. macOS only. Provides native tab-based visual monitoring. Requires iTerm2 application. |

### Selection Guidance

- **Use in-process** (default) for production workflows, CI/CD, and when you do not need visual monitoring of individual teammate sessions.
- **Use tmux** when debugging multi-agent workflows and you want to watch each teammate's session in real time. Requires `tmux` to be installed.
- **Use iTerm2** on macOS when you prefer native terminal tabs over tmux panes for visual monitoring during development.

The backend is configured at the Claude Code application level, not per-team or per-spawn call.

---

## File Structure

Agent Teams use a file-based coordination system rooted in the user's home directory.

### Directory Layout

```
~/.claude/
├── teams/
│   └── {team-name}/
│       └── config.json          # Team metadata, member roster, lead identity
├── tasks/
│   └── {team-name}/
│       ├── {task-id}.json       # Individual task files for team members
│       └── ...
└── inboxes/
    └── {team-name}/
        ├── {agent-name}/        # Per-agent inbox directory
        │   ├── msg-001.json     # Delivered message files
        │   └── ...
        └── ...
```

### config.json

The team configuration file at `~/.claude/teams/{team-name}/config.json` contains:
- Team name and description
- Team lead identity and agent type
- Member roster with names, types, and status
- Creation timestamp

Other teammates discover team membership by reading this file.

### Inbox Delivery

Messages sent via `SendMessage` are written as JSON files to the recipient's inbox directory. Claude Code monitors these directories and delivers messages automatically — teammates do not poll for messages.

### Task Files

Each teammate's assigned work is tracked as task files under `~/.claude/tasks/{team-name}/`. These follow the standard Claude Code Tasks format (same as non-team tasks). The task directory is removed when `TeamDelete` is called.

---

## SendMessage Overview

`SendMessage` is the communication tool for inter-agent messaging within a team. It supports five message types, each with different routing and semantics.

| Type | Routing | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| `message` | Direct (one recipient) | Send a targeted message to a specific teammate by name |
| `broadcast` | All members | Send to every team member simultaneously. Costs N messages for N members. |
| `shutdown_request` | Direct (one recipient) | Request a teammate to shut down gracefully. Includes a `request_id`. |
| `shutdown_response` | Direct (requester) | Teammate acknowledges shutdown. Includes matching `request_id`. |
| `plan_approval_response` | Direct (requester) | Approve or reject a teammate's proposed plan with optional feedback. |

**Message delivery is automatic** — Claude Code writes message files to recipient inboxes and notifies them. No polling required.

**Key rules**:
- Don't send structured JSON status messages — use `TaskUpdate` instead
- Idle notifications are sent automatically by the system when a teammate's turn ends
- Prefer `message` over `broadcast` in almost all cases

**Peer DM visibility**: Team leads can see direct messages between team members for oversight and coordination purposes.
