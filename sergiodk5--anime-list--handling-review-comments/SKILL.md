# Handling Review Comments

Process for addressing GitHub PR review comments efficiently using GitHub CLI.

## Prerequisites

- GitHub CLI installed and authenticated: `gh auth status`
- Repository cloned locally with push access

## Workflow

1. **Fetch comments** - Get all review comments from the PR
2. **Fix issues** - Implement fixes for each comment
3. **Run checks** - Verify fixes pass tests and linting
4. **Commit and push** - Group related fixes logically
5. **Reply to comments** - Confirm fixes with commit references
6. **Resolve threads** - Mark resolved via GraphQL API

## Fetching Comments

### Get All PR Comments

```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr_number}/comments

# Example
gh api repos/sergiodk5/anime-list/pulls/9/comments
```

### Get Review Threads (with resolution status)

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='{
  repository(owner: "{owner}", name: "{repo}") {
    pullRequest(number: {pr_number}) {
      reviewThreads(first: 20) {
        nodes {
          id
          isResolved
          comments(first: 1) {
            nodes {
              body
              databaseId
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}'
```

## Replying to Comments

```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr_number}/comments/{comment_id}/replies \
  -X POST \
  -f body="Fixed in commit {hash}. {description of fix}"

# Example
gh api repos/sergiodk5/anime-list/pulls/9/comments/123456/replies \
  -X POST \
  -f body="Fixed in commit abc123. Added validation as suggested."
```

## Resolving Threads

### Single Thread

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
mutation {
  resolveReviewThread(input: {threadId: "THREAD_ID_HERE"}) {
    thread { isResolved }
  }
}'
```

### Multiple Threads

```bash
for thread_id in PRRT_abc123 PRRT_def456 PRRT_ghi789; do
  gh api graphql -f query="mutation { resolveReviewThread(input: {threadId: \"$thread_id\"}) { thread { isResolved } } }"
done
```

## Comment Categories

| Type | Action |
|------|--------|
| Bug/Security | Fix immediately, add tests if needed |
| Nitpick | Fix if reasonable, explain if not |
| Enhancement | Acknowledge, create follow-up issue if needed |
| Question | Answer clearly, add code comments if helpful |

## Before Pushing

```bash
npm run format && npm run lint && npm run test:unit
```

## Commit Message Format

Group related fixes in logical commits:

```bash
git commit -m "fix: address security review feedback

- Add input validation for user-provided colors
- Escape HTML in dynamic attributes
- Use separate timeout variables to prevent race conditions"
```

## Response Patterns

**For fixes:**
```
Fixed in commit abc123. Added validation as suggested.
```

**For acknowledged issues:**
```
Acknowledged. This will be addressed in a follow-up PR.
```

**For clarifications:**
```
This is intentional because [reason]. Happy to discuss further.
```

**For questions:**
```
Good question! This works by [explanation]. Added a code comment for clarity.
```

## Verify Resolution

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='{
  repository(owner: "{owner}", name: "{repo}") {
    pullRequest(number: {pr_number}) {
      reviewThreads(first: 20) {
        nodes { isResolved }
      }
    }
  }
}'
```

## Complete Workflow Example

```bash
# 1. Fetch comments
gh api repos/sergiodk5/anime-list/pulls/9/comments

# 2. Fix issues in code (manual step)

# 3. Run checks
npm run format && npm run lint && npm run test:unit

# 4. Commit and push
git add . && git commit -m "fix: address review feedback" && git push

# 5. Reply to each comment
gh api repos/sergiodk5/anime-list/pulls/9/comments/{id}/replies \
  -X POST \
  -f body="Fixed in commit abc123..."

# 6. Resolve threads
gh api graphql -f query='mutation { resolveReviewThread(input: {threadId: "..."}) { thread { isResolved } } }'
```

## Best Practices

1. **Fix Before Responding** - Implement fix before replying to ensure accuracy
2. **Reference Commits** - Include commit hashes so reviewers can verify
3. **Group Related Fixes** - Combine related changes in logical commits
4. **Run All Checks** - Ensure tests/lint pass before pushing
5. **Be Concise** - Keep replies brief but informative
