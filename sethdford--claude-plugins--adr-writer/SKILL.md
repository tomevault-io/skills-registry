# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

Expert assistance for creating and maintaining Architecture Decision Records in Confluence.

## When to Use This Skill

- Documenting architectural decisions
- Recording technology choices
- Explaining design decisions
- Creating technical decision logs
- User mentions: ADR, architecture, technical decision, design choice

## What Are ADRs?

**Architecture Decision Records** document important architectural decisions made during a project:

### Purpose
- **Record context**: Why the decision was needed
- **Document options**: What alternatives were considered
- **Explain choice**: Why this option was selected
- **Note consequences**: What are the trade-offs

### Benefits
- Historical record of decisions
- Onboarding new team members
- Preventing decision revisitation
- Understanding system evolution
- Avoiding repeated mistakes

## ADR Structure

### Standard Template (Michael Nygard format)

```markdown
# [Number]. [Title]

**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Status**: [Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]
**Decision Makers**: [Names or team]
**Technical Story**: [Optional ticket/issue reference]

## Context

What is the issue we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?

## Decision

What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?

## Consequences

What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?

### Positive

- List of positive consequences

### Negative

- List of negative consequences
- Known limitations
- Trade-offs
```

### Example ADR

```markdown
# 001. Use PostgreSQL for Primary Database

**Date**: 2024-01-15
**Status**: Accepted
**Decision Makers**: Engineering Team
**Technical Story**: PROJ-123

## Context

We need to select a database system for our new user management service. The service will:
- Handle up to 1M users initially, growing to 10M
- Require complex queries across multiple tables
- Need ACID compliance for user transactions
- Support full-text search on user profiles
- Integrate with our existing infrastructure

We evaluated several options:
- PostgreSQL
- MySQL
- MongoDB
- DynamoDB

## Decision

We will use PostgreSQL 15 as our primary database.

**Key factors in this decision:**

1. **ACID Compliance**: Strong guarantees for user data integrity
2. **Complex Queries**: Excellent support for JOINs and aggregations
3. **JSON Support**: Native JSONB for flexible schema evolution
4. **Full-Text Search**: Built-in search capabilities with tsvector
5. **Proven at Scale**: Used successfully by similar applications
6. **Team Expertise**: Team has 5+ years PostgreSQL experience
7. **Cost**: Open source with commercial support available

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Data Integrity**: ACID compliance ensures user data consistency
- **Query Flexibility**: Rich SQL support for complex reporting
- **Future-Proof**: JSON support allows schema evolution
- **Performance**: Excellent performance for our workload patterns
- **Ecosystem**: Vast ecosystem of tools and extensions
- **Monitoring**: Mature monitoring and debugging tools
- **Team Velocity**: Team can be productive immediately

### Negative

- **Scaling Complexity**: Horizontal scaling requires additional tooling (Citus)
- **Operational Overhead**: Requires database administration expertise
- **Backup Strategy**: Need to implement robust backup/recovery
- **Cloud Lock-in**: Managed PostgreSQL ties us to cloud provider
- **Migration Cost**: Future migration to different database would be expensive

### Mitigation Strategies

- Use connection pooling (PgBouncer) for connection management
- Implement read replicas for read scaling
- Regular backup testing and disaster recovery drills
- Database versioning with migration tools (Flyway)
- Monitor query performance with pg_stat_statements

### Alternatives Considered

**MySQL**:
- ✅ Similar performance and features
- ❌ Less sophisticated JSON support
- ❌ Team less experienced

**MongoDB**:
- ✅ Excellent horizontal scaling
- ❌ No ACID transactions (at the time)
- ❌ Weak JOIN support for complex queries

**DynamoDB**:
- ✅ Fully managed, auto-scaling
- ❌ Complex query limitations
- ❌ Higher cost at scale
- ❌ AWS lock-in

## Notes

This decision can be revisited if:
- Scale exceeds 50M users
- Query patterns change dramatically
- Team expertise shifts
- Cost becomes prohibitive

## ADR Statuses

### Proposed
- Decision is under discussion
- Not yet implemented
- Open for feedback

### Accepted
- Decision has been approved
- Implementation in progress or complete
- Current recommendation

### Deprecated
- Decision is no longer recommended
- Still in use but should be phased out
- Usually replaced by a newer ADR

### Superseded
- Decision has been replaced
- Reference the new ADR
- Kept for historical context

### Rejected
- Decision was considered but not adopted
- Explains why it was rejected
- Prevents revisiting

## Types of ADRs

```

### Security Decision

```markdown
# 012. Implement OAuth 2.0 for Authentication

## Context
Need secure, industry-standard authentication.

Requirements:
- Third-party login support
- Token-based authentication

Options evaluated:
- Self-managed Kubernetes
- AWS ECS Fargate
- Google Cloud Run
- Heroku

## Decision

```

## ADR Best Practices

### 1. Write When Decision Is Made
- Document as decisions happen
- Don't wait until later
- Capture context while fresh

### 2. Be Specific and Concrete
- Avoid vague language
- Include concrete examples
- Reference metrics and data

### 3. Acknowledge Trade-offs
- Every decision has trade-offs
- Be honest about limitations
- Don't oversell the solution

### 4. Link Related ADRs
- Reference superseded ADRs
- Note related decisions
- Show decision evolution

### 5. Keep It Concise
- Focus on key points
- Link to detailed analysis
- 1-2 pages maximum

### 6. Use Consistent Format
- Same structure for all ADRs
- Predictable organization
- Easy to scan

### 7. Number Sequentially
- 001, 002, 003, etc.
- Never reuse numbers
- Gaps are OK (rejected ADRs)

## ADR Workflow

### 1. Identify Decision Needed
```
Team realizes: "We need to decide on a caching strategy"
```

### 2. Research Options
```
Options:
- Redis
- Memcached
- In-memory (application)
- CDN caching
```

### 3. Draft ADR
```
Create ADR with:
- Context and requirements
- Options evaluated
- Recommendation
- Trade-offs
```

### 4. Review and Discuss
```
Team reviews:
- Technical lead approval
- Security review if needed
- Architecture team input
```

### 5. Accept and Implement
```
- Mark as "Accepted"
- Publish to Confluence
- Implement the decision
- Link from related docs
```

### 6. Maintain Over Time
```
- Update if context changes
- Deprecate if superseded
- Add learnings and updates
```

**DON'T update** when:
- Decision needs to change → Create new ADR
- Context has changed significantly → Create new ADR
- Original reasoning was wrong → Create new ADR with Supersedes

### Update Format

Add updates section at the end:

```markdown
## Updates

### 2024-03-15: Performance Issues Discovered
After 3 months in production, we discovered that [issue]. We've mitigated this by [solution]. Consider ADR-XXX for future improvements.

### 2024-06-20: Cost Higher Than Expected

```

## How I'll Help

When creating ADRs, I will:

1. **Identify the decision**:
   - What needs to be decided?
   - Why is it important?
   - Who should be involved?

2. **Research context**:
   - Read related code
   - Review existing docs
   - Find similar decisions

3. **Structure the ADR**:
   - Use appropriate template
   - Fill in all sections
   - Add relevant details

4. **Evaluate options**:
   - List alternatives
   - Analyze trade-offs
   - Provide recommendations

5. **Create in Confluence**:
   - Format as ADF
   - Add to ADR index
   - Link related documents

6. **Maintain over time**:
   - Add updates
   - Track status changes
   - Deprecate when superseded

## Example Interaction

**You**: "We just decided to use Redis for caching. Can you create an ADR?"

**Me**: "I'll create an ADR for the Redis caching decision.

Let me gather some information:
- What were you using before?
- What other options did you consider?
- What were the key factors in choosing Redis?
- Any concerns or trade-offs?

[You provide context]

I'll create ADR-004: Use Redis for Application Caching

**Draft**:
- Context: Need caching to reduce database load (currently 1000 QPS)
- Evaluated: Redis, Memcached, in-memory caching
- Decision: Redis for persistence, pub/sub, and rich data types
- Consequences: Positive (performance, flexibility), Negative (ops overhead, cost)

Should I create this in Confluence? Which space?"

**You**: "Yes, space 456789"

**Me**: [Creates ADR page]
"Created ADR-004 in space 456789!
Link: https://your-domain.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/456789/pages/...

Also updating the ADR Index to include this new decision."
