# Structured Issue Creation

Expert assistance for creating well-structured, comprehensive Jira issues from any context.

## When to Use This Skill

- User wants to create a Jira issue
- User mentions tracking work, bugs, features, or tasks
- After implementing code that should be tracked
- When discussing a problem that should be documented
- User asks to "open a ticket" or "create an issue"

## Issue Types and When to Use Them

### 🐛 Bug
**When to use**: Something is broken or not working as expected

**Required information**:
- What's broken?

### 🎯 Epic
**When to use**: Large body of work that contains multiple stories

**Required information**:

## Creating Issues from Code Context

When creating an issue based on code I've written or changes I've detected:

1. **Analyze the change**:
   - What was added/modified?
   - What problem does it solve?
   - What testing is needed?

2. **Determine issue type**:
   - Bug fix? → Bug
   - New feature? → Story or Task
   - Refactoring? → Task

3. **Extract details**:
   - Use file names for context
   - Include code snippets in description
   - Link to related files

4. **Generate structured content**:
   - Clear, descriptive title
   - Complete description with context
   - Appropriate labels and priority

## Example: Creating Issue from Code

**Context**: I just helped implement user authentication

**Analysis**:
- New feature added: OAuth integration
- Files modified: auth.js, login.js, config.js
- Tests added: auth.test.js

**Generated Issue**:

**Title**: `Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication for user login`

**Type**: Story

**Description**:
```markdown
## User Story
As a user
I want to login using OAuth providers (Google, GitHub)
So that I don't need to create another password

## Implementation Details
Added OAuth 2.0 authentication with the following changes:

**Modified Files**:
- `src/auth/auth.js` - OAuth client integration
- `src/components/login.js` - OAuth login buttons
- `src/config/config.js` - OAuth app credentials

**Tests**:
- `tests/auth.test.js` - OAuth flow tests

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Google OAuth integration working
- [x] GitHub OAuth integration working
- [x] Error handling for failed OAuth
- [x] Tests added and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Security review completed

## Security Considerations
- OAuth credentials stored in environment variables
- PKCE flow used for enhanced security
- Token refresh logic implemented

## Next Steps
- Update user documentation
- Security team review
- Deploy to staging for testing
```

**Labels**: `backend`, `authentication`, `security`, `needs-review`

**Priority**: High

## Creating Issues from Conversations

When creating an issue from a discussion:

1. **Identify the core request**: What does the user actually want?
2. **Ask clarifying questions** if needed:
   - "Is this a bug or a new feature?"
   - "How urgent is this?"
   - "Who is affected?"
   - "Any specific requirements?"

3. **Structure the information**: Use appropriate template
4. **Confirm with user**: Show them the issue before creating

## Linking Related Work

When creating issues, consider:

### Parent/Child Relationships
- Epic → contains → Stories
- Story → contains → Subtasks

### Issue Links
- **Blocks**: This issue prevents progress on another
- **Is blocked by**: Cannot proceed until another is done
- **Relates to**: General relationship
- **Duplicates**: Same as another issue
- **Causes**: This issue causes another problem

### Example
```
Epic: User Authentication System
├─ Story: Implement OAuth login
│  ├─ Task: Add Google OAuth
│  ├─ Task: Add GitHub OAuth
│  └─ Task: Update login UI
├─ Story: Add password reset flow
└─ Story: Implement 2FA
```

## Quality Checklist

Before creating an issue, verify:

- [ ] **Title is clear**: Someone unfamiliar with context understands
- [ ] **Description is complete**: All necessary information included
- [ ] **Type is correct**: Bug/Story/Task/Epic appropriate
- [ ] **Priority is set**: Based on impact and urgency
- [ ] **Labels added**: For filtering and organization
- [ ] **Assignee considered**: Should someone be assigned now?
- [ ] **Linked issues**: Related work connected
- [ ] **Acceptance criteria**: Clear definition of done

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Vague Titles
"Fix login" → "User login fails with OAuth when email contains + character"

### ❌ Missing Context
"Implement feature" → Include user story, requirements, acceptance criteria

### ❌ No Acceptance Criteria
Add clear, testable conditions for completion

### ❌ Wrong Issue Type
Refactoring as Bug → Should be Task

### ❌ Missing Priority
Always set priority based on impact

### ❌ Kitchen Sink Issues
One issue = one logical unit of work. Split large work into multiple issues.

## Workflow Integration

### After Writing Code
```
Me: "I've implemented the user profile feature. Should I create a Jira issue to track this?"

You: "Yes, create a story"

Me: [Analyzes code] "I'll create a story with:
- Title: 'Implement user profile with avatar upload'
- Description includes implementation details from the code
- Acceptance criteria based on what was built
- Labels: frontend, backend, user-management
- Priority: Medium

Create this issue?"
```

### From Bug Reports
```
You: "Users report that the app crashes when uploading large files"

Me: "I'll create a bug issue:

## Title
App crashes when uploading files > 10MB

## Description
[Structured bug template with all details]

Should I also search for similar issues first to avoid duplicates?"
```

## Advanced Features

### Issue Templates
If your Jira project has custom templates, I can:
- Use project-specific fields
- Follow your team's conventions
- Match your existing issue style

### Bulk Creation
Create multiple related issues at once:
```
You: "Create issues for the payment integration epic"

Me: "I'll create:
1. Epic: Payment Integration
2. Story: Stripe API integration
3. Story: Payment form UI
4. Story: Transaction history
5. Task: Payment testing in sandbox

Proceed with all 5 issues?"
```

## How I'll Help

When you need to create an issue, I will:

1. **Gather context**: Understand what you want to track
2. **Determine type**: Bug, Story, Task, or Epic?
3. **Structure content**: Use appropriate template
4. **Add metadata**: Priority, labels, relationships
5. **Show preview**: Let you review before creating
6. **Create issue**: Use `/jira-create` command
7. **Follow up**: Suggest next actions (assign, link, transition)

## Example Interaction

**You**: "The authentication module I just wrote should be tracked"

**Me**: "I'll create a story for this. Let me analyze what you built...

**Proposed Issue:**

**Title**: Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication system

**Type**: Story

**Priority**: High

**Description**:
[Complete structured description with code context]

**Labels**: backend, authentication, security

Does this look good? Should I create it?"

**You**: "Yes"

**Me**: [Uses `/jira-create`] "Created PROJ-456: Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication system. Would you like me to add it to your current sprint?"
