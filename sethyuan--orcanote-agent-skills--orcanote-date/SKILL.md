# Block Date Extraction Guide

This skill provides instructions on how to determine the temporal context (date) of specific blocks in Orca Note.

## Procedure

1.  **Call Tool**: Use the `get_page` tool to query the page containing the target blocks.
2.  **Extract Date**: If returned page name of a block can be interpreted as a date, use it as the block's date, otherwise it means the block does not have a date.

### Now

```bash
date +%s
```

### Today (00:00 Local Time)
Run the following command:

date -v0H -v0M -v0S +%s
```
