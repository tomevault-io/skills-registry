# Product Manager Skill

## Overview

This skill enables Product Owner workflows focused on **ticket shaping, structure, and best practices**:
- Refine tickets with proper structure and acceptance criteria
- Analyze tickets for gaps, clarity, completeness, and dependencies
- Break down epics into actionable sub-tickets
- Generate meaningful refinement session questions
- Propose amendments based on conversation context

**Ticket Data Operations**: All ticket access and manipulation (get, list, create, update) is delegated to the **ticket-assistant agent**, which handles Linear MCP, Local Markdown, and GitHub Issues operations.

## Architecture

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Create Tickets from Conversation

**Scenario**: "Create a ticket for this feature with acceptance criteria" or "Based on the conversation transcript create epic with tickets/ticket"

**Process**:
1. Extract requirements from conversation context
2. Use ticket template from `assets/ticket_template.md`
3. Structure as simple or complex ticket based on scope
4. Apply appropriate type labels (Feature, Bug, Enhancement, etc.)
5. Present proposal to user for review
6. **Use AskUserQuestion tool for confirmation**: Wait for explicit approval before proceeding
7. **After user confirms**: Delegate to ticket-assistant agent to create ticket
8. Report created ticket with ID and link

**Guidelines**:
- Refer to `references/ticket_structure_guide.md` for formatting standards
- Include acceptance criteria for complex work
- Flag open questions when scope is unclear
- Suggest dependencies if work relates to existing tickets
- **Content focus**: Extract user needs and business value; avoid code snippets
- **Include technical details when**:
  - Explicitly instructed to include them
  - Deviating from standard conventions or patterns
  - Non-standard approach requires documentation
  - Critical technical constraints that impact implementation

### 2. Propose Ticket Amendments

**Scenario**: "Are there any wrong assumptions in the ticket?" or "Based on the conversation transcript suggest adjustments to epic XXX-123"

**Process**:
1. Delegate to ticket-assistant agent to fetch existing ticket/epic
2. Analyze current state (description, acceptance criteria, scope)
3. Cross-reference with provided context (code, conversation, etc.)
4. Use patterns from `references/analysis_patterns.md` to identify:
   - Assumption mismatches
   - Scope gaps or overreach
   - Missing edge cases or error handling
   - Outdated requirements
5. Present proposed changes:
   - "Current state" (quote from ticket)
   - "Suggested changes" (with rationale)
   - "Questions for team" (if needed)
6. **Use AskUserQuestion tool for confirmation**: Wait for explicit approval before proceeding
7. **After user confirms**: Delegate to ticket-assistant agent to update ticket
8. Report changes applied

**Guidelines**:
- Be specific: quote the problematic text
- Explain the "why" behind each suggested change
- Distinguish between critical (must fix) and nice-to-have improvements
- Use AskUserQuestion tool if context is ambiguous or requires clarification

### 3. Analyze Tickets for Quality

**Scenario**: "Review existing Linear tickets for completeness, clarity, dependencies, open questions" for range AIA-100 through AIA-110

**Process**:
1. Delegate to ticket-assistant agent to fetch tickets in range
2. For each ticket, evaluate against criteria:
   - **Clarity**: Title, description, acceptance criteria
   - **Completeness**: All required fields, edge cases covered
   - **Dependencies**: Blocks/Blocked-by relationships identified
   - **Open questions**: Uncertainties flagged
3. Use `references/analysis_patterns.md` Pattern 4 for systematic evaluation
4. Compile findings:
   - Strong tickets (ready for development)
   - Needs work (specific improvements recommended)
   - Needs breakdown (too large)
   - Blocked (waiting on decisions)
5. Present report with:
   - Summary per ticket
   - Recommended actions
   - Highest-priority refinements needed

**Guidelines**:
- Use consistent evaluation structure
- Highlight both strengths and issues
- Provide specific, actionable recommendations
- Flag patterns across multiple tickets (e.g., all missing error handling)

### 4. Identify Gaps in Epic Coverage

**Scenario**: "Identify gaps in the planned tickets for epic XXX-123"

**Process**:
1. Delegate to ticket-assistant agent to fetch epic and sub-tickets
2. Analyze epic scope vs. ticket coverage using `references/analysis_patterns.md` Pattern 1:
   - Frontend/UI components
   - Backend services and APIs
   - Testing and QA work
   - Documentation and knowledge base
   - Deployment or infrastructure
   - Edge cases and error scenarios
3. Present findings:
   - Identified gaps with context
   - Suggested new tickets for each gap
   - Estimated scope per gap
4. **Use AskUserQuestion tool for confirmation**: Present options to create all tickets, select specific ones, or review proposals first
5. **After user confirms**: Delegate to ticket-assistant agent to create tickets

**Guidelines**:
- Be thorough but realistic (not everything needs a separate ticket)
- Group related gaps (e.g., multiple API endpoints in one ticket)
- Consider team's estimation approach when scoping gaps
- Link new tickets to epic as subtickets

### 5. Analyze Dependencies and Suggest Parallelization

**Scenario**: User asks about dependencies between tickets or how to parallelize work

**Process**:
1. Delegate to ticket-assistant agent to fetch relevant tickets
2. Use `references/analysis_patterns.md` Pattern 3:
   - Extract explicit Blocks/Blocked-by relationships
   - Identify implicit dependencies
   - Find critical path (work that must complete first)
   - Group by parallelizable tracks
3. Present parallelization strategy:
   - Work that can happen simultaneously
   - Critical path dependencies
   - Recommended team allocation
4. Suggest implementation sequence

**Guidelines**:
- Consider frontend/backend can often run in parallel if API contract is clear
- Testing can often run alongside implementation if setup is clear
- Documentation can start early with skeleton/outline
- Infrastructure work often critical path

### 6. Generate Refinement Session Questions

**Scenario**: "Generate questions for the next refinement session for tickets XXX-100 through XXX-110"

**Process**:
1. Delegate to ticket-assistant agent to fetch ticket range
2. Analyze each ticket for uncertainty patterns:
   - Missing acceptance criteria
   - Ambiguous requirements
   - Unknown trade-offs
   - Implicit assumptions
   - Unclear edge cases
3. Use `references/refinement_session_guide.md` and `references/analysis_patterns.md` Pattern 5
4. Generate questions organized by:
   - **Critical blockers**: Must resolve first
   - **Design/Technical questions**: Needed before building
   - **Edge cases**: Clarify completeness
   - **Dependencies**: Identify coordination needs
   - **Success metrics**: Define what "done" means
5. Present as structured question set with:
   - Target audience (Product, Engineering, Design)
   - Why the question matters
   - Suggested answers or options

**Guidelines**:
- Prioritize high-impact questions first
- Frame as open-ended (not leading)
- Group related questions by theme
- Note interdependencies between questions
- Suggest time-boxing for discussion

## Reference Materials

### Ticket Structure and Templates
- **`references/ticket_structure_guide.md`** - Title guidelines, label categories, description formats, acceptance criteria best practices, refinement checklist, red flags
- **`assets/ticket_template.md`** - Ready-to-use templates for simple/complex/bug/epic tickets

### Analysis Patterns
- **`references/analysis_patterns.md`** - 6 structured reasoning patterns:
  1. Identifying gaps in epic coverage
  2. Detecting assumption mismatches
  3. Dependency analysis and parallelization
  4. Clarity and completeness review
  5. Generating refinement session questions
  6. Epic analysis and adjustment suggestions

### Refinement Sessions
- **`references/refinement_session_guide.md`** - Question generation strategies, facilitation tips, sample agendas, post-refinement checklist

### When to Use Each Analysis Pattern

| Pattern | Trigger Question | Reference |
|---------|------------------|-----------|
| Gap Identification | "Identify gaps in epic XXX" | `analysis_patterns.md` Pattern 1 |
| Assumption Mismatch | "Are there wrong assumptions?" | `analysis_patterns.md` Pattern 2 |
| Dependency Analysis | "What are dependencies?" | `analysis_patterns.md` Pattern 3 |
| Quality Review | "Review tickets for completeness" | `analysis_patterns.md` Pattern 4 |
| Refinement Questions | "Generate questions for session" | `analysis_patterns.md` Pattern 5, `refinement_session_guide.md` |
| Epic Adjustment | "Suggest adjustments to epic" | `analysis_patterns.md` Pattern 6 |

## Workflow: Create and Propose

All creation and amendment operations follow this pattern:

### Step 1: Gather Context
- User provides requirements (conversation, transcript, existing ticket)
- If ticket data is needed, delegate to ticket-assistant agent

### Step 2: Analyze and Draft
- Use appropriate patterns from `references/analysis_patterns.md`
- Follow structure from `references/ticket_structure_guide.md` or templates
- Draft ticket/amendment with complete context

### Step 3: Present for Review
- Show "current state" and "proposed state" for amendments
- Show "proposed ticket" for new tickets
- Include rationale for each decision
- Use AskUserQuestion tool if clarification is needed

### Step 4: Wait for Confirmation
- **Use AskUserQuestion tool** to get explicit user confirmation before proceeding
- **Do not proceed** until user confirms via the tool response
- Offer to adjust draft if user suggests changes
- Re-present adjusted version and confirm again using AskUserQuestion

### Step 5: Apply Changes
- Delegate to ticket-assistant agent to create/update tickets
- Agent handles all PM system-specific operations

### Step 6: Report Results
- Confirm what was created/updated
- Provide ticket ID and Link (if available)
- Ask: "What would you like to do next?"

## Best Practices

### Ticket Quality
- Read `references/ticket_structure_guide.md` for quality standards
- Ensure titles are specific and action-oriented
- Include acceptance criteria for complex work
- Flag open questions when scope is unclear
- Link dependencies explicitly

### Analysis Completeness
- Quote specific text when identifying issues
- Explain the "why" behind recommendations
- Distinguish between facts (what's written) and inferences
- Flag assumptions clearly
- Suggest options with trade-offs when multiple paths exist

### User Confirmation Protocol
- Always show proposals before applying
- **Use AskUserQuestion tool** to get explicit user confirmation with clear options
- Wait for confirmation response from the tool before proceeding
- Never assume approval
- Offer revision if user suggests changes
- Re-present for approval after revisions (using AskUserQuestion again)

### Delegating to Agent
- Use ticket-assistant agent for all data operations (get, list, create, update, search)
- Agent handles PM system detection and operations
- Focus skill logic on analysis, shaping, and best practices

## Using AskUserQuestion for User Input

When user input is required during workflow execution, use the **AskUserQuestion** tool to present structured options. This ensures clear, actionable choices and reduces ambiguity.

### When to Use AskUserQuestion

Use the tool for:
1. **Clarifying questions during analysis** - When requirements, scope, or context needs clarification
2. **Confirmation before actions** - Before creating or updating tickets in the PM system

Do NOT use for:
- Open-ended conversational follow-ups ("What would you like to do next?")
- Refinement session questions (those are for human facilitators)

### Example 1: Clarifying Requirements During Analysis

**Scenario**: Analyzing a ticket but scope is ambiguous between two interpretations.

```
Use AskUserQuestion tool with:
{
  "questions": [{
    "question": "The ticket mentions 'email notifications' but doesn't specify the scope. What should be included?",
    "header": "Scope",
    "multiSelect": true,
    "options": [
      {
        "label": "Digest emails",
        "description": "Scheduled summary emails sent daily/weekly"
      },
      {
        "label": "Real-time notifications",
        "description": "Immediate emails when events occur"
      },
      {
        "label": "Transactional emails",
        "description": "System-triggered emails (password reset, confirmations)"
      }
    ]
  }]
}
```

### Example 2: Confirming Before Creating Tickets

**Scenario**: Identified 3 gaps in epic coverage, ready to create tickets.

```
Use AskUserQuestion tool with:
{
  "questions": [{
    "question": "I've identified 3 missing tickets for the email digest epic. Should I create them?",
    "header": "Create Tickets",
    "multiSelect": false,
    "options": [
      {
        "label": "Create all 3 tickets",
        "description": "Create tickets for: UI preferences component, end-to-end testing, and scheduled job setup"
      },
      {
        "label": "Show me the proposals first",
        "description": "Present detailed ticket proposals for review before creating"
      },
      {
        "label": "Create only high-priority ones",
        "description": "Create tickets for UI component and testing, defer infrastructure work"
      }
    ]
  }]
}
```

### Guidelines for Effective Questions

**Structure**:
- Use clear, specific question text
- Provide 2-4 options (not just yes/no when possible)
- Include descriptions explaining what each option means
- Use `multiSelect: true` only when choices are not mutually exclusive

**Headers**:
- Keep short (max 12 chars): "Scope", "Approach", "Confirm", "Priority"
- Describes the decision type

**Options**:
- Label: Concise choice (1-5 words)
- Description: Explain implications or what happens if chosen
