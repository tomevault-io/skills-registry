# Kith API Bridge

This skill ensures that the "Ripple Effect" of a data model change is handled correctly across all layers of the Kith application.

## The Ripple Effect Workflow

When a data model change is requested:

1.  **Verify SQL**: Ensure a migration exists in `server/migrations/`.
2.  **Update Types**: Modify the relevant TypeScript interfaces in `types/` (e.g., `family.ts`, `activity.ts`). Use camelCase for TypeScript fields.
3.  **Audit Services**: Update `FamilyService.ts` and `ActivityService.ts` to fetch/send the new fields.
4.  **Sync Schema**: Trigger the `kith-schema-maintainer` to update `server/SCHEMA.md`.
5.  **Controller Check**: If the change affects the backend, update the controllers in `server/controllers/` to handle the new database columns.

## Guidelines
- **Naming**: Always convert database `snake_case` to frontend `camelCase`.
- **Consistency**: Refer to [type-mapping.md](references/type-mapping.md) for standard SQL-to-TS mappings.
- **Null Safety**: Always check if new fields should be optional (`?`) in TypeScript.
