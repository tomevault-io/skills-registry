## Step 2: Folder Creation

Create the project in `~/YT/Ideas/` (NOT root ~/YT/):

```bash
# Replace [VIDEO_TITLE] with sanitized video title (spaces to hyphens, no special chars)
mkdir -p ~/YT/Ideas/[VIDEO_TITLE]/{01_Script,02_Raw_Footage/{Screen_Recordings,Face_Cam},03_Audio/{Original,Processed},04_Assets/{B-Roll,Graphics,Music_SFX,Competitor_Thumbnails},05_Project_Files,06_Exports/{Long_Form,Shorts},07_Thumbnails}
```

Enhanced folder structure:
```
~/YT/Ideas/[Video Title]/
├── 01_Script/
│   ├── script.md              # Final script (generated later)
│   ├── outline.md             # Generated outline with structure

## Step 3: Competitor Research via Playwright MCP

If user selected "Full research" or "Find top competitors", use Playwright MCP:

### 3a. Search YouTube for Competitors

```
1. Navigate to YouTube
2. Search for: [topic] + relevant keywords
3. Filter by: View count (high), Upload date (recent - last 6 months)
4. Extract top 5-10 videos with:
   - Title
   - View count
   - Channel name
   - Subscriber count
   - Upload date
   - Thumbnail (screenshot)
   - Video URL
```

### 3b. Fetch Competitor Details

For each top competitor video:

```
1. Navigate to video page
2. Click "Show transcript" button
3. Extract:
   - Full transcript (for CTA extraction)
   - First 60 seconds (hook analysis)
   - Last 60 seconds (outro/CTA analysis)
   - Description (for keywords, links)
4. Take thumbnail screenshot → save to Competitor_Thumbnails/
```

### 3c. Extract CTAs from Transcripts

Parse transcripts to find CTA patterns:
- Subscribe mentions ("subscribe", "hit subscribe", "join the channel")
- Like mentions ("like this video", "thumbs up", "smash that like")
- Comment prompts ("let me know in the comments", "tell me below")
- Link mentions ("link in description", "check out", "use code")
- End screen mentions ("watch this next", "check out this video")

Save examples to `cta-ideas.md`:
```markdown
# CTA Ideas for [Video Title]

(Claude generates 3-5 custom options based on video topic)

1. Subscribe: "..."

```

### 3d. Analyze Competitor Thumbnails

4. When ready, say "help me write the script" and I'll create script.md

**Quick vidIQ AI Review:**
Before writing the full script, consider pasting your outline + chosen title to vidIQ AI for feedback.

Would you like me to:
1. Start writing the full script based on the outline?
2. Adjust the outline first?
3. Show you the competitor analysis details?
4. Create a presentation using /video-presentation?
```

## Moving Between Stages

When project progresses:

|-----------|--------|
| "Move to In Progress" | `mv ~/YT/Ideas/[name] ~/YT/In\ Progress/[name]` + update todo.md |
| "I'm recording" | Update todo.md, show recording checklist |
| "I finished [task]" | Update todo.md, show next steps |
| "Video is published" | `mv ~/YT/In\ Progress/[name] ~/YT/Uploaded/[name]` + update todo.md |

## Integration with Other Skills

### After Script is Written
Suggest: "Would you like me to create a presentation using `/video-presentation`?"

### For Finance Content
If category is Finance/Investing, suggest: "For finance topics, consider using `/finance-commentary` for fact-checking against official sources."

### For Quick Shorts
Suggest: "Want to create a quick Shorts presentation on this topic? Use `/shorts-presentation`."

## Error Handling

### If Playwright MCP Fails
Fallback to manual workflow:
"I couldn't automatically fetch the data. Here's what to do manually:

1. Go to https://vidiq.com → Keywords Tool
2. Search for: [keywords]
3. Paste back the scores

For competitor research:
1. Search YouTube for: [topic]
2. Note the top 5 videos with high views
3. Share the URLs and I'll help analyze"

### If vidIQ Requires Login
"vidIQ requires login. Please:

2. Tell me when ready
3. I'll retry fetching the data"
