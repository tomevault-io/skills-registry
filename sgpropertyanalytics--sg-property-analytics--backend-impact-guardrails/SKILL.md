## THE 4 QUESTIONS (Ask Before Every Backend Change)

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  1. Does this break the API CONTRACT?                       │
│     → Response shape, field names, required params          │
│                                                             │
│  2. Does this break FRONTEND RENDERING?                     │
│     → Will pages load? Will components mount?               │
│                                                             │
│  3. Does this break VISUAL CHARTS?                          │
│     → Will charts display? Data present? No empty states?   │
│                                                             │
│  4. Does this break CHART LOGIC/CALCULATIONS?               │
│     → Adapters, transformations, aggregations, metrics      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

If YES to ANY → STOP. Fix before proceeding.
```

### Quick Validation for Each Question

| Question | How to Validate |
|----------|-----------------|
| 1. API Contract | Compare old vs new response shape. Check `@api_contract` decorator. |
| 2. Frontend Rendering | Load all 7 pages. Check console for errors. |
| 3. Visual Charts | Verify charts render with data, no "No data" states unexpectedly. |
| 4. Chart Logic | Check adapters in `frontend/src/adapters/`. Verify calculations match. |

---

## Purpose

Prevent backend changes from silently breaking frontend visualizations. This skill enforces systematic impact analysis before any backend modification.

---

## When This Activates (MANDATORY)

This skill is **MANDATORY** for:

- Modifying or removing data files (CSV, JSON in `backend/data/`)
- Changing SQL queries in services (`backend/services/*_service.py`)
- Modifying API endpoints (`backend/routes/*.py`)
- Changing database schema or models
- Modifying constants that affect data classification
- Refactoring data transformation logic
- Changing API response shapes or field names

---

## Part 1: Pre-Change Dependency Check

### MANDATORY: Identify Affected Endpoints

Before any backend change, run this checklist:

| Change Type | Files to Audit | Impact Scope |
|------------|---------------|--------------|
| Data file removal | `BACKEND_CHART_DEPENDENCIES.md` | All charts using related endpoints |
| Service function change | Grep for function imports in routes | Routes calling the function |
| Route handler change | Frontend grep for endpoint URL | All charts calling that endpoint |
| SQL query change | Services using that query | Endpoints using those services |
| Model/schema change | All services querying that model | Cascading to all dependent routes |

### Step 1: Data Source Impact Analysis

```bash
# Find all files that import or reference the data source
grep -rn "your_data_source" backend/

# Find all services that use the affected model/table
grep -rn "Transaction\|from transactions" backend/services/

# Check which routes use the affected service
grep -rn "from services.affected_service" backend/routes/
```

### Step 2: Endpoint Dependency Mapping

For each affected endpoint, consult `docs/BACKEND_CHART_DEPENDENCIES.md` to find:
1. Which frontend charts consume this endpoint
2. Which pages contain those charts
3. Which filters/parameters affect the data

### Step 3: Validate Contract Compatibility

For endpoints with `@api_contract` decorator:
1. Check if response schema will change
2. Verify field names remain consistent (v1/v2)
3. Confirm metric calculations stay the same

---

## Part 2: Impact Categories

### Category A: BREAKING (Blocks Merge)

**STOP. Do not proceed without migration plan.**

- Removing data that charts depend on
- Changing API response field names
- Removing endpoints without migration
- Changing metric calculation logic
- Removing columns used in GROUP BY or WHERE clauses

### Category B: REQUIRES VALIDATION (Manual Check)

**Proceed with caution. Manual verification required.**

- Adding new filters that change result sets
- Modifying date boundary logic
- Changing aggregation methods
- Altering outlier exclusion rules
- Adding new required parameters

### Category C: SAFE (Proceed with Caution)

**Low risk but still document.**

- Adding new endpoints (additive)
- Adding new optional response fields
- Performance optimizations (same output)
- Adding new data sources (additive)
- Adding new optional parameters

---

## Part 3: Validation Workflow

### Before Making Changes

1. **Identify the change scope**
   ```
   [ ] Data file (removal/modification)
   [ ] Service function (logic change)
   [ ] Route handler (API change)
   [ ] Model/schema (structure change)
   [ ] Constants (classification change)
   ```

2. **Map downstream dependencies**
   - Consult `docs/BACKEND_CHART_DEPENDENCIES.md`
   - Run dependency grep commands
   - List all affected charts by page

3. **Assess impact category**
   - Determine if BREAKING, VALIDATION, or SAFE
   - Document reasoning

4. **If BREAKING: STOP and propose migration plan**

### After Making Changes

1. **Run regression tests**
   ```bash
   cd backend && pytest tests/test_regression_snapshots.py -v
   ```

2. **Run dependency sync tests**
   ```bash
   cd backend && pytest tests/test_chart_dependencies.py -v
   ```

3. **Run API contract tests**
   ```bash
   cd backend && pytest tests/test_api_invariants.py -v
   ```

4. **Manually verify ALL affected pages**
   - `/market-overview`
   - `/district-overview`
   - `/new-launch-market`
   - `/supply-inventory`
   - `/explore`
   - `/value-check`
   - `/exit-risk`

---

## Part 4: Required Output Format

For EVERY backend change affecting data flow:

```markdown
### Backend Impact Assessment

**Change:** [Description of the change]
**Category:** [BREAKING | VALIDATION | SAFE]
**Affected Files:** [List of modified files]

#### Dependency Chain
```
Data Source: [name]
    ↓
Service(s): [list]
    ↓
Route(s): [list]
    ↓
Endpoint(s): [list]
    ↓
Chart(s): [list]
    ↓
Page(s): [list]
```

#### Affected Endpoints
| Endpoint | Contract Version | Status |
|----------|-----------------|--------|
| `/api/aggregate` | v2 | [Unchanged/Modified/Removed] |

#### Affected Charts
| Page | Chart | Endpoint | Impact | Verified |
|------|-------|----------|--------|----------|
| MacroOverview | TimeTrendChart | /api/aggregate | [Impact] | [ ] |
| DistrictOverview | GrowthDumbbellChart | /api/aggregate | [Impact] | [ ] |

#### Verification Checklist
- [ ] Regression tests pass
- [ ] Dependency sync tests pass
- [ ] API contract tests pass
- [ ] All affected pages manually verified:
  - [ ] /market-overview
  - [ ] /district-overview
  - [ ] /new-launch-market
  - [ ] /supply-inventory
- [ ] No console errors on affected pages
- [ ] BACKEND_CHART_DEPENDENCIES.md updated (if applicable)
```

---

## Part 5: Quick Reference - Dependency Chains

### Chain 1: Transaction Data (Most Critical)

```
transactions table (PostgreSQL)
    ↓
dashboard_service.py (aggregations)
    ↓
├── /api/aggregate → TimeTrendChart, GrowthDumbbellChart, etc.
├── /api/kpi-summary-v2 → KPI Cards (MacroOverview)
├── /insights/district-psf → MarketStrategyMap (DistrictOverview)
└── /insights/district-liquidity → DistrictLiquidityMap (DistrictOverview)
```

**Removing transaction data = BREAKING for ALL analytics**

### Chain 2: Supply/Launch Data

```
upcoming_launches.csv / new_launch_units.csv
    ↓
supply_service.py
    ↓
/api/supply-metrics → SupplyWaterfallChart (SupplyInsights)
```

### Chain 3: Project Metadata

```
projects table
    ↓
project_service.py
    ↓
/api/projects/* → ProjectDetailPanel, FloorLiquidityHeatmap
```

---

## Part 6: Common Patterns - Quick Audit Commands

```bash
# Find all frontend files using a specific endpoint
grep -rn "'/api/aggregate'" frontend/src/ | head -20

# Find all charts using a specific adapter
grep -rn "transform.*Series" frontend/src/components/

# Find all pages importing a specific chart
grep -rn "import.*GrowthDumbbell" frontend/src/pages/

# List all routes in backend
grep -rn "@.*_bp.route" backend/routes/ | grep -v "__pycache__"

# Find service functions used by a route
grep -rn "from services" backend/routes/analytics.py

# Check what consumes a specific service function
grep -rn "get_aggregated_data" backend/routes/
```

---

## Part 7: The Resale Data Rule (Incident Prevention)

**The incident that created this guardrail:**

A commit removed resale CSV data without checking impact. Result:
- KPI card measuring annualized resale velocity broke
- DistrictOverview charts broke silently
- No validation was run before merge

**The dependency chain that was ignored:**

```
Resale CSV data (REMOVED)
    ↓
transactions table (sale_type = 'Resale')
    ↓
dashboard_service.py aggregations
    ↓
/api/aggregate, /api/kpi-summary-v2
    ↓
TimeTrendChart, KPI Cards, etc.
    ↓
MacroOverview page = BROKEN
```

**The rule now:**

Before removing ANY data:
1. Check `BACKEND_CHART_DEPENDENCIES.md`
2. List every chart that will break
3. If ANY chart breaks → STOP
4. Create migration plan FIRST
5. Get explicit approval

## Mental Model

```
Before ANY backend change:

1. WHAT am I touching? (data/service/route/model)
2. WHO depends on it? (check registry)
3. WILL anything break? (trace dependency chain)
4. HOW do I verify? (run tests + manual check)
5. DID I document it? (impact assessment)

If unsure at ANY step → STOP and ask.
```
