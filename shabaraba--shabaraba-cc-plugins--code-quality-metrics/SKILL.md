# Code Quality Metrics Guide

## Overview

Code quality metrics provide quantitative measures of code characteristics. This skill covers complexity metrics, maintainability indices, and their practical thresholds across different languages.

## Complexity Metrics

### Cyclomatic Complexity (CC)

Measures the number of linearly independent paths through code.

**Calculation**: CC = E - N + 2P
- E = edges in control flow graph
- N = nodes in control flow graph
- P = connected components (usually 1)

**Simplified**: Count decision points + 1
- Each `if`, `elif`, `else`, `for`, `while`, `case`, `catch`, `&&`, `||`, `?:` adds 1

**Thresholds**:
| Range | Risk | Action |
|-------|------|--------|
| 1-10 | Low | Simple, well-structured |
| 11-20 | Moderate | More complex, consider refactoring |
| 21-50 | High | Complex, difficult to test |
| >50 | Very High | Untestable, must refactor |

### Cognitive Complexity

Measures how difficult code is to understand (introduced by SonarQube).

**Key differences from CC**:
- Penalizes nested structures more heavily
- Doesn't count all decision points equally
- Focuses on human comprehension

**Calculation rules**:
1. +1 for each break in linear flow (`if`, `for`, `while`, `switch`, `catch`, `?:`)
2. +1 for each nesting level inside these structures
3. +1 for binary logical operators (`&&`, `||`)
4. Recursion adds +1

**Thresholds**:
| Range | Assessment |
|-------|------------|
| 0-7 | Easy to understand |
| 8-15 | Moderate complexity |
| 16-24 | High complexity, refactor |
| 25+ | Very high, immediate refactoring |

**Example**:
```python
def process(items):           # 0
    for item in items:        # +1 (loop)
        if item.active:       # +1 (if) +1 (nesting=1)
            if item.valid:    # +1 (if) +2 (nesting=2)
                handle(item)
    return items              # Total: 6
```

### Halstead Metrics

Based on counting operators and operands:

| Metric | Formula | Meaning |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Vocabulary | n = n1 + n2 | Unique operators + operands |
| Length | N = N1 + N2 | Total operators + operands |
| Volume | V = N × log2(n) | Size of implementation |
| Difficulty | D = (n1/2) × (N2/n2) | Error-proneness |
| Effort | E = D × V | Mental effort to understand |

## Maintainability Metrics

### Maintainability Index (MI)

Composite metric combining complexity, size, and comments.

**Formula**: MI = 171 - 5.2 × ln(V) - 0.23 × CC - 16.2 × ln(LOC)

**Thresholds**:
| Range | Maintainability |
|-------|-----------------|
| 85-100 | High maintainability |
| 65-84 | Moderate maintainability |
| 0-64 | Low maintainability |

### Lines of Code (LOC)

| Metric | Description | Threshold |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Physical LOC | All lines including blanks/comments | Method: <100, Class: <500 |
| Logical LOC | Executable statements | Method: <30, Class: <200 |
| Comment Ratio | Comments / Total | 10-30% typical |

## Coupling Metrics

### Afferent Coupling (Ca)
Number of classes that depend on this class.
- High Ca = Many dependents, changes are risky

### Efferent Coupling (Ce)
Number of classes this class depends on.
- High Ce = Many dependencies, class is fragile

### Instability (I)
I = Ce / (Ca + Ce)
- 0 = Stable (many dependents, few dependencies)
- 1 = Unstable (few dependents, many dependencies)

## Cohesion Metrics

### Lack of Cohesion of Methods (LCOM)

Measures how related methods are within a class.

**LCOM1**: Number of method pairs without shared instance variables
- 0 = Perfect cohesion
- High = Low cohesion, consider splitting

**LCOM4**: Number of connected components in method-field graph
- 1 = Cohesive class
- >1 = Multiple responsibilities

## Quick Reference Table

| Metric | Tool | Good | Warning | Critical |
|--------|------|------|---------|----------|
| Cyclomatic | ESLint, SonarQube | ≤10 | 11-20 | >20 |
| Cognitive | SonarQube | ≤15 | 16-24 | >24 |
| Method LOC | - | ≤30 | 31-50 | >50 |
| Class LOC | - | ≤300 | 301-500 | >500 |
| Parameters | ESLint | ≤3 | 4-5 | >5 |
| Nesting Depth | ESLint | ≤3 | 4 | >4 |
| LCOM4 | - | 1 | 2 | >2 |

## Measurement Commands

### ESLint Complexity
```bash
npx eslint --rule 'complexity: ["error", 10]' src/
```

### SonarQube Analysis
```bash
sonar-scanner -Dsonar.projectKey=myproject
```

### Python Radon
```bash
radon cc src/ -a -s  # Cyclomatic complexity
radon mi src/ -s     # Maintainability index
```
