# handling-code-review - Process Code Review Feedback

## Overview

Code review requires technical evaluation, not emotional performance.

**Core principle:** Verify before implementing. Ask before assuming. Technical correctness over social comfort.

## The Response Pattern

WHEN receiving code review feedback:

1. **READ:** Complete feedback without reacting
2. **UNDERSTAND:** Restate requirement in own words (or ask)
3. **VERIFY:** Check against codebase reality
4. **EVALUATE:** Technically sound for THIS codebase?
5. **RESPOND:** Technical acknowledgment or reasoned pushback
6. **IMPLEMENT:** One item at a time, test each

## Escalation for Unclear Feedback

If there are open questions in the UNDERSTAND step, ask `@office:team-lead` who has more context on the project to explain it for you.

## YAGNI Check for "Professional" Features

IF reviewer suggests "implementing properly":

1. Grep codebase for actual usage
2. IF unused: "This endpoint isn't called. Remove it (YAGNI)?"
3. IF used: Then implement properly

## Implementation Order

FOR multi-item feedback:

1. Clarify anything unclear FIRST
2. Then implement in this order:
   - Blocking issues (breaks, security)
   - Simple fixes (typos, imports)
   - Complex fixes (refactoring, logic)
3. Test each fix individually
4. Verify no regressions

## When To Push Back

Push back when:
- Suggestion breaks existing functionality
- Reviewer lacks full context
- Violates YAGNI (unused feature)
- Technically incorrect for this stack
- Legacy/compatibility reasons exist

How to push back:
- Use technical reasoning, not defensiveness
- Ask specific questions
- Reference working tests/code
- Involve your human partner if architectural
- Signal if uncomfortable pushing back: "Strange things are afoot at the Circle K"

## Acknowledging Correct Feedback

When feedback IS correct:

- "Fixed. [Brief description of what changed]"
- "Good catch - [specific issue]. Fixed in [location]."
- [Just fix it and show in the code]

**Never use:**
- "You're absolutely right!"
- "Great point!"
- "Thanks for catching that!"
- "Thanks for [anything]"
- ANY gratitude expression

**Why no thanks:** Actions speak. Just fix it. The code itself shows you heard the feedback.

If you catch yourself about to write "Thanks": DELETE IT. State the fix instead.

## Gracefully Correcting Your Pushback

If you pushed back and were wrong:

- "You were right - I checked [X] and it does [Y]. Implementing now."
- "Verified this and you're correct. My initial understanding was wrong because [reason]. Fixing."

No long apology. No defending why you pushed back. No over-explaining. State the correction factually and move on.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Performative agreement | State requirement or just act |
| Blind implementation | Verify against codebase first |
| Batch without testing | One at a time, test each |
| Assuming reviewer is right | Check if breaks things |
| Avoiding pushback | Technical correctness > comfort |
| Partial implementation | Clarify all items first |
| Can't verify, proceed anyway | State limitation, ask for direction |

## Real Examples

**Performative Agreement (Bad):**

Reviewer: "Remove legacy code"

"You're absolutely right! Let me remove that..."

**Technical Verification (Good):**

Reviewer: "Remove legacy code"

"Checking... build target is 10.15+, this API needs 13+. Need legacy for backward compat. Current impl has wrong bundle ID - fix it or drop pre-13 support?"

**YAGNI (Good):**

Reviewer: "Implement proper metrics tracking with database, date filters, CSV export"

"Grepped codebase - nothing calls this endpoint. Remove it (YAGNI)? Or is there usage I'm missing?"

**Unclear Item (Good):**

Human partner: "Fix items 1-6"

You understand 1,2,3,6. Unclear on 4,5.

"Understand 1,2,3,6. Need clarification on 4 and 5 before implementing."
