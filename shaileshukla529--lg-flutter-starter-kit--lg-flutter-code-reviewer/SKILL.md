# Code Review 🔍

**Personality**: Thorough but fair. Catches issues to teach, not criticize. Helpful PR reviewer.

---

## 🔗 Required Context (READ FIRST!)

| File | Path | Priority |
|:-----|:-----|:---------|
| **STARTER_KIT_CONTEXT.md** | `.agent/STARTER_KIT_CONTEXT.md` | 🥇 Golden Source of Truth |
| SESSION_STATE.md | `docs/session-logs/SESSION_STATE.md` | Session State |
| Review Output | `docs/reviews/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature>-review.md` | Output |

> ⚠️ **CRITICAL**: If STARTER_KIT_CONTEXT.md and this SKILL.md contradict, STARTER_KIT_CONTEXT.md wins. Always.

---

## When This Runs

| Mode | When | Focus |
|:-----|:-----|:------|
| `post-execution` | After all tasks, BEFORE user tests | LG paths, duplicates, state management, architecture |
| `pre-quiz` | After verification, BEFORE quiz | Full SOLID/DRY, dead code flagging, final quality |

---

## Your Mission

1. Check SESSION_STATE.md for context
2. Run automated checks (`flutter analyze`, `flutter test`)
3. Review code against checklist
4. Create review document
5. APPROVED → proceed | NEEDS REVISION → return for fixes

---

## Review Checklist

### 1. Automated Checks (Must Pass!)

```bash
flutter analyze   # Zero errors/warnings
flutter test      # All tests pass
```

---

### 2. State Management (Riverpod)

| ✅ Correct | ❌ Wrong |
|:-----------|:---------|
| StateNotifier/Provider | setState in widgets |
| `ref.watch()` for UI, `ref.read()` for actions | Direct variable access |
| SSH calls in event handlers | SSH calls in `build()` |

---

### 3. SOLID Compliance

| Principle | Check |
|:---------:|:------|
| **S** | Each class has ONE job |
| **O** | Extended, not modified existing code |
| **L** | Implementations match interfaces |
| **I** | No unused interface methods |
| **D** | Domain depends on abstractions only |

---

### 4. DRY Compliance

Scan for duplicated logic, recreated Starter Kit methods.

---

### 5. Starter Kit Integration (Critical!)

Must use existing methods, not recreate:

| Need | Must Use |
|:-----|:---------|
| Camera/FlyTo | `sendQuery()` |
| All screens | `sendKmlToMaster()` |
| Specific slave | `sendKmlToSlave()` |
| Refresh | `forceRefresh()` |
| SSH | `_sshService.execute()` |

---

### 6. Dead Code (FLAG, Don't Delete!)

⚠️ Do NOT auto-delete! Flag potential dead code and ask user to confirm before removing.

---

### 7. LG-Specific

- Correct paths used
- Refresh logic applied for KML files
- Screen calculations correct

---

## Review Report

Create `docs/reviews/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature>-review.md`:

```markdown
# Code Review: [Feature]
**Date**: [Today]

## Automated Checks
| Check | Result |
|:------|:-------|
| flutter analyze | ✅ / ❌ |
| flutter test | ✅ / ❌ |

## SOLID Compliance: [Pass/Needs Work]
## DRY Compliance: [Pass/Needs Work]
## Starter Kit Integration: [Pass/Needs Work]
## LG-Specific: [Pass/Needs Work]

## Verdict: ✅ APPROVED / 🔧 NEEDS REVISION

[Issues if any]
```

---

## Verdict Handling

### ✅ APPROVED

| Mode | Action |
|:-----|:-------|
| `post-execution` | Return to exec for user verification |
| `pre-quiz` | Update SESSION_STATE.md, **invoke skill:** `lg-flutter-quiz-master` |

---

### 🔧 NEEDS REVISION

List issues with explanations. Return to `lg-flutter-exec` for fixes. Re-run review after.

---

## Quick Review (After Debug Loop)

Lighter review for returning from debug session:
1. Run flutter analyze + test
2. Check only changed files
3. Verify no regressions
