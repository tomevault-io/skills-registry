# Skill Creator

Create effective, token-efficient Claude skills.

## Core Principles

1. **Concise** - Challenge every token. Only add what Claude doesn't already know.
2. **Appropriate freedom** - Match specificity to task fragility (see references/workflows.md)
3. **Progressive disclosure** - Metadata → SKILL.md → references (loaded as needed)
4. **Favor subagents** - Design skills to use Task tool for parallel work where beneficial

## Skill Structure

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md              # Required: frontmatter + instructions
├── scripts/              # Optional: executable code
├── references/           # Optional: documentation loaded as needed
└── assets/               # Optional: files used in output
```

## Creation Workflow

1. **Understand** - Gather concrete usage examples (use subagents for parallel research)
2. **Architect** - Use skill-architect to design subagents for the skill
3. **Plan** - Identify reusable resources (scripts/references/assets)
4. **Initialize** - Run `scripts/init_skill.py <name> --path <dir>`
5. **Implement** - Create resources, write SKILL.md with agent definitions
6. **Validate** - Run `scripts/validate_skill.py <skill-dir>`
7. **Register** - Add skill to `.claude/claude.md` under "Auto-Triggered Skills"
8. **Package** - Run `scripts/package_skill.py <skill-dir>` (creates .skill file)
9. **Iterate** - Improve based on real usage

## Writing SKILL.md

### Frontmatter (Critical)

```yaml
---
name: lowercase-hyphenated
description: What it does AND when to trigger. Include specific triggers, keywords, use cases. This is the PRIMARY triggering mechanism.
allowed-tools: Read, Edit, Write, Task  # Include Task for subagent support
---
```

The `description` must contain ALL "when to use" info - body is only loaded AFTER triggering.
Include `Task` in allowed-tools to enable subagent parallelization.

### Body Guidelines

- Keep under 500 lines; split to references if longer
- Use imperative form ("Run the script" not "You should run")
- For multi-step processes, give overview early
- For output formats, use templates or examples (see references/output-patterns.md)

## Resource Types

| Type | When to Use | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `scripts/` | Same code rewritten repeatedly; deterministic reliability needed | `rotate_pdf.py` |
| `references/` | Documentation Claude should reference while working | `schema.md` |
| `assets/` | Files used in output, not loaded into context | `template.pptx` |

## Do NOT Include

- README.md, CHANGELOG.md, INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md
- Auxiliary documentation not needed by Claude
- Duplicate info (lives in SKILL.md OR references, not both)

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] `name` and `description` in frontmatter
- [ ] Description includes what + when to trigger
- [ ] SKILL.md under 500 lines
- [ ] Scripts tested and working
- [ ] No extraneous files
- [ ] References cited in SKILL.md

See `references/workflows.md` for workflow patterns and `references/output-patterns.md` for output formatting.
