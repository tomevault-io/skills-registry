# Workflow Execution

This skill provides patterns for executing Conductor tracks according to defined workflow methodologies, updating progress, and verifying completion.

## Overview

Workflow execution is the implementation phase where plans become reality. This skill covers:
- Following workflow methodologies (TDD, BDD, standard)
- Updating plan status in real-time
- Phase completion verification
- Commit strategies
- Error handling during implementation

## Workflow Methodologies

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)

**Pattern**: Red → Green → Refactor

For each task requiring code:
1. **Write Test**: Create failing test that defines expected behavior
2. **Run Test**: Execute test, verify it fails (Red)
3. **Implement**: Write minimal code to make test pass
4. **Run Test**: Execute test, verify it passes (Green)
5. **Refactor**: Improve code quality without changing behavior
6. **Run Test**: Execute test again, verify still passes

**Example Task**:
```markdown
### [~] Task: Add user email validation
- [x] Sub-task: Write email validation tests
- [x] Sub-task: Run tests (expect failure)
- [~] Sub-task: Implement validation logic
- [ ] Sub-task: Run tests (expect pass)
- [ ] Sub-task: Refactor for clarity
- [ ] Sub-task: Run tests (verify still passes)
```

### Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)

**Pattern**: Specify → Implement → Verify

For each task:
1. **Specify**: Define behavior in Given-When-Then format
2. **Implement**: Write code to satisfy specification
3. **Verify**: Run scenarios to confirm behavior

### Standard Workflow

**Pattern**: Implement → Test → Review

For each task:
1. **Implement**: Write the code or make the change
2. **Test**: Verify it works (manual or automated)
3. **Review**: Check code quality and standards

## Status Management

### Status Markers

Update plan.md markers as work progresses:

| Transition | When | Example |
|------------|------|---------|
| `[ ]` → `[~]` | Starting work | Beginning a task |
| `[~]` → `[x]` | Completing work | Finishing a task |
| `[~]` → `[!]` | Encountering blocker | Cannot proceed |
| `[!]` → `[~]` | Resolving blocker | Resuming work |

### Real-Time Updates

Update plan.md immediately when status changes:
1. Read current plan.md
2. Update status marker
3. Write updated plan.md
4. Commit change (if using per-task commits)

### TodoWrite Integration

Mirror plan.md structure in TodoWrite:
- Create todos for phases, tasks, sub-tasks
- Update todo status when plan.md status changes
- Keep both synchronized throughout implementation

## Phase Completion Verification

### Automated Checks

Run at phase boundaries:

**Tests**:
```bash
npm test          # JavaScript/TypeScript
pytest            # Python
go test ./...     # Go
mvn test          # Java
```

**Build**:
```bash
npm run build     # JavaScript/TypeScript
python setup.py build  # Python
go build          # Go
mvn package       # Java
```

**Linting**:
```bash
npm run lint      # JavaScript/TypeScript
pylint src/       # Python
golangci-lint run # Go
```

**Type Checking**:
```bash
npx tsc --noEmit  # TypeScript
mypy src/         # Python
```

### User Confirmation

After automated checks, present results and ask:
- Question: "Phase '<Phase Name>' is complete. Verification results: [summary]. Ready to proceed?"
- Options:
  - "Yes, proceed to next phase"
  - "No, let me review/fix issues"

If issues found, halt and await user instructions.

## Commit Strategies

### Conventional Commits

Format: `type(scope): description`

**Types**:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `refactor`: Code restructuring
- `test`: Adding tests
- `docs`: Documentation
- `chore`: Maintenance

**Examples**:
```bash
git commit -m "feat(auth): add user registration endpoint"
git commit -m "test(auth): add registration validation tests"
git commit -m "conductor(plan): mark registration task complete"
```

### Commit Frequency

**Per Task**:
- Commit after each task completion
- Include task description in commit message
- Update plan.md in same commit

**Per Phase**:
- Commit after each phase completion
- Include phase summary in commit message
- Update plan.md and tracks.md in same commit

### Plan Update Commits

Always commit plan.md updates:
```bash
git add conductor/tracks/<track_id>/plan.md
git commit -m "conductor(plan): Update <task/phase> status"
```

## Error Handling

### Task Failures

If implementation fails:
1. Mark task as blocked: `[!]`
2. Document blocker in plan.md
3. Update TodoWrite status
4. Inform user with error details
5. Ask how to proceed:
   - "Retry this task"
   - "Skip and continue"
   - "Halt implementation"

### Test Failures

If tests fail during verification:
1. Present test output to user
2. Mark phase as needs-review
3. Ask: "Tests failed. How to proceed?"
   - "Fix issues now"
   - "Continue anyway (not recommended)"
   - "Halt and review"

### Build Failures

If build fails:
1. Present build output
2. Halt implementation
3. Inform: "Build failed. Please fix issues before continuing."
4. Do not proceed to next phase

## Phase-Level Execution Pattern

For each phase:

1. **Announce Phase Start**:
   ```
   🚀 Starting Phase: <Phase Name>
   Tasks in this phase: <N>
   ```

2. **Execute Tasks Sequentially**:
   - For each task in phase:
     - Mark as in_progress: `[~]`
     - Follow workflow methodology
     - Implement the task
     - Mark as completed: `[x]`
     - Update TodoWrite

3. **Run Automated Checks**:
   - Execute tests
   - Run build
   - Check linting
   - Verify type checking

4. **User Verification**:
   - Present check results
   - Ask for confirmation
   - If approved, continue
   - If not, halt and await instructions

5. **Update Phase Status**:
   - Mark phase as complete
   - Commit changes
   - Proceed to next phase

## Context Loading

Before implementing, load all context:
1. `conductor/tracks/<track_id>/spec.md` - Requirements
2. `conductor/tracks/<track_id>/plan.md` - Implementation plan
3. `conductor/workflow.md` - Methodology
4. `conductor/tech-stack.md` - Technical constraints
5. `conductor/product.md` - Product context
6. `conductor/code_styleguides/` - Style standards

## Tips for Implementation

1. **Follow the Plan**: Don't deviate without updating plan first
2. **Update in Real-Time**: Keep plan.md current as you work
3. **Commit Frequently**: Per task or phase, not at the end
4. **Run Checks**: Automated verification at phase boundaries
5. **Respect Methodology**: Follow TDD/BDD/standard as defined
6. **Handle Errors Gracefully**: Mark blockers, inform user, await instructions
7. **Verify Completion**: Don't skip phase verification steps
8. **Keep User Informed**: Announce progress throughout
