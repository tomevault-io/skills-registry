description: Guide for differential abundance analysis method selection, threshold choices, and result interpretation. Use when user asks about LinDA, ZINB, Hurdle, NB methods, q-value thresholds, effect sizes, sensitivity, FDR, or how to interpret DAA results. Also use when user runs an analysis and gets unexpected results (like 0 significant features). Use when this capability is needed.

# Differential Abundance Analysis Guide

This skill provides evidence-based guidance for method selection, threshold choices, and result interpretation based on comprehensive benchmarking.

## Quick Method Selection

| Sparsity | Method | Threshold | Sensitivity | FDR | Use Case |
|----------|--------|-----------|-------------|-----|----------|
| >70% | **Hurdle** | q < 0.05 | 83% | 25% | Sparse data with structural zeros |
| 50-70% | **ZINB** | q < 0.05 | 83% | 29% | Moderate sparsity, excess zeros |
| <30% | **LinDA** | q < 0.10 | 39% | 12.5% | Low sparsity, high-confidence findings |
| Longitudinal | **LMM** | q < 0.05 | - | - | Repeated measures |

## CRITICAL: LinDA Threshold

**LinDA requires q < 0.10, NOT q < 0.05**

LinDA uses CLR (Centered Log-Ratio) transformation which attenuates effect sizes by ~75%:
- True 4.0 log2FC (16x fold change) becomes ~1.0 observed
- At q < 0.05: **0% sensitivity** (nothing detected)
- At q < 0.10: **39% sensitivity** with excellent **12.5% FDR**

This is by design, not a bug. CLR centers by geometric mean to handle compositional data.

### When User Gets 0 Significant Results with LinDA

1. First, check if they used q < 0.05 → suggest q < 0.10
2. If still nothing at q < 0.10, the effects may be too small
3. LinDA needs >8x fold changes to detect anything reliably
4. Suggest trying Hurdle if FDR control is less critical

## Effect Size Requirements

| Method | Minimum Detectable Effect | Notes |
|--------|---------------------------|-------|
| LinDA | >8x fold change (3 log2FC) | Due to CLR attenuation |
| ZINB | >2x fold change (1 log2FC) | Good sensitivity |
| Hurdle | >2x fold change (1 log2FC) | Best for sparse data |
| NB | >16x fold change (4 log2FC) | Conservative |

## Method Details

### LinDA (CLR + Linear Model)
- **Best for**: High-confidence findings, FDR-controlled discovery
- **Threshold**: q < 0.10 (NOT 0.05)
- **Pros**: Excellent FDR control (12.5%), handles compositionality
- **Cons**: Low sensitivity, only detects very large effects
- **Effect sizes**: NOT directly interpretable as fold changes (attenuated by ~75%)

### ZINB (Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial)
- **Best for**: Discovery, count data with excess zeros
- **Threshold**: q < 0.05
- **Pros**: High sensitivity (83%), models zero-inflation
- **Cons**: Moderate FDR (29%), assumes NB distribution

### Hurdle Model
- **Best for**: Sparse data with structural zeros, two-part analysis
- **Threshold**: q < 0.05
- **Pros**: High sensitivity (83%), good FDR (25%), separates presence/abundance
- **Cons**: More complex interpretation (binary + count components)

### NB (Negative Binomial)
- **Best for**: Low-sparsity data, simple overdispersion
- **Threshold**: q < 0.05
- **Pros**: Simple, well-understood
- **Cons**: Low sensitivity (6%), doesn't handle excess zeros

### Permutation Test
- **Best for**: Unknown distributions, non-parametric inference
- **Threshold**: p < 0.05
- **Pros**: Distribution-free, robust
- **Cons**: Computationally intensive, may be conservative

### LMM (Linear Mixed Model)
- **Best for**: Longitudinal data, repeated measures
- **Threshold**: q < 0.05
- **Pros**: Handles within-subject correlation, auto-detected by `recommend`
- **Cons**: Requires CLR transformation, same attenuation as LinDA

## Interpreting Results

### LinDA Results
- Effect sizes are CLR-transformed, NOT fold changes
- Observed estimate of 1.0 may represent true 4x fold change
- Focus on significance (q-value), not effect magnitude
- Use q < 0.10 threshold

### ZINB/Hurdle Results
- Effect sizes are on log scale (interpretable as log fold change)
- `fold_change = exp(estimate)`
- Higher sensitivity means more discoveries but also more false positives
- Consider biological plausibility of findings

### Sample Size Considerations
- n=10 per group: Only huge effects (>8x) reliably detectable
- n=20 per group: Large effects (>4x) detectable
- n=50 per group: Moderate effects (>2x) become detectable
- Power analysis recommended before study

## Decision Tree

```
Is your data longitudinal/repeated measures?
├── YES → recommend auto-detects and runs LMM
└── NO → Continue...

What is your sparsity level?
├── >70% zeros → Hurdle (q < 0.05)
├── 50-70% zeros → ZINB (q < 0.05)
├── 30-50% zeros → ZINB or LinDA
└── <30% zeros → LinDA (q < 0.10)

Unsure about distributional assumptions?
└── Permutation test (p < 0.05)
```

## CLI Quick Reference

The unified workflow handles method selection automatically:

```bash
# Let the tool choose the best method for your data
daa recommend -c counts.tsv -m metadata.tsv -g group -t treatment --run -o results.tsv

# Just see the recommendation (no execution)
daa recommend -c counts.tsv -m metadata.tsv -g group -t treatment

# Generate editable YAML for custom configurations
daa recommend -c counts.tsv -m metadata.tsv -g group -t treatment --yaml -o pipeline.yaml

# Non-parametric alternative
daa permutation -c counts.tsv -m metadata.tsv -f "~ group" -t grouptreatment -o results.tsv
```

### Longitudinal/Repeated Measures

The `recommend` command auto-detects these designs:

```bash
# Metadata with subject + timepoint columns → LMM automatically
daa recommend -c counts.tsv -m metadata.tsv -g group -t treatment --run -o results.tsv

# For custom formulas (interactions, random slopes):
daa recommend -c counts.tsv -m metadata.tsv -g group -t treatment --yaml -o pipeline.yaml
# Edit pipeline.yaml, then:
daa run -c counts.tsv -m metadata.tsv --config pipeline.yaml -o results.tsv
```

## Troubleshooting: 0 Significant Features

1. **Check threshold**: Did you use LinDA with q < 0.05? Try q < 0.10
2. **Check sample size**: n < 20/group has very limited power
3. **Check sparsity**: >70% sparsity with LinDA? Try Hurdle instead
4. **Run validation**: `daa validate` to see if method works on your data structure
5. **Check raw p-values**: Are any features close (p < 0.1)?
