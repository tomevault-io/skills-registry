# Testing and Validation

**All proposed changes must pass the full test suite and all linters before being submitted.**

## CI-Aligned Validation (matches what CI runs)

```bash
# All tests (workflow, backend, web, mypy)
rtk bazel test //...

# All linters: ruff, eslint, tsc, mypy
rtk bazel build --config=lint //...
```

Run `rtk bazel test //...` — it discovers and runs all affected tests automatically.
Do not pick granular targets to save time during iterative debugging. Bazel caches
passing targets, so re-running `//...` after a fix costs no more than running a single target.

## Auto-Fix Before Committing

```bash
gz_format
# equivalent to:
ruff format .
ruff check --fix .
```

Run from the repo root with the venv active. No Bazel-integrated auto-fix step.

## Individual Suites (fast iteration during development)

Prefer Bazel targets — they match CI and benefit from incremental caching.

Before running a granular Bazel test after adding or importing new source files, check
that the target's source slice includes the new dependencies:

```bash
rtk bazel query 'labels(srcs, //web:workflow_state_src)'  # inspect included files
rtk bazel query 'deps(<test-target>)'                     # trace dependencies
```

This matters especially when a page is refactored into a subfolder (`web/src/pages/<PageName>/`):
update the matching `js_library` `srcs` and focused test target inputs at the same time.

```bash
# Workflow schema validation
rtk bazel test //tests:...

# Backend API tests
rtk bazel test //api:api_test

# Backend mypy
rtk bazel test //api:api_mypy

# Web component tests
rtk bazel test //web:web_test
cd web && npm run test:watch     # watch mode (no Bazel equivalent)

# Web type-check + lint
rtk bazel build --config=lint //web/...
# Do not run tsc directly — may not resolve depending on environment setup
```

When web lint or type-check fails because a fixture or test object is missing a
field, treat that as a useful contract signal. Fix the backend serializer so
the generated schema exposes the field, then make the fixture match the
generated type. **Do not** weaken `types.ts` or use it to decide which fields
are present or optional just to satisfy the checker.

## Web Test and Lint Helpers

```bash
source env-agent.sh
gz_lint
gz_test
```

`gz_lint` runs all project linters and type-checkers, and `gz_test` runs all tests.

## CI Jobs

Three parallel jobs on every push and PR (see `.github/workflows/ci.yml`):

| Job | What it runs |
|---|---|
| `test` | `rtk bazel test --config=ci //...` — all test suites |
| `lint` | `bazel build --config=ci --config=lint //...` — ruff, eslint, tsc, mypy |
| `coverage` | `bazel coverage --config=ci --combined_report=lcov //...` — feeds Codecov |

A PR should not be merged if any job is red.

## BUILD.bazel Source File Rules

When adding a new source file, check whether the relevant Bazel target picks it up
automatically (glob) or requires a manual `srcs` addition (explicit list).

### Python (`api/`)

| File type | Target | Auto-included? |
|---|---|---|
| Non-test, non-migration `.py` in `api/` | `//api:api_lib` | ✅ glob — no change needed |
| Migration `api/migrations/*.py` | `//api:migrations` | ✅ glob — no change needed |
| New test file `api/tests/test_*.py` | appropriate `py_test` in `api/BUILD.bazel` | ❌ must add to `srcs` |

Determine which `py_test` target to add to by matching the test's concern:

| Test concern | Target |
|---|---|
| Workflow helpers, globals DSL, additional fields | `//api:api_workflow_test` |
| Model factory, globals, utils | `//api:api_model_test` |
| Piece CRUD, state transitions, sealed state | `//api:api_piece_test` |
| Auth (login, logout, Google OAuth) | `//api:api_auth_test` |
| Glaze combination, public library, import tool | `//api:api_glaze_test` |
| Admin, R2 uploads, exports | `//api:api_admin_test` |

### TypeScript (`web/`)

| File type | Target | Auto-included? |
|---|---|---|
| `web/src/util/**/*.ts` (non-test) | `//web:util_lib` | ✅ glob — no change needed |
| `web/src/components/*.tsx` or `web/src/pages/*.tsx` | `//web:web_lib` (build) | ✅ glob — no change needed for builds |
| Same component/page file | fine-grained `*_src` `js_library` (tests) | ❌ must add to appropriate `*_src` target's `srcs` in `web/BUILD.bazel` |
| New `**/*.test.ts` or `**/*.test.tsx` | appropriate `vitest_test` in `web/BUILD.bazel` | ❌ must add to `srcs` |

**Component `*_src` target lookup:** find the `js_library` whose `srcs` already contains
sibling files from the same component group. If the new component has no siblings yet,
create a new `js_library` (following the existing pattern) and a corresponding
`vitest_test` target, then add the new test target to the `web_test` `test_suite`.

Verify Bazel picks up the new file before committing:
```bash
rtk bazel query 'labels(srcs, //api:api_lib)'         # confirm Python file included
rtk bazel query 'labels(srcs, //web:util_lib)'         # confirm util file included
rtk bazel query 'labels(srcs, //web:<component>_src)'  # confirm component file included
```

## Regression Test Validity

When adding a regression test for a bugfix, verify the test would actually have caught
the bug — not just that it passes with the fix applied. The standard procedure:

```bash
# From the worktree containing both the fix and the new test:
git stash   # or checkout a clean baseline without the fix
rtk bazel test //web:web_<component>_test --test_output=errors
# The new test should FAIL here.
git stash pop
rtk bazel test //web:web_<component>_test --test_output=errors
# The new test should PASS here.
```

A test that passes on the buggy baseline is not a regression test — it is noise that
will never catch a future recurrence of the bug.

## Tautological Constant Tests

When a test compares a function's output against an exported constant, check that
the constant and the function don't share the same formula at the same input value.
If they do, the test passes trivially on both the correct and any broken implementation
that happens to change both together.

```ts
// ❌ tautological — passes even if the formula is wrong, because DEFAULT_FOO_HEIGHT
//    is computed from the same expression at the same input width
expect(estimateFooHeight({ thumbnail: null }, 220)).toBe(DEFAULT_FOO_HEIGHT);
// DEFAULT_FOO_HEIGHT = Math.round(220 * 0.75) + 112  ← same formula, same input

// ✅ use a different input that exercises the formula independently
expect(estimateFooHeight({ thumbnail: null }, 160)).toBe(
  Math.round(160 * DEFAULT_ASPECT_HEIGHT / DEFAULT_ASPECT_WIDTH) + CHROME_HEIGHT,
);
// Also add a separate test that pins the constant to its reference input:
expect(DEFAULT_FOO_HEIGHT).toBe(
  Math.round(220 * DEFAULT_ASPECT_HEIGHT / DEFAULT_ASPECT_WIDTH) + CHROME_HEIGHT,
);
```

This also applies to tests that compare two calls to the same function: they prove
internal consistency but not correctness.

## Test Locations

- `tests/test_workflow.py` — workflow schema/integrity validation
- `api/tests/` — Django API tests (granular Bazel targets per concern)
- `web/src/components/__tests__/` — React component tests (granular Bazel targets per component)
- `web/src/util/workflow.test.ts` — `workflow.ts` helper unit tests
- `web/src/util/__tests__/api.test.ts` — `api.ts` unit tests (axios mocked)

**Keep tests in their domain-specific file.** Each Bazel target covers one coherent slice.
When adding new tests, extend the existing file covering the same module. Do not create
new cross-cutting files — they end up in catch-all targets that run on every change.
