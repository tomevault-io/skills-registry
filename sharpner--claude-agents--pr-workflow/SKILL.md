# PR Merge Workflow

**NEVER MERGE YOURSELF - ALWAYS WAIT FOR USER APPROVAL!**

## STEPS (All Required)

### 1. Pre-PR Validation
```bash
# Run quality checks
npm test           # or: go test ./...
npm run build      # or: go build ./...
npm run lint       # or: golangci-lint run
```

### 2. Create PR
```bash
gh pr create --title "type: description (closes #issue)" --body "..."
```

### 3. Wait for CI
```bash
gh pr checks <pr-number> --watch
```

### 4. Request Reviews
- Code review from team member
- Security review (if auth/API changes)
- Mobile review (if UI changes)

### 5. Address Feedback
- Fix all CRITICAL issues immediately
- Fix HIGH issues before merge
- Create follow-up tickets for MEDIUM/LOW

### 6. Wait for Approval
```bash
gh pr view <pr-number> --json reviews --jq '.reviews[] | select(.state == "APPROVED")'
```

**IF NO APPROVAL -> STOP AND WAIT!**

### 7. After Approval Only
```bash
gh pr merge <pr-number> --squash --delete-branch
```

## ISSUE LABEL WORKFLOW

| `in progress` | Actively working on issue |
| `blocked` | Waiting on dependency |
| `ready for review` | PR created, awaiting review |

```bash
# Add label
gh issue edit <nr> --add-label "in progress"

# Add blocker comment

## NEVER DO

- Merge without approval
- Force push to shared branches
- Skip CI checks
- Merge with failing tests
- Push directly to main
