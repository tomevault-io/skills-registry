# SolidJS Development Skill

Expert guidance for building reactive applications with SolidJS. This skill provides best practices, reactivity rules, and integration patterns for the SolidJS ecosystem.

## Quick Reference

### Core Reactivity Rules

⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Never destructure props—it kills reactivity. Use `splitProps` or access `props.property` directly.

```tsx
// ❌ WRONG - Breaks reactivity
const { value, onChange } = props

// ✅ CORRECT - Preserves reactivity
const value = () => props.value
// OR access directly: props.value
```

### Common Patterns

| Pattern | Use |
|---------|-----|
| `createSignal()` | Reactive state with getter/setter |
| `createMemo()` | Derived reactive value (cached computation) |
| `createEffect()` | Side effect on dependency change |
| `batch()` | Group multiple signal updates |
| `splitProps()` | Split props while preserving reactivity |

## File Structure & Conventions

```tsx
// EditorPane.tsx - One component per file, PascalCase naming
import { createSignal, batch } from 'solid-js'

// ✅ Named export (preferred)
export function EditorPane(props) {
  // Component implementation
}
```

**Rules**:
- TypeScript with `.tsx` extension
- One component per file
- Named exports (avoid default exports)
- PascalCase for component filenames

## Reactivity Deep Dive

### Props Are Reactive Getters

Props are automatically reactive—no need to wrap them:

```tsx
function Child(props) {
  // ✅ Reactive automatically
  return <div>{props.value}</div>

  // ❌ Don't do this
  return <div>{props.value()}</div>  // props.value is not a function!
}
```

### Batching Multiple Updates

```tsx
import { batch } from 'solid-js'

// Batch prevents multiple re-renders
batch(() => {
  setName('Alice')
  setAge(30)
  setCity('NYC')
})
```

### The `children` Helper

**Always** use the `children` helper when accepting `props.children`:

```tsx
import { children } from 'solid-js'

function Wrapper(props) {
  const resolved = children(() => props.children)

  // Use resolved() in JSX
  return <div>{resolved()}</div>
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Properly resolves children (functions executed, arrays flattened)
- Memoizes to prevent redundant DOM creation
- Tracks in the correct scope

**Conditional rendering**:
```tsx
const resolved = children(() => visible() && props.children)
```

## Naming Conventions

### `create*` — Reactive Primitives

Creates a **reactive primitive** that integrates with Solid's tracking system.

```tsx
createSignal()  // Signal with getter/setter
createMemo()    // Derived reactive value
createEffect()  // Side effect on dependency change
```

**Use when**: Setting up reactivity, registering dependencies, producing tracked reads/writes

### `make*` — Non-Reactive Foundations

Creates a **non-reactive building block** with only setup + cleanup.

```tsx
makeTimer()  // Timer scheduler + cleanup
// createTimer() would wrap makeTimer() to add reactivity
```

**Use when**: Building low-level utilities, composing into reactive primitives, zero reactivity needed

### `use*` — Access Existing Resources

**Consumes** an already-created resource rather than creating new reactive machinery.

```tsx
useContext()     // Retrieves context created by createContext()
useTransition()  // Accesses transition state
```

**Use when**: Accessing existing contexts, retrieving already-created resources

## Async & Suspense

### Quick Reference

| Primitive | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `Suspense` | Shows fallback until resources resolve |
| `createResource` | Keyed async data with cache, refetch, loading |
| `createAsync` | Fire-and-forget async (no keys, no refetch) |
| `startTransition` | Keeps old UI until new resource resolves |
| `useTransition` | Provides `pending()` during transitions |

### Critical Rules

1. **Only resources trigger Suspense**—signals, memos, and props do not
2. **Never wrap resources in `<Show>`** inside Suspense:
   ```tsx
   // ❌ Bad
   <Suspense><Show when={res()} /></Suspense>

   // ✅ Good
   <Suspense>{res()}</Suspense>
   ```
3. **Nested Suspense** isolates loading states—each waits only for its own resources

### Resource-Driven UI Pattern

```tsx
const [font] = createResource(activeFont, loadFont)

<Suspense fallback={<Spinner />}>
  <Editor font={font()} />
</Suspense>

// Smooth transition on change
startTransition(() => setActiveFont("Inter"))
```

### Decision Guide

| Need | Use |
|------|-----|
| No flicker | `Suspense` |
| Keyed async | `createResource` |
| Smooth swaps | `startTransition` |
| Loading indicator | `useTransition` |
| Partial loading | Nested `Suspense` |

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Setting signals in effects** → Use `createMemo` for derived values instead
2. **Destructuring props** → Kills reactivity; use `splitProps` or direct access
3. **Wrapping resources in `<Show>`** → Prevents Suspense from working
4. **Not batching updates** → Causes unnecessary re-renders
5. **Accessing props.value()** → Props are already reactive, don't call as function

## Solid Primitives Library

Before implementing custom solutions, check **[solid-primitives](https://github.com/solidjs-community/solid-primitives)**.

Install: `bun add @solid-primitives/{name}`

For detailed information about available primitives, see [PRIMITIVES.md](PRIMITIVES.md).

## Additional Resources

- **[PRIMITIVES.md](PRIMITIVES.md)** - Complete guide to solid-primitives library including fetchers, resources, WebSockets, and composition patterns
- **[TERMINOLOGY.md](TERMINOLOGY.md)** - Detailed glossary of SolidJS terms and concepts
- **Official Docs** - Use the `fetch_solidjs_docs` helper to access official documentation

## Official Documentation Access

To fetch the latest information from SolidJS official documentation (uses gitingest to access the solidjs/solid-docs GitHub repo):

```bash
# Fetch specific documentation page
python3 .claude/skills/solidjs/fetch_docs.py "reactivity"
python3 .claude/skills/solidjs/fetch_docs.py "createResource"
python3 .claude/skills/solidjs/fetch_docs.py "signals"

# Or search for any topic
python3 .claude/skills/solidjs/fetch_docs.py "Suspense"
```

**Features**:
- Caches documentation for 1 hour to avoid repeated fetches
- Searches through 219 files from the official solid-docs repo
- Returns relevant markdown documentation with examples
- Covers concepts, guides, API reference, and tutorials

When you need the most up-to-date information or details not covered in this skill, use the documentation fetcher.
