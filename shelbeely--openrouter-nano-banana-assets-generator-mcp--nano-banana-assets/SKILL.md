# Nano Banana Assets Generator Skill

This skill enables AI agents to generate **any kind of visual asset** using OpenRouter's Nano Banana Pro model (Google Gemini 3 Pro Image Preview). 

**Use this skill when users request:**
- Any image, graphic, or visual content
- Icons, logos, banners, backgrounds, UI elements
- Illustrations, characters, stickers, avatars
- Product mockups, designs, compositions
- Social media graphics, marketing materials
- Creative artwork of any style or type

**Key Philosophy:** Be flexible and creative. Adapt to the user's needs rather than forcing predefined templates.

## About Nano Banana Pro

Nano Banana Pro is Google's most advanced image-generation and editing model, built on Gemini 3 Pro. It extends the original Nano Banana with significantly improved multimodal reasoning, real-world grounding, and high-fidelity visual synthesis.

**Key Features:**
- **Multi-Image Support**: Can blend and edit up to **14 reference images** per request
- **Identity Preservation**: Maintains consistency across up to **5 distinct subjects/characters** simultaneously
- **Multi-Image Blending**: Consistent style across multiple generations with superior quality
- **Text Rendering**: Industry-leading text placement in images (94-96% accuracy) with multilingual layouts
- **Fine-Grained Controls**: Localized edits, lighting adjustments, focus control, camera transformations
- **Flexible Outputs**: Support for 2K/4K outputs and multiple aspect ratios (1:1, 16:9, 9:16, 4:3, 3:4, 21:9, 9:21, 2:3, 3:2, 5:4, 4:5)
- **Context-Rich Graphics**: From infographics and diagrams to cinematic composites
- **Conversational Editing**: Iterative, multi-turn editing workflows for refinement
- **Photorealistic Quality**: Advanced multimodal reasoning for professional-quality outputs

**Understanding Image Limits:**
- **Reference Images**: You can include up to 14 reference images in a single API request
- **Identity Subjects**: The model can maintain consistency for up to 5 different characters/subjects within those references
- **Series Generation**: For generating series of many images (10+, 20+, 50+), use the **sliding window technique** (detailed in section 5 below) to maintain visual consistency across the entire collection by using the most recent 5-14 generated images as references for each new image.

## Known Limitations

### ⚠️ Transparent Backgrounds Not Supported

**IMPORTANT:** Nano Banana Pro (Google Gemini 3 Pro Image Preview) **does not generate images with true alpha transparency**. This is a model limitation, not a configuration issue.

**What Actually Happens:**
- Generated images are RGB PNG files (color type 2) without alpha channels
- When you request "transparent background," the model paints a solid color or pattern
- The background may appear white, gray, or have a checkered pattern painted as pixels
- The resulting PNG files cannot be overlaid on other backgrounds with transparency

**Implications for Agents:**
- ❌ **Do NOT promise users transparent backgrounds** or alpha channel support
- ❌ **Do NOT include "transparent background" in prompts** - it creates fake checkered patterns
- ✅ **DO use chroma key colors** for easy background removal (#00FF00 bright green recommended)
- ✅ **DO inform users** that post-processing is needed for true transparency

**Recommended Approach: Chroma Key Backgrounds**

When users need transparency, use a **bright chroma key color** that can be easily removed:

**Best Chroma Key Colors:**
1. **Bright Green (#00FF00)** - Most common, rarely appears in subjects
2. **Bright Magenta (#FF00FF)** - Alternative if subject contains green
3. **Bright Blue (#0000FF)** - For subjects with green/magenta elements

**Example Prompts:**
```
- "Solid bright green background (#00FF00) for chroma key removal"
- "Pure #00FF00 green background, flat and uniform"
- "Subject isolated on solid bright green (#00FF00) chroma key background"
```

**Why This Works:**
- ✅ Model generates clean, uniform color fills
- ✅ No fake checkered patterns painted as pixels
- ✅ Easy to select and remove using color-based tools
- ✅ Chroma key removal is cleaner than edge detection
- ✅ Works perfectly with standard video/photo editing workflows

**Automated Scripts Available:**

The skill includes several helper scripts in `scripts/` directory for various workflows:

**1. Single Asset with Transparency (Recommended):**
```bash
cd .github/skills/nano-banana-assets/scripts
python generate_with_transparency.py "Your prompt" "1:1" "1024x1024"
```
- ✅ Generates with #00FF00 chroma key (no fake checkered patterns)
- ✅ Removes background with rembg (AI-powered)
- ✅ Outputs transparent RGBA PNG files
- ✅ Saves both transparent and original versions

**2. Batch Generation:**
```bash
# From config file
python batch_generate.py --config example_batch_config.json --transparent

# From prompts
python batch_generate.py --prompts "Icon 1" "Icon 2" "Icon 3" --transparent
```
- ✅ Generate multiple assets at once
- ✅ Optional transparency support
- ✅ Progress tracking and error handling

**3. Post-Process Existing Images:**
```bash
# Remove backgrounds from already-generated images
python remove_backgrounds.py --directory ./images/

# Or with chroma key
python remove_backgrounds.py --chroma-key "#00FF00" image.png
```
- ✅ AI-powered removal with rembg
- ✅ Chroma key color removal
- ✅ Batch directory processing

**See `scripts/README.md` for complete documentation and examples.**

**Requirements:**
```bash
pip install rembg requests Pillow
```

**Post-Processing Background Removal:**

**Recommended: Using rembg (AI-powered removal)**

The **rembg** tool provides automated, high-quality background removal that works with any background color (including chroma key backgrounds):

1. **Install rembg:**
   ```bash
   pip install rembg[gpu]  # For GPU acceleration
   # or
   pip install rembg       # CPU only
   ```

2. **Remove background (single file):**
   ```bash
   rembg i input.png output.png
   ```

3. **Batch process all files:**
   ```bash
   # Process all PNG files in directory
   for file in *.png; do
     rembg i "$file" "transparent_$file"
   done
   
   # Or use rembg's built-in batch processing
   rembg p input_folder output_folder
   ```

4. **Python API (for integration):**
   ```python
   from rembg import remove
   from PIL import Image
   
   input_path = 'input.png'
   output_path = 'output.png'
   
   with open(input_path, 'rb') as i:
       with open(output_path, 'wb') as o:
           input_data = i.read()
           output_data = remove(input_data)
           o.write(output_data)
   ```

**Why rembg is Best:**
- ✅ AI-powered edge detection (U²-Net model)
- ✅ Works with any background color (chroma key or natural)
- ✅ High-quality results with fine details (hair, fur, transparent objects)
- ✅ Fully automated - no manual selection needed
- ✅ Fast batch processing
- ✅ Open source and free

**Alternative: Manual Chroma Key Removal**

If you prefer manual control or don't want to install rembg:

1. **Using ImageMagick (CLI):**
   ```bash
   # Remove bright green background with tolerance
   convert input.png -fuzz 5% -transparent "#00FF00" output.png
   
   # Batch process all files
   for file in *.png; do
     convert "$file" -fuzz 5% -transparent "#00FF00" "transparent_$file"
   done
   ```

2. **Using Photoshop:**
   - Select → Color Range → Sample the green background
   - Adjust tolerance as needed
   - Delete selection → Save as PNG with transparency

3. **Using GIMP:**
   - Colors → Color to Alpha → Select the green (#00FF00)
   - Export as PNG with alpha channel

4. **Using FFmpeg (for batch):**
   ```bash
   ffmpeg -i input.png -filter_complex "colorkey=0x00FF00:0.3:0.2" output.png
   ```

**Not Recommended:**

1. **Plain White/Gray Backgrounds:**
   - ⚠️ Harder to remove if subject has similar colors
   - Requires more manual editing around edges

2. **Request "Transparent" (Avoid):**
   - ❌ Creates fake checkered patterns painted as pixels
   - ❌ Very difficult to remove cleanly

**What to Tell Users:**
```
Note: Generated images have solid backgrounds (RGB PNG format). 
The model cannot create true transparent backgrounds (RGBA). 

For transparency removal, I recommend using rembg (AI-powered):
  pip install rembg
  rembg i input.png output.png

Or for manual chroma key removal with the bright green (#00FF00) background:
  convert image.png -fuzz 5% -transparent "#00FF00" output.png

The chroma key approach avoids the "fake checkered pattern" issue.
```

```

### 5. Generate Consistent Series (More than 5 Images)

Use this when the user needs to generate **a large series of images** (10+, 20+, 50+) that must maintain consistency across the entire series.

**Background**: Nano Banana Pro can process up to **14 reference images** per request and maintain identity for up to **5 distinct subjects/characters**. For generating extensive series (many more images than can be used as references), use a **sliding window approach** where you use the most recent 5-14 generated images as references for each new image.

**When to use:**
- User asks for "20+ icons in the same style"
- User wants "a storyboard with 15+ frames"
- User needs "30-day social media calendar with consistent branding"
- User requests any extensive image series (icon libraries, product catalogs, etc.)

**Steps:**

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - Collect series requirements:
     - Overall series description
     - Individual descriptions for each image
     - Brand guidelines and style requirements
     - Color palette
     - Aspect ratio and resolution
     - Any initial reference images or logo (up to 14 images)

2. **Generate First Image**:
   - Use any initial reference images provided
   - Include brand guidelines and color palette
   - This establishes the baseline style

3. **Generate Subsequent Images (Sliding Window)**:
   - For images 2-14: Use ALL previously generated images as references (accumulating)
   - For image 15 onwards: Use only the LAST 10-14 generated images as references (sliding window)
   - This maintains consistency while respecting the model's 14-image reference limit
   - Recommended: Use 10-12 recent images to leave room for logo/initial references

4. **Workflow Pattern**:

   **For each image in the series:**
   
   a. Build the prompt:
   ```
   Generate image [N] of [TOTAL] for this series:
   
   Series Context: [overall description]
   
   This Image: [specific description for this image]
   
   Brand Guidelines:
   [guidelines]
   
   Color Palette: [colors]
   Aspect Ratio: [ratio]
   Resolution: [resolution]
   
   Consistency Requirements:
   - Maintain the same visual style as the reference images
   - Use consistent design language, color treatment, and composition
   - Ensure this image feels like part of the same cohesive series
   - Professional, web-ready quality
   - Modern and polished appearance
   
   IMPORTANT: The reference images show the previously generated images in this series. Match their style, tone, and visual identity exactly while creating this new variation.
   ```
   
   b. Prepare reference images (up to 14 total):
   ```
   reference_images = []
   
   # Add logo if provided (takes 1 slot)
   if logo_file:
       reference_images.append(logo_file)
   
   # Add initial style references only for first image (up to 3-5 slots)
   if current_image == 1 and initial_references:
       reference_images.extend(initial_references[:5])  # Limit to first 5
   
   # Add previously generated images (sliding window approach)
   if generated_images:
       # Calculate how many slots remain (max 14 total)
       remaining_slots = 14 - len(reference_images)
       
       # For images 2-14: Use all previous images (if they fit)
       if current_image <= 14:
           reference_images.extend(generated_images[:remaining_slots])
       else:
           # For image 15+: Use last 10-12 images (sliding window)
           # Keep 2-4 slots for logo and initial references
           window_size = min(remaining_slots, 12)
           start_index = max(0, len(generated_images) - window_size)
           reference_images.extend(generated_images[start_index:])
   ```
   
   c. Make API call with reference images (max 14)
   
   d. Store the generated image for use in next iteration
   
   e. Repeat for next image

5. **Present results with clear tracking**:
   - Show each image with its number and description
   - Indicate which images were used as references
   - Confirm consistency across the series

**Example workflow for 20-icon series:**

```
User Request: "Create 20 minimalist weather icons with consistent style"

Your Workflow:

Step 1: Generate Icon 1 (Sunny)
---
Prompt: "Generate icon 1 of 20 for this series:

## Best Practices

### Writing Effective Prompts (Google's Six-Element Framework)

Google's research shows that prompts structured around six core elements produce the best results with Gemini models:

1. **Subject: Define Who/What**
   - Be specific about the main elements, characters, or objects
   - Include physical attributes, characteristics, and details
   - ❌ "A banner"
   - ✅ "A modern SaaS hero banner featuring abstract geometric shapes (floating hexagons, connecting nodes, light particles)"

2. **Composition: Describe Framing & Layout**
   - Specify camera angles, framing, and perspective
   - Use standard photography/design terms
   - ❌ "Nice layout"
   - ✅ "Wide shot with rule of thirds composition, negative space on left third for text overlay, visual weight balanced on right"

3. **Action: Explain What's Happening**
   - Describe movement, interactions, or static positioning
   - Define energy level and dynamics
   - ❌ "Some movement"
   - ✅ "Subtle upward particle drift creating sense of innovation and progress, energy flowing through connecting lines"

4. **Location: Set the Environment**
   - Describe setting, context, and surroundings
   - Include environmental details that enhance the scene
   - ❌ "Tech background"
   - ✅ "Contemporary digital workspace with infinite depth, clean minimal environment suggesting cloud/SaaS platform"

5. **Style: Define the Aesthetic**
   - Be specific about visual treatment and design approach
   - Reference design movements, art styles, or specific aesthetics
   - ❌ "Modern look"
   - ✅ "Modern minimalist with vibrant gradients, flat design principles, clean professional aesthetic suitable for enterprise SaaS"

6. **Lighting: Specify Illumination Details**
   - Describe light sources, quality, direction, and mood
   - Include shadows, highlights, and atmospheric effects
   - ❌ "Good lighting"
   - ✅ "Soft ambient glow from gradient background, subtle rim lighting on geometric elements from top-right creating depth, gentle shadows"

### Advanced Prompt Enhancements

1. **Camera Details** (Optional but Powerful)
   - Lens specifications: "85mm portrait lens", "24mm wide angle"
   - Focal properties: "shallow depth of field", "everything in focus"
   - Perspective: "low angle looking up", "bird's eye view", "eye level"
   - Example: "Shot with 85mm equivalent focal length, f/2.8 aperture for subtle background blur"

2. **Materiality & Texture** (For Product/Design Assets)
   - Surface qualities: "matte finish", "glossy", "brushed metal", "frosted glass"
   - Texture details: "smooth gradient", "paper texture", "fabric weave", "metallic sheen"
   - Example: "Gradient elements have smooth glass-like quality, geometric shapes with subtle metallic sheen, soft velvety background"

3. **Full Sentence Narratives**
   - Use natural language, not just keywords
   - Brief the AI like a creative director
   - ❌ "blue purple gradient tech shapes modern"
   - ✅ "Create a hero shot featuring an abstract technology landscape with flowing gradients from deep blue to vibrant purple, populated with geometric shapes that suggest connectivity and innovation"

### Iterative Conversational Editing

Nano Banana Pro excels at multi-turn refinement. Instead of regenerating, use conversational edits:

**Initial Prompt:**
```
Generate a product banner for smart home device...
```

**Follow-up Edit 1:**
```
Make the lighting warmer and more inviting, shift from cool tones to golden hour quality
```

**Follow-up Edit 2:**
```
Add the brand logo in top-left corner, subtle drop shadow, 15% opacity
```

**Follow-up Edit 3:**
```
Increase the contrast of the main product by 20%, make it pop more against the background
```

This preserves composition and layout while refining specific aspects.

### Writing Effective Prompts (Legacy Guidelines - Still Valid)

1. **Be Specific and Detailed**
   - ❌ "Make a banner"
   - ✅ "Create a modern tech startup hero banner with gradient background from blue to purple, abstract geometric elements, and space for overlaying text"

2. **Include Context**
   - Mention where the asset will be used (website, social media, email, app)
   - Specify the target audience
   - Describe the desired mood/emotion

3. **Define Style Clearly**
   - Use descriptive terms: minimalist, vibrant, elegant, playful, professional
   - Reference art styles: flat design, material design, glassmorphism, etc.
   - Mention specific elements: gradients, shadows, textures, patterns

4. **Specify Technical Requirements**
   - Always include aspect ratio for the intended use case
   - Mention resolution if quality is critical
   - List any technical constraints

### Color Guidance

1. **Provide Hex Codes**
   - ✅ Use: "#667EEA", "#764BA2"
   - ❌ Avoid: "blue", "purple"

2. **Include 3-5 Brand Colors**
   - Primary color
   - Secondary color
   - Accent color(s)
   - Background color (if applicable)

3. **Consider Color Harmony**
   - Complementary colors for contrast
   - Analogous colors for harmony
   - Triadic colors for vibrancy

### Reference Images

1. **Use Up to 14 Reference Images (Not Just 5)**
   - Nano Banana Pro supports up to **14 reference images** per request
   - Use for style guidance, composition examples, and identity preservation
   - Categories of references:
     - **Style references**: Overall aesthetic and visual treatment (1-3 images)
     - **Composition references**: Layout and arrangement examples (1-2 images)
     - **Color treatment references**: Mood and color grading (1-2 images)
     - **Subject/identity references**: For maintaining character or product consistency (up to 5 distinct subjects)
     - **Technical references**: Quality level and detail expectations (1-2 images)
     - **Brand assets**: Logos and brand elements (1-2 images)

2. **Provide Context for References**
   - Explain what aspect to emulate from each reference
   - Clarify what to avoid from the reference
   - Specify if it's for style, composition, color, or subject identity
   - Example: "Reference image 1 shows the composition layout to follow. Reference image 2 demonstrates the lighting quality desired."

3. **Identity Preservation Across References**
   - Model can maintain consistency for up to **5 distinct subjects/characters** across the 14 references
   - Use multiple angles/views of same subject to strengthen identity preservation
   - Explicitly mention: "Maintain the visual identity shown in reference images 1-3"

### Brand Consistency

1. **Establish Guidelines First**
   - Define style clearly
   - Document color usage rules
   - Specify typography preferences
   - Outline logo usage rules

2. **Use Identity Preservation**
   - Include brand reference images
   - Provide logo in all requests
   - Maintain color palette strictly

3. **Iterate and Refine**
   - Generate initial assets
   - Check consistency
   - Refine as needed
   - Validate final outputs
