  status: "SUCCESS" | "FAILED" | "PARTIAL" | "NEEDS_VERIFICATION"

  post_info:
    platform: string
    post_title: string
    post_author: string

  comment:
    text: string  # What was posted
    char_count: int
    timestamp: string

      - attempt: 1
        action: string
        result: string

  error:  # If failed
    type: string
    message: string
    recoverable: boolean
```

## Primary Workflow

### Phase 1: Navigate to Post (if needed)

```
If post_identifier.type != "current_screen":
  1. Navigate to the specified post
     (Use appropriate navigation based on identifier type)

  2. Verify correct post
     - Check title/author matches expected

  3. Wait for post to fully load
     → smart_wait(timeout=3)
```

### Phase 2: Locate Comment Input

```
Platform-specific patterns:

Threads:
  - Look for comment icon or "Reply" text
  - Click to open comment input
  → find_and_click(text="Reply") OR find_and_click(resource_id="comment_button")

Instagram:
  - Tap comment icon
  - Input field appears at bottom
  → find_and_click(description="Comment")

WeChat:
  - Scroll to comment section
  - Look for input field or "写留言"
  → find_and_click(text="写留言")

X/Twitter:
  - Look for "Reply" or comment icon
  → find_and_click(text="Reply")

YouTube:
  - Look for "Add a comment" field
  → find_and_click(text="Add a comment")
```

### Phase 3: Enter Comment Text

```
1. Ensure input field is focused
   - May need to tap input field first
   → find_and_click(text="Add a comment") OR tap on visible input

2. Wait for keyboard to appear
   → smart_wait(timeout=2)

3. Enter comment text (Unicode supported via DeviceKit)
   → type_and_submit(text=comment_text, submit=false)

4. Verify text was entered correctly
   - Get current input field content
   - Compare with expected text
```

### Phase 4: Submit Comment

```
1. Locate submit button
   Platform patterns:
   - Threads/Instagram: "Post" or arrow icon
   - WeChat: "发送" or checkmark
   - X/Twitter: "Reply" or "Post"
   - YouTube: Paper airplane or "Comment"

2. Submit the comment
   → find_and_click(text="Post") OR find_and_click(text="发送")

3. Wait for submission
   → smart_wait(timeout=5)

4. Check for errors:
   - "Comment failed" messages
   - Network error dialogs
   - Character limit warnings
   - Content policy violations
```

### Phase 5: Verify Comment Posted

```
Verification methods (try in order):

Method 1: Element Search
  - Look for comment text in comment section
  → scroll_and_find(text=comment_text[:30])  # First 30 chars
  - If found: VERIFIED

Method 2: Author Match
  - Look for "You" or user's name near comment
  - Check timestamp shows "just now" or similar

Method 3: Visual Verification
  - Take screenshot
  - Confirm comment visible
  → mobile_save_screenshot(saveTo="outputs/.../evidence.png")

Method 4: Post-Submit UI
  - Some platforms show "Comment posted" toast
  - Input field clears after success
```

### Phase 6: Handle Failures

```
If submission failed:
  1. Identify error type:
     - Network error: retry after wait
     - Content violation: cannot retry, report to user
     - Rate limit: wait longer, then retry
     - Login expired: cannot retry, report to user

  2. If retry_on_failure and retries < max_retries:
     - Wait 2-5 seconds
     - Attempt again from Phase 3

  3. If exhausted retries:
     - Report failure with details
     - Capture screenshot of error state
```

### Phase 7: Report Result

```
Compile posting_result with:
  - Final status
  - Evidence screenshot (if take_evidence=true)
  - Attempt history
  - Any error details
```

## Heuristics

### Comment Input Detection

| Platform | Input Field Identifiers |
|----------|------------------------|
| Threads | "Add a comment", "Write a comment" |
| Instagram | "Add a comment...", placeholder text |
| WeChat | "写留言", "发表留言" |
| Weibo | "说点什么", "写评论" |
| X/Twitter | "Tweet your reply", "Add a comment" |
| YouTube | "Add a comment...", "Add a public comment" |

### Submit Button Detection

| Platform | Submit Button Text/ID |
|----------|----------------------|
| Threads | "Post", send arrow |
| Instagram | "Post", blue arrow |
| WeChat | "发送", checkmark |
| Weibo | "发送", "发布" |
| X/Twitter | "Reply", "Post" |
| YouTube | Send icon (paper airplane) |

### Success Indicators

| Indicator | Confidence |
|-----------|------------|
| Comment visible with your username | High |
| "Comment posted" toast | High |
| Input field cleared | Medium |
| Timestamp shows "now" / "刚刚" | Medium |
| Screen returned to post view | Low (might be success or failure) |

### Failure Indicators

| Indicator | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| "Comment failed" / "发送失败" | Submission error |
| "Try again" button | Temporary failure |
| "Content violates..." | Policy rejection |
| "Log in to comment" | Session expired |
| "Comments are turned off" | Post disabled comments |
| "Too many comments" | Rate limited |
| Input field still has text | Submission didn't complete |

## Failure Modes & Recovery

### 1. Input Field Not Found

**Symptom:** Can't locate comment input area.

**Recovery:**
- Try scrolling to reveal comment section
- Check if comments are disabled on this post
- Try alternative input selectors
- Report: "Comment input not found, comments may be disabled"

### 2. Text Input Fails

**Symptom:** Comment text doesn't appear in field.

**Recovery:**
- Ensure input field is focused (tap again)
- Check if keyboard is active
- Try clearing and re-entering
- Verify DeviceKit APK is installed for Unicode

### 3. Submit Button Unresponsive

**Symptom:** Tapping submit does nothing.

**Recovery:**
- Ensure comment field has text
- Check for validation errors (character limit)
- Try keyboard "Enter" key as alternative
- Wait and retry

### 4. Content Policy Rejection

**Symptom:** "Your comment couldn't be posted" or similar.

**Recovery:**
- Cannot retry with same text
- Report specific rejection reason if shown
- Suggest user modify comment content
- Do NOT auto-modify the comment

### 5. Rate Limiting

**Symptom:** "Wait before commenting again" or similar.

**Recovery:**
- Wait 30-60 seconds
- Retry if within retry budget
- Report if still blocked

### 6. Comment Requires Approval

**Symptom:** "Comment submitted for review" or doesn't appear immediately.

**Recovery:**
- Status: "PARTIAL" (posted but not verified)
- Note that approval is pending
- Screenshot confirmation message

### 7. Network Error During Submit

**Symptom:** Timeout or connection error.

**Recovery:**
- Check if comment was partially saved (draft)
- Retry submission
- Verify network connectivity

## Tooling (MCP)

### Primary Tools

| Tool | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| `find_and_click` | Navigate to post, tap comment input, submit |
| `type_and_submit` | Enter comment text |
| `smart_wait` | Wait for UI state changes |
| `navigate_back` | Return after posting |

### Secondary Tools

| Tool | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| `mobile_list_elements_on_screen` | Find input field, submit button |
| `mobile_type_keys` | Direct text input if type_and_submit fails |
| `scroll_and_find` | Locate comment section, verify posted |
| `mobile_save_screenshot` | Capture evidence |
| `dismiss_popup` | Handle unexpected dialogs |

### Unicode Input Requirements

```
For Chinese/Japanese/Korean text:
- DeviceKit APK must be installed
- Use: mobile_type_keys with DeviceKit active

If DeviceKit not available:
- Report limitation
- Suggest user install DeviceKit
- Cannot post Unicode comments via MCP
```

## Key Reminders

1. **Pre-composed comment only** - Don't generate content, just post it
2. **Verify before claiming success** - Actually find the posted comment
3. **Capture evidence** - Screenshot is proof of action
4. **Handle Unicode properly** - Ensure DeviceKit installed for CJK text
5. **Report approval pending** - WeChat comments often need approval
6. **Don't auto-retry policy failures** - These won't succeed with same text
7. **Platform-specific flows** - Each platform has different posting UI
8. **Clear error reporting** - User needs to know exactly what went wrong
