# Social Media Skill

## Mindset

```
You are EXPLORING, not scripting.

UIs change constantly. Observe → Think → Act → Verify.
When blocked, try alternatives. Trust your judgment.
```

## Tool Priority

1. `mobile_list_elements_on_screen` - Get clickable elements with coordinates
2. `mobile_take_screenshot` - Visual verification when elements unclear
3. MCP tools for actions, Python fallback if needed

## Think Like a User

**What would a human do?**

To like → find heart icon → tap
To comment → find bubble → tap → type → send
To search → find magnifying glass → tap → type → submit
To message → find chat/inbox → select contact → type → send
To follow → go to profile → tap follow button

**Icons are universal:**
- Heart/Thumbs = Like
- Bubble = Comment
- Paper plane/Arrow = Share/Send
- Magnifying glass = Search
- Bookmark = Save
- ≡ = Menu
- ⋮ = More options

## Browsing & Exploration

**One screen is never enough.** When browsing feeds, search results, profiles, or any content list:

1. **Scroll naturally** - Swipe up 3-5 times, let content load
2. **Tap into content** - Open posts/articles to see full text, images, comments
3. **Navigate back** - Return to list and continue browsing
4. **Repeat** - Browse multiple items before concluding

**Applies to:**
- Search results (keywords, hashtags, topics)
- User profiles (viewing someone's posts)
- Feeds and timelines
- Comments and replies
- Product reviews
- News articles
- Any scrollable content list

**Browsing workflow:**
```
Open list/feed → Scroll → Open item 1 → Read → Back
→ Scroll → Open item 2 → Read → Back
→ ... (continue exploring)
→ Report findings or complete task
```

**How much to browse:**
- Quick check: 3-5 items
- Research/summary task: 5-10+ items
- Comprehensive analysis: scroll until content repeats

**Don't be robotic:**
- Skip obvious ads or irrelevant content
- Spend more time on interesting items
- Follow your judgment like a real user would

## Adaptive Approach

**Element not where expected?**
→ Scroll to reveal, wait for loading, try screenshot, find alternative path

**Action failed?**
→ Tap center of bounds, check for overlay, try long-press, retry once

**Unknown app?**
→ Map all elements, find universal patterns, proceed with what exists

**3+ failures?**
→ Stop, reassess, try different approach or report to user

## Dating Apps

```
Right swipe / Heart = Like
Left swipe / X = Pass
Tap buttons if swipe unreliable
Handle match popup → continue or message
```

## Obstacles

| Issue | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Login required | Report to user |
| Ads/Popups | Find X/Skip/Close |
| Permissions | Allow if needed |
| CAPTCHA | Report to user |

## References

Load when needed:
- `references/package-names.md`
- `references/ui-common.md`
- `references/ui-{platform}.md` (instagram, threads, facebook, line, wechat, x-twitter, telegram, tiktok, youtube, dating, etc.)
