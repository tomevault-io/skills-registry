## Workflow Guidelines

### Initial Assessment

When receiving a Flutter development request:

1. **Identify the primary concern** (UI, state, navigation, platform-specific, theming, performance)
2. **Determine which reference(s) to load** based on the request
3. **Consider cross-cutting concerns** (accessibility, performance, platform differences)
4. **Ask clarifying questions** if requirements are ambiguous

### Reference Loading Strategy

Load reference documentation as needed rather than all at once:

- **Single focus requests**: Load one reference file
- **Complex requests**: Load multiple references progressively
- **Performance concerns**: Always consider loading `performance_optimization.md`
- **UI requests**: Consider if `adhd_friendly_ui.md` applies for better accessibility

### Implementation Approach

Follow these principles when implementing solutions:

1. **Start with current Flutter best practices** (Flutter 3.x, Dart 3.x)
2. **Use Material 3** unless Material 2 is explicitly required
3. **Apply const constructors** wherever possible
4. **Consider performance implications** from the start
5. **Think multi-platform** unless single platform specified
6. **Prioritize accessibility** and inclusive design
7. **Write testable code** with clear separation of concerns
8. **Follow widget composition best practices** (small, focused widgets)

### Code Quality Standards

Ensure all generated code:
- Uses modern Flutter/Dart syntax (null safety, pattern matching, records)
- Follows official Dart style guide
- Includes necessary imports
- Uses meaningful variable and widget names
- Has appropriate const constructors
- Disposes resources properly (controllers, streams, listeners)
- Handles errors gracefully
- Is testable

## Examples

### Example 1: ADHD-Friendly Task Manager

**Request:** "Build a task management screen with ADHD-friendly UI"

**Approach:**
1. Load `references/adhd_friendly_ui.md`
2. Implement card-based layout for discrete information chunks
3. Use clear visual hierarchy with Material 3 typography
4. Provide immediate feedback for all actions
5. Include progress indicators for multi-step tasks
6. Apply simplified navigation patterns
7. Consider focus mode for distraction-free work

### Example 2: Authentication with Bloc

**Request:** "Implement authentication flow with Bloc"

**Approach:**
1. Load `references/state_management.md`
2. Create sealed classes for auth states (Initial, Loading, Authenticated, Unauthenticated, Error)
3. Define auth events (Login, Logout, CheckAuth)
4. Implement AuthBloc with proper event handlers
5. Use BlocListener for navigation side effects
6. Use BlocBuilder for UI rendering
7. Add proper error handling

### Example 3: Multi-Platform App

**Request:** "Create an app that works on iOS, Android, and Web"

**Approach:**
1. Load `references/platform_specific.md` and `references/navigation_routing.md`
2. Set up go_router with web-friendly URLs
3. Implement adaptive widgets for iOS/Android differences
4. Handle platform-specific features (permissions, deep linking)
5. Create responsive layouts for different screen sizes
6. Test on all target platforms

### Example 4: Performance Optimization

**Request:** "This list is laggy with many images"

**Approach:**
1. Load `references/performance_optimization.md`
2. Profile with Flutter DevTools to identify bottlenecks
3. Switch to ListView.builder if not already using it
4. Add itemExtent for fixed-height items
5. Implement image caching with cached_network_image
6. Use cacheWidth/cacheHeight to decode images at appropriate size
7. Add RepaintBoundary if needed
8. Extract static widgets to prevent unnecessary rebuilds

## Additional Notes

- **Stay Current**: Follow Flutter's official blog and release notes for latest features
- **Test Thoroughly**: Always test on target platforms (physical devices when possible)
- **Consider Accessibility**: Use Semantics widgets and test with screen readers
- **Document Decisions**: Explain why specific patterns or approaches are chosen
- **Performance First**: Consider performance implications from the start, not as an afterthought
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with core functionality, add enhancements progressively
