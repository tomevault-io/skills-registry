# Commit Analysis for Problem Pattern Detection

This skill provides techniques for analyzing git commits to identify bug fix patterns, extract root causes, and detect similar issues in code changes.

## Purpose

Commit analysis transforms raw git history into actionable insights by:

- Identifying which commits represent bug fixes vs. features
- Extracting problem patterns from fix commits
- Understanding root causes from code changes
- Detecting similar patterns in new code changes
- Building knowledge bases from historical fixes

## Commit Identification Strategy

### Two-Stage Filtering

Use a two-stage approach to identify fix-related commits:

**Stage 1: Shell-based filtering**
- Fast, deterministic filtering using commit message patterns
- Excludes obvious non-fix commits (feat, docs, chore, style, refactor, test, build, ci, perf)
- Includes commits with fix-related keywords if configured

**Stage 2: AI analysis**
- Analyze commit messages and diffs to confirm actual fixes
- Distinguish between bug fixes, workarounds, and refactorings
- Identify root cause from changes made

### Conventional Commit Pattern Recognition

Parse conventional commit format: `type(scope): subject`

**Common fix types**:
- `fix:` - Bug fixes
- `bugfix:` - Explicit bug fixes
- `hotfix:` - Urgent production fixes
- `patch:` - Small fixes
- `revert:` - Reverting broken changes
- `security:` - Security fixes

**Exclude types** (not fixes):
- `feat:` - New features
- `docs:` - Documentation
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks
- `style:` - Formatting, no logic change
- `refactor:` - Code restructuring, no behavior change
- `test:` - Test additions
- `build:` - Build system changes
- `ci:` - CI/CD configuration
- `perf:` - Performance improvements (not fixes)

### Keyword-Based Detection

When commit messages don't follow conventional format, look for keywords:

**Strong fix indicators**:
- fix, fixes, fixed, fixing
- bug, bugfix
- issue, resolve, resolves, resolved
- hotfix, patch
- crash, error, failure
- broken, break

**Context-dependent indicators**:
- handle, prevent (may indicate defensive coding, not necessarily fixing existing bug)
- improve, update (could be enhancement or fix)
- correct, adjust (likely fixes)

**AI analysis needed**: When keywords are ambiguous, examine the diff to determine if it's fixing existing broken behavior or adding new functionality.

## Commit Diff Analysis

### Structure of Analysis

For each commit identified as potential fix, analyze:

1. **Files changed**: Which modules/components affected
2. **Code patterns**: What types of changes made
3. **Logic changes**: What behavior was modified
4. **Test changes**: What test coverage was added

### Identifying Root Cause from Diff

#### Added Validation or Bounds Checking

**Pattern**: New `if` statements, assertions, or checks added

```diff
+ if (index < 0 || index >= array.length) {
+     throw new Error("Index out of bounds");
+ }
  return array[index];
```

**Root cause**: Missing input validation or boundary check

#### Fixed Null/Undefined Handling

**Pattern**: Added null checks, optional chaining, or default values

```diff
- const name = user.profile.name;
+ const name = user?.profile?.name ?? "Unknown";
```

**Root cause**: Null pointer/undefined access

#### Corrected Logic or Algorithm

**Pattern**: Changed comparison operators, loop conditions, or calculations

```diff
- if (count > threshold) {
+ if (count >= threshold) {
```

**Root cause**: Logic error, off-by-one error

#### Added Synchronization or Locking

**Pattern**: Added mutexes, locks, or atomic operations

```diff
+ mutex.lock();
  shared_resource.update();
+ mutex.unlock();
```

**Root cause**: Race condition or concurrency issue

#### Fixed Error Handling

**Pattern**: Added try-catch, error checking, or improved error propagation

```diff
  try {
      perform_operation();
+ } catch (SpecificError e) {
+     handle_error(e);
+     throw new UserFriendlyError("Operation failed");
  }
```

**Root cause**: Missing or inadequate error handling

#### Corrected API Usage

**Pattern**: Changed function calls, parameter order, or API contracts

```diff
- api.call(data, callback, options);
+ api.call(data, options, callback);
```

**Root cause**: API misuse or misunderstanding

#### Fixed Resource Management

**Pattern**: Added resource cleanup, close operations, or lifecycle management

```diff
  const file = open(path);
  process(file);
+ file.close();
```

**Root cause**: Resource leak

## Pattern Detection

### Common Problem Patterns

Identify recurring patterns across fix commits:

#### 1. Input Validation Issues
**Symptoms**:
- Added bounds checking
- Added type validation
- Added format verification

**Pattern signature**:
```python
# Check for additions like:
if not validate_input(x):
    raise ValueError()
```

#### 2. Null/None Safety Issues
**Symptoms**:
- Added null checks
- Added default values
- Changed to safe navigation

**Pattern signature**:
```python
# Check for changes like:
obj?.property  # Optional chaining
value ?? default  # Nullish coalescing
```

#### 3. Race Conditions
**Symptoms**:
- Added locks or mutexes
- Changed to atomic operations
- Added synchronization

**Pattern signature**:
```python
# Check for additions like:
with lock:
    shared_state.update()
```

#### 4. Off-by-One Errors
**Symptoms**:
- Changed `<` to `<=` or vice versa
- Changed `+1` to `+0` or vice versa
- Changed loop bounds

**Pattern signature**:
```diff
- for i in range(len(array)):
+ for i in range(len(array) - 1):
```

#### 5. Error Handling Gaps
**Symptoms**:
- Added try-catch blocks
- Added error checking after operations
- Improved error messages

**Pattern signature**:
```python
# Check for additions like:
try:
    operation()
except Exception as e:
    handle_error(e)
```

## Merge Commit Analysis

Merge commits require special handling to identify conflict resolutions.

### Detecting Merge-Related Fixes

**Indicators of conflict resolution issues**:
- Merge commit contains logic changes (not just combining changes)
- Subsequent fix commit shortly after merge
- Fix affects files that were merged

### Analyzing Merge Conflicts

Use git tools to examine merge conflict resolution:

```bash
# Show what was changed in merge compared to parents
git show <merge-commit> --cc

# See which files had conflicts
git show <merge-commit> --name-only
```

**Look for**:
- Logic that combines both parents incorrectly
- Missing code from one parent
- Incorrect conflict resolution choices
- Broken integrations between merged features

## Similarity Detection

### Comparing Code Changes

To detect if new changes match known problem patterns:

#### File Path Similarity
- **Exact match**: Same file modified = High risk
- **Same directory**: Related files = Medium risk
- **Same module**: Same component = Low-medium risk
- **Different area**: Unrelated = Low risk

#### Code Structure Similarity
Analyze AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) or code patterns:
- Same function names or signatures
- Similar variable names
- Similar control flow structures
- Same API usage patterns

#### Keyword Similarity
Extract keywords from postmortem and compare with new changes:
- Technical terms (array, index, token, validation)
- Operation verbs (check, validate, parse, handle)
- Problem indicators (null, race, leak, overflow)

### Risk Scoring

Combine similarity metrics:

```python
risk_score = (
    file_similarity * 0.4 +
    pattern_similarity * 0.3 +
    keyword_similarity * 0.3
)

if risk_score > 0.8:
    risk_level = "critical"
elif risk_score > 0.6:
    risk_level = "high"
elif risk_score > 0.4:
    risk_level = "medium"
else:
    risk_level = "low"
```

## Batch Analysis Strategy

For analyzing many commits (during initialization):

### Batch Size
- Process 10-20 commits per batch
- Prevents context overflow
- Allows for comprehensive analysis of each commit

### Batch Processing Steps

1. **Extract commit metadata**: Use `commit-filter.sh` to get candidate commits
2. **Batch commits**: Group into batches of 10-20
3. **Analyze each batch**:
   - For each commit: Get diff, message, files changed
   - Determine if it's a fix (AI analysis)
   - If fix: Extract problem pattern, root cause
   - Generate postmortem draft
4. **Save results**: Write postmortem documents
5. **Update index**: Maintain searchable index

### Incremental Updates

For ongoing updates:
- Track last analyzed commit hash in index
- Only analyze commits since last update
- Merge or update existing postmortems if new information found

## Git Helper Utilities

Use provided scripts for common operations:

### Get Commit Info
```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/git-helpers.sh get_commit_info <commit-hash>
```

Returns JSON with commit metadata.

### Get Commit Diff
```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/git-helpers.sh get_commit_diff <commit-hash> --full
```

Options: `--stat`, `--name-only`, `--full`

### Filter Commits
```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/commit-filter.sh \
  --include-keywords "fix,bug,hotfix" \
  --since 6.months.ago \
  --format json
```

Returns filtered commit list.

## Analysis Workflow

### For Postmortem Generation

1. **Identify commit**: Get commit hash from user or filter output
2. **Gather information**:
   ```bash
   info=$(git-helpers.sh get_commit_info $commit)
   diff=$(git-helpers.sh get_commit_diff $commit --full)
   ```
3. **Analyze diff**: Identify pattern from changes (see "Identifying Root Cause from Diff")
4. **Determine severity**: Based on impact and scope
5. **Extract tags**: From commit message, files, and patterns
6. **Generate postmortem**: Use template and fill sections
7. **Validate**: Ensure all sections complete and actionable

### For Risk Analysis

1. **Get current changes**:
   ```bash
   git diff  # For uncommitted changes
   git show <commit>  # For specific commit
   ```
2. **Load postmortem index**: Read all existing postmortems
3. **Calculate similarity**:
   - File path matching
   - Code pattern matching
   - Keyword matching
4. **Score risk**: Combine similarity metrics
5. **Report findings**: List matching postmortems with risk levels

## Common Analysis Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Confusing Refactoring with Fixes
Not every code change is a fix. Refactoring improves structure without changing behavior.

**Fix indicators**:
- Adds validation that was missing
- Changes logic that was incorrect
- Handles errors that were unhandled

**Refactoring indicators**:
- Renames for clarity
- Extracts functions
- Improves structure without logic changes

### Mistake 2: Missing Root Cause
Don't stop at surface symptom.

**Surface**: "Added null check"
**Root cause**: "Function assumed input was always non-null because it was only called from one location, but new caller can pass null"

### Mistake 3: Overmatching
Not every change to authentication code is the same issue.

**Be specific**: Match specific patterns, not just file paths.

### Mistake 4: Ignoring Test Changes
Test additions reveal what edge cases were missed.

**Analyze tests**: They document the bug better than the fix sometimes.

## Key Principles

1. **Two-stage filtering**: Shell first (fast), then AI (accurate)
2. **Root cause focus**: Go beyond surface changes to understand why
3. **Pattern recognition**: Look for recurring structures across fixes
4. **Similarity metrics**: Combine multiple signals for risk detection
5. **Batch processing**: Handle large histories efficiently
6. **Incremental updates**: Only analyze new commits

Apply these techniques to transform git history into actionable knowledge for preventing code regression.
