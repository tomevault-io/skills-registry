# Postmortem Writing for Code Issues

This skill provides guidance for writing effective postmortem documents that learn from code fixes and prevent future regressions.

## Purpose

Postmortem documents serve as a knowledge base for preventing code regression in AI-assisted development. Each postmortem analyzes a bug fix to extract:

- What went wrong and why
- How it was fixed
- What patterns to watch for
- How to prevent similar issues systematically

**Blameless principle**: Focus on learning and prevention, not blame. Never include author attribution.

## Document Structure

Postmortem documents follow a standard structure with YAML frontmatter and markdown sections.

### YAML Frontmatter

Required metadata fields:

```yaml
---
commit: abc123def456           # Full commit hash
date: 2026-01-13              # Commit date (YYYY-MM-DD)
severity: medium              # low, medium, high, critical
tags: [authentication, race-condition]  # Descriptive tags
files_changed: 5              # Number of files modified
related_commits: []           # Related fix commits (hashes)
---
```

**Severity levels**:
- **critical**: System crash, data loss, security breach
- **high**: Core functionality broken, widespread impact
- **medium**: Feature broken, workaround available
- **low**: Minor issue, edge case, cosmetic problem

**Tags**: Use descriptive, searchable tags for categorization:
- Component/module names: `authentication`, `database`, `api`
- Problem types: `race-condition`, `null-pointer`, `memory-leak`
- Technologies: `postgres`, `redis`, `react`
- Patterns: `boundary-check`, `input-validation`, `error-handling`

### Markdown Sections

Each postmortem includes these sections in order:

#### 1. Title

Format: `# Postmortem: [Brief Description]`

Use imperative form and be specific:
- Good: `Fix null pointer in user authentication flow`
- Good: `Resolve race condition in cache invalidation`
- Avoid: `Bug fix`
- Avoid: `Update code`

#### 2. Problem Summary

Describe the observable symptom and broken functionality.

**What to include**:
- What was the user-visible problem?
- What functionality was broken or degraded?
- Under what conditions did it occur?

**Keep it concise**: 2-3 sentences maximum.

**Example**:
```markdown
## Problem Summary

Users were unable to log in after password reset. The authentication
service returned a 500 error when validating reset tokens. This affected
all users who attempted password reset between 2026-01-10 and 2026-01-12.
```

#### 3. Root Cause Analysis

Explain WHY the problem occurred, not just what was wrong.

**Structure**:
```markdown
## Root Cause Analysis

**Root cause category**: [Logic Error | Missing Validation | Race Condition |
Architecture Flaw | Dependency Issue | Configuration Error | Other]

**Why it happened**:
- [Primary reason - dig deep, not surface]
- [Contributing factors]
- [Missed edge cases or incorrect assumptions]
```

**Go beyond surface symptoms**: Identify the underlying cause, not just the immediate trigger.

**Good analysis**:
```markdown
**Root cause category**: Logic Error

**Why it happened**:
- Token validation logic assumed tokens were always 32 characters
- Password reset flow generates 64-character tokens
- No length validation on token input
- Original implementation only supported session tokens (32 chars)
```

**Poor analysis**:
```markdown
**Why it happened**:
- The code had a bug
- Token check failed
```

#### 4. Code Changes

Describe what was modified to fix the issue.

**Structure**:
```markdown
## Code Changes

**Modified files**:
[List files with change summary]

**Key logic changes**:
- [Describe algorithmic or logical changes]
- [What was added, removed, or refactored]

**API/Interface changes**:
- [Function signature changes]
- [Data structure modifications]
- [Impact on callers or dependencies]
```

**Be specific**: Mention actual file names, function names, and logic changes.

**Example**:
```markdown
## Code Changes

**Modified files**:
- `src/auth/token_validator.py`: Updated validation logic
- `tests/auth/test_token_validation.py`: Added test cases

**Key logic changes**:
- Removed hardcoded 32-character length check
- Added flexible token length validation (16-128 chars)
- Improved error messages to distinguish token types

**API/Interface changes**:
- `validate_token()` now accepts optional `token_type` parameter
- Return value includes token type for better error handling
```

#### 5. Risk Pattern

Identify patterns to watch for in future changes.

**Structure**:
```markdown
## Risk Pattern

**File/module risk**:
- Files: [Specific files prone to similar issues]
- Modules: [Components or services]

**Code pattern risk**:
- [Vulnerable code structures or patterns]
- [Common mistakes in this area]

**Common mistake**:
- [What assumption led to this bug]
- [What developers might miss]
```

**Make it actionable**: Describe patterns that can be detected in code changes.

**Example**:
```markdown
## Risk Pattern

**File/module risk**:
- Files: `src/auth/*.py`, especially token handling
- Modules: Authentication service, session management

**Code pattern risk**:
- Fixed-length string assumptions without validation
- Token handling without type checking
- String operations assuming specific formats

**Common mistake**:
- Assuming all tokens have the same format
- Not validating token length before operations
- Forgetting that token formats evolve over time
```

#### 6. Prevention Strategy

Focus on automation and systematic prevention.

**Critical**: This section should emphasize **automation without human intervention**, not manual processes.

**Structure**:
```markdown
## Prevention Strategy

### Automated Testing
- [ ] [Specific test case with input/expected behavior]
- [ ] [Integration test scenario]
- [ ] [Recommend test framework]

### AI Coding Context
- **When to load**: [Specific trigger for loading this postmortem]
- **What to load**:
  - [ ] [This postmortem document]
  - [ ] [Related postmortems]
  - [ ] [Architecture docs]
- **Context strategy**: [What AI should pay attention to]

### Automation Hooks
- **Pre-commit checks**: [Linter rules, static analysis]
- **CI/CD checks**: [Build-time validation]
- **Claude Code hooks** (future): [PreToolUse/PostToolUse recommendations]

### Code Review Checklist
- [ ] [Specific review item]
- [ ] [Second item]
```

**Automated Testing**:
- Describe specific test cases to add
- Include edge cases and boundary conditions
- Recommend test types (unit, integration, property-based)

**AI Coding Context**:
- Specify WHEN to load context (what triggers it)
- List WHAT context to load (files, docs, postmortems)
- Explain HOW AI should use the context

**Example**:
```markdown
### Automated Testing
- [ ] Test tokens of various lengths: 16, 32, 64, 128 characters
- [ ] Test invalid token formats (empty, too short, too long)
- [ ] Test mixed token types in same session
- [ ] Property-based testing: generate random valid tokens

### AI Coding Context
- **When to load**: When modifying `src/auth/*.py` or token-related code
- **What to load**:
  - [ ] This postmortem (token length assumptions)
  - [ ] `docs/auth/token-formats.md` (token specifications)
  - [ ] Related postmortem: `2026-01-05-xyz789-session-token-expiry.md`
- **Context strategy**: Verify no fixed-length assumptions in new code. Check all string operations for token length validation.

### Automation Hooks
- **Pre-commit checks**:
  - [ ] Linter rule: Flag hardcoded length checks on token strings
  - [ ] Static analysis: Detect string operations without length validation
- **CI/CD checks**:
  - [ ] Run token validation test suite on all auth changes
  - [ ] Property-based tests must pass
```

#### 7. Related Issues

Connect to related problems and areas.

**Structure**:
```markdown
## Related Issues

**Similar commits**:
- [Commit hash]: [Brief description]

**Potential problem areas**:
- [Files or modules that might have same pattern]

**Follow-up work**:
- [ ] [Additional hardening needed]
- [ ] [Documentation updates]
```

#### 8. Technical Context

Provide technical background for understanding the issue.

**Structure**:
```markdown
## Technical Context

**Affected components**:
- [Service/module/layer affected]

**Dependencies**:
- [External libraries, services, systems]

**Testing challenges**:
- [Why this was hard to catch]
- [How testing was improved]

**Additional notes**:
- [Other relevant context]
```

## Writing Guidelines

### Use Clear, Technical Language

Write for developers who will read this months or years later.

**Good**:
```markdown
The authentication service validated tokens using a fixed-length
comparison, assuming all tokens were 32 characters. When password
reset tokens (64 characters) were introduced, the validation logic
failed silently.
```

**Bad**:
```markdown
There was a problem with the token thing. The code didn't work right
for some tokens.
```

### Focus on "Why", Not Just "What"

Explain reasoning and assumptions, not just symptoms.

**Good**:
```markdown
The original implementation assumed all tokens came from the session
service, which always generates 32-character tokens. The password reset
service was added later and generates longer tokens for security, but
the validation logic was never updated.
```

**Bad**:
```markdown
The token was the wrong length and failed validation.
```

### Be Specific About Prevention

Provide actionable, automatable prevention strategies.

**Good**:
```markdown
### Automated Testing
- [ ] Add property-based test: generate tokens of length 16-128, verify all validate correctly
- [ ] Add integration test: complete password reset flow with token validation
- [ ] Test framework: Use hypothesis for property-based testing
```

**Bad**:
```markdown
### Prevention
- Write tests
- Be careful with tokens
- Review code carefully
```

### Use Imperative Form

Write instructions, not descriptions.

**Good**: "Add test cases for token length validation"
**Bad**: "We should add test cases" or "You should add test cases"

## Severity Assessment

Assign severity based on impact and scope.

### Critical
- System crash or unavailability
- Data loss or corruption
- Security breach or vulnerability
- Complete feature failure affecting all users

**Example**: Database connection leak causing service crash

### High
- Core functionality broken for many users
- Data inconsistency (but not loss)
- Performance degradation (>10x slower)
- Authentication or authorization failure

**Example**: Users unable to log in after password reset

### Medium
- Feature broken for some users
- Workaround available
- Minor data inconsistency
- Performance degradation (2-10x slower)

**Example**: Export function fails for files >10MB

### Low
- Edge case or rare condition
- Minor UI issue
- Cosmetic problem
- Only affects specific configurations

**Example**: Button alignment off by 2px on mobile

## Tag Selection

Use consistent, searchable tags.

### Component Tags
Technical components affected: `authentication`, `database`, `api`, `frontend`, `cache`

### Problem Type Tags
Nature of the issue: `race-condition`, `null-pointer`, `memory-leak`, `deadlock`, `off-by-one`

### Technology Tags
Specific technologies: `postgres`, `redis`, `react`, `python`, `docker`

### Pattern Tags
Code patterns: `boundary-check`, `input-validation`, `error-handling`, `concurrency`, `resource-management`

**Example tag set**:
```yaml
tags: [authentication, password-reset, input-validation, string-handling]
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Blame or Attribution
❌ Don't identify who wrote the buggy code
❌ Don't criticize individuals or decisions
✅ Focus on what happened and how to prevent it

### Mistake 2: Surface-Level Analysis
❌ "The bug was in line 42"
❌ "The code was wrong"
✅ Explain why the code was written that way
✅ Identify assumptions that proved incorrect

### Mistake 3: Vague Prevention
❌ "Write better tests"
❌ "Be more careful"
✅ Specific test cases to add
✅ Concrete automation strategies

### Mistake 4: Manual Prevention Focus
❌ "Developers should remember to check token length"
❌ "Reviewers should watch for this pattern"
✅ Linter rules to catch the pattern
✅ Tests that fail if pattern recurs

## Template Usage

Generate initial postmortem template using:

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/postmortem-template.sh <commit-hash> output.md
```

This creates a structured template with commit metadata populated. Fill in the analysis and prevention sections.

## Key Principles

1. **Blameless**: Focus on learning, not blame
2. **Root cause**: Go beyond symptoms to understand why
3. **Actionable**: Prevention strategies must be specific and automatable
4. **Searchable**: Use clear tags and structure for future discovery
5. **Complete**: Include all context needed to understand the issue
6. **English**: Write all content in English for consistency

Follow these guidelines to create postmortem documents that effectively prevent regression and build a valuable knowledge base for AI-assisted development.
