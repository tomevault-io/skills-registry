# AWS Elastic Beanstalk Documentation (EB CLI)

Provide documentation, best practices, and reference information for Elastic Beanstalk using the EB CLI.

## When to Use

- User asks "how do I..." regarding Elastic Beanstalk
- User wants best practices or recommendations
- User needs platform-specific guidance
- User asks about EB concepts or architecture

## When NOT to Use

- Performing EB CLI operations → use the dedicated skills (`deploy`, `status`, `logs`, `config`, `environment`, `app`, `maintenance`)
- Diagnosing issues → use `troubleshoot` skill
- AWS infrastructure (SSL, domains, secrets, DB, security, monitoring, costs) → use `eb-infra` skill

## Platform Best Practices

> For full platform details (all 8 platforms including configuration, examples, and comparison), see the [Platforms Reference](../_shared/references/platforms.md).

### Node.js
```
Project Structure:
├── package.json          # Required: dependencies & scripts
├── .npmrc                # Optional: npm configuration
├── Procfile              # Optional: custom start command
├── .ebignore             # Optional: files to exclude
└── .ebextensions/        # Optional: EB configuration

Key Settings:
- NODE_ENV=production
- npm start should work
- Listen on process.env.PORT (default: 8080)
```

### Python
```
Project Structure:
├── requirements.txt      # Required: pip dependencies
├── application.py        # WSGI application
├── Procfile             # Optional: custom command
├── .ebignore            # Optional: files to exclude
└── .ebextensions/       # Optional: EB configuration

Key Settings:
- WSGIPath: application:application
- NumProcesses, NumThreads for scaling
```

### Java
```
Project Structure:
├── target/app.war        # WAR file (Tomcat)
├── target/app.jar        # JAR file (standalone)
├── Procfile             # For JAR: web: java -jar app.jar
└── .ebextensions/       # Optional: EB configuration

Key Settings:
- JVM options via JAVA_OPTS
- Heap size configuration
```

### Docker
```
Project Structure:
├── Dockerfile            # Required for single container
├── docker-compose.yml    # For multi-container
├── .dockerignore        # Exclude files from build
└── .ebextensions/       # Optional: EB configuration

Key Settings:
- Expose port 80 or configure proxy
- Use multi-stage builds for smaller images
```

## .platform/ Directory (AL2 and AL2023)

On Amazon Linux 2 and AL2023, use `.platform/` for hooks and reverse proxy customization:

```
.platform/
├── hooks/                    # Run during deployments & platform updates
│   ├── prebuild/             # Before app build (install dependencies)
│   ├── predeploy/            # After build, before app deploy
│   └── postdeploy/           # After app deploy completes
├── confighooks/              # Run only on configuration changes
│   ├── prebuild/
│   ├── predeploy/
│   └── postdeploy/
└── nginx/
    ├── conf.d/               # Additional nginx config (*.conf)
    └── nginx.conf            # Full nginx config (replaces default)
```

Hook scripts must be executable (`chmod +x`). They run as root.

### Platform Hook Example

```bash
# .platform/hooks/postdeploy/01_restart_service.sh
#!/bin/bash
systemctl restart my-service
```

### Nginx Customization

```
# .platform/nginx/conf.d/client_max_body.conf
client_max_body_size 50M;
```

**Note:** `.ebextensions/` still works on AL2/AL2023 for option_settings and resources, but prefer `.platform/hooks/` over `.ebextensions/` commands/container_commands for lifecycle scripts.

## .ebextensions Examples

### Environment Variables
```yaml
# .ebextensions/env.config
option_settings:
  aws:elasticbeanstalk:application:environment:
    NODE_ENV: production
    LOG_LEVEL: info
```

### Packages
```yaml
# .ebextensions/packages.config
packages:
  yum:
    gcc: []
    make: []
```

### Commands
```yaml
# .ebextensions/commands.config
commands:
  01_create_dir:
    command: mkdir -p /var/app/logs
    ignoreErrors: true
```

### Files
```yaml
# .ebextensions/files.config
files:
  "/etc/nginx/conf.d/proxy.conf":
    mode: "000644"
    owner: root
    group: root
    content: |
      client_max_body_size 20M;
```

## .ebignore File

Create `.ebignore` to exclude files from deployment:
```
# Dependencies
node_modules/
.venv/
__pycache__/

# Build artifacts
dist/
build/
*.pyc

# Local config
.env
.env.local

# IDE
.idea/
.vscode/

# Git
.git/
```

## Experimental & Specialized Commands

### eb labs

Experimental features that may change or be removed in future versions:
```bash
eb labs --help    # List available lab commands
```

**Warning:** Do not rely on `eb labs` commands for production workflows.

### eb migrate (Windows IIS)

Migrates IIS sites from Windows servers to Elastic Beanstalk:
```bash
eb migrate --interactive                       # Interactive migration
eb migrate --sites "Default Web Site" --archive-only  # Archive without deploy
eb migrate explore --verbose                   # List available IIS sites
eb migrate cleanup                             # Clean up migration artifacts
```

Requires IIS 7.0+, Web Deploy 3.6+, and admin privileges. Windows only.

## Security Best Practices

### Environment Variables
- Never commit secrets to source control
- Use AWS Secrets Manager for sensitive values
- Use `eb setenv` for configuration
- Rotate credentials regularly

### IAM
- Use least-privilege instance profiles
- Separate roles for different environments
- Enable MFA for console access

### Network
- Use VPC with private subnets for instances
- Configure security groups restrictively
- Enable HTTPS with SSL certificate

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

**"Environment health has transitioned from Ok to Severe"**
```bash
eb health    # Check health details
eb logs      # View application logs
eb events    # Check recent events
```

**"Deployment failed"**
```bash
eb events    # Check deployment errors
eb logs --all  # Get detailed logs
```

**"502 Bad Gateway"**
1. App not listening on correct port
2. App crashed on startup
3. Health check failing

**"High latency warnings"**
```bash
eb health --refresh  # Monitor metrics
eb scale 3           # Add more instances
```

## Presenting Documentation

When providing documentation:
1. Give direct answers first
2. Include relevant EB CLI commands
3. Link to official docs for more detail
4. Provide context for best practices

Example:
```
To set environment variables in Elastic Beanstalk:

1. Via EB CLI (recommended):
   eb setenv NODE_ENV=production API_KEY=secret

2. Via .ebextensions (committed to repo):
   # .ebextensions/env.config
   option_settings:
     aws:elasticbeanstalk:application:environment:
       NODE_ENV: production

3. View current variables:
   eb printenv

Best Practice: Use Secrets Manager for sensitive values.

See: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/environments-cfg-softwaresettings.html
```

## Composability

- **Deploy code**: Use `deploy` skill
- **Check status & health**: Use `status` skill
- **View logs**: Use `logs` skill
- **Change configuration**: Use `config` skill
- **Troubleshoot issues**: Use `troubleshoot` skill
- **Manage environments**: Use `environment` skill
- **Manage applications**: Use `app` skill
- **Platform updates**: Use `maintenance` skill
- **AWS infrastructure** (SSL, domains, secrets, DB, security, monitoring, costs): Use `eb-infra` skill
