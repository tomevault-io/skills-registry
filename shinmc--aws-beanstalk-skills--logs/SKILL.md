# Logs & Events

Retrieve application logs, stream live logs, enable CloudWatch logging, and view environment events using the EB CLI.

## When to Use

- View application logs
- Stream logs in real time
- Enable CloudWatch log integration
- Check environment events
- Find platform-specific log file paths

## When NOT to Use

- Interpreting errors and fixing issues → use `troubleshoot` skill
- Checking health status → use `status` skill
- Deploying code → use `deploy` skill

---

## Recent Logs

```bash
eb logs
eb logs <env-name>
eb logs --all            # All log files
eb logs --stream         # Stream logs live (Ctrl+C to stop)
eb logs --zip            # Download complete log bundle
eb logs --instance <id>  # Logs from specific instance
eb logs -g <log-group>   # Specific CloudWatch log group
```

## Enable CloudWatch Logs

```bash
eb logs --cloudwatch-logs enable
```

## Environment Events

```bash
eb events
eb events --follow       # Follow events live
```

## Platform-Specific Log Paths (via SSH)

**AL2/AL2023 (current platforms):**
- **Node.js**: `/var/log/web.stdout.log`, `/var/log/web.stderr.log`
- **Python**: `/var/log/web.stdout.log`, `/var/log/web.stderr.log`
- **Docker**: `/var/log/eb-docker/containers/eb-current-app/*.log`
- **Java (Corretto)**: `/var/log/web.stdout.log`, `/var/log/web.stderr.log`
- **Java (Tomcat)**: `/var/log/tomcat/catalina.out`
- **Go**: `/var/log/web.stdout.log`, `/var/log/web.stderr.log`
- **Ruby**: `/var/log/web.stdout.log`, `/var/log/web.stderr.log`
- **PHP**: `/var/log/web.stdout.log`, `/var/log/web.stderr.log`
- **.NET**: `/var/log/web.stdout.log`, `/var/log/web.stderr.log`

**Common EB platform logs:**
- `/var/log/eb-engine.log` — EB deployment engine log
- `/var/log/eb-hooks.log` — Platform hook execution log
- `/var/log/nginx/access.log`, `/var/log/nginx/error.log` — Reverse proxy logs

## Composability

- **Diagnose issues from logs**: Use `troubleshoot` skill
- **Check environment health**: Use `status` skill
- **Deploy code**: Use `deploy` skill
