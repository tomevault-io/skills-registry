# Maintenance

Manage platform updates, restart application servers, and handle managed actions using the EB CLI.

## When to Use

- Upgrade platform version
- Restart application server
- Check pending managed actions
- Configure maintenance windows
- Perform platform migration (blue/green)

## When NOT to Use

- Configuration changes → use `config` skill
- Creating environments → use `environment` skill
- Deploying code → use `deploy` skill

---

## Platform Updates

```bash
eb status            # Check current platform
eb platform list     # List available platforms
eb upgrade           # Upgrade to latest
eb platform select   # Select different platform
```

## Restart Application Server

```bash
eb restart
eb restart <env-name>
```

## Pending Managed Actions

```bash
aws elasticbeanstalk describe-environment-managed-actions \
  --environment-name <env-name> --output json
```

## Managed Action History

```bash
aws elasticbeanstalk describe-environment-managed-action-history \
  --environment-name <env-name> --output json
```

## Configure Managed Updates

```bash
eb config
```

When `ManagedActionsEnabled` is `true`, you **must** also set `PreferredStartTime` and `UpdateLevel`:

```yaml
aws:elasticbeanstalk:managedactions:
  ManagedActionsEnabled: 'true'
  PreferredStartTime: 'Tue:09:00'    # Format: day:hour:minute (UTC)
aws:elasticbeanstalk:managedactions:platformupdate:
  UpdateLevel: minor                  # Values: patch | minor
```

- `patch` — patch version updates only (e.g., 2.0.7 → 2.0.8)
- `minor` — minor and patch updates (e.g., 2.0.8 → 2.1.0)

## Platform Migration (Blue/Green)

1. Clone environment: `eb clone <env> --clone_name <env>-migrated`
2. Select new platform: `eb platform select`
3. Test: `eb status && eb health && eb open`
4. Swap: `eb swap <env> --destination_name <env>-migrated`
5. Terminate old: `eb terminate <env> --force`

---

## Composability

- **Change configuration**: Use `config` skill
- **Manage environments**: Use `environment` skill
- **Check status**: Use `status` skill
