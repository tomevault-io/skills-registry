# Image Generation Prompt Best Practices

## Prompt Structure

Enhance every image generation prompt around three core elements:

### 1. SUBJECT (What)

- Physical characteristics: textures, materials, colors, scale
- Actions, poses, expressions if applicable
- Distinctive features that define the subject

### 2. CONTEXT (Where/When)

- Setting, background, spatial relationships (foreground, midground, background)
- Time of day, weather, atmospheric conditions
- Mood and emotional tone of the scene

### 3. STYLE (How)

- Artistic or photographic approach: reference specific artists, movements, or styles
- Camera/lens choices: specify focal length, aperture, and shooting angle when photographic

## Core Principles

- **Preserve intent** — Add visual details (lighting, texture, composition) only in areas the user left unspecified; keep all user-specified elements unchanged
- **Positive descriptions only** — Describe what should be present; rephrase any exclusion as an inclusion
- **Specific over vague** — "golden hour sunlight at 15° angle" beats "nice lighting"
- **Natural flow** — Weave elements into a single flowing description, not a bullet list

## Output Format

Return the enhanced prompt as a single flowing paragraph. When the user provides multiple requests, return each as a separate enhanced prompt under a labeled heading.

## Enhancement Patterns

### Hyper-Specific Details

Add concrete visual details for any Subject/Context/Style element not specified by the user:

- Lighting → direction, quality, color temperature, shadow behavior
- Textures → surface materials, weathering, reflectivity
- Atmosphere → particulates, humidity, depth haze
- Scale → relative sizes, distances, proportions

### Camera Control Terminology

When a photographic look is appropriate:

- Lens type: "shot with 85mm portrait lens", "wide-angle 24mm"
- Aperture: "shallow depth of field at f/1.8", "deep focus at f/11"
- Angle: "low angle emphasizing height", "bird's eye view"
- Motion: "motion blur on the paws", "frozen mid-action"

### Atmospheric Enhancement

Convey mood through environmental details:

- Emotional tone with visual indicators: "serene (soft diffused light, muted palette)", "ominous (low contrast, heavy shadows, desaturated)", "jubilant (high saturation, warm tones, dynamic motion)"
- Weather/air: "morning mist", "dust particles in a sunbeam"

### Text in Images

When the image should contain readable text (signs, labels, titles, typography):

- Specify the exact text content in quotes: `"OPEN 24 HOURS" in bold sans-serif`
- Describe visual treatment: font style, weight, size relative to the scene
- Define placement and integration: "centered on the storefront awning", "hand-lettered on the chalkboard"

## Feature Patterns

### Character Consistency

When the same character must be recognizable across multiple images:

- Include **at least 3 recognizable visual markers** (distinctive scar, signature clothing, unique hairstyle, characteristic accessory)
- Use anchoring words: "distinctive", "signature", "always wears", "always has"
- Be specific: "round tortoiseshell glasses" not just "glasses"

### Compositional Integration

When combining multiple visual elements in one scene:

- Define spatial relationships with proportions: "foreground (40% of frame)", "midground", "background"
- Define how elements interact spatially and visually: overlap, reflection, shared lighting, color echo between foreground and background
- Specify relative scale and interaction between elements

### Real-World Accuracy

When depicting real places, cultures, or historical elements:

- Use specific terminology: "traditional Edo-period architecture", "authentic Moroccan zellige tilework"
- Include culturally accurate details
- Reference geographical or historical specifics

### Purpose-Driven Enhancement

Tailor the prompt to the intended use:

| Purpose | Emphasis |
|---------|----------|
| Product photo | Clean background, studio lighting, commercial appeal |
| UI mockup | Flat design elements, consistent spacing, screen-appropriate |
| Presentation slide | Bold composition, clear focal point, text-friendly layout |
| Social media | Eye-catching, vibrant, crop-friendly aspect ratio |
| Book/album cover | Typography space, dramatic mood, symbolic elements |

## Image Editing

When modifying an existing image:

- **Preserve** the original's core characteristics: color palette, lighting style, composition
- Use anchoring phrases: "maintain the existing...", "preserve the original...", "keep the same..."
- Be specific about what to change vs what to keep unchanged
- Describe modifications relative to the existing image, not from scratch

## Ambiguous Cases

- When user intent is unclear between photographic and illustrative style, ask before enhancing
- When enhancement would significantly change the user's concept, present the original interpretation alongside the enhanced version
- When cultural or historical accuracy cannot be verified, flag the uncertainty rather than guessing

## Scope

This skill covers static image prompt enhancement only. It does not cover video generation, 3D rendering, or image analysis/description.

## Example

**Input:** "A happy dog in a park"

**Enhanced:** "Golden retriever mid-leap catching a red frisbee, ears flying, tongue out in joy, in a sunlit urban park. Soft morning light filtering through oak trees creates dappled shadows on emerald grass. Background shows families on picnic blankets, slightly out of focus. Shot from low angle emphasizing the dog's athletic movement, with motion blur on the paws suggesting speed."
