# Plan Feature Skill

Systematically gather requirements and create implementation plans before starting Rails feature development. Ensures thorough planning, proper task breakdown, and alignment with project conventions.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- User mentions planning a new feature
- Starting development on a new capability
- Breaking down complex requirements
- User says "plan", "requirements", "tasks", "kickoff"
- Beginning work on authentication, CRUD, dashboards, or APIs

## Instructions

Follow these steps systematically when planning a feature:

### Step 1: Understand the Feature Request

Acknowledge the feature request and restate it to confirm understanding:

```
I'll help you plan the implementation of [feature name]. Let me gather requirements and analyze the codebase to create a structured plan.
```

### Step 2: Gather Requirements

Use the AskUserQuestion tool to ask 2-4 focused questions tailored to the feature type.

**For Authentication/Authorization:**
- Authentication method (email/password, OAuth, magic links)
- Session management and duration
- Password requirements and reset flow
- Multi-factor authentication needed?
- Role-based access control requirements

**For CRUD Features (Posts, Comments, etc.):**
- Required fields and validations
- Relationships to existing models
- Permission levels (who can create/edit/delete)
- UI requirements (forms, listings, filters)
- Real-time updates needed?

**For Dashboard/Admin Features:**
- Metrics and data to display
- Filters and search requirements
- Export capabilities
- Access restrictions
- Update frequency (real-time vs static)

**General Questions (always relevant):**
- Target users (all users, admins, specific roles)
- Mobile responsiveness requirements
- Performance considerations
- Integration with existing features

### Step 3: Analyze Codebase

Use Read, Grep, and Glob tools to understand current state:

```ruby
# Check existing models
Glob: "app/models/**/*.rb"

# Find similar features
Grep: Search for related functionality

# Review routes
Read: "config/routes.rb"

# Check migrations
Glob: "db/migrate/**/*.rb"

# Review test structure
Glob: "test/**/*_test.rb"
```

**Look for:**
- Existing models that need relationships
- Similar features to follow as patterns
- Naming conventions in use
- Testing patterns being followed
- Authentication/authorization setup

### Step 4: Create Implementation Plan

Design a comprehensive plan covering:

**Database Layer:**
- New migrations needed
- Model changes or new models
- Associations to add
- Indexes required for performance

**Business Logic:**
- Model validations
- Callbacks (use sparingly)
- Scopes for reusable queries
- Service objects for complex logic

**Controllers & Routes:**
- New controllers or actions needed
- RESTful routes to add
- Nested resources
- API endpoints if applicable

**Views & Frontend:**
- New views or partials
- Forms with proper helpers
- Turbo Frames/Streams for interactivity
- Stimulus controllers for JavaScript
- TailwindCSS styling approach

**Testing:**
- Model tests (validations, associations)
- Controller tests (actions, responses)
- System tests (user workflows)
- Fixtures or factories needed

**Security & Performance:**
- Authorization checks required
- Input sanitization points
- N+1 query prevention
- Caching opportunities

### Step 5: Create Task List

Use TodoWrite tool to create actionable tasks in logical order:

1. **Database setup** - Migrations, models, associations
2. **Business logic** - Validations, scopes, methods
3. **Controllers & routes** - RESTful actions, authorization
4. **Views & frontend** - Forms, Turbo Frames, TailwindCSS
5. **Testing** - Model, controller, system tests
6. **Review & polish** - Linters, security scan, browser testing

Each task should:
- Be specific and actionable
- Include both imperative and active forms
- Follow logical dependencies
- Include testing and review steps

### Step 6: Identify Dependencies & Risks

Call out potential issues:
- **Dependencies**: Gems to install, external services
- **Breaking changes**: Migrations affecting existing data
- **Risks**: Complex logic, performance concerns, security
- **Open questions**: Decisions needed before proceeding

### Step 7: Present Plan Summary

Provide a clear summary:

```
## Feature: [Name]

### Overview
[1-2 sentence description]

### Key Requirements
- Requirement 1
- Requirement 2
- Requirement 3

### Technical Approach
- Database: [brief description]
- Backend: [brief description]
- Frontend: [brief description]
- Testing: [brief description]

### Files to Create/Modify
- db/migrate/xxx_create_table.rb
- app/models/model.rb
- app/controllers/controller.rb
- app/views/resource/
- test/models/model_test.rb

### Tasks Created
[X tasks tracked in todo list]

### Next Steps
1. Review and confirm approach
2. (Optional) Run /refine-requirements to clarify details with follow-up questions
3. (Optional) Run /create-task-files to export tasks to markdown files
4. Start with: [first task]
5. Proceed sequentially through tasks

Ready to start implementation?
```

**Note:** After planning, you can:
- Run `/refine-requirements` to ask follow-up questions and clarify ambiguous requirements
- Run `/create-task-files` to export tasks into structured markdown files (epic, user-story, bug, issue) in a `tasks/` directory for git-based tracking

## Best Practices

**Do:**
- ✅ Ask focused, specific questions
- ✅ Search codebase before suggesting new patterns
- ✅ Follow existing project conventions
- ✅ Break features into small, manageable tasks
- ✅ Consider testing from the start
- ✅ Reference `.claude/rules/*.md` for implementation patterns

**Don't:**
- ❌ Make assumptions - ask when unclear
- ❌ Create vague or ambiguous tasks
- ❌ Ignore existing similar features
- ❌ Skip security considerations
- ❌ Forget mobile responsiveness
- ❌ Plan without understanding current state

## Integration with Project

This skill works within the Rails blog app structure:

- **Follows**: `.claude/CLAUDE.md` for project-specific setup
- **Applies**: `.claude/rules/*.md` for implementation guidelines
- **Uses**: Minitest (not RSpec) for testing
- **Leverages**: Hotwire, TailwindCSS, Solid trilogy
- **Respects**: Rails Omakase philosophy

## Example Usage

**User request:**
```
Plan a blog post commenting system
```

**Skill workflow:**
1. Asks: Comment nesting? Moderation? Real-time updates? Email notifications?
2. Analyzes: Checks for Post model, User model, existing auth patterns
3. Plans: Comment model with polymorphic associations, controller, Turbo Streams
4. Creates: 12 tasks from migration → tests → polish
5. Presents: Summary with technical approach and file list
6. Awaits: User confirmation to begin

## Output

Always use TodoWrite to create trackable tasks with:
- Clear descriptions (imperative: "Create migration", active: "Creating migration")
- Logical ordering (database → logic → UI → tests)
- Testing tasks included
- Review/polish tasks at end

This ensures thorough planning, reduces rework, and aligns with Rails best practices before writing code.
