# PHPUnit Adversarial Test Review

Stress-test reviewer consensus: form independent judgment before exposure to findings, then challenge weak consensus, resurrect premature withdrawals, and discover missed violations.

## Overview

Work a different cognitive model from the standard reviewer — instead of applying rules group-by-group:

1. Read the code with fresh eyes (no rules framework)
2. Receive the consensus (first exposure to reviewer reasoning)
3. Compare independent impressions against consensus to find gaps
4. Gather rule evidence only for substantiated challenges
5. Scan for cross-file inconsistencies

**Input**: Consensus package (required) + optional pre-formed impressions from an earlier wave + optional `{rules}` (the pre-rendered rule catalog as text, provided in your prompt; when set, Phase 4 selects rules from it instead of calling `get_rules`).

**Output**: Structured challenges report per references/output-format.md.

## Phase 1: Independent Intuitive Scan

**Skip condition**: If `impressions` input is provided (pre-formed in an earlier wave), skip this phase entirely and proceed to Phase 2.

Read each assigned test file and its source class (from `#[CoversClass]`). Do NOT use MCP rule tools (`get_rules`) in this phase.

Load references/intuitive-scan-guidance.md for heuristic lenses, then for each file:

1. Read the test file completely
2. Read the source class under test (from `#[CoversClass]`)
3. Apply each heuristic lens from the guidance
4. Record concerns as free-form observations with severity estimate

Output per file:

```yaml
impressions:
  - file_path: tests/unit/Path/To/ClassTest.php
    concerns:
      - area: "brief description of concern"
        severity: high | medium | low
```

## Phase 2: Receive Consensus Package

Parse the consensus package provided as input:

1. Validate the package contains `consensus_findings`, `withdrawn_findings`, and `reconciliation_record` per file
2. This is the first exposure to reviewer reasoning — note your initial reactions before proceeding

The consensus package is provided in full in your input — `consensus_findings`, `withdrawn_findings`, and the reconciliation record per file.

## Phase 3: Structured Comparison

Load references/comparison-strategies.md. For each file, contrast Phase 1 impressions against Phase 2 consensus:

1. **Intuition-consensus gaps** — Phase 1 concerns that no reviewer raised. These are the highest-value candidates for new findings. For each unmatched concern, note which area of the code it targets.

2. **Weak consensus findings** — for each consensus finding, apply the "would this survive harder pushback?" test:
   - MAJORITY findings with thin reasoning in the reconciliation record
   - Findings where the reconciliation record shows quick concession without evidence
   - Findings that don't match your Phase 1 impressions at all

3. **Premature withdrawals** — for each withdrawn finding, check:
   - Does the concession reason cite a specific detection algorithm? If not, flag it.
   - Did your Phase 1 scan independently flag the same area? If yes, strong resurrection candidate.
   - Did only one reviewer push back while others followed? Bandwagon pattern.

4. **Assumption excavation** — for each consensus finding, state the unstated premise:
   - What must be true for this finding to be valid?
   - What breaks if that premise is wrong?

Output: prioritized list of candidate challenges, resurrections, and new findings — not yet evidence-backed.

## Phase 4: Evidence Gathering

For each candidate from Phase 3 (starting with highest-priority):

1. Load applicable rules and detection algorithms: when `{rules}` is set, select from the inline text every rule whose `Categories` include the detected category — the text holds every rule, so **NEVER** read, open, search, or locate a rule file by any means (no `Read`/`Grep`/`Glob`, no `get_rules`); reading the test/source code is unaffected. Otherwise call `mcp__plugin_test-writing_test-rules__get_rules(test_type=unit, test_category={category})`.
2. Apply the detection algorithm against the actual code

**Promotion gate**: promote a candidate to a formal challenge ONLY if a detection algorithm substantiates it. Drop candidates where the evidence doesn't hold up. This is the filter against contrarianism — intuition proposes, evidence disposes.

**Endorsement**: consensus findings that Phase 1 intuition independently confirmed AND that have strong detection algorithm support get endorsed. Endorsements are part of the output — they strengthen findings in the final report.

## Phase 5: Cross-File Inconsistency Scan

Only applicable when reviewing multiple files. Compare patterns across all assigned files:

1. For each rule_id that appears in any file's consensus, check if the same pattern exists in other files:
   - File A's consensus accepted a pattern that file B's consensus flagged -> high-value challenge
   - All files share the same weakness but none flagged it -> systemic finding

2. Compare treatment of similar code patterns:
   - setUp() strategies across files
   - Mocking approaches (createMock vs createStub)
   - Assertion styles
   - Data provider usage

Cross-file inconsistencies use the same promotion gate as Phase 4 — cite the detection algorithm.

## Phase 6: Generate Challenges Report

Load references/output-format.md. Assemble the structured output:

1. Group all promoted challenges by file path
2. Include all endorsements
3. Include cross-file inconsistencies (from Phase 5)
4. Set status:
   - `CHALLENGES_RAISED` if any challenges, resurrections, new findings, or cross-file inconsistencies
   - `NO_CHALLENGES` if only endorsements
   - `FAILED` if input validation or processing failed

### Output Contract

```yaml
status: CHALLENGES_RAISED | NO_CHALLENGES | FAILED
files:
  - file_path: tests/unit/Path/To/ClassTest.php
    challenges_to_consensus:
      - rule_id: CONV-004
        consensus_was: UNANIMOUS | MAJORITY
        challenge: "Detection algorithm requires X but..."
        verdict_sought: overturn | weaken
    resurrections:
      - rule_id: DESIGN-005
        originally_reported_by: reviewer-1
        resurrection_argument: "The concession was premature because..."
        code_evidence: "ClassTest.php:72 — ..."
    new_findings:
      - rule_id: ISOLATION-002
        enforce: must-fix
        location: ClassTest.php:88
        summary: "Description"
        current: |
          # code
        suggested: |
          # fix
        detection_algorithm_citation: "ISOLATION-002 specifies..."
    endorsements:
      - rule_id: UNIT-003
        reason: "Strong finding, correctly applied"
    cross_file_inconsistencies:
      - rule_id: CONV-004
        this_file_status: accepted
        other_file: tests/unit/Other/ClassTest.php
        other_file_status: flagged
        inconsistency: "Same pattern, divergent treatment"
reason: null  # explanation if FAILED
```

## Troubleshooting

### No Impressions Formed in Phase 1

If the test file or source class cannot be read:
- Return FAILED with the file path and error
- Do not proceed to comparison phases without impressions

### MCP Tool Unavailability

If `mcp__plugin_test-writing_test-rules__get_rules` is unavailable:
- Report error: "test-rules MCP server not available — ensure the test-writing plugin is installed and Claude Code was restarted"
- Candidates from Phase 3 cannot be promoted without evidence — return NO_CHALLENGES with a note explaining the limitation

### All Candidates Fail Promotion Gate

If Phase 4 drops all candidates (none substantiated by detection algorithms):
- This is a valid outcome — return NO_CHALLENGES
- Include endorsements for strong consensus findings
- The adversary adds value by confirming the consensus is robust
