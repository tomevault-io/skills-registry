# DevOps Bestays Infrastructure

## Overview

Orchestrate and manage the Bestays Real Estate Platform development environment. This skill provides workflows for starting services, debugging issues, checking system health, and locating component information across the codebase.

**Core Principle**: This skill is a **pointer system**, not a knowledge base. It knows WHERE information lives (specs, configs, code), not WHAT the information is. This keeps it lightweight, accurate, and self-maintaining.

## When to Use This Skill

**Primary Triggers**:

- Starting or restarting the development environment
- Debugging service failures or integration issues
- Checking system health or component status
- Finding information about system components
- Adding new services to docker-compose
- Understanding how subsystems connect
- Troubleshooting environment setup

**User Patterns**:

- "How do I start the dev environment?"
- "The backend isn't starting"
- "What ports does the system use?"
- "Where is the chat API documented?"
- "How do I add a new service?"
- "Check system health"

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Environment Orchestration

**Start Development Environment**:

```bash
make dev
```

**What Happens**:

1. Checks for running containers → Stops if found
2. Runs preflight validation (`.sdlc-workflow/scripts/preflight.sh`)
3. Starts all services (docker-compose up -d)
4. Verifies health checks

**Preflight Validates**:

- Docker daemon running
- Ports available (8011, 5183, 5433, 6379)
- .env file exists
- Required env vars set (CLERK_SECRET_KEY, OPENROUTER_API_KEY)
- Docker Compose file valid
- Required directories present

**Spec Reference**: `.pattern-book/specifications/tech/preflight-validation.md`

**Stop Environment**:

```bash
make dev-stop
# or
make down
```

**Full Rebuild** (after Dockerfile changes):

```bash
make rebuild
```

Performs: down → build → up → migrate

### 2. System Health Monitoring

**Check All Services**:

```bash
make check
```

**What It Checks**:

- Backend health: `curl http://localhost:8011/api/health`
- Database: `pg_isready`
- Frontend: `curl http://localhost:5183`

**View Logs**:

```bash
make logs              # All services
make logs-server       # Backend only
make logs-frontend     # Frontend only
make logs-db           # Database only
```

**Service Status**:

```bash
make status
# or
docker ps --filter "name=bestays"
```

### 3. Component Information Lookup

**When You Need Information**:

**Step 1**: Identify component category

- Infrastructure? → Docker Compose, Makefile
- Backend? → FastAPI server, PostgreSQL, Redis
- Frontend? → SvelteKit app
- External? → OpenRouter, Clerk
- Pattern-Book? → Discussions, specs

**Step 2**: Consult component map

```
Read: references/component-map.md
```

**Component Map Provides**:

- Definitive source file paths
- What information is available there
- Related specs
- Quick access patterns

**Example Lookup**:

- **Q**: "What ports does the system use?"
- **A**: Component map → Docker Compose section → Points to `docker-compose.dev.yml` → Read ports sections

**Pattern**: Always read definitive source, never rely on cached knowledge

### 4. Troubleshooting

**When Something Breaks**:

**Step 1**: Identify issue category

- Environment startup?
- Service-specific (backend, frontend, db)?
- Application-level (chat, auth)?
- Docker/container?
- Integration/API?

**Step 2**: Consult troubleshooting index

```
Read: references/troubleshooting-index.md
```

**Index Provides**:

- Symptoms → Troubleshooting path
- Common causes
- Pointer to definitive solution

**Example Troubleshooting**:

- **Issue**: "make dev fails"
- **Action**: Read troubleshooting-index.md → Environment Issues → Points to preflight validation
- **Next**: Run `bash .sdlc-workflow/scripts/preflight.sh` to see specific failure

**Debugging Workflow**:

1. Check service logs (`make logs-[service]`)
2. Verify service health (`make check`)
3. Access service shell (`make shell-[service]`)
4. Consult infrastructure discussion for detailed workflows
5. Update troubleshooting index with new learnings

**Infrastructure Discussion**: `.pattern-book/discussions/20251027-2321-infrastructure-setup-deployment-testing-/`

### 5. Adding New Components

**To Add a New Service to Docker Compose**:

**Step 1**: Update `docker-compose.dev.yml`

```yaml
services:
  new-service:
    image: ...
    ports:
      - "XXXX:YYYY"
    environment:
      - VAR=value
    depends_on:
      - existing-service
    networks:
      - bestays-network
```

**Step 2**: Update preflight validation (if ports added)

- Edit `.sdlc-workflow/scripts/preflight.sh`
- Add port check in `check_ports_available()`

**Step 3**: Update Makefile (if special commands needed)

```makefile
logs-newservice:
    $(COMPOSE) logs -f new-service

shell-newservice:
    $(COMPOSE) exec new-service /bin/sh
```

**Step 4**: Update this skill

- Add entry to `references/component-map.md`
- Document in relevant section (Infrastructure, Backend, etc.)
- Add troubleshooting patterns if known

**Step 5**: Create/update specs

- Create URS if user-facing feature
- Create tech spec for implementation details
- Create integration contract for API boundaries

### 6. Self-Update Protocol

**When This Skill Is Missing Information**:

**Detect**: Encounter question skill can't answer with current pointers

**Analyze**: Determine what information is missing and where it should be documented

**Update**:

1. If it's configuration → Already documented in config files, add pointer to component map
2. If it's a process → Document in relevant spec or discussion, add pointer
3. If it's troubleshooting → Add to troubleshooting index
4. If it's new component → Add to component map

**Pattern to Follow**:

In `references/component-map.md`:

```markdown
### [Component Name]

**Definitive Source**: [file path]

**What's There**: [list of available information]

**Spec** (if applicable): [path to spec]

**Key Details**: [critical locating information]
```

In `references/troubleshooting-index.md`:

```markdown
### "[Issue Title]"

**Symptoms**: [observable problems]

**Troubleshooting Path**: [step-by-step diagnosis]

**Common Causes**: [typical root causes]

**Definitive Source**: [where solution documented]
```

**Commit Updates**: After updating, commit changes to skill so future sessions benefit

## Resources

### references/component-map.md

Complete index of all system components and where their information lives.

**When to Read**: Looking for information about a specific component

**Provides**:

- File path to definitive source
- List of available information
- Related specifications
- Quick access patterns

**Covers**:

- Infrastructure (Docker, Makefile, preflight)
- Backend (FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis)
- Frontend (SvelteKit)
- External services (OpenRouter, Clerk)
- Pattern-Book system
- Configuration files

### references/troubleshooting-index.md

Index of common issues and where to find solutions.

**When to Read**: Debugging a problem

**Provides**:

- Symptoms → troubleshooting path
- Common causes
- Pointers to definitive solutions

**Covers**:

- Environment & startup issues
- Service-specific issues (backend, frontend, db, redis)
- Application-level issues (chat, auth)
- Docker & container issues
- Performance issues
- Development workflow issues
- Integration & API issues

## Best Practices

### Always Use Pointers

**Good** ✅:

```
"Port configuration is in docker-compose.dev.yml → services → [service] → ports"
```

**Bad** ❌:

```
"Backend uses port 8011, frontend uses 5183..."
```

### Read Definitive Sources

When user asks "What ports does the system use?":

1. Point to docker-compose.dev.yml
2. Read the file
3. Extract current configuration
4. Provide answer

**Never** answer from memory - config may have changed.

### Update After Learning

When you solve a problem not documented:

1. Document solution in appropriate spec
2. Update troubleshooting index with pointer
3. Update component map if new component
4. Commit update

### Maintain Single Source of Truth

- Config lives in config files
- Specs live in .pattern-book/specifications/
- This skill provides POINTERS only
- No duplication of information

## Workflow Examples

### Example 1: Starting Development

**User**: "Start the development environment"

**Actions**:

1. Run `make dev`
2. Monitor output for preflight validation
3. If validation fails, read error and guide user
4. Once services start, verify health with `make check`
5. Provide service URLs

### Example 2: Debugging Backend Failure

**User**: "Backend isn't starting"

**Actions**:

1. Read `references/troubleshooting-index.md` → "Backend Not Starting"
2. Follow troubleshooting path:
   - Check logs: `make logs-server`
   - Check container: `docker ps -a | grep bestays-server`
   - Identify error in logs
3. If database connection issue → Check postgres health
4. If migration issue → Run `make migrate`
5. Document new issue if not in index

### Example 3: Finding API Specification

**User**: "Where is the chat API documented?"

**Actions**:

1. Read `references/component-map.md` → Backend section
2. Find: "Specs: .pattern-book/specifications/integration/openrouter-chat.md"
3. Read integration spec for API contract
4. Also point to API docs: http://localhost:8011/docs

### Example 4: Adding New Environment Variable

**User**: "How do I add a new environment variable?"

**Actions**:

1. Read `references/component-map.md` → Configuration Files → Environment Variables
2. Guide through process:
   - Add to `.env` file
   - Add to `docker-compose.dev.yml` → service → environment
   - Document in relevant spec
3. Restart services: `make dev`
4. Update component map if it's a significant new config

## Validation & Quality

**Skill Health Indicators**:

- ✅ All pointers in component map are valid file paths
- ✅ Troubleshooting index covers known issues
- ✅ Can answer "where is X documented?" questions
- ✅ No duplicated information (everything points to source)
- ✅ Self-update protocol is followed when gaps found

**Regular Maintenance**:

- After new components added → Update component map
- After solving new issues → Update troubleshooting index
