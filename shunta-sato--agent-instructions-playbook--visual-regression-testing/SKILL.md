## Purpose

Use this skill to enforce a consistent UI visual verification contract without hard-coding a specific test framework.

## When to use

- Any UI code changed (iOS/SwiftUI, Android/Compose/XML, web UI/components/styles).
- The request mentions pixel perfect, UI matches design, snapshot, or screenshot.

## How to use

1) Open `references/visual-regression-testing.md`.
2) Discover and run the repo’s canonical UI verify/record interface.
3) Review produced artifacts and compare against baselines/design mocks.
4) Update baselines only for intentional UI changes.
5) Output the required report format exactly.

## Gotchas

- **Common pitfall:** skipping snapshot verification even though UI changed.  
  **Instead:** run the repo-defined UI verification command and always check whether diffs exist.
- **Common pitfall:** recording failed snapshots in bulk without root-cause review.  
  **Instead:** review diff images and apply only intended changes to baseline.
- **Common pitfall:** omitting artifact paths in reports, preventing reviewer recheck.  
  **Instead:** explicitly include compare result, update status, and relative artifact paths in output format.
- **Common pitfall:** assuming visual differences are environment-only and leaving them unresolved.  
  **Instead:** separate font/resolution/theme/locale differences and record reproduction conditions before judgment.
