# Code Review Skill

Guidelines for performing effective code reviews that catch issues, improve code quality, and maintain a positive team dynamic.

## Review Mindset

**Default to requesting changes.** Your job is to protect the codebase. An approval is a statement that you'd stake your reputation on this code — if you have any doubt, request changes. It's always cheaper to do another review round than to ship a bug.

### Goals of Code Review
1. **Catch bugs and design flaws** before they reach production
2. **Prevent security issues** — treat every input as hostile
3. **Enforce quality standards** — the codebase should get better with every PR, never worse
4. **Maintain architectural integrity** — reject code that works but is built wrong

### The Right Attitude
- You are a **gatekeeper**. That's not a dirty word — it's your job. The codebase depends on you saying "no" when something isn't ready.
- Be direct and specific. Don't soften feedback with hedging language.
- Approving bad code is worse than blocking good code. When in doubt, request changes.
- A clean diff is not the same as correct code. Read critically, assume there are bugs, and prove yourself wrong.

## Review Process

### 1. Understand the Context First

Before looking at code:
```
1. Read the PR description
2. Read the linked issue
3. Understand WHAT is being done and WHY
4. Consider: Is this the right approach?
```

### 2. First Pass: High-Level Review

Ask yourself:
- Does this solve the problem described in the issue?
- Is the approach reasonable?
- Are there obvious architectural concerns?
- Is anything missing?

### 3. Second Pass: Detailed Review

Look at each file for:
- Correctness (does it work?)
- Edge cases and error handling
- Security implications
- Performance concerns
- Test coverage
- Code style and readability

### 4. Summarize Your Review

End with an overall assessment:
```markdown
**[Architect]** Overall this looks good. Clean implementation of the user registration flow.

A few suggestions:
1. Consider adding rate limiting (security)
2. The validation error messages could be more user-friendly
3. Minor: prefer `const` over `let` where possible

Approving with minor suggestions - none are blocking.
```

## What to Look For

### Correctness
- Does the code do what it's supposed to do?
- Are there logic errors?
- Are edge cases handled?
- What happens with null/undefined/empty inputs?

```markdown
**Concern:** This will throw if `user` is null:
\`\`\`javascript
const name = user.profile.name;
\`\`\`

Consider:
\`\`\`javascript
const name = user?.profile?.name ?? 'Unknown';
\`\`\`
```

### Error Handling
- Are errors caught appropriately?
- Are error messages helpful?
- Does the error handling match the project patterns?

```markdown
**Suggestion:** The error is swallowed here - the user won't know what went wrong:
\`\`\`javascript
try {
  await saveUser(data);
} catch (e) {
  console.log(e);
}
\`\`\`

Consider surfacing this to the user or rethrowing.
```

### Security (OWASP Top 10)
- SQL injection (parameterized queries?)
- XSS (output encoding?)
- Authentication/authorization checks
- Sensitive data exposure
- Input validation

```markdown
**Security Issue:** User input is interpolated directly into the query:
\`\`\`javascript
const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '${email}'`;
\`\`\`

Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
```

### Performance
- Unnecessary loops or iterations
- N+1 query problems
- Missing indexes
- Large payloads
- Memory leaks

```markdown
**Performance:** This creates an N+1 query problem - one query per user:
\`\`\`javascript
for (const user of users) {
  user.posts = await getPosts(user.id);
}
\`\`\`

Consider using a batch query or join.
```

### Maintainability
- Is the code readable?
- Are names descriptive?
- Is the logic easy to follow?
- Will this be easy to modify later?

```markdown
**Readability:** This function does a lot - consider splitting:
- Validation logic → `validateUserInput()`
- Transformation → `transformUserData()`
- Persistence → `saveUser()`

This would make each piece easier to test and understand.
```

### Tests
- Are tests included?
- Do tests cover the main paths?
- Do tests cover edge cases?
- Are tests readable and maintainable?

```markdown
**Testing:** Good coverage of the happy path! Consider adding tests for:
- Invalid email format
- Duplicate email (already registered)
- Missing required fields
```

### Consistency
- Does it follow project conventions?
- Does it match existing patterns?
- Is it consistent with itself?

```markdown
**Consistency:** The rest of the codebase uses `async/await`, but this uses `.then()`:
\`\`\`javascript
fetchUser(id).then(user => { ... });
\`\`\`

Consider using async/await for consistency.
```

## How to Give Feedback

### Be Specific and Actionable

**Bad:**
> This code is confusing.

**Good:**
> The nested callbacks make this hard to follow. Consider using async/await or extracting the inner logic into named functions.

### Explain the Why

**Bad:**
> Use `const` here.

**Good:**
> Use `const` here since `user` is never reassigned. This signals intent to readers and catches accidental reassignment.

### Offer Solutions

**Bad:**
> This won't scale.

**Good:**
> This loads all users into memory, which won't scale. Consider:
> 1. Pagination with limit/offset
> 2. Streaming with cursor-based pagination
> 3. If the use case allows, a count query instead

### Distinguish Severity

Use prefixes to indicate importance:

| Prefix | Meaning | Blocks Merge? |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| **Blocker:** | Must fix — bugs, security, correctness, design flaws | Yes — always |
| **Concern:** | Likely needs fixing — poor patterns, missing tests, unclear logic | Yes — unless author justifies |
| **Suggestion:** | Would improve the code | No |
| **Nit:** | Minor style/preference | No |
| **Question:** | Seeking to understand (may become a blocker depending on answer) | Potentially |

**Important:** Don't downgrade real issues to "Suggestion" or "Nit" to avoid conflict. If something will cause bugs or maintenance pain, it's a Blocker or Concern, period.

```markdown
**Blocker:** This SQL query is vulnerable to injection. (Security - must fix)

**Suggestion:** Consider extracting this into a helper function for reuse. (Not blocking - can be done later)

**Nit:** Extra blank line here. (Definitely not blocking)

**Question:** Why did you choose this approach over X? (Curious, not blocking)

**Praise:** Really clean error handling here! (Always welcome)
```

### Be Direct, Not Wishy-Washy

**Too soft (avoids accountability):**
> Have you considered using a Map here? It might give better performance for frequent lookups. What do you think?

**Direct and clear:**
> This should be a Map, not a plain object. Map has O(1) lookups and doesn't suffer from prototype pollution. Change this.

## Common Review Scenarios

### When Something Is Missing

```markdown
**Missing:** I don't see error handling for the case where the API returns 404. What should happen?
```

### When You Don't Understand

```markdown
**Question:** I'm not following the logic in this section. Could you add a comment explaining the business rule, or walk me through it?
```

### When Praising Good Work

Don't just point out problems:
```markdown
**Praise:** Nice job extracting this into a reusable hook! This will help with the other forms too.

**Praise:** The test coverage here is excellent.
```

## Review Response Templates

**Default to Request Changes.** An approval should be the exception, not the rule. Most PRs have at least one issue worth fixing before merge.

### Request Changes (most common outcome)
```markdown
**[Architect]** Changes requested:

**Blockers:**
1. SQL injection vulnerability in the search query — this is a security risk
2. No error handling on the API call — will crash on network failure

**Concerns:**
1. This bypasses the existing validation layer — use `validateInput()` instead of rolling your own
2. Missing tests for the error path

Fix these and request re-review.
```

### Approve (use sparingly — only when the PR is genuinely solid)
```markdown
**[Architect]** Approved. Implementation is correct, well-tested, and follows existing patterns.

No issues found.
```

### Decline (N/A)
```markdown
**[UI/UX]** N/A - No UI changes in this PR.

Reviewed: Backend/infrastructure changes only, no user-facing impact.
```

## Review Standards

### Do
- Review promptly
- Be thorough — read every line of the diff
- Request changes whenever you find real issues — don't let things slide
- Hold a high bar — "it works" is not enough, it must be correct, maintainable, and secure
- Re-review quickly after changes, and verify the fixes are actually good

### Don't
- Approve out of politeness or to avoid slowing things down
- Downgrade blockers to suggestions to seem agreeable
- Approve with "suggestions" that are actually required fixes — if it needs fixing, request changes
- Leave reviews hanging

## Self-Review Checklist

Before requesting review, authors should self-review:

- [ ] I've re-read my own diff
- [ ] Tests pass locally
- [ ] No console.logs or debug code left
- [ ] No commented-out code
- [ ] Variable names are descriptive
- [ ] Complex logic has comments
- [ ] Error cases are handled
- [ ] No obvious security issues
