# Work Issue Skill

This skill contains the implementation logic for working on a single GitHub issue. It is loaded by:
- `/auto-work-issue {n}` command (direct invocation)
- `/auto-work-all` subagents (spawned for context isolation)

## Input

This skill expects an `ISSUE_NUMBER` to be provided by the caller.

## Workflow

```
1. PRE-FLIGHT CHECK → Verify commands.md exists and is complete
2. SETUP ORCHESTRATION FOLDER
3. GET ISSUE DETAILS
4. CHECK DEPENDENCIES → If blocked, report and stop
4.5. CHOOSE COORDINATION MODE → Teams vs subagents for each step
5. GET DESIGN SPECS (if UI) → Invoke designer agent with briefing
6. IMPLEMENT → Invoke developer agent (or team) with briefing
7. COORDINATE REVIEWS → Architect, Designer (if UI), Tester (subagents or team)
8. HANDLE CHANGE REQUESTS → Loop until all approved
9. COMMIT ORCHESTRATION FILES → Preserve audit trail in branch
10. REPORT RESULT → Success, Blocked, or Escalated
```

---

## Step 1: Pre-flight Check

Before starting work, verify the project is set up for E2E testing.

### Check commands.md Exists and Is Complete

```bash
# Check if commands.md exists
if [ ! -f .claude/commands.md ]; then
  echo "ERROR: .claude/commands.md does not exist"
fi

# Read and check for required commands
cat .claude/commands.md
```

**Required commands that must be documented:**
- Development server command (how to run the app)
- Development server URL (where the app runs)
- Test command (how to run tests)

### If commands.md Is Missing or Incomplete

**STOP** and report to the user:

```
PRE-FLIGHT FAILED: commands.md is incomplete

Before I can work on issues, .claude/commands.md must document:
- How to start the development server
- The URL where the app runs
- How to run tests

Please update .claude/commands.md with these commands, or I won't be able to verify the implementation works.
```

**Do NOT proceed** until commands.md is complete. The Tester agent will need this to run E2E verification, and skipping E2E verification is unacceptable.

### If commands.md Is Complete

Continue to Step 2.

---

## Step 2: Setup Orchestration Folder

Create a folder for this issue's briefings and reports:

```bash
# Get issue title for slug
ISSUE_TITLE=$(gh issue view {ISSUE_NUMBER} --json title --jq '.title')
SLUG=$(echo "$ISSUE_TITLE" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | tr ' ' '-' | tr -cd 'a-z0-9-' | head -c 30)

# Create orchestration folder
mkdir -p orchestration/issues/{ISSUE_NUMBER}-${SLUG}
```

All briefings and reports for this issue will go in this folder.

---

## Step 3: Get Issue Details

```bash
gh issue view {ISSUE_NUMBER}
```

Extract:
- Title
- Acceptance criteria
- Dependencies
- Labels (UI-related?)

---

## Step 4: Check Dependencies

Parse "Depends on #X" from issue body:

```bash
gh issue view {ISSUE_NUMBER} --json body --jq '.body' | grep -oE 'Depends on #[0-9]+' | grep -oE '[0-9]+'
```

For each dependency, check if closed:

```bash
gh issue view {dep_number} --json state --jq '.state'
```

**If any dependency is OPEN:**
```
Report: "BLOCKED: Issue #{ISSUE_NUMBER} is blocked on #{dep_number}"
Stop here.
```

---

## Step 4.5: Choose Coordination Mode

Read team preferences from `.claude/settings.json` under `automatasaurus.limits`:

```bash
# Check team preferences
cat .claude/settings.json | grep -A3 'teamPrefer'
```

### Decision Matrix

| Step | Default Mode | Use Team When |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| Design Specs (Step 5) | Subagent | N/A — single agent task |
| Implementation (Step 6) | Subagent | `teamPreferForImplementation: true` AND issue has UI work |
| Reviews (Step 7) | Subagent | `teamPreferForReviews: true` |
| Address Feedback (Step 8) | Subagent | N/A — single agent task |

### Set Mode for Each Step

Based on settings and issue context:

```
implementationMode = "subagent"  # default
reviewMode = "subagent"          # default

# Check settings
if teamPreferForImplementation AND issue has UI work:
    implementationMode = "team"

if teamPreferForReviews:
    reviewMode = "team"
```

If teams are enabled for any step, load the `team-coordination` skill for detailed patterns.

**Important:** Teams are experimental. If team creation fails at any step, fall back to subagent mode and continue the workflow.

---

## Step 5: Get Design Specs (If UI Work)

Check if issue involves UI (labels contain "ui", "frontend", or issue mentions UI work).

If UI work needed and no design specs in comments:

### 5a. Write Designer Briefing

Write `orchestration/issues/{ISSUE_NUMBER}-{slug}/BRIEFING-design-specs.md`:

```markdown
# Agent Briefing: design-specs
Generated: {timestamp}

## Your Task
Add UI/UX specifications to issue #{ISSUE_NUMBER}.

## Context
- Issue: #{ISSUE_NUMBER} - {title}
- This issue involves UI work and needs design specifications before implementation

## Resources (Read as Needed)
- Issue details: `gh issue view {ISSUE_NUMBER}`
- design-system.md: Available design tokens and patterns
- Existing components in codebase for consistency

## Expected Output
Post design specifications as an issue comment following your AGENT.md template, including:
- Design intent
- User flow
- Visual design with token references
- Component states
- Accessibility requirements
- Responsive behavior
```

### 5b. Spawn Designer Agent

```
Use the Task tool with:
  subagent_type: "designer"
  model: "opus"
  description: "Designer specs for issue #{ISSUE_NUMBER}"
  prompt: |
    Read orchestration/issues/{ISSUE_NUMBER}-{slug}/BRIEFING-design-specs.md first.

    After completing your work, write your report to:
    orchestration/issues/{ISSUE_NUMBER}-{slug}/REPORT-design-specs.md
```

### 5c. Read Designer Report

After designer returns, read `REPORT-design-specs.md` to understand what was produced.

---

## Step 6: Implement

Update issue label:
```bash
gh issue edit {ISSUE_NUMBER} --add-label "in-progress" --remove-label "ready"
```

### 6a. Write Developer Briefing

Write `orchestration/issues/{ISSUE_NUMBER}-{slug}/BRIEFING-implement.md`:

```markdown
# Agent Briefing: implement
Generated: {timestamp}

## Your Task
Implement issue #{ISSUE_NUMBER}: {title}

## Context
- Acceptance criteria: {from issue body}
- Mode: {single-issue/all-issues}

## Prior Agent Activity
{If designer created specs, summarize from REPORT-design-specs.md:}
- **Designer**: Created UI specifications including {summary of specs}

## Resources (Read as Needed)
- Issue details: `gh issue view {ISSUE_NUMBER}`
- Design specs: Check issue comments for "**[Designer]** Design Specifications"
- design-system.md: Available design tokens
- Existing patterns in codebase

## Expected Output
- Working implementation matching acceptance criteria
- Tests passing
- PR created with "Closes #{ISSUE_NUMBER}" in body
```

### 6b. Spawn Developer Agent

```
Use the Task tool with:
  subagent_type: "developer"
  model: "opus"
  description: "Implement issue #{ISSUE_NUMBER}"
  prompt: |
    Read orchestration/issues/{ISSUE_NUMBER}-{slug}/BRIEFING-implement.md first.

    After completing your work, write your report to:
    orchestration/issues/{ISSUE_NUMBER}-{slug}/REPORT-implement.md
```

### 6c. Read Developer Report and Get PR Number

After developer returns, read `REPORT-implement.md` to understand what was done.

Get PR number from report or:
```bash
gh pr list --search "head:{ISSUE_NUMBER}-" --json number --jq '.[0].number'
```

### 6b-alt. Spawn Implementation Team (If implementationMode = "team")

When the issue involves UI work and `teamPreferForImplementation` is true, use an implementation team instead of a solo developer subagent.

```
1. Write BRIEFING-implement.md (same content as 6a above)
2. Write BRIEFING-design-specs.md if not already written in Step 5

3. Create team:
   "Create a team to implement issue #{ISSUE_NUMBER}: {title}.

   Teammates:
   - Developer: Read orchestration/issues/{ISSUE_NUMBER}-{slug}/BRIEFING-implement.md.
     Implement the feature, write tests, create PR with 'Closes #{ISSUE_NUMBER}'.
     Message Designer when starting UI components or making design decisions.
     Write report to orchestration/issues/{ISSUE_NUMBER}-{slug}/REPORT-implement.md.

   - Designer: Read orchestration/issues/{ISSUE_NUMBER}-{slug}/BRIEFING-design-specs.md.
     Provide real-time feedback on UI implementation.
     Message Developer if implementation doesn't match specs.
     Write report to orchestration/issues/{ISSUE_NUMBER}-{slug}/REPORT-design-review-inline.md."

4. After team completes, read REPORT-implement.md
5. Get PR number (same as 6c)
```

**Fallback:** If team creation fails, fall back to standard Step 6b (solo developer subagent).

---

## Step 7: Coordinate Reviews

Update issue label:
```bash
gh issue edit {ISSUE_NUMBER} --add-label "needs-review" --remove-label "in-progress"
```

### 7a. Write Review Briefings

Write briefings for each reviewer, including prior agent activity.

**BRIEFING-architect-review.md:**
```markdown
# Agent Briefing: architect-review
Generated: {timestamp}

## Your Task
Review PR #{pr_number} for technical quality.

## Context
- Issue: #{ISSUE_NUMBER} - {title}
- Developer has completed implementation

## Prior Agent Activity
- **Developer**: {summary from REPORT-implement.md - what was built, key decisions, any concerns}

## Resources (Read as Needed)
- PR details: `gh pr view {pr_number}`
- PR diff: `gh pr diff {pr_number}`

## Expected Output
Post standardized review comment:
- ✅ APPROVED - Architect (if acceptable)
- ❌ CHANGES REQUESTED - Architect (if issues found)
```

**BRIEFING-designer-review.md (if UI):**
```markdown
# Agent Briefing: designer-review
Generated: {timestamp}

## Your Task
Review PR #{pr_number} for UI/UX quality.

## Context
- Issue: #{ISSUE_NUMBER} - {title}
- You provided design specs earlier

## Prior Agent Activity
- **Designer** (specs): {summary from REPORT-design-specs.md}
- **Developer**: {summary from REPORT-implement.md}

## Resources (Read as Needed)
- PR details: `gh pr view {pr_number}`
- Your original design specs in issue comments

## Expected Output
Post standardized review comment:
- ✅ APPROVED - Designer
- ❌ CHANGES REQUESTED - Designer
- N/A - No UI changes (if applicable)
```

**BRIEFING-test.md:**
```markdown
# Agent Briefing: test
Generated: {timestamp}

## Your Task
Verify PR #{pr_number} meets acceptance criteria.

## Context
- Issue: #{ISSUE_NUMBER} - {title}

## Prior Agent Activity
- **Developer**: {summary from REPORT-implement.md}

## Resources (Read as Needed)
- PR details: `gh pr view {pr_number}`
- Issue acceptance criteria: `gh issue view {ISSUE_NUMBER}`
- Test commands: Check `.claude/commands.md`

## Expected Output
Post standardized review comment:
- ✅ APPROVED - Tester (all tests pass, criteria verified)
- ❌ CHANGES REQUESTED - Tester (issues found)
```

### 7b. Spawn Review Agents (Parallel)

Spawn all reviewers in parallel (single message, multiple Task calls):

```
# Architect review
Use the Task tool with:
  subagent_type: "architect"
  model: "opus"
  description: "Architect review PR #{pr_number}"
  prompt: |
    Read orchestration/issues/{ISSUE_NUMBER}-{slug}/BRIEFING-architect-review.md first.

    After completing your review, write your report to:
    orchestration/issues/{ISSUE_NUMBER}-{slug}/REPORT-architect-review.md

# Designer review (if UI)
Use the Task tool with:
  subagent_type: "designer"
  model: "opus"
  description: "Designer review PR #{pr_number}"
  prompt: |
    Read orchestration/issues/{ISSUE_NUMBER}-{slug}/BRIEFING-designer-review.md first.

    After completing your review, write your report to:
    orchestration/issues/{ISSUE_NUMBER}-{slug}/REPORT-designer-review.md

# Tester verification
Use the Task tool with:
  subagent_type: "tester"
  model: "opus"
  description: "Tester verify PR #{pr_number}"
  prompt: |
    Read orchestration/issues/{ISSUE_NUMBER}-{slug}/BRIEFING-test.md first.

    After completing verification, write your report to:
    orchestration/issues/{ISSUE_NUMBER}-{slug}/REPORT-test.md
```

### 7b-alt. Spawn Review Team (If reviewMode = "team")

When `teamPreferForReviews` is true, use a review team instead of parallel subagents. This enables reviewers to share findings in real-time.

```
1. Write all BRIEFING files (same as 7a above)

2. Create team:
   "Create a team to review PR #{pr_number} for issue #{ISSUE_NUMBER}: {title}.

   Teammates:
   - Architect: Read orchestration/issues/{ISSUE_NUMBER}-{slug}/BRIEFING-architect-review.md.
     Review PR for technical quality and architecture alignment.
     If you find concerns the Tester should verify, message them.
     Post review comment and write report to REPORT-architect-review.md.

   - Tester: Read orchestration/issues/{ISSUE_NUMBER}-{slug}/BRIEFING-test.md.
     Verify PR meets acceptance criteria using Playwright MCP for E2E testing.
     Check any concerns flagged by Architect.
     Post review comment and write report to REPORT-test.md.

   - Designer: Read orchestration/issues/{ISSUE_NUMBER}-{slug}/BRIEFING-designer-review.md.
     Review UI/UX quality and accessibility.
     If you find accessibility issues, flag to Architect for technical assessment.
     Post review comment and write report to REPORT-designer-review.md.
     (Only include Designer if PR has UI changes.)

   Each teammate must post a standardized review comment:
   - ✅ APPROVED - {Role}
   - ❌ CHANGES REQUESTED - {Role}

   All teammates must complete their reviews."

3. After team completes, read all REPORT files
4. Write REPORT-team-review.md synthesizing findings
```

**Fallback:** If team creation fails, fall back to standard Step 7b (parallel subagents). The BRIEFING files are already written, so subagent invocation can proceed immediately.

**Note on Tester MCP access:** Playwright MCP may not be available in teammate sessions. If the Tester teammate cannot perform E2E testing, they should message the team lead and the orchestrator should fall back to spawning Tester as a subagent (which has MCP configured).

### 7c. Read All Review Reports

After all reviewers return, read their reports:
- `REPORT-architect-review.md`
- `REPORT-designer-review.md` (if UI)
- `REPORT-test.md`

---

## Step 8: Handle Change Requests

Check PR comments for review status:
```bash
gh pr view {pr_number} --comments
```

**If any `❌ CHANGES REQUESTED`:**

### 8a. Write Feedback Briefing

Write `BRIEFING-address-feedback.md`:

```markdown
# Agent Briefing: address-feedback
Generated: {timestamp}

## Your Task
Address review feedback on PR #{pr_number}.

## Context
- Issue: #{ISSUE_NUMBER}
- Reviewers have requested changes

## Prior Agent Activity
- **Architect**: {from REPORT-architect-review.md - what was approved/rejected}
- **Designer**: {from REPORT-designer-review.md - if applicable}
- **Tester**: {from REPORT-test.md - test results}

## Feedback to Address
{List specific feedback items from reviews}

## Resources (Read as Needed)
- PR comments: `gh pr view {pr_number} --comments`

## Expected Output
- All feedback addressed
- Changes pushed
- Comment posted that changes are ready for re-review
```

### 8b. Spawn Developer for Fixes

```
Use the Task tool with:
  subagent_type: "developer"
  model: "opus"
  description: "Address feedback PR #{pr_number}"
  prompt: |
    Read orchestration/issues/{ISSUE_NUMBER}-{slug}/BRIEFING-address-feedback.md first.

    After completing fixes, write your report to:
    orchestration/issues/{ISSUE_NUMBER}-{slug}/REPORT-address-feedback.md
```

### 8c. Re-request Reviews

After developer pushes fixes, re-run relevant reviews with new briefings.

Repeat until all required approvals are present.

---

## Step 9: Commit Orchestration Files

Before reporting success, commit all briefings and reports to the branch so they're preserved in the PR.

```bash
# Switch to the issue branch
BRANCH=$(gh pr view {pr_number} --json headRefName --jq '.headRefName')
git checkout "$BRANCH"

# Add all orchestration files for this issue
git add orchestration/issues/{ISSUE_NUMBER}-{slug}/

# Commit with clear message
git commit -m "docs: add agent orchestration files for #{ISSUE_NUMBER}

Includes briefings and reports from:
- Designer (if UI)
- Developer
- Architect review
- Tester verification

These provide audit trail of agent coordination."

# Push to the branch
git push
```

This ensures the full agent communication history is preserved in the PR and merged with the code.

---

## Step 10: Report Result

### Check for All Approvals

Required approvals (check PR comments):
- `✅ APPROVED - Architect` (always)
- `✅ APPROVED - Tester` (always)
- `✅ APPROVED - Designer` (if UI changes)

No outstanding `❌ CHANGES REQUESTED`.

### Success

If all approvals present:

```
Report: "SUCCESS: PR #{pr_number} is ready for merge"

Include:
- PR number
- Issue number
- Summary of what was implemented
```

### Blocked

If dependencies not met (from Step 3):

```
Report: "BLOCKED: Issue #{ISSUE_NUMBER} is blocked on #{dep_number}"
```

### Escalated

If developer escalated to architect, and architect also stuck:

```
Report: "ESCALATED: Issue #{ISSUE_NUMBER} requires human intervention"

Include:
- What was tried
- Where it got stuck
- Error details
```

---

## Exit States

The caller (either /work command or /work-all orchestrator) will parse the output for these indicators:

| State | Output Contains | Meaning |
|-------|-----------------|---------|
| SUCCESS | "PR #X is ready for merge" | All reviews approved, ready to merge |
| BLOCKED | "blocked on #" | Dependencies not met |
| ESCALATED | "requires human intervention" or "Escalating" | Stuck, needs human |

---

## Orchestration Folder After Completion

After working on issue #42, the folder should contain:

```
orchestration/issues/42-user-auth/
├── BRIEFING-design-specs.md          # (if UI) What designer was asked to do
├── REPORT-design-specs.md            # (if UI) What designer did
├── BRIEFING-implement.md             # What developer was asked to do
├── REPORT-implement.md               # What developer did
├── REPORT-design-review-inline.md    # (if implementation team) Designer's inline feedback
├── BRIEFING-architect-review.md      # What architect was asked to review
├── REPORT-architect-review.md        # Architect's review findings
├── BRIEFING-designer-review.md       # (if UI) What designer was asked to review
├── REPORT-designer-review.md         # (if UI) Designer's review findings
├── BRIEFING-test.md                  # What tester was asked to verify
├── REPORT-test.md                    # Tester's verification results
├── REPORT-team-review.md             # (if review team) Synthesized team findings
├── BRIEFING-address-feedback.md      # (if changes requested) Feedback to address
└── REPORT-address-feedback.md        # (if changes requested) How feedback was addressed
```

This provides a complete audit trail of all agent communication for the issue, whether using subagents or teams.
