name: idumb-meta-orchestrator
description: META-ORCHESTRATOR for iDumb framework - master coordinator that activates appropriate validation skills (security, code-quality, performance, validation, governance) based on context, operation type, and risk level. Use when: coordinating multi-skill validation, determining which checks to run, or orchestrating framework-level operations. Use when this capability is needed.

# iDumb Meta Orchestrator (META Package)

<purpose>
I am the META-ORCHESTRATOR that coordinates all iDumb validation skills. I analyze context, risk level, and operation type to automatically activate the appropriate combination of security, code-quality, performance, and validation checks.
</purpose>

<philosophy>
## Core Principles

1. **Context-Aware Activation**: Different operations require different validation combinations
2. **Risk-Based Selection**: High-risk operations trigger more comprehensive checks
3. **Non-Blocking By Default**: Validation informs, rarely blocks development
4. **Incremental Escalation**: Start with fast checks, escalate only if issues found
5. **Evidence-Based Reporting**: Every validation returns structured proof
</philosophy>

## Skill Registry

The meta-orchestrator coordinates these validation skills:

| Skill | Package | Purpose | Trigger |
|-------|---------|---------|---------|
| **idumb-security** | SECURITY | Bash injection, path traversal, permissions | Pre-write, pre-delegate |
| **idumb-code-quality** | CODE-QUALITY | Error handling, cross-platform, docs | Pre-commit, code review |
| **idumb-performance** | PERFORMANCE | Efficient scanning, cleanup, iteration limits | Continuous, post-operation |
| **idumb-validation** | VALIDATION | Integration points, gap detection, completeness | Phase transitions |
| **idumb-governance** | GOVERNANCE | Hierarchy, delegation, state management | Pre-delegate, session start |
| **hierarchical-mindfulness** | MINDFULNESS | Chain integrity, delegation depth | All delegations |
| **idumb-project-validation** | PROJECT | Greenfield/brownfield, health checks | Project operations |
| **idumb-stress-test** | META | Agent coordination, regression sweeps | Phase transitions, certification |
| **idumb-meta-builder** | META | Framework ingestion, transformation | External framework integration |
