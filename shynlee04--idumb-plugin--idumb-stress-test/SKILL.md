# iDumb Stress Test Skill (META Package)

<purpose>
I am the META stress-testing skill for the iDumb framework itself. I validate that all agents, commands, workflows, and tools work together flawlessly. I am the perfectionist's tool for ensuring zero conflicts, zero gaps, and zero drift in the governance system.
</purpose>

<philosophy>
## Core Principles

1. **Coordinator-Driven Activation**: The coordinator decides when to run micro vs batch validation based on conditions
2. **Iterative Until Pass**: Loops continue until ALL checks pass, not until a counter expires
3. **Self-Healing**: Automatically fix what can be fixed, escalate what cannot
4. **Non-Blocking**: Validations run without blocking development flow
5. **Evidence-Based**: Every claim backed by file:line citations
6. **Regression Prevention**: Changes never break existing functionality
</philosophy>

## Activation Modes

<activation_modes>
### Mode 1: Micro-Validation (Real-Time)

**Trigger Conditions:**
```yaml
micro_validation_triggers:
  - agent_action_complete: true
  - file_modified: "src/agents/*.md OR src/commands/*.md OR src/workflows/*.md"
  - delegation_chain_extended: true
  - state_write_occurred: true
```

**Coordinator Decision Logic:**
```yaml
use_micro_when:
  - high_risk_action: "write to governance files"
  - chain_depth: "> 2"
  - previous_validation_failed: true
  - user_requested: "strict mode"
```

**Checks (Fast, <5s):**
- Permission violation detection
- Chain integrity verification
- State consistency check
- Immediate conflict detection

### Mode 2: Batch-Validation (Phase Transition)

**Trigger Conditions:**
```yaml
batch_validation_triggers:
  - phase_transition: "discussed → planned → executed → verified"
  - milestone_complete: true
  - session_end: true
  - user_requested: "/idumb:stress-test"
```

**Coordinator Decision Logic:**
```yaml
use_batch_when:
  - phase_boundary_reached: true
  - multiple_files_changed: "> 5 files"
  - significant_time_elapsed: "> 30 minutes since last"
  - before_commit: true
```

**Checks (Thorough, <60s):**
- Full integration matrix validation
- Agent coordination stress test
- Regression sweep across all components
- Gap detection with resolution planning

### Mode 3: Full Stress Test (Comprehensive)

**Trigger Conditions:**
```yaml
full_stress_test_triggers:
  - user_requested: "/idumb:stress-test --full"
  - major_release_prep: true
  - post_transformation: true
  - certification_required: true
```

**Checks (Complete, <5min):**
- All micro checks
- All batch checks
- Agent spawning simulation
- Workflow chain execution
- Conflict matrix generation
- OpenCode compatibility verification
</activation_modes>

  - circular_delegation:
      detect: "A delegates to B, B delegates to A"
      resolution: "Break cycle by hierarchy"
      
  - permission_overlap:
      detect: "Non-leaf has write + task permissions"
      resolution: "Remove one permission"
```

#### Type 2: Agent-Tool Conflicts
```yaml
