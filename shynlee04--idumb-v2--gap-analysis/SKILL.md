# Skill: Gap Analysis

Systematically identify what's missing, unknown, or needs investigation before 
making changes. Turn vague requirements into comprehensive gap assessments.

## When to Use This Skill

**Trigger this skill when:**
- Proposing new features or changes
- Making technical decisions or architecture choices
- Implementing solutions without full context
- Modifying existing systems or modules
- Integrating new dependencies or third-party services
- Migrating or refactoring code

**Do NOT use when:**
- Research is complete and implementation is straightforward
- Changes are trivial and isolated (e.g., typo fix)
- Context is already comprehensive and gaps are identified

## Gap Analysis Framework

### Step 1: Map the Current State

Before identifying gaps, establish what exists:

**Questions to ask:**
```
What do we know?
- [Existing systems, features, patterns]
- [Current architecture, tech stack, tools]
- [Related implementations, similar code]
- [Documentation, tests, existing research]

What don't we know?
- [Missing context, unknowns, assumptions]
- [Areas not yet investigated]
- [Dependencies not yet mapped]
- [Edge cases not yet considered]
```

**Tools to use:**
- `idumb_scan` - Framework detection and structure analysis
- `idumb_codemap` - Symbol extraction to find related code
- `idumb_read` - Entity-aware reading to gather context
- `grep` - Search for patterns across codebase

### Step 2: Identify Gap Categories

Use this systematic framework to identify gaps across 8 dimensions:

| Category | Questions to Ask | Common Gaps |
|----------|------------------|-------------|
| **Context** | What's the background? Why this change now? | Missing requirements, unclear motivation |
| **Knowledge** | What do we need to know before starting? | Unresearched dependencies, unknown edge cases |
| **Integration** | How does this connect to existing systems? | Unmapped dependencies, breaking changes |
| **Dependencies** | What does this depend on? What depends on this? | Missing dependency analysis, circular deps |
| **Constraints** | What limitations exist? Technical, business, timeline? | Unstated constraints, unrealistic assumptions |
| **Validation** | How will we know this works? | Missing tests, unclear success criteria |
| **Rollback** | What if this fails? | Missing rollback plan, no migration path |
| **Documentation** | How will this be documented? | Missing doc plan, unclear maintenance burden |

### Step 3: Prioritize Gaps by Impact

Not all gaps are equal. Prioritize using this matrix:

```
HIGH IMPACT + HIGH LIKELIHOOD  →  Critical gaps (address immediately)
HIGH IMPACT + LOW LIKELIHOOD     →  Important gaps (have contingency plan)
LOW IMPACT + HIGH LIKELIHOOD     →  Watchlist (monitor during implementation)
LOW IMPACT + LOW LIKELIHOOD      →  Nice-to-know (research if time permits)
```

**Impact dimensions to consider:**
- Blockers: Will this prevent implementation?
- Risk: How likely is this to cause problems?
- Cost: How expensive to fix if we get it wrong?
- Time: How long to investigate?
- Complexity: How complex to address?

### Step 4: Create Gap Investigation Plan

For each prioritized gap, define:

```
Gap: [Description]
Impact: [Critical/Important/Watchlist/Nice-to-know]
Investigation needed:
  - [Step 1]
  - [Step 2]
  - [Step 3]
Expected output: [What we'll learn]
Estimated effort: [Time/resource estimate]
Owner: [Who investigates]
```

### Step 5: Validate Gap Completeness

Use this checklist to ensure you haven't missed anything:

```
- [ ] Context gaps: Requirements, motivation, background understood?
- [ ] Knowledge gaps: Dependencies, patterns, edge cases identified?
- [ ] Integration gaps: Connections to existing systems mapped?
- [ ] Dependency gaps: Forward and backward dependencies clear?
- [ ] Constraint gaps: Technical, business, timeline constraints known?
- [ ] Validation gaps: Tests, success criteria defined?
- [ ] Rollback gaps: Migration path, rollback plan clear?
- [ ] Documentation gaps: Doc plan, maintenance burden understood?
```

### Step 6: Present Gap Analysis

Structure findings clearly for stakeholder review:

```
## Gap Analysis Summary

**Proposal:** [What we're proposing to change]
**Total Gaps Identified:** [X critical, Y important, Z watchlist]

### Critical Gaps (Must Address)

**1. [Gap Name]**
- **Issue:** [Description]
- **Impact:** [Why critical]
- **Investigation:** [What to research]
- **Estimate:** [Effort]

### Important Gaps (Should Address)

**2. [Gap Name]**
...

### Watchlist (Monitor During Implementation)

**3. [Gap Name]**
...

### Recommended Next Steps

1. [Address critical gaps first]
2. [Research important gaps in parallel]
3. [Monitor watchlist during implementation]
4. [Consider nice-to-know gaps if time permits]

**Ready to proceed with implementation?**
```

## Gap Analysis Integration with iDumb v2

### Using `idumb_codemap` for Dependency Gaps

```typescript
// Find all imports/references to a module
const codemap = await idumb_codemap({ action: "graph", path: "src/user-module" });
// Returns: dependency graph showing all dependents
```

### Using `idumb_scan` for Context Gaps

```typescript
// Scan project to understand current state
const scan = await idumb_scan({ action: "frameworks" });
// Returns: detected frameworks, technologies, patterns
```

### Using `idumb_read` for Knowledge Gaps

```typescript
// Read entity with outline mode to understand structure
const outline = await idumb_read({ 
  path: "src/auth", 
  mode: "outline" 
});
// Returns: structure + entity context, reveals patterns
```

### Using `grep` for Pattern Gaps

```typescript
// Search for patterns across codebase
const cachingPatterns = await grep({ 
  pattern: "cache|Cache|CACHE", 
  include: "*.ts" 
});
// Returns: all caching implementations and usages
```

## Gap Analysis vs Risk Assessment

**Gap Analysis** is proactive - identifies what's missing BEFORE starting work

**Risk Assessment** is reactive - identifies what could go wrong during/after work

Both are important, but gap analysis happens FIRST:
1. Gap Analysis → Ensure we have complete picture
2. Risk Assessment → Plan for what might go wrong

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Jumping to solutions before identifying gaps**  
→ Must understand what's missing before proposing fixes

❌ **Assuming gaps don't exist**  
→ There are always gaps. Even "simple" changes have unknowns.

❌ **Prioritizing based on difficulty instead of impact**  
→ Focus on impact first, then difficulty

❌ **Skipping validation step**  
→ Use checklist to ensure comprehensive coverage

❌ **Not presenting findings to stakeholders**  
→ Gap analysis is useless if people don't act on it

❌ **Treating all gaps equally**  
→ Prioritize ruthlessly using impact/likelihood matrix

❌ **Not updating gap analysis as new information emerges**  
→ Gaps evolve as you learn more. Keep analysis current.

## Integration with Other Skills

Use **before**:
- `research-workflow-planner` - Gap analysis informs research scope
- `multi-aspect-assessment` - Gaps are one aspect to assess

Use **after**:
- `intent-clarification` - Gap analysis clarifies intent further

Use **in parallel with**:
- `opencode-primitive-selector` - Choose tools to investigate gaps

## Success Criteria

Gap analysis is successful when:
- ✓ All 8 gap dimensions have been considered
- ✓ Critical gaps are identified and prioritized
- ✓ Investigation plan exists for each prioritized gap
- ✓ Stakeholder has reviewed and approved findings
- ✓ Implementation can proceed with confidence
- ✓ Unknowns are now known or at least documented

## Outcome

After using this skill:
- Unknowns are identified and prioritized
- Investigation plan is clear
- Stakeholder is aligned on what needs to be researched
- Ready to proceed with `research-workflow-planner` or implementation

**Never start implementation without gap analysis.** This skill catches problems before they happen.
