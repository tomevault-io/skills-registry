# Skill: Intent Clarification

Transform vague, underspecified research requests into precise, actionable research 
plans before executing any research activities.

## When to Use This Skill

**Trigger this skill when:**
- User says "research", "investigate", "analyze", "look into", "find out" without specifics
- Request lacks: scope, goals, deliverables, success criteria, time constraints
- Request is ambiguous about: what to research, why it's needed, who will use findings
- User's prompt is > 10 lines or response is absurdly short → MUST trigger clarification
- Request mixes research with implementation → separate concerns

**Do NOT use when:**
- Request is already specific: "Investigate why user login fails with error 403"
- Request clearly defines: scope, goals, deliverables, success criteria
- User explicitly provides context, constraints, and expected outcomes

## Intent Clarification Framework

### Step 1: Detect Ambiguity

Check if the request is missing any of these critical elements:

| Element | What It Looks Like | Why It Matters |
|---------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Scope** | "What exactly should I research?" | Avoids over-researching or missing key areas |
| **Goal** | "What problem are we solving?" | Focuses research on actionable outcomes |
| **Deliverables** | "What output do you expect?" | Defines success criteria upfront |
| **Context** | "Background, constraints, assumptions?" | Prevents researching irrelevant areas |
| **Audience** | "Who will use these findings?" | Determines depth and format of output |

### Step 2: Ask Targeted Questions

Use the **5W1H framework** to structure clarification questions:

```
WHAT:   What specifically do you want to know?
WHY:    Why is this research needed now? What will it enable?
WHO:    Who will use the findings? Decision-maker? Developer? Architect?
WHERE:  In what context will this be applied? Specific feature, system, or project?
WHEN:   By when do you need this? Any time constraints or deadlines?
HOW:    How detailed should the findings be? High-level summary vs deep dive?
```

**Question phrasing principles:**
- Ask ONE question at a time (avoid overwhelming user)
- Use binary choices when possible (A vs B) to reduce cognitive load
- Provide examples to clarify abstract concepts
- Offer default assumptions if user is uncertain

### Step 3: Validate with Examples

After gathering answers, validate by paraphrasing back:

```
Let me confirm I understand correctly:

**Research Scope:** [restate scope]
**Primary Goal:** [restate goal]
**Key Deliverables:** [list expected outputs]
**Assumptions:** [list any assumptions]

**Expected Format:** [bullet points, report, code examples?]
**Success Criteria:** [how will you know I succeeded?]

Is this accurate? Any adjustments needed before I begin research?
```

### Step 4: Define Research Boundaries

Explicitly state what will NOT be researched:

```
**Out of Scope:**
- [Area X] - Not relevant to your goal
- [Area Y] - Requires access I don't have
- [Area Z] - Too time-consuming for current timeline

**In Scope:**
- [Primary research area] - Core focus
- [Secondary area] - If time permits

**Approach:**
1. [First step]
2. [Second step]
3. [Final validation]

Ready to proceed?
```

### Step 5: Establish Checkpoints

Define validation moments during research:

```
**Research Checkpoints:**
- ✓ After [X], I'll share initial findings
- ✓ After [Y], I'll validate direction with you
- ✓ Final deliverable: [what you'll receive]

**Stop Conditions:**
- If I find [condition], I'll pause for your input
- If approach isn't working, I'll propose alternatives

Shall I begin?
```

## Common Ambiguity Patterns

### Pattern 1: Overly Broad Requests

```
User: "Research the codebase"
❌ Too vague

Clarification:
"I'd love to help research the codebase! To focus my research effectively:

1. What aspect of the codebase interests you?
   - Architecture patterns?
   - Performance bottlenecks?
   - Security vulnerabilities?
   - Tech stack decisions?

2. What's your goal with this research?
   - Understand how to contribute?
   - Prepare for a migration?
   - Audit code quality?
   - Something else?

3. What format would be most useful?
   - High-level overview?
   - Deep dive into specific areas?
   - Diagrams and documentation?
   - Code examples?"
```

### Pattern 2: Context-Loss from Compaction

```
User: "Why is this slow?" (after context compaction)
❌ Missing context (what is "this"?)

Clarification:
"I notice we've lost some context from the conversation. To help you:

1. What specific functionality is slow?
   - API endpoint? UI component? Database query? Build process?

2. What does "slow" mean here?
   - Response time > X seconds?
   - Slow relative to what baseline?
   - User-reported latency?

3. When did this start happening?
   - After recent changes?
   - Always been slow?
   - Intermittent issue?

Can you provide more context so I can investigate effectively?"
```

### Pattern 3: Mixed Research and Implementation

```
User: "Research how to add OAuth and implement it"
❌ Two distinct concerns mixed together

Clarification:
"I see two distinct activities here. Let's separate them:

**Research Phase:**
- Investigate OAuth integration options
- Analyze compatibility with your stack
- Document recommended approach

**Implementation Phase:**
- Code the OAuth integration
- Write tests
- Update documentation

Should I:
1. Start with research and get your approval before implementation?
2. Focus only on research right now (you'll handle implementation)?
3. Something else?

What's your preference?"
```

### Pattern 4: Missing Success Criteria

```
User: "Analyze the performance"
❌ No definition of what "good performance" means

Clarification:
"To analyze performance effectively, I need to know what "good" looks like:

1. What are your performance targets?
   - Response time < X milliseconds?
   - Throughput > Y requests/second?
   - Memory usage < Z MB?
   - Some other metric?

2. What's the baseline you're comparing against?
   - Current performance numbers?
   - Industry benchmarks?
   - Previous version?

3. What's the business impact?
   - User experience degradation?
   - Resource costs increasing?
   - Something else?

Once I understand your goals, I can focus the analysis on what matters most."
```

## Research Intent Clarification Checklist

Before starting any research, verify:

- [ ] Scope clearly defined (what will/won't be researched)
- [ ] Goal articulated (what problem will this solve)
- [ ] Deliverables specified (what output will you receive)
- [ ] Success criteria established (how will you know it's complete)
- [ ] Context gathered (constraints, assumptions, audience)
- [ ] Checkpoints defined (when will we validate progress)
- [ ] Stop conditions identified (when will I pause for input)
- [ ] Timeline understood (any deadlines or time constraints)
- [ ] Research vs implementation separated (if applicable)
- [ ] Paraphrased back for confirmation (user validated understanding)

## Research Readiness Levels

**Level 1 (Not Ready):** Vague request, multiple ambiguities  
→ **Action:** Trigger this skill, ask clarification questions

**Level 2 (Partially Ready):** Some clarity, but missing key details  
→ **Action:** Ask targeted questions to fill gaps

**Level 3 (Ready):** Specific request with clear goals, scope, deliverables  
→ **Action:** Paraphrase back for confirmation, then proceed with research

**Level 4 (Over-Defined):** Extremely detailed request  
→ **Action:** Validate if this level of detail is necessary or if it indicates micromanagement

## Integration with Other Skills

This skill works well in sequence with:
- **gap-analysis** - After clarifying intent, systematically identify knowledge gaps
- **multi-aspect-assessment** - Evaluate request from multiple angles (technical, business, UX, etc.)
- **research-workflow-planner** - Create structured research plan once intent is clear
- **opencode-primitive-selector** - Choose appropriate OpenCode tools for research execution

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Assuming** what user means instead of asking  
→ Always verify, never assume

❌ **Asking multiple questions at once**  
→ Ask one question at a time, get answer, then ask next

❌ **Skipping paraphrase-back step**  
→ Always validate understanding before proceeding

❌ **Proceeding with research when ambiguity remains**  
→ Better to spend 2 minutes clarifying than 2 hours researching wrong thing

❌ **Not defining what's out of scope**  
→ Explicitly state what you won't research to set expectations

❌ **Forgetting checkpoints**  
→ Define validation moments to catch misalignment early

## Examples of Good vs Bad Clarification

**Bad Clarification:**
```
What do you want to research? Be more specific.
```

**Good Clarification:**
```
To help you effectively, I'd like to understand your research goals:

1. What specific area of authentication are you investigating?
   - Login flow security?
   - Token refresh mechanism?
   - Role-based access control?
   - Something else?

2. What problem are you trying to solve?
   - Security vulnerability?
   - Performance issue?
   - Integration complexity?
   - Another concern?

Let's start with the first question and we'll build from there.
```

## Outcome

After using this skill:
- Research intent is crystal clear
- Scope, goals, deliverables, and success criteria defined
- Research plan established with checkpoints
- Ready to proceed with `gap-analysis`, `multi-aspect-assessment`, or `research-workflow-planner`

**Never start research without clear intent.** This skill is your first line of defense against wasted effort and misaligned deliverables.
