# Skill: Multi-Aspect Assessment

Evaluate requests, proposals, or decisions from multiple dimensions to ensure 
holistic understanding before proceeding.

## When to Use This Skill

**Trigger this skill when:**
- Making technical decisions or architecture choices
- Choosing between multiple solutions or technologies
- Proposing significant changes or features
- Evaluating third-party integrations or dependencies
- Designing systems or user experiences
- Considering migrations or refactors

**Do NOT use when:**
- Decision is trivial and low-impact (e.g., variable naming)
- Previous assessment exists and context hasn't changed
- Decision is already validated and approved

## Assessment Framework

### The 8 Assessment Aspects

Always evaluate across these 8 aspects (add/remove based on context):

| Aspect | Questions to Ask | Key Considerations |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Technical** | Is it technically feasible? What are the technical implications? | Complexity, risk, compatibility, dependencies |
| **Business** | Does it solve a real problem? What's the ROI? | Value, cost, opportunity cost, alignment |
| **User Experience** | How does it affect users? Is it intuitive? | Usability, accessibility, satisfaction |
| **Security** | What are the security implications? Are there vulnerabilities? | Data privacy, attack surface, compliance |
| **Performance** | How does it impact performance? Are there bottlenecks? | Latency, throughput, resource usage, scalability |
| **Maintainability** | How easy is it to maintain? What's the technical debt? | Code quality, documentation, testability |
| **Operational** | How does it affect operations? What's the ops burden? | Deployment, monitoring, debugging, reliability |
| **Strategic** | Does it align with long-term goals? Is it future-proof? | Roadmap, standards, migration path, vendor lock-in |

### Step 1: Identify Relevant Aspects

Not all aspects apply equally. For each proposal:

```
Proposal: [Description]

Relevant Aspects: [Select from 8 aspects above]
- [Aspect 1] - Why relevant?
- [Aspect 2] - Why relevant?
- [Aspect 3] - Why relevant?
- [Aspect 4] - Why relevant?

Less Relevant: [Aspects with minimal impact]
- [Aspect] - Reason it's less relevant
```

### Step 2: Score Each Aspect

For each relevant aspect, use this scoring rubric:

```
Score 1 (Critical Risk): Major blocker, significant downside
Score 2 (Concern): Moderate issue, needs mitigation
Score 3 (Neutral): Neither good nor bad
Score 4 (Benefit): Positive impact, minor benefit
Score 5 (Major Benefit): Significant advantage, strong positive
```

**Assessment Template:**

```
## [Aspect Name]: [Score 1-5]

**Summary:** [One-sentence summary]

**Pros:**
- [Positive outcome 1]
- [Positive outcome 2]

**Cons:**
- [Negative outcome 1]
- [Negative outcome 2]

**Risks:**
- [Risk 1] - [Mitigation strategy]
- [Risk 2] - [Mitigation strategy]

**Recommendation:** [What to do about this aspect]
```

### Step 3: Identify Trade-Offs

Look for conflicts between aspects:

```
Trade-Off Matrix:

Aspect A (Score X) vs Aspect B (Score Y):
- [Describe conflict]
- [Which one wins? Why?]
- [How to mitigate the loser?]

Aspect C (Score X) vs Aspect D (Score Y):
- [Describe conflict]
- [Which one wins? Why?]
- [How to mitigate the loser?]
```

### Step 4: Weigh by Priorities

Not all aspects are equally important. Context matters:

```
Aspect Priorities (Context-Dependent):

High Priority (Must excel):
- [Aspect] - [Why critical in this context]

Medium Priority (Important):
- [Aspect] - [Why important in this context]

Low Priority (Nice-to-have):
- [Aspect] - [Why less important in this context]

Weighted Score Calculation:
- [Aspect]: [Raw Score] × [Weight] = [Weighted Score]
- Total Weighted Score: [Sum]
```

### Step 5: Generate Recommendations

Based on assessment, provide clear guidance:

```
## Assessment Summary

**Proposal:** [Description]
**Overall Assessment:** [Positive/Neutral/Negative]
**Weighted Score:** [Number]/[Max Possible]

### Key Findings

**Strengths:**
- [Major advantage 1]
- [Major advantage 2]

**Weaknesses:**
- [Major concern 1]
- [Major concern 2]

**Trade-Offs:**
- [Trade-off 1] - [Resolution]
- [Trade-off 2] - [Resolution]

### Recommendations

**Go/No-Go:** [Recommendation with confidence level]

**If Go:**
- [Critical mitigation 1]
- [Critical mitigation 2]
- [Success criteria]

**If No-Go:**
- [Alternative 1]
- [Alternative 2]
- [What would make this viable?]

**If Conditional:**
- [Condition 1] - Must be met before proceeding
- [Condition 2] - Must be met before proceeding
- [What changes if conditions are met?]
```

- Enables autonomous teams
- Future-proofs for scale

**Cons:**
- Vendor lock-in to microservices ecosystem
- Harder to reverse back to monolith
- Mismatch if team size is small

**Risks:**
- Microservices for wrong reasons - Mitigate: Clear criteria for when to use microservices

**Recommendation:** Only use microservices if organization meets criteria

### Trade-Offs

Technical (3) vs Operational (2):
- Technical benefits don't justify operational burden
- Neither wins - both are concerns

Business (2) vs Strategic (3):
- Strategic benefits don't justify business costs
- Neither wins - both are concerns

### Priorities

High Priority: Business (must have ROI)
Medium Priority: Strategic (must align with goals)
Low Priority: Technical, Operational, Maintainability (supporting aspects)

### Weighted Score

Strategic: 3 × 0.6 = 1.8
Business: 2 × 1.0 = 2.0
Technical: 3 × 0.3 = 0.9
Operational: 2 × 0.3 = 0.6
Maintainability: 2 × 0.3 = 0.6
**Total: 5.9/15**

### Recommendations

**Go/No-Go:** No-Go (Confidence: 85%)

**Why No-Go:**
- Business case is unclear
- Operational burden is significant
- Technical complexity is high
- ROI is uncertain

**When to Reconsider:**
1. Organization has 50+ developers (microservices scale with team size)
2. Services have clear domain boundaries (DDD)
3. Independent scaling needs are clear (performance issues)
4. Strong operations team exists (24/7 coverage)
5. Business value is measurable and significant

**Alternative:**
- Modular monolith with clear boundaries
- Extract services when there's clear need
- Delay microservices until organization grows

**What Would Make This Viable?**
- Clear business case with measurable ROI
- Proven operational team with distributed systems expertise
- Services have clear domain boundaries with low coupling
- Independent scaling requirements are critical
- Organization is large enough to justify overhead

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Only assessing technical aspects**  
→ Must consider business, UX, security, operations, etc.

❌ **Ignoring trade-offs**  
→ Every decision has trade-offs. Identify and address them.

❌ **Weighting all aspects equally**  
→ Context determines priority. Weight aspects by importance.

❌ **Scoring without justification**  
→ Always explain why you gave a score. Scoring is a conversation starter.

❌ **Not considering context**  
→ Same proposal may have different scores in different contexts.

❌ **Making recommendations without mitigation**  
→ If there are concerns, propose mitigation strategies.

❌ **Binary thinking (go/no-go only)**  
→ Conditional decisions are common. Define conditions clearly.
