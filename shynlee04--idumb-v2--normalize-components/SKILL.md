description: Systematic workflow for reducing oversized components (>300 lines) into focused, composable modules through hook extraction and component decomposition. Use this workflow when splitting large React components, extracting custom hooks, or implementing component composition patterns. Use when this capability is needed.

# Normalize Components Workflow

This Workflow provides Claude Code with step-by-step guidance for normalizing component size.

## When to use this workflow

- When a React component exceeds 300 lines
- When extracting complex state logic into custom hooks
- When separating concerns (UI, state, business logic)
- When implementing component composition patterns
- When reducing component complexity through decomposition

## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Component Analysis (1-2 hours)
**Agent**: component-splitter
**Input**: Oversized component file path
**Output**: Analysis report with refactoring recommendations

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Component size calculated (lines, props, hooks, nesting depth)
- [ ] Composition opportunities identified (nested components, repeated logic)
- [ ] Hook extraction candidates identified (state, effects, event handlers)
- [ ] Concern separation planned (UI, state, business logic)
- [ ] Consumer impact assessed (who uses this component)

### Step 2: Hook Extraction (2-4 hours)
**Agent**: component-splitter
**Input**: Analysis report
**Output**: Custom hooks for complex logic

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Custom hooks created for state management
- [ ] Custom hooks created for side effects
- [ ] Custom hooks created for event handlers
- [ ] Hook dependencies properly managed
- [ ] Hook cleanup implemented where needed
- [ ] Hooks tested independently

### Step 3: Component Decomposition (3-6 hours)
**Agent**: component-splitter
**Input**: Component with extracted hooks
**Output**: Modular sub-components

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Sub-components created for UI sections
- [ ] Composition patterns implemented (render props, children)
- [ ] Props interface stable (backward compatible)
- [ ] Component behavior preserved
- [ ] Styling maintained (design tokens, CSS)
- [ ] Event handlers work identically

### Step 4: Validation & Testing (1-2 hours)
**Agent**: component-splitter
**Input**: Refactored components
**Output**: Validation report

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] All components ≤300 lines
- [ ] Zero TypeScript errors
- [ ] Zero test failures (100% pass rate)
- [ ] Component behavior validated (manual testing)
- [ ] Props interface stable
- [ ] Custom hooks tested

## Example Usage

```
"Split src/presentation/components/knowledge/KnowledgePage.tsx using the normalize-components workflow"
```

## Validation Commands

```bash
# TypeScript check
pnpm tsc --noEmit --incremental

# Test suite
pnpm test

# Component size verification
find src/presentation/components -name "*.tsx" -exec wc -l {} \; | awk '$1 > 300 {print $2, $1, "lines"}'
```

## Success Criteria

- ✅ All components ≤300 lines
- ✅ Zero TypeScript errors
- ✅ 100% test pass rate
- ✅ Props interface stable
- ✅ Component behavior preserved
- ✅ Custom hooks tested independently
- ✅ Styling maintained (design tokens)
