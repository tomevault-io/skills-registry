# Skill: Research Workflow Planner

Create structured, executable research plans with clear phases, checkpoints, 
and validation criteria.

## When to Use This Skill

**Trigger this skill when:**
- Research intent is clear (use `intent-clarification` first if not)
- Research scope is defined (use `gap-analysis` if not)
- Gaps are identified and prioritized (use `gap-analysis` if not)
- Need a systematic approach to execute research
- Research involves multiple steps, sources, or phases
- Stakeholder approval required before research begins

**Do NOT use when:**
- Research is trivial (single web search or file read)
- Research plan already exists
- Intent is unclear (use `intent-clarification` first)
- Scope or gaps are undefined (use `gap-analysis` first)

## Research Workflow Framework

### Step 1: Define Research Objectives

Start with clear, measurable objectives:

```
Research Title: [Descriptive title]

Primary Objective:
[What is the main goal? Must be specific and measurable]

Secondary Objectives:
[What additional goals support the primary objective?]

Success Criteria:
[How will we know when research is complete?]
- [Criterion 1 - measurable]
- [Criterion 2 - measurable]
- [Criterion 3 - measurable]

Research Question(s):
[What questions will this research answer?]
1. [Question 1]
2. [Question 2]
3. [Question 3]
```

### Step 2: Identify Information Sources

Map out where information will come from:

```
Primary Sources (Direct Investigation):
- [Codebase analysis - codemap, grep, read]
- [Internal documentation - AGENTS.md, docs, comments]
- [Running the system - logs, metrics, behavior]
- [Existing tests - test files reveal expected behavior]

Secondary Sources (External Research):
- [Official documentation - SDK docs, API references]
- [Community resources - Stack Overflow, GitHub issues]
- [Best practices - blog posts, conference talks]
- [Comparison studies - benchmarks, case studies]
- [Industry standards - RFCs, specifications]

Tertiary Sources (Contextual Understanding):
- [Similar code in this codebase - patterns, conventions]
- [Related features - dependencies, integrations]
- [Historical context - git history, previous decisions]
```

### Step 3: Structure Research Phases

Break research into logical phases with clear deliverables:

```
Phase 1: Discovery
Goal: [What will this phase achieve?]
Duration: [Estimated time]
Deliverables: [What will you have at the end?]
  - [Deliverable 1]
  - [Deliverable 2]
Checkpoint: [What validates completion?]
  
Phase 2: Deep Dive
Goal: [What will this phase achieve?]
Duration: [Estimated time]
Deliverables: [What will you have at the end?]
  - [Deliverable 1]
  - [Deliverable 2]
Checkpoint: [What validates completion?]
  
Phase 3: Validation
Goal: [What will this phase achieve?]
Duration: [Estimated time]
Deliverables: [What will you have at the end?]
  - [Deliverable 1]
  - [Deliverable 2]
Checkpoint: [What validates completion?]
  
Phase 4: Synthesis
Goal: [What will this phase achieve?]
Duration: [Estimated time]
Deliverables: [What will you have at the end?]
  - [Deliverable 1]
  - [Deliverable 2]
Checkpoint: [What validates completion?]
```

### Step 4: Define Phase Tasks

For each phase, break down into specific tasks:

```
Phase X: [Phase Name]

Tasks:
1. [Task name]
   - Description: [What to do]
   - Tools: [Which OpenCode tools to use]
   - Output: [What will this produce]
   - Estimated time: [How long?]
   - Dependencies: [What must happen first?]
   
2. [Task name]
   - Description: [What to do]
   - Tools: [Which OpenCode tools to use]
   - Output: [What will this produce]
   - Estimated time: [How long?]
   - Dependencies: [What must happen first?]
```

### Step 5: Specify Checkpoints and Validation

Define validation moments at checkpoints:

```
Checkpoint: After [Phase/Task]

Validation Questions:
- [Question 1 - has phase delivered its outputs?]
- [Question 2 - is direction still correct?]
- [Question 3 - should we adjust approach?]

Approval Required: [Yes/No - if yes, who approves?]

Stop Conditions:
- If [condition], pause for input
- If [condition], adjust plan
- If [condition], abort research

Go/No-Go Decision:
- [Criteria for continuing]
- [Criteria for stopping]
```

### Step 6: Define Final Deliverables

Specify what research will produce:

```
Research Outputs:

Primary Deliverable:
[Main research output - report, recommendation, analysis]
- Format: [markdown, presentation, code examples, etc.]
- Structure: [sections, sections, sections]
- Audience: [who will read this?]

Secondary Deliverables:
- [Supporting materials - data, code snippets, diagrams]
- [Supporting materials - links, references, citations]
- [Supporting materials - action items, recommendations]

Artifacts to Create:
- [Document 1 - e.g., .idumb/research/analysis-2026-02-08.md]
- [Document 2 - e.g., .idumb/brain/knowledge/finding.md]
- [Document 3 - e.g., implementation recommendations]

Documentation Format:
- Structure: [outline of document]
- Evidence: [how to cite sources?]
- Recommendations: [how to structure recommendations?]
```

### Step 7: Estimate Resources

Define what's needed for research:

```

Time Estimates:
Phase 1: [X hours/days]
Phase 2: [X hours/days]
Phase 3: [X hours/days]
Phase 4: [X hours/days]
Total: [X hours/days]

Buffer Time: [X% for unknowns, contingencies]
Total with Buffer: [X hours/days]

Tool Access Needed:
- [idumb_webfetch for external docs]
- [idumb_codemap for dependency analysis]
- [idumb_read for code investigation]
- [grep for pattern searching]
- [bash for running commands if needed]

External Resources:
- [URLs to fetch - official docs, APIs, etc.]
- [Tools to install if needed]
- [Access needed - APIs, accounts, etc.]

Risks and Contingencies:
- [Risk 1] - [Mitigation]
- [Risk 2] - [Mitigation]
```

### Step 8: Create Research Plan Document

Compile into a comprehensive plan:

```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Creating vague objectives**  
→ Objectives must be specific and measurable

❌ **Skipping checkpoints**  
→ Checkpoints catch misalignment early. Define them clearly.

❌ **Not estimating buffer time**  
→ Research always takes longer than expected. Add 20-30% buffer.

❌ **Forgetting validation criteria**  
→ How will you know a phase is complete? Define criteria.

❌ **Ignoring stakeholder approval**  
→ Research is worthless if stakeholder doesn't accept outputs.

❌ **Planning in isolation**  
→ Validate plan with stakeholder before executing.

❌ **Not defining stop conditions**  
→ When should you pause or abort? Define conditions upfront.

❌ **Over-planning**  
→ Don't plan every detail. Keep phases and tasks high-level enough to adapt.

❌ **Not using the right tools**  
→ Use `opencode-primitive-selector` to choose appropriate tools.

❌ **Skipping documentation**  
→ Create artifacts as you go. Don't wait until the end.

## Integration with Other Skills

Use **after**:
- `intent-clarification` - Ensure intent is clear before planning
- `gap-analysis` - Ensure gaps are identified before planning
- `multi-aspect-assessment` - Use assessment to inform research scope

Use **with**:
- `opencode-primitive-selector` - Choose tools for each task

Use **before**:
- Research execution (following the plan)

## Success Criteria

Research workflow plan is successful when:
- ✓ Objectives are specific and measurable
- ✓ Phases are logical with clear goals
- ✓ Tasks are actionable with tools specified
- ✓ Checkpoints have validation criteria
- ✓ Deliverables are clearly defined
- ✓ Time estimates include buffer
- ✓ Stakeholder approves plan before execution
- ✓ Plan is documented in `.idumb/research/` or `.idumb/brain/`

## Outcome

After using this skill:
- Clear research plan with phases, tasks, and deliverables
- Defined checkpoints and validation criteria
- Resource estimates with buffer time
- Stakeholder approval to proceed
- Ready to execute research systematically

**Never execute research without a plan.** This skill transforms research goals into actionable workflows.
