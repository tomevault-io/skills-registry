# Workspace File System E2E Workflow

This Workflow provides Claude Code with step-by-step guidance for implementing workspace file system E2E.

## When to use this workflow

- When implementing file system E2E for a workspace (IDE, Notes, Knowledge)
- When auditing FSA (File System Access API) permission models
- When creating agent tool permission matrices
- When handling concurrent file access and synchronization
- When integrating AI synthesis with workspace file systems

## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: File System Strategy Definition (2-3 hours)
**Agent**: workspace-architect
**Input**: Workspace type (IDE, Notes, Knowledge)
**Output**: File system strategy document

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Desktop strategy defined (FSA API with bi-directional sync)
- [ ] Mobile strategy defined (IndexedDB with sync-to-FSA)
- [ ] Permission handling specified (FSA requests, graceful degradation)
- [ ] Concurrent access strategy defined (file locking, conflict resolution)
- [ ] AI integration approach defined (per-file, batch, RAG)

### Step 2: Permission Model Implementation (3-4 hours)
**Agent**: workspace-architect
**Input**: File system strategy
**Output**: Permission model + agent tool matrix

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] FSA permission audit completed
- [ ] Agent tool permission matrix created
- [ ] Permission request UI implemented (user prompts)
- [ ] Permission persistence handled (session vs permanent)
- [ ] Permission revocation support (user can revoke)

### Step 3: Concurrent Access Handling (3-4 hours)
**Agent**: workspace-architect
**Input**: Permission model
**Output**: File locking + conflict resolution

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] File locking mechanism implemented
- [ ] Conflict resolution strategies defined (last-write-wins, merge, user-choice)
- [ ] Concurrent operation queuing
- [ ] Optimistic locking with retry
- [ ] User prompts for conflicting changes

### Step 4: Sync Implementation (4-6 hours)
**Agent**: file-sync-specialist
**Input**: Concurrent access handler
**Output**: Sync service + status indicators

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Sync service implemented (bi-directional, batch, throttle)
- [ ] Sync status indicators created (UI components)
- [ ] Conflict resolution UI (user choice prompts)
- [ ] Offline-first support (IndexedDB queue)
- [ ] Sync error recovery (retry logic, rollback)

### Step 5: AI Integration (3-5 hours)
**Agent**: workspace-architect
**Input**: Sync service
**Output**: AI synthesis integration

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Per-file AI synthesis implemented
- [ ] Batch AI synthesis implemented
- [ ] RAG pipeline integration (Knowledge workspace)
- [ ] AI tool permissions (read, write with user consent)
- [ ] Progress indicators for AI operations

### Step 6: E2E Validation (2-3 hours)
**Agent**: workspace-architect
**Input**: Complete E2E implementation
**Output**: Validation report

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] E2E tests passing (critical user journeys)
- [ ] Permission model validated (all scenarios)
- [ ] Concurrent access tested (no data loss)
- [ ] Sync reliability validated (offline, online, conflicts)
- [ ] AI integration tested (per-file, batch)
- [ ] Zero data loss scenarios

## Example Usage

```
"Implement Notes workspace file system E2E using the workspace-file-system-e2e workflow"
```

## Validation Commands

```bash
# TypeScript check
pnpm tsc --noEmit --incremental

# Test suite
pnpm test

# E2E tests for workspace
pnpm test workspace-*

# File system sync validation
pnpm test sync-*
```

## Success Criteria

- ✅ File system E2E implemented (read, write, sync)
- ✅ Permission model hardened (FSA, agent tools)
- ✅ Concurrent access handled (file locking, conflicts)
- ✅ AI integration working (per-file, batch)
- ✅ Sync status indicators visible
- ✅ Zero data loss scenarios
- ✅ E2E tests passing
