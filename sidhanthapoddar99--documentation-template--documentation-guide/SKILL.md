description: Use this skill for ANY work in a documentation-template project — writing markdown, working with the issue tracker (issues, subtasks, comments, agent-logs), creating blog posts, editing docs pages, configuring site.yaml / navbar.yaml / footer.yaml / .env, and anything touching files under the project's `data/` folder. The skill triages the task to a domain-specific reference file (writing, docs-layout, blog-layout, issue-layout, settings-layout). TRIGGER eagerly — documentation work in this project almost always benefits from this skill. Use it whenever the user mentions docs, frontmatter, settings.json, the todo / issues tracker, blog posts, the data folder, content types, themes, or any file under the project's content folders. SKIP only for pure framework source-code work under `astro-doc-code/src/` that doesn't touch any documentation file.

# Documentation skill

Operating manual for working in an Astro-based documentation-template project. The project's content + config live under the user's `data/` and `config/` folders and render through Astro layouts shipped inside the `documentation-template/` framework folder. The framework's *own* bundled docs (the canonical user-guide for the framework itself) live at `documentation-template/default-docs/data/user-guide/` — read those when this skill is unclear.

> **Two modes.** *Consumer mode* (the default) — the framework is a subfolder of the user's project (`<project>/documentation-template/`) and the user's content lives at the project root (`config/`, `data/`, `assets/`, `themes/` next to the framework folder). *Dogfood mode* — the framework repo *is* the project; content lives under `default-docs/`. The scripts derive the actual location from `.env` (`CONFIG_DIR`), so this skill describes paths relative to **the user's content folders** and the underlying scripts handle both modes. Where this skill says `data/`, the script resolves to `<project>/data/` (consumer) or `<framework>/default-docs/data/` (dogfood).

## Triage — which reference file to read

Pick the reference file that matches the task. Read **only the one(s) you need** — they're independent and self-contained.

| If the task involves… | Domain | Read |
|---|---|---|
| Writing markdown, frontmatter, custom tags, asset embedding (across any content type) | writing | `references/writing.md` |
| Files under `data/<sidebar-driven-section>/` (e.g. `user-guide/`, `dev-docs/`) | docs-layout | `references/docs-layout.md` |
| Files under `data/blog/` (flat `YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`) | blog-layout | `references/blog-layout.md` |
| Files under `data/todo/` or any issue tracker (folder-per-item, `settings.json`, subtasks, comments, agent-logs) | issue-layout | `references/issue-layout.md` |
| `site.yaml` / `navbar.yaml` / `footer.yaml` / `.env` / paths / themes / project setup | settings-layout | `references/settings-layout.md` |

Cross-cutting tasks read multiple references. Example: *"add a new docs section and write its first page"* → read `settings-layout.md` (registering the section) **and** `writing.md` (writing the page).

## Project orientation

**Consumer mode** (default) — the user's project root, with the framework as a subfolder:

```
<your-project>/                   ← user's project root
├── config/                       ← site.yaml, navbar.yaml, footer.yaml
├── data/                         ← all content (docs, blog, issues, custom)
│   ├── user-guide/               ← (your own user-guide, if any)
│   ├── blog/                     ← blog posts
│   ├── todo/                     ← issue tracker (folder-per-item)
│   └── README.md                 ← MAP of every top-level data folder (read first)
├── assets/                       ← static assets served at /assets/
├── themes/                       ← optional custom themes
├── layouts/                      ← optional custom layouts (with LAYOUT_EXT_DIR set)
└── documentation-template/       ← FRAMEWORK FOLDER — don't edit
    ├── start                     ← bash wrapper: `./start [dev|build|preview|<script>]`
    ├── .env                      ← CONFIG_DIR=../config (consumer) or ./default-docs/config (dogfood)
    ├── astro-doc-code/           ← framework code (src/, package.json, astro.config.mjs)
    │   └── src/layouts/          ← per-content-type layouts (docs, blog, issues, custom)
    ├── default-docs/             ← framework's bundled content (its own user-guide / dev-docs / themes / template)
    └── plugins/                  ← repo-local plugins (e.g. documentation-guide)
```

**Dogfood mode** — the framework repo *is* the project; the structure above collapses (no outer wrapper). Content lives under `documentation-template/default-docs/` and `CONFIG_DIR=./default-docs/config`. Same code path either way; only `CONFIG_DIR` differs.

**The most important rule:** the framework's bundled user-guide at `documentation-template/default-docs/data/user-guide/` is the **canonical source of truth** for everything this skill describes. When this skill is unclear, ambiguous, or stale, the user-guide wins. Each reference file points to its corresponding user-guide section.

## Read `data/README.md` first

Every project should have a `data/README.md` that maps the data layout — what each top-level folder contains, its purpose, and how it's served. **Read it at the start of any task** to learn the project's content shape. The framework supports `user-guide/`, `dev-docs/`, `blog/`, `todo/`, `pages/` out of the box, but a project may add custom ones (e.g. an `internal-knowledge-base/`, a separate `meeting-notes/`, etc.).

If `data/README.md` doesn't exist, **create one** before doing the requested task — the skill is far more useful when this map exists, and the cost is low. When you add or remove a top-level folder under `data/`, **update the README in the same change** so future agents (and humans) don't drift.

## Universal conventions

These apply across all domains. Reference files don't repeat them — they assume you know.

- **`XX_` prefix** — folders and files inside `data/<docs-section>/` use a 2-digit numeric prefix (`01_`, `05_`, `10_`, …) for ordering. Issues and blog posts do **not** use this prefix.
- **`settings.json`** — every docs folder has one (sidebar label, position). Issue trackers have a root `settings.json` declaring vocabulary. Issues have a per-issue `settings.json` for metadata.
- **Frontmatter `title`** — required on every markdown file. Astro builds will fail without it.
- **Theme variables only** — when editing CSS in layouts, consume declared theme variables (see `astro-doc-code/src/styles/theme.yaml → required_variables`). Never hardcode colours, fonts, or invent variable names.
- **Edit, don't rewrite** — prefer `Edit` over `Write` for existing files. Surgical regex replaces preserve formatting and key order in JSON.
- **`./start` is the entrypoint** — from the repo root, `./start` (preflight: detect bun/npm → install if needed → sanity build → dev), or `./start dev | build | preview` to skip preflight and forward to that script. Inside `astro-doc-code/`, `bun run dev` / `bun run build` / `bun run preview` still work directly. For helper scripts and any Node CLI tool, prefer `bun` if available, fall back to `npm` / `node`.

## Helper scripts — 12 CLI wrappers on PATH

This plugin ships 12 CLI wrappers in its `bin/` folder, which Claude Code adds to `PATH` automatically when the plugin is installed. Just type the command — no path needed.

**Issue tracker (8):**

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `docs-list` | Multi-field filter + free-text regex search over the tracker |
| `docs-show` | One issue's metadata + subtask summary + comment & agent-log heads |
| `docs-subtasks` | List subtasks for one issue, or across all (`--all`) |
| `docs-agent-logs` | Last N agent-log entries for an issue |
| `docs-set-state` | Update issue or subtask state |
| `docs-add-comment` | Append a comment with auto-incremented prefix |
| `docs-add-agent-log` | Append an agent-log entry with auto-incremented iteration |
| `docs-review-queue` | Items awaiting review (status=review issues + open issues with review subtasks) |

**Validators (3):**

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `docs-check-blog` | Validate the blog folder — `YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md` naming, frontmatter `title:`, no nested folders. Resolves the blog path from `.env` (`<content-root>/blog/`); pass an explicit folder to override. See `references/blog-layout.md`. |
| `docs-check-config` | Validate `site.yaml` / `navbar.yaml` / `footer.yaml` — required keys, `pages:` structure, `data:` path resolution, footer `page:` references. Resolves the config dir from `.env`; pass an explicit folder to override. See `references/settings-layout.md`. |
| `docs-check-section` | Validate a docs section — `XX_` prefix discipline, `settings.json` presence, frontmatter `title:`, prefix collisions. Required arg: section folder (e.g. `data/user-guide`). See `references/docs-layout.md`. |

**Content ops (1):**

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `docs-move` | Move / rename a docs `.md` file or folder **link-aware** — rewrites every Markdown link that pointed at the moved path (inbound) and every relative link inside the moved files that pointed elsewhere (outbound) — including link **text** that mirrors the path — so nothing breaks or goes stale. Whenever you move or rename anything under `data/`, reach for `docs-move <from> <to>` instead of `mv` / `git mv` — a plain move silently breaks all those relative links. `--dry-run` previews every edit; uses `git mv` inside a work tree to preserve history. See `references/docs-layout.md`. |

Each wrapper internally uses `bun` if available, falls back to `node`. Pass `--help` to any of them for the full flag list. Validators exit `0` on clean, `1` on errors found — useful in pre-commit / CI.

**Searching the tracker — use `docs-list --search`, not the `Grep` tool.** Any "find / locate / grep / search" verb against `data/todo/` (or any tracker folder) should route to `docs-list`, which understands the schema (vocabulary, subtask states, frontmatter), composes structural filters with regex search in one call, and returns exact paths + line numbers. `Grep` only sees text. See `references/issue-layout.md` for the synonym list and examples.

## Slash commands — bootstrap & section scaffolding

The plugin ships two slash commands for project-level scaffolding:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/docs-init` | Bootstrap a new documentation-template project from zero — interactive: scope (whole repo vs subfolder) → site name/title/description → first section name → writes `config/`, `data/`, starter page, README, patches `CLAUDE.md` at the repo root. Prints the framework-clone command at the end. |
| `/docs-add-section [name]` | Add a new top-level docs section under `data/`. Auto-computes next `XX_` prefix, creates `settings.json` + `01_overview.md`, optionally registers in `config/site.yaml`'s `pages:` block. |

When the user says "set up a new docs project", "scaffold a new site", "add a new section / area / handbook", route to these commands rather than hand-authoring.

## When to spawn a subagent

For bulk file reads (10+ files), spawn a Haiku subagent via the Task/Agent tool to summarise rather than loading every file into the main context. Pattern: give the subagent the file list + the question, ask for a tight report (under 200 words).

The reference files (especially `issue-layout.md`) document concrete subagent patterns for their domain.

## When to update this skill

This skill mirrors the framework's bundled user-guide. If you discover the skill is wrong or out of date relative to the user-guide, **update the skill** rather than working around it — and tell the user. The skill catalogue page (`@root/default-docs/data/user-guide/05_getting-started/05_claude-skills.md` — i.e. inside the framework folder) is the user-facing index of installed skills; keep it in sync.
