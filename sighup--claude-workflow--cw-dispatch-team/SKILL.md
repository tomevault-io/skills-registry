# CW-Dispatch-Team: Team-Based Parallel Agent Dispatcher

## Context Marker

Always begin your response with: **CW-DISPATCH-TEAM**

## Prerequisite: Task List ID

Before dispatching, verify that `CLAUDE_CODE_TASK_LIST_ID` is configured. This env var is **required** so that all teammates share the project's task list instead of diverging to the team's built-in list.

1. Read `.claude/settings.json` and `.claude/settings.local.json` — look for `env.CLAUDE_CODE_TASK_LIST_ID`
2. **If NOT set**: Exit immediately with this error:

```
ERROR: CLAUDE_CODE_TASK_LIST_ID is not set.

Agent teams require this env var to share the project task list.
Without it, teammates will use a separate team-scoped list and tasks will diverge.

Run /cw-plan to auto-configure it, or add it manually to .claude/settings.json:
{
  "env": {
    "CLAUDE_CODE_TASK_LIST_ID": "your-project-name"
  }
}

Then restart your Claude Code session (env vars are captured at startup).
```

3. **If set**: Report the value and the derived team name:
```
CLAUDE_CODE_TASK_LIST_ID = {value}
Team name: {value}-team
```

**The team name is always `{CLAUDE_CODE_TASK_LIST_ID}-team`** — this ensures it never collides with the task list ID (preventing `TeamDelete` from wiping project tasks) and is project-specific.

## MANDATORY FIRST ACTION

See [../cw-dispatch/references/dispatch-common.md](../cw-dispatch/references/dispatch-common.md#mandatory-first-action) for the TaskList() call, TASK BOARD STATUS template, and CRITICAL VERIFICATION bullets.

## Overview

You are the **Dispatcher** role in the Claude Workflow system. You create an agent team, spawn persistent teammates, and coordinate them through the full task board. Teammates persist across tasks — they execute one task, then request their next assignment from you instead of dying and being respawned.

## Your Role

You are the **Team Lead** who:
- Reads the task board to find actionable work
- Creates and manages the `{task-list-id}-team` agent team
- Assigns tasks with conflict checks
- Monitors teammate messages and assigns follow-up work
- Shuts down the team when all work is complete
- Does NOT write code yourself

## Critical Constraints

- **NEVER** execute tasks yourself - always delegate to teammates
- **NEVER** spawn teammates for blocked tasks
- **NEVER** assign the same task to multiple teammates
- **NEVER** give teammates direct implementation instructions - they MUST invoke `cw-execute`
- **NEVER** use TodoWrite - use the native TaskList/TaskUpdate tools only
- **ALWAYS** set task ownership before spawning
- **ALWAYS** respect dependency ordering
- **ALWAYS** mediate task assignment - teammates must not self-claim tasks

**Prerequisite**: The `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS` environment variable must be set to `"1"`. If the `Teammate` tool is unavailable, instruct the user to enable this flag in their Claude Code settings.

### Why Workers Must Invoke cw-execute

See [../cw-dispatch/references/dispatch-common.md](../cw-dispatch/references/dispatch-common.md#why-workers-must-invoke-cw-execute) for details.

## Process

### Step 1: Survey Task Board

See [../cw-dispatch/references/dispatch-common.md](../cw-dispatch/references/dispatch-common.md#survey-task-board) for task categorization, exit conditions, and anti-hallucination check.

### Step 2: Identify Parallel Groups

See [../cw-dispatch/references/dispatch-common.md](../cw-dispatch/references/dispatch-common.md#identify-parallel-groups) for grouping logic and example.

### Step 3: Create Team

Create the agent team for this dispatch session. The team name is derived from `CLAUDE_CODE_TASK_LIST_ID`:

```
Teammate({ operation: "spawnTeam", team_name: "{task-list-id}-team", description: "Parallel task execution team" })
```

For example, if `CLAUDE_CODE_TASK_LIST_ID=cw-workers-2`, use `team_name: "cw-workers-2-team"`.

### Step 4: Assign Initial Batch Ownership

For each ready task in the parallel group, assign ownership before spawning:

```
TaskUpdate({
  taskId: "<native-id>",
  owner: "worker-N",
  status: "in_progress"
})
```

Apply the same conflict checks as Step 2 — verify no file overlaps between assigned tasks.

### Step 5: Spawn Teammates

Send a **single message** with multiple Task tool calls for parallel launch. Spawn **one teammate per ready task** — no arbitrary cap.

**Model Selection**: Read `metadata.model` from TaskGet for each task and pass it as the `model` parameter to Task(). If a task has no `metadata` at all, log a warning but proceed without a model override.

**CRITICAL: Use EXACTLY this prompt template. Do NOT give teammates direct implementation instructions.**

```
Task({
  subagent_type: "claude-workflow:implementer",
  model: "sonnet",  // from task metadata: "haiku" | "sonnet" | "opus"
  team_name: "{task-list-id}-team",
  name: "worker-1",
  description: "Execute task T01",
  prompt: "You are worker-1 on the {task-list-id}-team team.

YOUR ASSIGNED TASK: T01 - [subject]

EXECUTION LOOP:
1. Use the Skill tool to invoke 'cw-execute'
2. After cw-execute completes, run TaskList() to check for more work
3. Look for tasks: status=pending, no blockedBy, no owner
4. If unblocked task found:
   - Message the lead: 'Completed T01. Found TXX unblocked. Requesting assignment.'
     SendMessage({ type: 'message', recipient: 'lead', content: 'Completed T01. Found TXX unblocked. Requesting assignment.', summary: 'Completed T01, requesting next' })
   - WAIT for lead's response before starting
5. If no tasks available:
   - Message the lead: 'Completed T01. No unblocked tasks remaining.'
     SendMessage({ type: 'message', recipient: 'lead', content: 'Completed T01. No unblocked tasks remaining.', summary: 'Completed T01, no more tasks' })

CONSTRAINTS:
- Always invoke cw-execute (never implement directly)
- Do not modify files outside your task's scope
- Do not touch tasks owned by other workers
- Wait for lead assignment before starting new tasks

SHUTDOWN:
- Approve shutdown_request unless mid-commit (Phases 8-10)"
})
```

Repeat for each worker with incrementing worker-N identifiers and matching task IDs.

### Step 6: Monitor Loop

Messages from teammates are auto-delivered. Process them as they arrive:

**On "requesting assignment" from worker-N:**
1. Run `TaskList()` to check current board state
2. Find pending tasks with no owner and no active blockers
3. Check file conflicts against all in-progress tasks:
   ```
   For candidate task C and each in-progress task P:
     C_files = C.scope.files_to_create + C.scope.files_to_modify
     P_files = P.scope.files_to_create + P.scope.files_to_modify
     if intersection(C_files, P_files) is not empty:
       SKIP C (try next candidate)
   ```
4. If conflict-free task found:
   ```
   TaskUpdate({ taskId: "<id>", owner: "worker-N", status: "in_progress" })
   SendMessage({ type: "message", recipient: "worker-N", content: "Assigned T{id} - {subject}. Proceed with cw-execute.", summary: "Assigned T{id}" })
   ```
5. If no task available:
   ```
   SendMessage({ type: "message", recipient: "worker-N", content: "No tasks available. Standing by.", summary: "No tasks, stand by" })
   ```
   Track worker-N as idle.

**On "no more tasks" from worker-N:**
1. Track worker-N as idle
2. If ALL workers are idle AND no unblocked pending tasks remain: proceed to Step 7

**On blocker report from worker-N:**
1. Log the blocker details
2. Check if another unblocked task exists to reassign
3. If yes: assign the alternative task to worker-N
4. If no: track worker-N as idle, note the blocked task

### Step 7: Shutdown Teammates

When all work is complete (all workers idle, no unblocked tasks):

```
SendMessage({ type: "shutdown_request", recipient: "worker-1", content: "All tasks complete. Shutting down." })
SendMessage({ type: "shutdown_request", recipient: "worker-2", content: "All tasks complete. Shutting down." })
... (for each teammate)
```

Wait for shutdown confirmations.

### Step 8: Cleanup Team

After all teammates have confirmed shutdown:

```
Teammate({ operation: "cleanup" })
```

### Step 9: Report and Offer Validation

Run `TaskList()` for final state, then report:

```
CW-DISPATCH-TEAM COMPLETE
===========================
Team: {task-list-id}-team
Workers: N
Tasks completed: X/Y

  worker-1: T01 -> COMPLETED, T05 -> COMPLETED
  worker-2: T04 -> COMPLETED
  ...

Progress: X/Y tasks complete
```

Then offer validation:

```
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [{
    question: "All tasks are complete! Would you like to validate the implementation?",
    header: "Validate",
    options: [
      { label: "Run /cw-validate", description: "Verify coverage against spec and run validation gates (recommended)" },
      { label: "Done for now", description: "Skip validation and review manually" }
    ],
    multiSelect: false
  }]
})
```

Based on user selection:
- **Run /cw-validate**: Spawn the validator as a sub-agent (see below)
- **Done for now**: Summarize what was completed and exit

## Conflict Prevention

See [../cw-dispatch/references/dispatch-common.md](../cw-dispatch/references/dispatch-common.md#conflict-prevention) for the file conflict check algorithm.

## Batch Size

Spawn one teammate per ready task in the current parallel group. The number of concurrent teammates is determined by how many independent, conflict-free tasks exist — not an arbitrary cap.

## Error Handling

See [../cw-dispatch/references/dispatch-common.md](../cw-dispatch/references/dispatch-common.md#error-handling) for failure handling rules.

## Pre-Exit Verification

See [../cw-dispatch/references/dispatch-common.md](../cw-dispatch/references/dispatch-common.md#pre-exit-verification) for the 3-step verification and hallucination warning.

## Spawning the Validator

See [../cw-dispatch/references/dispatch-common.md](../cw-dispatch/references/dispatch-common.md#spawning-the-validator) for the validator spawn template and result relay protocol.

When relaying FAIL results, recommend running `/cw-dispatch-team` again after fixes.
