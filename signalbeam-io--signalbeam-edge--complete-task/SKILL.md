# Complete Task

Finalize the current feature branch by running all quality gates and creating a PR. This skill orchestrates multiple verification steps with parallel execution where possible, and dynamically composes review agents based on what changed.

## Prerequisites

- You must be on a feature branch (not main)
- All implementation work should be complete
- Working tree should be clean (all changes committed)

## Arguments

- `{issue}` — GitHub issue number (optional). If not provided, extract from branch name.
- `--skip-integration` — Skip integration tests (faster, for WIP checks)
- `--auto-fix` — Automatically fix lint issues before proceeding

## Scripts & MCP Tools

| Tool | Type | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| `preflight.sh` | Bash (`.claude/scripts/`) | Branch check, clean tree, issue extraction |
| `mcp__signalbeam-validator__detect_changes` | MCP | Change detection flags for gating phases |
| `mcp__signalbeam-validator__check_all_migrations` | MCP | Pending EF Core migrations check |

## State Machine

```
[start] → pre-flight + detect-changes
    ↓
  parallel-build (backend || frontend)
    ↓
  pending-migrations (if HAS_BACKEND)
    ↓
  parallel-lint+tests (backend || frontend || infra)
    ↓
  integration-tests → browser-verify
    ↓
  parallel-agents (reviewer || verifier || doc-checker? || infra-reviewer?)
    ↓
  [issues?] → scoped-fix → [restart affected tracks]
    ↓
  create-pr → [done]
```

CRITICAL: Do not skip states. Do not proceed if a gate fails. Maximum 3 fix iterations before stopping.

## Process

### Phase 0: Pre-flight + Change Detection

Run the shared pre-flight script:

```bash
source .claude/scripts/preflight.sh
```

If pre-flight fails, STOP and report the issue.

**Change Detection — run immediately after pre-flight:**

Call `mcp__signalbeam-validator__detect_changes` (no parameters). It returns structured JSON with boolean flags:

```json
{ "hasBackend": true, "hasFrontend": false, "hasInfra": true, "hasEndpoints": false, "hasEntities": true, "hasEvents": false }
```

Use these flags to gate all downstream phases. If a flag is `false`, skip its corresponding tracks.

### Phase 1: Parallel Build

Launch build commands in parallel using separate Bash tool calls in a single response. Only include tracks where changes were detected.

**Track A (if HAS_BACKEND > 0):**
```bash
dotnet build src/SignalBeam.sln --configuration Release --no-restore
```

**Track B (if HAS_FRONTEND > 0):**
```bash
cd web && npm run type-check
```

If either track fails, STOP and report the failure.

### Phase 1.5: Pending Migrations Check (if hasBackend)

Call `mcp__signalbeam-validator__check_all_migrations` (no parameters). It returns structured JSON:

```json
{ "results": { "DeviceManager": { "hasPending": false }, "BundleOrchestrator": { "hasPending": true } }, "anyPending": true }
```

If `anyPending` is `true`, STOP and create the migration using `/add-migration` for the affected service(s) before proceeding.

### Phase 2: Parallel Lint + Unit Tests

Launch all applicable tracks in parallel using separate Bash tool calls in a single response.

**Track A (if HAS_BACKEND > 0): Backend lint + unit tests**

If `--auto-fix` was passed, run `dotnet format src/SignalBeam.sln` first, then:
```bash
dotnet format src/SignalBeam.sln --verify-no-changes && dotnet test src/SignalBeam.sln --no-build --configuration Release --filter "Category!=Integration"
```

**Track B (if HAS_FRONTEND > 0): Frontend lint**

If `--auto-fix` was passed, run `cd web && npm run lint:fix` first, then:
```bash
cd web && npm run lint
```

**Track C (if HAS_INFRA > 0): Infrastructure lint**
```bash
helm lint deploy/charts/signalbeam-infrastructure && helm lint deploy/charts/signalbeam-platform && terraform fmt -check -recursive infra
```

If any track fails, STOP and report which track(s) failed.

### Phase 3: Integration Tests (if HAS_BACKEND > 0)

Skip if `--skip-integration` was passed.

```bash
dotnet test src/SignalBeam.sln --no-build --configuration Release --filter "Category=Integration"
```

If tests fail, STOP and report failures.

### Phase 3.5: Browser Verification (if HAS_FRONTEND > 0)

Check if the frontend is running:

```bash
curl -sf http://localhost:5173 > /dev/null 2>&1 && echo "Frontend: UP" || echo "Frontend: DOWN"
```

- **Frontend running:** Invoke `/smoke-test --frontend-only` to verify routes render without errors. Report results as **advisory (WARNING, not FAIL)** — browser verification issues don't block the PR.
- **Frontend not running:** Skip with advisory note: "Browser verification skipped — frontend not running. Run `/run-local` and `/verify-feature` to test manually."

### Phase 4: Parallel Agent Review (Dynamic Composition)

Launch all applicable agents in parallel in a single response. Each agent uses `isolation: "worktree"` for safe parallel reads and `run_in_background: true` so you can begin drafting the PR summary while agents work.

**Always launch:**

1. **`reviewer`** (isolation: worktree, run_in_background: true) — Code review for security, architecture, and quality issues. Uses the `reviewer` agent definition. The agent should review `git diff origin/main...HEAD` and return a structured report with Critical/Warning/Suggestion categories and a PASS/FAIL summary.

2. **`verifier`** (isolation: worktree, run_in_background: true) — QA verification that implementation matches the GitHub issue acceptance criteria. Uses the `verifier` agent definition. The agent should fetch the issue via `gh issue view`, compare against the diff, and return MET/UNMET/PARTIAL status for each criterion with a PASS/FAIL summary.

**Conditionally launch:**

3. **`doc-checker`** (isolation: worktree, run_in_background: true) — Only if `HAS_ENDPOINTS > 0` OR `HAS_ENTITIES > 0` OR `HAS_EVENTS > 0` OR `HAS_INFRA > 0`. Detects stale documentation relative to code changes.

4. **`infra-reviewer`** (isolation: worktree, run_in_background: true) — Only if `HAS_INFRA > 0`. Dedicated Terraform/Helm/CI review using the `infra-reviewer` agent definition.

While agents run in the background, begin preparing the PR description (title, summary of changes, test plan). You will be notified as each agent completes — do not poll or sleep. Once all agents have reported back, proceed to Phase 5.

### Phase 5: Evaluate + Scoped Fix Loop

Collect results from all agents.

**If ALL pass:**
- Proceed to Phase 6

**If ANY issues found:**
1. Display the issues to the user, grouped by agent
2. Ask: "Fix these issues automatically? (max 3 iterations)"
3. If yes, fix the issues
4. Re-run only affected tracks — determine which tracks to re-run based on which files the fix touched:
   - Fix touched `src/` → re-run backend build, backend lint+tests
   - Fix touched `web/` → re-run frontend build, frontend lint
   - Fix touched `infra/` or `deploy/` → re-run infra lint
   - Re-run only the agents that reported issues (not all agents)
   - When unsure which tracks a fix affects, re-run all tracks
5. If no or max iterations reached, STOP and report

Track iteration count. After 3 failed attempts, STOP with:
```
Maximum fix iterations reached. Manual intervention required.
Remaining issues:
{list issues}
```

### Phase 5.5: Documentation Check (Advisory)

Before creating the PR, if `HAS_ENDPOINTS > 0` OR `HAS_ENTITIES > 0` OR `HAS_EVENTS > 0` OR `HAS_INFRA > 0`, suggest running `/docs` for the affected areas:
- New/changed endpoints → `/docs api {service}`
- New/changed entities or events → `/docs domain`
- Infrastructure changes → `/docs architecture`

This is advisory, not blocking — note it in the PR output if docs may need updating. If the `doc-checker` agent already ran in Phase 4, use its findings here instead of re-checking.

### Phase 6: Create PR

Run the `/create-pr` skill with the extracted issue number.

```
/create-pr {issue}
```

## Output

On success:
```
## Task Completed Successfully

- Branch: {branch}
- Issue: #{issue}
- PR: {pr-url}

### Quality Gates
- Build: PASS (backend + frontend) / PASS (backend only) / PASS (frontend only)
- Lint: PASS (backend + frontend + infra) / PASS ({active tracks})
- Unit Tests: PASS ({count} tests) / SKIP (no backend changes)
- Integration Tests: PASS ({count} tests) / SKIP
- Browser Verification: PASS / SKIP (no web/ changes) / SKIP (frontend not running)
- Code Review: PASS
- Task Check: PASS ({x}/{y} criteria met)
- Doc Check: PASS (no stale docs) / SKIP (no endpoint/entity/event/infra changes)
- Infra Review: PASS / SKIP (no infra changes)

PR is ready for human review.
```

On failure:
```
## Task Completion Failed

Failed at: {phase name}
Reason: {error details}

{Specific failure output}
```

## When NOT to Use

- **Infrastructure-only changes** (only `infra/`, `deploy/`, `.github/workflows/`) — use `/complete-infra` instead, which skips .NET build/tests and frontend lint
- **Work in progress** — this skill expects all implementation to be complete and committed
- **Exploratory changes** — if you're still figuring out the approach, run `/check-architecture` and `/run-tests` individually instead

## Guidelines

- This skill is idempotent — safe to run multiple times
- All bash commands use explicit paths relative to repo root
- Subagents run with worktree isolation to avoid polluting main conversation and enable safe parallel reads
- Never force-push or amend commits during this process
- If unsure about a fix, ask the user rather than guessing
- Parallel tracks are launched as multiple tool calls in a single response for maximum throughput
