# PR Review Team

**MANDATORY**: This skill runs a complete review-fix-re-review loop using Subagents (NOT Agent Teams).

The leader MUST:
1. Initialize state and gather PR context (Step 1)
2. Launch 4 parallel reviewer subagents (Step 2)
3. Run CI checks via script (Step 3)
4. Integrate results + security checklist (Step 4)
5. If critical > 0 OR important > 0 OR security != "all_pass": enter fix loop (Step 5)
6. Report results and cleanup (Step 6)

🔴 Stop hooks verify workflow completion. Skipping steps will block the stop request.

## Step 1: Initialize & Identify Target PR

### Initialize State

Run immediately (creates the active-review flag file for Stop hook detection):

```bash
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/pr-review-state.sh init <PR番号>
```

### Resolve PR

- If user specified: use that number
- Otherwise: `gh pr view --json number --jq '.number' 2>/dev/null`

### Gather Context

- File overview: `gh pr diff <PR番号> --name-only`
- Base branch: `git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed 's|refs/remotes/origin/||'` (fallback: `main`)
- Test command: detect from `package.json`, `Makefile`, `pytest.ini`, etc.
- Project rules: read project's CLAUDE.md if present

**Note**: `gh` commands may require `dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true` for TLS issues.

## Step 2: Parallel Review (Subagents)

**MANDATORY**: Launch ALL 4 reviewers in a SINGLE message using parallel Agent tool calls.
Do NOT use TeamCreate or Task tool. Use the Agent tool directly.

Launch in parallel (one message, 4 Agent tool calls):

1. `Agent(subagent_type: "pr-review-toolkit:code-reviewer", model: "sonnet", prompt: "...")`
2. `Agent(subagent_type: "pr-review-toolkit:silent-failure-hunter", model: "sonnet", prompt: "...")`
3. `Agent(subagent_type: "pr-review-toolkit:pr-test-analyzer", model: "sonnet", prompt: "...")`
4. `Agent(subagent_type: "pr-review-toolkit:comment-analyzer", model: "haiku", prompt: "...")`

Results return automatically. No shutdown procedure needed.

Review criteria: include `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/review-commit/references/review-criteria.md` path in each agent prompt — agents read criteria, leader handles integration.

### Agent Launch Failure Handling

| Agent | Failure Severity | Action |
|-------|-----------------|--------|
| code-reviewer | **CRITICAL** | Abort review. Report failure and STOP. |
| silent-failure-hunter | WARNING | Continue with remaining reviewers. Note in report. |
| pr-test-analyzer | WARNING | Continue with remaining reviewers. Note in report. |
| comment-analyzer | WARNING | Continue with remaining reviewers. Note in report. |

### Update State

```bash
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/pr-review-state.sh set <PR番号> reviewers_done true
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/pr-review-state.sh set <PR番号> phase reviewed
```

## Step 3: CI Check

Run the CI wait script (requires `dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true`):

```bash
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/wait-ci-checks.sh <PR番号>
```

Parse the STATUS line from output:
- **PASS**: All checks passed
- **FAIL**: Get failure details with `gh run view <run-id> --log-failed`
- **TIMEOUT**: Continue review, note "CI: PENDING (timed out)" in report
- **ERROR**: Retry with `dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true`

Also collect review comments:
```bash
gh pr view <PR番号> --json comments --jq '.comments[].body'
```

### HEAD Filtering

Avoid sending already-fixed issues to the fixer:
- For each CI issue or review comment, check if the referenced line still exists in current HEAD
- Mark modified/removed lines as "already addressed" — do NOT send to fixer

## Step 4: Integrate & Prepare Fixer Message

🔴 VIOLATION — Direct Editing Prohibited
ALL fixes MUST be delegated to the fixer subagent in Step 5.
Using Edit/Write tools directly to apply fixes is a workflow violation.
The Stop hook will block completion if the fixer agent was not used.

🔴 MANDATORY — Security Checklist
Read NOW (Stop hook verifies this was read):
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/pr-review-team/references/security-checklist.md`

```bash
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/pr-review-state.sh set <PR番号> security_done true
```

### Fixer Message Template

Structure ALL findings into one single message (split messages prohibited):

```
## Critical Issues
- Source: <reviewer-name>
- File: <path>:<line>
- Issue: <description>

## Important Issues
- Source: <reviewer-name>
- File: <path>:<line>
- Issue: <description>

## Security Checklist Failures
- Check: <checklist-item>
- File: <path>:<line>
- Issue: <description>

## Already Addressed (informational — do NOT fix)
- Source: <reviewer-name or CI>
- Reason: Line modified/removed in current HEAD

Security Checklist: ALL PASS (N items checked) / HAS FAILURES (list)
```

If all pass: "Security Checklist: ALL PASS (N items checked)"

## Step 5: Fix Loop

🔴 MANDATORY: If Step 4 produced ANY critical or important issues, or security failures, this step MUST execute.

🔴 VIOLATION — Re-review Required After Fixes
After fixer applies fixes, ALL 4 reviewers MUST be re-invoked (same parallel pattern as Step 2).
Skipping re-review is a workflow violation.

```
MAX_ITERATIONS=3

FOR iteration = 1 TO MAX_ITERATIONS:
  1. Spawn fixer subagent:
     Agent(subagent_type: "general-purpose", model: "sonnet", prompt: "<all findings>")
     Send ALL findings in a single prompt (Critical + Important + Security failures)

  2. Fixer applies fixes and runs tests
     IF tests fail after 2 retries → report to user, do NOT merge, BREAK

  3. Re-review: Launch ALL 4 reviewers again (parallel Agent tool calls, same as Step 2)

  4. Collect fresh counts: fresh_critical, fresh_important, fresh_security

  5. Update state:
     bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/pr-review-state.sh set <PR番号> fixer_done true
     bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/pr-review-state.sh set <PR番号> iterations <N>
     bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/pr-review-state.sh set <PR番号> final_critical <count>
     bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/pr-review-state.sh set <PR番号> final_important <count>

  6. IF fresh_critical = 0 AND fresh_important = 0 AND fresh_security = "all_pass" → BREAK
END FOR
```

If iteration limit reached with remaining issues: report to user, do NOT merge.

## Step 6: Report & Cleanup

Report summary:
- Issues found / fixed / remaining
- Iterations performed
- Security checklist status
- CI status (including any PENDING timeouts)
- Agents that failed to launch (if any)

**Do NOT merge** — wait for user's explicit instruction.

### Cleanup

```bash
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/pr-review-state.sh cleanup <PR番号>
```

No shutdown procedure needed — subagents complete automatically.
