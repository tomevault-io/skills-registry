# Git Workflow Setup

This skill configures a complete Git workflow for your project, including branch structure, branch protection, merge settings, and security configuration.

## What This Skill Does

1. **Project Type Selection** - Determine security level (Personal / Small OSS / Large OSS)
2. **Development Style Selection** - Solo or Team development
3. **Repository Check** - Verify or create GitHub repository
4. **Branch Structure** - Create main and develop branches
5. **Branch Protection** - Apply protection rules using templates
6. **Merge Settings** - Disable squash/rebase merge (merge commit only for Git Flow)
7. **Security Settings** - CODEOWNERS, Secret Scanning (based on project type)
8. **Verification** - Confirm all settings are correct

## Execution Steps

### Step 0: Project Type & Development Style

Ask the user about their project type to determine appropriate security settings:

| Setting | Personal | Small OSS | Large OSS |
|---------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Visibility | Private | Public | Public |
| Secret Scanning | Not needed | Recommended | Required |
| CODEOWNERS | Not needed | Recommended | Required |
| develop protection | Optional | Recommended | Required |
| Fork PR restriction | Not needed | Optional | Recommended |

Then ask development style:
- **Solo Development** - `enforce_admins=false` (admin bypass allowed)
- **Team Development** - `enforce_admins=true` (all rules apply to everyone)

### Step 1: Repository Check

```bash
git remote -v
gh repo view --json nameWithOwner,isPrivate,defaultBranchRef 2>/dev/null
```

If no repository exists, guide the user to create one first.

### Step 2: Branch Structure

Create `develop` branch if it doesn't exist, push to remote, and verify the default branch.

### Step 3: Branch Protection

Apply branch protection using the template files:
- Solo: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/.github/branch-protection/solo-development.json`
- Team: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/.github/branch-protection/team-development.json`

Apply to both `main` and `develop` branches using `gh api`.

### Step 4: Repository-Level Merge Settings (REQUIRED)

```bash
gh api repos/:owner/:repo -X PATCH \
  -f allow_squash_merge=false \
  -f allow_rebase_merge=false \
  -f allow_merge_commit=true
```

**Why**: Git Flow requires merge commits. Squash/rebase destroys Git Flow history.

### Step 5: Security Settings

Based on project type, apply appropriate settings.

For CODEOWNERS template, refer to:
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/git-workflow-setup/references/codeowners-template.md`

For security settings details, refer to:
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/git-workflow-setup/references/security-settings.md`

### Step 6: Verification

```bash
git branch -a
gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef --jq '.defaultBranchRef.name'
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/branches/main/protection
gh api repos/:owner/:repo --jq '{allow_squash_merge, allow_merge_commit, allow_rebase_merge}'
```

Show results to the user and confirm everything is correct.

## Completion

Report all configured settings and provide next steps for the Git workflow (branching, committing, PR creation).

## Absolute Prohibitions (Git Flow)

- main -> develop reverse flow (MOST IMPORTANT)
- Direct commits to main/develop branches
- Squash merge (destroys Git Flow history)
