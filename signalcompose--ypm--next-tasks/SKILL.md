# Next Tasks

Extract "next tasks" from `~/.ypm/PROJECT_STATUS.md` and display in priority order.

## Prerequisites

- Run `/ypm:setup` first if `~/.ypm/config.yml` doesn't exist
- Run `/ypm:project-status-update` first if `~/.ypm/PROJECT_STATUS.md` doesn't exist

## Display Format

- Project name
- Current Phase
- Next task
- Last update date

## Priority Order

1. Active projects (updated within 1 week)
2. Projects with high implementation progress
3. By Phase order

## Recommended Action

- Suggest the highest priority project
- Clarify the next task to work on

## CRITICAL: Reporting Guidelines

- Display "next task" as-is from PROJECT_STATUS.md
- DO NOT create new plans or features
- Include Issue number if GitHub Issues exist
- Add "(source unknown)" if information source is unclear
