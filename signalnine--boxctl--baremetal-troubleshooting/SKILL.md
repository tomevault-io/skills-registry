# Baremetal Troubleshooting

Systematic investigation of baremetal system issues using boxctl's 216 monitoring scripts.

## When to Use

User invokes `/baremetal` after discovery has identified relevant scripts.

## Investigation Loop

```dot
digraph investigation {
    "State hypothesis" -> "Run script";
    "Run script" -> "Interpret output";
    "Interpret output" -> "Root cause?" [label=""];
    "Root cause?" -> "Report conclusion" [label="yes"];
    "Root cause?" -> "Update hypothesis" [label="no"];
    "Update hypothesis" -> "Run script";
    "Run script" -> "Max steps?" [label=""];
    "Max steps?" -> "Summarize findings" [label="yes, 10 reached"];
}
```

## Step Tracking

Track explicitly in each message:

```
## Investigation: <original symptom>

**Step N/10**: Running <script>
**Hypothesis**: <current theory>
**Finding**: <what this script revealed>
**Next**: <why running next script>
```

## Running Scripts

```bash
# Non-privileged
boxctl run <script> --format json

# Root required (check boxctl show first)
boxctl --sudo run <script> --format json
```

Prefer `--format json` for structured parsing. Fall back to plain text if JSON unavailable.

## Guardrails

| Rule | Action |
|------|--------|
| Max 10 steps | Summarize findings, ask if user wants more |
| Exit code 2 | Run `boxctl doctor`, report missing tool |
| Permission denied | Suggest non-privileged alternatives |
| Root cause found | Stop, report conclusion with evidence |

## Fast Paths

Skip deep investigation for obvious patterns:

| Pattern | Diagnosis |
|---------|-----------|
| Exit 1 + "disk full" in output | Disk space exhaustion |
| Exit 1 + "OOM" events | Memory exhaustion |
| Exit 2 + tool missing | Missing dependency |

## Privilege Verification

Before using `--sudo`:
1. Run `boxctl show <script>` to confirm privilege requirement
2. Script must be from boxctl distribution (not user-added)
3. If denied, explain what info would have been gained

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Running without hypothesis | State what you expect to find |
| Ignoring exit codes | 0=healthy, 1=issues, 2=error |
| Too many scripts at once | One at a time, interpret before next |
| No step count | Always show "Step N/10" |

## Dead Ends

When you can't find a script for what you need:

1. Confirm no existing script covers it: `boxctl search "your terms"`
2. File a request:
   ```bash
   boxctl request "capability needed" \
     --searched "terms you tried" \
     --context "what you were investigating"
   ```
3. Document the gap in your investigation summary
4. Continue with alternative approaches if possible
