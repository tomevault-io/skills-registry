# Mollusk Testing Framework Setup

**Primary Objective:** For a given Solana program codebase, rapidly and correctly establish a Mollusk-based testing framework with a minimal test case, providing deterministic foundations for subsequent operations and validations.

## When to Use

- The current project contains a Solana program codebase
- The user explicitly requests creation of a testing framework for the Solana program

## When NOT to Use

- The current project does not contain a Solana program codebase
- The `tests/` directory already contains a `sailor_test_endpoint.rs` file (indicating the testing framework has already been established)

## Execution Flow

### Step 1: Identify the Program Codebase Directory

First, determine the exact program codebase directory and program name. A typical program directory structure:

```
src/
  instructions/
  states/
  lib.rs
Cargo.toml
Xargo.toml
```

The `src` directory contains the program source files.

**Important:** For Anchor-based programs, the `Anchor.toml` file exists at the workspace root, which is NOT the program codebase directory. The actual program codebase resides under `programs/<program-name>/`. If multiple programs exist and the user has not specified which one, you MUST halt the current task and prompt the user to select **exactly one** program before proceeding with the framework setup.

Once the program codebase directory is identified, all subsequent commands MUST be executed with this directory as the working directory.

The program name is the `package.name` field in `Cargo.toml`. If `lib.name` is also present, prioritize `lib.name` over `package.name`.

### Step 2: Verify Prerequisites and Install Dependencies

1. Execute `cargo check` in the working directory to verify the program compiles without errors. If compilation fails, HALT the task and instruct the user to resolve the errors before retrying.

2. Search for the `target/sbpf-solana-solana/release` directory:
   - If it does NOT exist, HALT the task and instruct the user to run `anchor build` or `cargo sbpf-build` first, then retry.
   - If it exists, capture its absolute path as the SBF output directory for use in subsequent steps.

3. Execute `cargo nextest --version` to verify nextest is installed. If not available, HALT the task and instruct the user to install it via `cargo install cargo-nextest`, then retry.

4. Install Mollusk framework dependencies by executing ALL of the following `cargo add` commands:

```sh
cargo add --dev mollusk-svm
cargo add --dev solana-precompiles solana-account solana-pubkey solana-feature-set solana-program solana-sdk
cargo add --dev mollusk-svm-programs-token
cargo add --dev spl-associated-token-account-interface
cargo add --dev spl_token_interface
```

### Step 3: Create the Testing Framework and Write the Initial Test Case

1. Create the `tests/` directory in the working directory if it does not exist.

2. Create a file named `sailor_test_endpoint.rs` in the `tests/` directory. If **this file already exists**, clear its contents and rewrite from scratch.

3. Implement the initial test function `test_endpoints` in `sailor_test_endpoint.rs`:

```rust
#[test]
fn test_endpoints() {
  // ...
}
```

This test function MUST include the following components:

1. **Initialize a Mollusk instance:** `let mut mollusk = Mollusk::new(<program_id>, <program_name>)`

2. **Register additional programs** to the Mollusk environment (Token Program, Associated Token Program, System Program, etc.):

```rust
let (token_program, token_program_account) = mollusk_svm_programs_token::token::keyed_account();
let (associated_token_program, associated_token_program_account) = mollusk_svm_programs_token::associated_token::keyed_account();
let (system_program, system_program_account) = mollusk_svm::program::keyed_account_for_system_program();

mollusk_svm_programs_token::token::add_program(&mut mollusk);
mollusk_svm_programs_token::associated_token::add_program(&mut mollusk);
```

3. **Select a minimal instruction** for the test case based on your understanding of the program:
   - Prioritize initialization instructions as test candidates
   - Instructions with minimal account requirements are also suitable choices

4. **Prepare instruction data and account inputs** for the selected instruction

5. **Execute the instruction:** `mollusk.process_instruction(&instruction, &accounts)`

6. **Assert the expected outcome:** `assert!(result.program_result.is_ok())`

Refer to [sailor_test_endpoint.rs](./examples/sailor_test_endpoint.rs) as a reference implementation.

### Step 4: Execute, Debug, and Finalize the Test Case

After completing the initial test case, iterate through run-and-fix cycles until the test passes.

First, run `cargo check --test sailor_test_endpoint` to verify the test compiles. If compilation errors occur, analyze the error messages, cross-reference with the codebase source and reference documentation, and correct the test code accordingly.

Once `cargo check` passes, execute the test using:

```sh
SBF_OUT_DIR="<program-sbf-directory>" cargo nextest r --test sailor_test_endpoint
```

Replace `<program-sbf-directory>` with the absolute path to the SBF output directory obtained in Step 2.

**Example:**
```sh
SBF_OUT_DIR="/opt/ctf/staking/target/sbpf-solana-solana/release" cargo nextest r --test sailor_test_endpoint
```

Analyze the test results. If the test passes, the task is complete. If the test fails, examine the failure details, cross-reference with the codebase source and reference documentation, and modify the test code accordingly.

Repeat this process until all tests pass.
