  - Success: README includes accurate setup and run instructions.
- Add docstrings for public modules and functions that are reused.
  - Success: Public APIs have concise docstrings.
- Provide a minimal example command or notebook that reproduces results.
  - Success: A minimal example reproduces expected output.
- Document output artifacts and how to interpret them.
  - Success: Outputs and metrics are explained in docs.
