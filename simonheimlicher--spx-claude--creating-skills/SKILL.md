When this skill is invoked, Claude Code provides the base directory in the loading message:

```
Base directory for this skill: /path/to/.claude/plugins/cache/{marketplace}/{plugin}/{version}/skills/creating-skills/
```

Throughout this skill, we refer to this as `${SKILL_DIR}`.

Use this path for all skill file access:

- References: `${SKILL_DIR}/references/`
- Workflows: `${SKILL_DIR}/workflows/`
- Templates: `${SKILL_DIR}/templates/`
- Scripts: `${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/`

**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT search the project directory for skill files. If you cannot find a file, use Glob: `.claude/plugins/cache/**/creating-skills/**/*.md`
</accessing_skill_files>

<essential_principles>
Skills are prompts. All prompting best practices apply. Be clear, be direct, assume Claude is smart.

**Pure XML Structure**: No markdown headings (#) in skill body. Use semantic XML tags:

- `<objective>` - What the skill does
- `<quick_start>` - Immediate actionable guidance
- `<success_criteria>` - How to know it worked

**Progressive Disclosure**: SKILL.md under 500 lines. Details go in `references/` and `workflows/`.

**Router Pattern** (for complex skills):

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md              # Router + essential principles
├── workflows/            # Step-by-step procedures (FOLLOW)
├── references/           # Domain knowledge (READ)
├── templates/            # Output structures (COPY + FILL)
└── scripts/              # Executable code (RUN)
```

**Skill Types**: Match structure to purpose:

| Type       | Purpose              | Key Output                   |
| ---------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Builder    | Create artifacts     | Code, documents, widgets     |
| Guide      | Provide instructions | Tutorials, workflows         |
| Automation | Execute workflows    | Processed files, deployments |
| Analyzer   | Extract insights     | Reports, summaries           |
| Validator  | Enforce quality      | Pass/fail assessments        |
| Reference  | Share knowledge      | Standards loaded by others   |

**Domain Discovery**: Research the domain BEFORE asking users. Users want expertise IN the skill.

<intake>
What would you like to do?

1. Create a new skill
2. Audit or improve an existing skill
3. Add a component (workflow, reference, template, script)
4. Understand skill patterns

**Wait for response before proceeding.**
</intake>

<routing>
| Response | Workflow |
|----------|----------|
| 1, "create", "new", "build" | `${SKILL_DIR}/workflows/create-new-skill.md` |
| 2, "audit", "improve", "review", "check" | `${SKILL_DIR}/workflows/audit-skill.md` |
| 3, "add workflow" | `${SKILL_DIR}/workflows/add-workflow.md` |
| 3, "add reference" | `${SKILL_DIR}/workflows/add-reference.md` |
| 3, "upgrade to router" | `${SKILL_DIR}/workflows/upgrade-to-router.md` |
| 4, "patterns", "understand", "help" | Read `${SKILL_DIR}/references/skill-patterns.md` |

**Intent-based routing** (if user provides clear context):

- "verify content is current" → `${SKILL_DIR}/workflows/verify-skill.md`
- "audit this skill" → `${SKILL_DIR}/workflows/audit-skill.md`
- "create skill for X" → `${SKILL_DIR}/workflows/create-new-skill.md`

**After reading the workflow, follow it exactly.**
</routing>

<quick_reference>
**YAML Frontmatter** (required):

```yaml
---
name: skill-name # lowercase-with-hyphens, ≤64 chars
description: >- # Directive, ≤1024 chars. Add NEVER only if it disambiguates.
  ALWAYS invoke this skill when <triggers>.
---
```

**Simple Skill Structure**:

```text
<objective>What the skill does</objective>
<quick_start>Minimal working example</quick_start>
<workflow>Step-by-step procedure</workflow>
<success_criteria>How to know it worked</success_criteria>
```

**Router Skill Structure**:

```text
<essential_principles>Always applies</essential_principles>
<intake>Question to ask user</intake>
<routing>Maps answers to workflows</routing>
<reference_index>Available references</reference_index>
<workflows_index>Available workflows</workflows_index>
```

**Naming Convention**: Prefer gerund form (verb + -ing):

- `creating-skills`, `processing-pdfs`, `reviewing-code`

<success_criteria>
A well-structured skill:

- Has valid YAML frontmatter (name + description)
- Uses pure XML structure (no markdown headings in body)
- Has essential principles inline in SKILL.md (if router pattern)
- Routes to appropriate workflows based on user intent
- Keeps SKILL.md under 500 lines
- Has been tested with real usage

</success_criteria>
