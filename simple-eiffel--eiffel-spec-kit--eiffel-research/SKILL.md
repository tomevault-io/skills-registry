# /eiffel.research - Pre-Phase: Deep Research

**Purpose:** Systematically research a new library idea BEFORE design. Transforms a vague idea into validated requirements.

## When to Use

- **New simple_* library** - Before creating any new library
- **Major feature** - Before adding significant capability
- **Technology selection** - Choosing between approaches
- **Problem unclear** - When the problem space needs exploration

## Usage

```
/eiffel.research <project-path>
```

**Example:**
```
/eiffel.research d:\prod\simple_cache
```

## CRITICAL: Anti-Slop Rules

**This workflow requires ACTUAL:**
- Web searches with real URLs (WebSearch/WebFetch tools)
- Documentation written to actual files
- Sources cited with actual URLs

**FORBIDDEN:**
- Making up library names or features
- Citing documentation without actual URLs
- Claiming "research complete" without written deliverables

## Workflow

### Step 0: Get Initial Idea

Ask user for:
```
IDEA: {one-sentence description}
CONTEXT: {why we want this}
INITIAL THOUGHTS: {any preliminary ideas}
CONSTRAINTS: {known limitations}
```

### Step 1: SCOPE - Define Boundaries

Create `<project-path>/.eiffel-workflow/research/01-SCOPE.md`:

**Must answer:**
- What problem are we solving?
- Who has this problem?
- What does success look like?
- What's definitely NOT in scope?

**Template:**
```markdown
# SCOPE: {project_name}

## Problem Statement
In one sentence: {The problem is...}

What's wrong today: {current pain}
Who experiences this: {affected users}
Impact of not solving: {consequence}

## Target Users
| User Type | Needs | Pain Level |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| {type} | {needs} | HIGH/MED/LOW |

## Success Criteria

### Step 9: Save Evidence

Create `<project-path>/.eiffel-workflow/evidence/pre-phase-research.txt`:
```
# Pre-Phase Research Evidence
# Project: <project-path>
# Date: [timestamp]

Research completed: [yes/no]
Steps completed: 7/7
Recommendation: BUILD/ADOPT/ADAPT/ABANDON
Confidence: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW

References cited: [count]
Alternatives researched: [count]
Risks identified: [count]

# Status: COMPLETE
```

## Completion

```
Pre-Phase RESEARCH COMPLETE: Research validated.
Project: <project-path>

Files:
  - .eiffel-workflow/research/01-SCOPE.md
  - .eiffel-workflow/research/02-LANDSCAPE.md
  - .eiffel-workflow/research/03-REQUIREMENTS.md
  - .eiffel-workflow/research/04-DECISIONS.md
  - .eiffel-workflow/research/05-INNOVATIONS.md
  - .eiffel-workflow/research/06-RISKS.md
  - .eiffel-workflow/research/07-RECOMMENDATION.md
  - .eiffel-workflow/research/REFERENCES.md

Recommendation: {BUILD/ADOPT/ADAPT}

Next: Run /eiffel.spec <project-path> to transform research into Eiffel specification.
```

## Context Management (RLM Pattern)

**DO:**
- Use WebSearch and WebFetch for actual research
- Use Task tool with Explore agent for ecosystem questions
- Write findings to actual files as you go

**DO NOT:**
- Make up library names or features
- Cite URLs without actually fetching them
- Skip steps or claim research without evidence

## Research Quality Criteria

| Step | Criterion |
|------|-----------|
| Scope | Problem clearly stated, boundaries defined |
| Landscape | At least 3 alternatives researched with real URLs |
| Requirements | Prioritized with acceptance criteria |
| Decisions | Options evaluated, rationale recorded |
| Innovations | Differentiation clearly stated |
| Risks | Identified with mitigations |
| Recommendation | Clear, evidence-based, actionable |

## Anti-Drift

- **Every claim needs evidence** - URLs, code samples, actual data
- **No imaginary libraries** - Only cite what actually exists
- **Research before recommend** - Don't skip to conclusions
- **simple_* first** - Check ecosystem before recommending ISE/Gobo
