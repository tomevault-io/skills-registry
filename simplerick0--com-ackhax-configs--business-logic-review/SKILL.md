# Business Logic Review

Verify code correctly implements business requirements and handles all cases.

## Review Focus

### Correctness
- Does the code do what the requirements specify?
- Are all business rules implemented?
- Are edge cases handled?
- Are error conditions handled appropriately?

### Completeness
- All acceptance criteria met?
- All user paths covered?
- All input variations handled?
- All output states possible?

### Consistency
- Consistent with existing behavior?
- Consistent with documented rules?
- Consistent across similar features?

## Review Process

### 1. Understand Requirements
Before reviewing code, clarify:
- What is this feature supposed to do?
- Who uses it and how?
- What are the business rules?
- What are the edge cases?

### 2. Trace User Flows
Walk through each user path:
```
Happy path: Normal successful flow
Error paths: Each way things can fail
Edge cases: Boundary conditions, empty states
```

### 3. Verify Business Rules
For each rule, find where it's enforced:
```markdown
Rule: "Users can only edit their own posts"
- Check: Is ownership validated?
- Where: Before edit operation
- How: user.id == post.author_id
```

### 4. Test Assumptions
Question implicit assumptions:
- What if the input is empty?
- What if the user is not authenticated?
- What if the resource doesn't exist?
- What if concurrent modifications occur?

## Common Logic Issues

### Missing Validation
```python
# Missing: What if user_id doesn't exist?
def get_user_orders(user_id):
    return Order.query.filter_by(user_id=user_id).all()

# Better: Handle missing user
def get_user_orders(user_id):
    user = User.query.get(user_id)
    if not user:
        raise UserNotFoundError(user_id)
    return user.orders
```

### Incorrect Boundary Conditions
```python
# Bug: Off-by-one error
if age >= 18 and age < 65:  # What about 65-year-olds?
    apply_standard_rate()

# Correct: Clear boundaries
if 18 <= age <= 64:
    apply_standard_rate()
elif age >= 65:
    apply_senior_rate()
```

### Race Conditions
```python
# Bug: Check-then-act race condition
if inventory.count > 0:
    inventory.count -= 1  # Another request could decrement first

# Better: Atomic operation
result = Inventory.query.filter(
    Inventory.id == item_id,
    Inventory.count > 0
).update({Inventory.count: Inventory.count - 1})
if result == 0:
    raise OutOfStockError()
```

### Missing State Transitions
```python
# Bug: Can transition from any state to completed
def complete_order(order):
    order.status = 'completed'

# Better: Validate state transitions
VALID_TRANSITIONS = {
    'pending': ['processing', 'cancelled'],
    'processing': ['completed', 'failed'],
}

def complete_order(order):
    if 'completed' not in VALID_TRANSITIONS.get(order.status, []):
        raise InvalidStateTransition(order.status, 'completed')
    order.status = 'completed'
```

## Review Output Format

```markdown
## Business Logic Review: [Feature Name]

### Requirements Verified
- [x] Requirement 1 - Implemented in `function_name()`
- [x] Requirement 2 - Implemented in `class.method()`
- [ ] Requirement 3 - **NOT FOUND**

### Logic Issues
- **[Location]**: [Description of logic error]
  - Expected: [What should happen]
  - Actual: [What the code does]
  - Impact: [Business impact if not fixed]

### Edge Cases
| Case | Handled? | Location |
|------|----------|----------|
| Empty input | Yes | line 42 |
| User not found | No | - |
| Concurrent edit | No | - |

### Questions for Clarification
- [Question about unclear requirement]
```

## Questions to Ask

### For Every Change
- What happens if the input is null/empty?
- What happens if the resource doesn't exist?
- What happens if the user lacks permission?
- What happens if this fails halfway through?

### For State Changes
- What states can transition to this state?
- What should happen in each prior state?
- Is the transition atomic?
- What if concurrent transitions occur?

### For Calculations
- What are the boundary values?
- What precision is required?
- What happens at min/max values?
- Are there rounding considerations?
