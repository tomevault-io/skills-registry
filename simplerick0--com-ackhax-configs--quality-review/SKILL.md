# Code Quality Review

Evaluate code for readability, maintainability, and adherence to best practices.

## Review Focus Areas

### Readability
- Clear, descriptive names (variables, functions, classes)
- Appropriate function/method length (< 30 lines preferred)
- Logical code organization
- Consistent formatting and style
- Self-documenting code (minimal comments needed)

### Maintainability
- Single Responsibility Principle
- Low coupling between modules
- High cohesion within modules
- No duplicated code (DRY)
- Clear dependency relationships

### Complexity
- Cyclomatic complexity (< 10 per function)
- Nesting depth (< 4 levels)
- Number of parameters (< 5 per function)
- Class size (< 300 lines)
- File size (< 500 lines)

## Review Checklist

### Naming
- [ ] Variables describe their content
- [ ] Functions describe their action
- [ ] Boolean names are questions (is_valid, has_permission)
- [ ] No abbreviations except common ones (id, url, etc.)
- [ ] Consistent naming conventions throughout

### Structure
- [ ] Functions do one thing
- [ ] No deep nesting (extract to functions)
- [ ] Related code is grouped together
- [ ] Dependencies are explicit (no globals)
- [ ] Error handling is consistent

### Code Smells
- [ ] No magic numbers/strings (use constants)
- [ ] No commented-out code
- [ ] No dead code (unreachable paths)
- [ ] No overly clever code
- [ ] No premature optimization

## Issue Severity Levels

```
CRITICAL - Must fix before merge
- Security vulnerabilities
- Data corruption risks
- Breaking changes without migration

HIGH - Should fix before merge
- Logic errors
- Performance problems
- Missing error handling

MEDIUM - Fix soon after merge
- Code smells
- Minor maintainability issues
- Missing tests for edge cases

LOW - Consider fixing
- Style inconsistencies
- Minor naming improvements
- Documentation gaps
```

## Review Output Format

```markdown
## Code Review: [File/PR Name]

### Summary
[1-2 sentence overview of the change and overall quality]

### Critical Issues
- **[Location]**: [Issue description]
  - Impact: [What could go wrong]
  - Suggestion: [How to fix]

### Suggestions
- **[Location]**: [Improvement suggestion]
  - Rationale: [Why this matters]

### Positive Notes
- [What was done well]
```

## Common Patterns to Flag

### Complexity
```python
# Too complex - extract conditions
if user.is_active and user.has_permission('edit') and not user.is_banned and item.is_editable:
    ...

# Better
def can_edit(user, item):
    return (user.is_active
            and user.has_permission('edit')
            and not user.is_banned
            and item.is_editable)
```

### Magic Values
```python
# Bad
if status == 3:
    ...

# Good
STATUS_COMPLETED = 3
if status == STATUS_COMPLETED:
    ...
```

### Deep Nesting
```python
# Bad - deeply nested
def process(items):
    for item in items:
        if item.is_valid:
            if item.needs_processing:
                if item.has_data:
                    # actual logic buried here

# Good - early returns
def process(items):
    for item in items:
        if not item.is_valid:
            continue
        if not item.needs_processing:
            continue
        if not item.has_data:
            continue
        # actual logic at top level
```
