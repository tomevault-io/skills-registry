# Cleanup

Arguments:
- scope: what to review (default: your current changes). Examples: "diff to main", "PR #123", "src/components/", "whole codebase"
- fix: whether to apply fixes (default: true). Set to false to only propose changes.

User arguments: $ARGUMENTS

## Steps

Run each of these skills in order on the specified scope, passing through the scope and fix arguments. After each skill completes, move to the next. Do not skip any.

1. `/you-might-not-need-an-effect $ARGUMENTS`
2. `/you-might-not-need-a-memo $ARGUMENTS`
3. `/you-might-not-need-a-callback $ARGUMENTS`
4. `/you-might-not-need-state $ARGUMENTS`
5. `/react-query-best-practices $ARGUMENTS`
6. `/emcn-design-review $ARGUMENTS`

After all skills have run, output a summary of what was found and fixed (or proposed) across all six passes.

## Boundary Audit Guidance

- When removing route-local Zod schemas, replacing raw `fetch(` calls in hooks, or removing `as unknown as X` casts, do not introduce `// boundary-raw-fetch: <reason>` or `// double-cast-allowed: <reason>` annotations to silence the audit. Fix the underlying call instead — adopt a contract from `@/lib/api/contracts/**` and use `requestJson(contract, ...)` from `@/lib/api/client/request`, or refine the type so the double cast is unnecessary.
- Annotations are reserved for legitimate exceptions only: streaming responses, binary downloads, multipart uploads, signed-URL flows, OAuth redirects, external-origin requests, and double casts where no narrower type is available. Each annotation requires a non-empty reason; empty reasons fail `bun run check:api-validation:strict`.
