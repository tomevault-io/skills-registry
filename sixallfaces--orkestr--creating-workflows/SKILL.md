# Creating Orchestration Workflows

I'll help you create powerful orchestration workflows that coordinate multiple Claude Code agents. I use Socratic questioning to understand your needs and generate optimal workflow syntax.

## When I Activate

I automatically activate when you:
- Describe a multi-step process you want to automate
- Mention "workflow", "orchestration", "automate", "coordinate agents"
- Ask "how do I create a workflow?"
- Want to connect multiple agents or tasks
- Ask about automating repetitive processes

## My Process

### 1. Understanding Your Intent

**CRITICAL**: I use AskUserQuestion tool for ALL questions. NO plain text numbered lists.

I'll ask strategic questions to understand:
- What problem you're solving
- What your goal is
- What scope you have in mind
- **What external data sources you need** (APIs, web scraping, databases)

### 2. Detecting Temp Script Needs

I automatically scan for these triggers:
- **External APIs**: Reddit, Twitter, GitHub, ProductHunt, etc.
- **Web Scraping**: Extracting data from websites
- **Data Processing**: Analyzing 10+ items, statistical analysis
- **Authentication**: Any service requiring API keys

**If detected → I'll proactively create temp scripts for you**

### 3. Identifying the Pattern
I'll determine if your workflow is:
- **Sequential**: One step after another (`->`)
- **Parallel**: Multiple tasks at once (`||`)
- **Conditional**: Based on results (`~>`)
- **Hybrid**: Combination of above

### 3. Designing the Workflow
I'll help you define:
- Which agents to use (built-in or custom)
- How data flows between steps
- Error handling strategy
- Review checkpoints

### 4. Generating Syntax
I'll create clean, readable workflow syntax like:

```flow
# Simple sequential workflow
explore:"Analyze codebase" ->
implement:"Add feature" ->
test:"Run tests"
```

```flow
# Parallel with merge
[security-check || style-check || performance-check] ->
general-purpose:"Consolidate findings"
```

## Question Approach

For more details on my questioning strategy, see [socratic-method.md](socratic-method.md).

**Quick overview:**
- **Vague requests**: I ask about problem → scope → constraints
- **Specific requests**: I confirm pattern → ask about customization
- **Medium requests**: I explore scope → clarify details

## Common Patterns

I have templates for common scenarios. See [patterns.md](patterns.md) for complete catalog.

**Popular patterns:**
- Feature implementation (explore → implement → test → review)
- Bug fixing (investigate → fix → verify)
- Security scanning (scan → review → fix → verify)
- Documentation (analyze → write → review)
- Refactoring (analyze → refactor → test → validate)

## Custom Agents

When your workflow needs specialized expertise, I can create **temp agents** for you.

**Temp agents are:**
- Created automatically during workflow design
- Saved in `temp-agents/` directory
- Auto-cleaned after workflow execution
- Can be promoted to permanent agents if useful

**When I create temp agents:**
- You need domain-specific expertise (e.g., security scanner)
- Task requires specific output formats
- Multiple workflows might benefit (I'll suggest making it permanent)

See [temp-agents.md](temp-agents.md) for examples and guidelines.

## Temp Scripts (CRITICAL)

**Temp scripts** are Python/Node.js scripts I create for tasks that Claude Code tools can't handle directly.

### When I Create Temp Scripts

I **automatically** create temp scripts when you need:

1. **External API calls** - Reddit, Twitter, GitHub, ProductHunt
2. **Web scraping** - Extracting data from websites
3. **Data processing** - Pandas analysis, JSON parsing at scale
4. **Database queries** - SQL, NoSQL operations
5. **Batch operations** - Processing 10+ files
6. **Third-party libraries** - NumPy, BeautifulSoup, requests

### How It Works

**You say**: "Fetch 10 Reddit posts about startups"

**I create**:
```flow
general-purpose:"Create Python script using PRAW library:
1. Authenticate with Reddit API (client_id, client_secret)
2. Fetch 10 hot posts from r/startups
3. Extract: title, url, score, selftext
4. Return JSON array
5. Save as temp-scripts/reddit_fetcher.py
6. Execute and return results":reddit_posts
```

### Proactive Detection

I scan your request for keywords:
- "API", "fetch", "scrape", "get data from"
- "Reddit", "Twitter", "ProductHunt", "GitHub"
- "analyze", "process", "calculate"
- Numbers like "10 posts", "100 records"

**If found → I'll suggest temp scripts and ask for your confirmation**

### When Uncertain

If I'm not sure whether you need a temp script, I'll ask:

```javascript
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [{
    question: "How should I handle this data processing?",
    header: "Approach",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      {label: "Built-in tools", description: "Use Read/Grep for simple operations"},
      {label: "Create temp script", description: "Python script for complex processing"},
      {label: "External API", description: "Fetch from service with authentication"}
    ]
  }]
})
```

For complete guide, see: `docs/TEMP-SCRIPTS-DETECTION-GUIDE.md`

## Custom Syntax

Sometimes you need syntax beyond the basics. I can design custom syntax elements like:
- New operators (`=>` for merge-with-dedup)
- Checkpoints (`@security-gate`)
- Conditions (`if security-critical`)
- Loops (`retry-with-backoff`)

I follow a **reuse-first approach**: I check existing syntax before creating new.

See [custom-syntax.md](custom-syntax.md) for syntax design process.

## Examples

Real workflow examples to inspire you:

See [examples.md](examples.md) for complete catalog with explanations.

**Quick examples:**

**TDD Implementation:**
```flow
# Test-Driven Development workflow
general-purpose:"Write failing test":test_file ->
implement:"Make test pass":implementation ->
code-reviewer:"Review {implementation}":review ->
(if review.approved)~> commit:"Commit changes" ~>
(if review.needs_changes)~> implement:"Fix issues"
```

**Bug Investigation:**
```flow
# Parallel investigation with consolidation
[
  explore:"Find related code":related_files ||
  general-purpose:"Search for similar bugs":similar_issues ||
  general-purpose:"Check recent changes":recent_commits
] ->
general-purpose:"Consolidate findings into root cause analysis":analysis ->
implement:"Fix bug based on {analysis}":fix ->
general-purpose:"Run relevant tests":test_results
```

**Security Audit:**
```flow
# Security scanning with manual gate
$security-scanner:"Scan codebase for vulnerabilities":findings ->
@security-review:"Review {findings}. Approve if no critical issues." ->
(if approved)~> deploy:"Deploy to production"
```

## Workflow Templates

After creating your workflow, I'll offer to save it as a template for reuse.

Templates include:
- Descriptive name and metadata
- Parameter placeholders for customization
- Complete workflow syntax
- Usage instructions

Templates are saved in `examples/` directory as `.flow` files.

## What Happens Next

After I create your workflow:

1. **Review**: I show you the generated syntax with explanation
2. **Customize**: You can ask for modifications
3. **Save**: I offer to save as template
4. **Execute**: Use `/orchestration:run` to execute it

## Tips for Best Results

- **Be specific**: More details = better workflow
- **Ask questions**: I'm here to help refine your ideas
- **Start simple**: We can add complexity later
- **Review examples**: Check [examples.md](examples.md) for inspiration

## Technical Details

- **Namespace**: All plugin agents use `orchestration:` prefix
- **Temp agents**: Auto-prefixed with `orchestration:`
- **Variable binding**: Use `:variable_name` to capture outputs
- **Error handling**: Use `(if failed)~>` for error branches
