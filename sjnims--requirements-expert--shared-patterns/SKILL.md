# Shared Command Patterns

## Quick Reference

| Pattern | Purpose | Section |
|---------|---------|---------|
| [Recovery Flow](#standard-recovery-flow) | Handle `gh` operation failures | Interactive error recovery |
| [Idempotency Check](#idempotency-check) | Prevent duplicate issue creation | Query-before-create |
| [Batch Tracking](#batch-tracking) | Track multi-item operation results | Summary reporting |
| [Two-Layer Metadata](#two-layer-metadata-update) | Update custom fields AND labels | GitHub Projects metadata |

## Command Integration

Commands reference these patterns by name rather than reimplementing. When developing or modifying `/re:*` commands, apply the relevant patterns to ensure consistent behavior across the plugin.

**Pattern application:**

- Load this skill when implementing command error handling or batch operations
- Reference pattern names in command instructions (e.g., "Apply Standard Recovery Flow")
- Use the AskUserQuestion structures defined here for consistent user interactions
- Follow the Batch Tracking summary format for operation reporting

For full implementation details, see `references/implementation-details.md`.

## Overview

These four patterns provide consistent, reusable behavior across all `/re:*` commands:

1. **Recovery Flow** - Graceful error handling with user choice
2. **Idempotency Check** - Safe re-runs without duplicates
3. **Batch Tracking** - Clear operation summaries
4. **Two-Layer Metadata** - Complete GitHub Projects integration

Each pattern is designed for AI consumption—terse core definitions with detailed implementations in references/.

## Standard Recovery Flow

**When:** Any `gh` CLI operation fails (network, auth, permissions, rate limit).

**Options:** Present via `AskUserQuestion`:

| Option | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Retry | Re-attempt the failed operation |
| Skip | Add to `failed[]`, continue to next item |
| Check permissions | Run `gh auth status`, display result, re-ask |
| Stop | Exit immediately with summary of completed work |

**AskUserQuestion Structure:**

```yaml
header: "Operation Failed"
question: "[Operation] failed: [error message]. How would you like to proceed?"
options:
  - label: "Retry"
    description: "Attempt the operation again"
  - label: "Skip"
    description: "Skip this item and continue with the next"
  - label: "Check permissions"
    description: "Verify GitHub CLI authentication status"
  - label: "Stop"
    description: "Stop processing and show summary"
```

**Variations:**

- `re:init`: 3-option (no Skip) - single operation, nothing to skip
- `re:discover-vision`: Adds "Save draft" - preserve work on failure

---

## Idempotency Check

**When:** Before creating any GitHub issue (vision, epic, story, task).

**Flow:**

1. Query existing: `gh issue list --repo [repo] --label "type:[type]" --json number,title`
2. Match: case-insensitive, trimmed title comparison
3. If match found → present options via `AskUserQuestion`

**AskUserQuestion Structure:**

```yaml
header: "Duplicate Found"
question: "An issue titled '[title]' already exists (#[number]). How would you like to proceed?"
options:
  - label: "Skip"
    description: "Keep existing issue, don't create duplicate"
  - label: "Update"
    description: "Update the existing issue with new content"
  - label: "Create anyway"
    description: "Create new issue despite duplicate"
```

**Tracking integration:**

- Skip → add to `skipped[]` with existing issue number
- Update → add to `updated[]` after successful edit
- Create anyway → proceed to create, add to `created[]`

---

## Batch Tracking

**When:** Processing multiple items (epics, stories, tasks, priority updates).

**Lists:** Initialize at command start:

- `created[]` – New items successfully created
- `skipped[]` – Items skipped (duplicates or user choice)
- `updated[]` – Existing items modified
- `failed[]` – Operations that failed (with error reason)

**Summary Output Template:**

```markdown
## Summary

**Created:** [N] new [item-type]
- #[number] - [Title]
- #[number] - [Title]

**Updated:** [N] existing [item-type]
- #[number] - [Title] (updated [fields])

**Skipped:** [N] [item-type] (duplicates)
- [Title] (existing #[number])

**Failed:** [N] [item-type]
- [Title]: [error reason]
```

**Display rules:**

- Only show categories with count > 0
- Include issue numbers as `#[number]` links
- Show specific error reasons for failed items
- Order: Created → Updated → Skipped → Failed

**Variation:** `re:prioritize` adds `partial[]` for items where custom field updated but label failed.

---

## Two-Layer Metadata Update

**When:** Setting Type, Priority, or Status on GitHub Project items.

**Why two layers:**

| Layer | Command | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Custom Field | `gh project item-edit --field-id [id] --value "[val]"` | Project views, boards, filtering |
| Label | `gh issue edit [number] --add-label "[label]"` | Cross-project queries, GitHub search |

**Operation order:** Always update custom field first, then label.

**Label mapping:**

| Field Value | Label |
|-------------|-------|
| Vision | `type:vision` |
| Epic | `type:epic` |
| Story | `type:story` |
| Task | `type:task` |
| Must Have | `priority:must-have` |
| Should Have | `priority:should-have` |
| Could Have | `priority:could-have` |
| Won't Have | `priority:wont-have` |

**Tracking integration:**

- Both succeed → add to `updated[]`
- Field succeeds, label fails → add to `partial[]` (non-blocking)
- Both fail → add to `failed[]`

---

## Pattern Integration

Patterns work together in command workflows:

```text
For each item to process:
  1. Idempotency Check → determines if create/update/skip
  2. Create or Update operation
     - On failure → Recovery Flow
     - On success → Two-Layer Metadata Update
  3. Track result in appropriate Batch Tracking list

After all items:
  4. Display Batch Tracking Summary
```

**Cross-pattern data flow:**

| From Pattern | To Pattern | Data |
|--------------|------------|------|
| Idempotency Check | Batch Tracking | `skipped[]`, `updated[]` |
| Recovery Flow (Skip) | Batch Tracking | `failed[]` |
| Two-Layer Metadata | Batch Tracking | `updated[]`, `partial[]`, `failed[]` |
