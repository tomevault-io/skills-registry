# Task Breakdown

## Quick Actions & Routing

| User Intent | Action | Resource |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| Reviewing story first | Understand user goal and value | Step 1: Review the User Story |
| Identifying tasks | Map implementation layers | `references/task-layers.md` |
| Applying task patterns | Use CRUD/feature/integration patterns | `references/task-patterns.md` |
| Defining acceptance criteria | Use testable statement format | Step 4: Define Acceptance Criteria |
| Creating task issues | Use template | `references/task-template.md` |
| Viewing examples | Load sample task set | `examples/example-task-set.md` |

## Command Integration

The `/re:create-tasks` command guides task creation in GitHub Projects. This skill provides the methodology for breaking down stories into tasks—including task patterns, acceptance criteria templates, and layer-by-layer decomposition techniques. Load this skill for deeper understanding of task breakdown concepts or when you need guidance beyond what the command provides.

## Overview

Task breakdown transforms user stories into concrete, executable work items that can be assigned, tracked, and completed. Tasks represent the actual implementation steps needed to deliver a user story, each with clear acceptance criteria. This skill guides the process of decomposing stories into well-defined tasks suitable for GitHub issue tracking.

## Purpose

Tasks are the execution layer in the requirements hierarchy:
- **Above**: User Stories (user-facing functionality)
- **Tasks**: Specific implementation steps
- **Below**: (Nothing—tasks are the lowest level)

Well-defined tasks:
- Represent discrete units of work (2-8 hours typical, up to 1-2 days max)
- Have clear, testable acceptance criteria
- Can be assigned to individuals
- Track progress toward story completion
- Enable accurate status reporting

## Prerequisite

User story must exist before creating tasks. If no story exists, use the **user-story-creation** skill first.

## Task Characteristics

### What Makes a Good Task

**Specific and Concrete:**
- Clear, unambiguous description
- Obvious what needs to be done
- No interpretation needed

**Right-sized:**
- 2-8 hours of work (up to 1-2 days maximum)
- Small enough to complete in a single sitting when possible
- Large enough to deliver meaningful progress

**Testable:**
- Has clear acceptance criteria
- Can verify when complete
- Observable outcome

**Assignable:**
- One person can own and complete it
- Doesn't require coordinating multiple people

**Valuable:**
- Contributes toward completing the story
- Represents real progress

## Task Breakdown Process

### Step 1: Review the User Story

Understand the story being implemented:

**Key Actions:**
- Read story issue in GitHub Projects
- Understand the user goal and value
- Review acceptance criteria
- Note any constraints or assumptions

### Step 2: Identify Implementation Layers

Break down work by typical software layers. See `references/task-layers.md` for detailed guidance, examples, and checklists for each layer.

**Common Layers:**

| Layer | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| Frontend/UI | Components, styling, interactions, state |
| Backend/API | Endpoints, business logic, validation |
| Data/Database | Schema, migrations, queries, indexes |
| Testing | Unit, integration, E2E, manual |
| Documentation | API docs, user guides, code comments |
| DevOps | Configuration, deployment, monitoring |
| Research/Spike | Evaluation, prototypes, feasibility |

### Step 3: Apply Common Task Patterns

Use proven patterns as starting points for task breakdown. See `references/task-patterns.md` for detailed guidance, examples, and checklists.

**Common Patterns:**

| Pattern | When to Use |
|---------|-------------|
| CRUD Operations | Building entity management (create, read, update, delete) |
| Feature Implementation | Adding new user-facing capabilities |
| Integration | Connecting to external services or APIs |
| Refactoring | Improving code structure without changing behavior |
| Bug Fix | Fixing production issues |
| Migration | Moving to new systems or technologies |

### Step 4: Define Acceptance Criteria

For each task, specify clear success conditions:

**Format:**

Use specific, testable statements:
- "Component renders correctly with props X, Y, Z"
- "API endpoint returns 200 status with correct data structure"
- "Database migration runs without errors and creates table T"
- "Unit tests achieve >80% code coverage for module M"

**Key Elements:**
- What should exist/work when task is complete
- How to verify it works
- Any performance or quality standards

### Step 5: Sequence and Dependencies

Order tasks logically:

**Dependency Analysis:**
- Which tasks must come first?
- What's the critical path?
- Can any tasks be done in parallel?

**Typical Sequence:**
1. Data/schema changes (if needed)
2. Backend implementation
3. Frontend implementation
4. Integration and testing
5. Documentation

**Mark Dependencies:**
- Note which tasks block others
- Identify tasks that can start immediately
- Plan for parallel work when possible

### Step 6: Create Task Issues in GitHub Projects

For each task, create a GitHub issue in the relevant GitHub Project:

**Issue Title:** "[Clear, action-oriented task description]"

**Issue Description:** Task details and acceptance criteria using template

**Custom Fields:**
- Type: Task
- Priority: (inherited from story)
- Status: Not Started

**Labels:**
- `type:task`
- Technical labels (frontend, backend, database, testing, docs)

**Parent:** Link to Story issue as parent

**Estimate:** (optional) Hour or story point estimate

## Task Templates and Examples

For detailed task templates and examples by type (Frontend, Backend, Database, Testing, Documentation, Research/Spike), see `references/task-template.md`.

## Best Practices

### Keep Tasks Focused

One clear objective per task:

❌ "Implement campaign filtering and sorting and export"
✅ "Implement campaign date filtering"
✅ "Implement campaign sorting by name"
✅ "Implement campaign CSV export"

### Use Action-Oriented Titles

Start with verbs:

**Good:**
- "Create campaign filter component"
- "Implement date validation logic"
- "Add database index for performance"
- "Write unit tests for filter module"

**Poor:**
- "Campaign filtering" (vague)
- "Database" (what about it?)
- "Tests" (what kind? for what?)

### Include Technical Context

Help the implementer:
- Reference existing code patterns to follow
- Note relevant files or modules
- Mention design system components to use
- Link to related tasks or documentation

### Balance Granularity

Not too big, not too small:

**Too big:**
"Implement entire campaign management system" (this is a story or epic)

**Too small:**
"Import React" (this is a substep, not a task)

**Just right:**
"Create CampaignList component with sorting and filtering props"

### Always Include Acceptance Criteria

Never create a task without clear success conditions:
- Minimum 3-5 criteria per task
- Make them specific and testable
- Include both functional and quality criteria

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Tasks Without Acceptance Criteria

Every task needs testable success conditions:

❌ "Work on campaign filtering"
✅ "Implement date filter UI" + 5 specific acceptance criteria

### Tasks Too Large

Watch for multi-day or multi-person tasks:
- Split tasks larger than 2 days
- Each task should be completable by one person
- If coordination needed, it's probably too big

### Mixing Concerns

One task, one focus area:

❌ "Implement filter UI and backend API and database schema"
✅ Three separate tasks for UI, API, and database

### Vague Descriptions

Be specific about what needs to be done:

❌ "Fix bugs"
✅ "Fix date validation bug where end date before start date is allowed"

### Missing Dependencies

Note what must be done first:
- Database schema before backend code
- Backend API before frontend integration
- Core functionality before tests (usually)

## Quick Reference: Task Breakdown Flow

1. **Review Story** → Understand user goal, value, acceptance criteria
2. **Identify Layers** → Frontend, backend, database, testing, docs, infrastructure
3. **Apply Patterns** → Use common task patterns as starting points
4. **Define Acceptance Criteria** → Specify testable success conditions for each task
5. **Sequence** → Order tasks, note dependencies
6. **Create Issues** → Add to GitHub Projects as children of story
7. **Assign** → (Optional) Assign tasks to team members
8. **Execute** → Begin work, update task status as progress is made

## Integration with GitHub Issues (GitHub Projects)

### Task Issue Format

**Title:** Clear, action-oriented description

**Labels:**
- `type:task`
- Technical area (frontend, backend, database, etc.)
- Priority (inherited from story)

**Assignment:** Person responsible

**Estimate:** Optional hours or points

**Parent Link:** User story issue

**Acceptance Criteria:** In issue description

### Tracking Progress

Tasks enable granular progress tracking:
- Story progress = % of tasks complete
- Epic progress = % of stories complete (via tasks)
- Vision progress = % of epics complete (via stories → tasks)

Full traceability: Vision → Epic → Story → Task
