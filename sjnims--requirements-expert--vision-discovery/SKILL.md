## Command Integration

The `/re:discover-vision` command orchestrates the vision creation workflow. This skill provides the methodology, templates, and techniques (like 5 Whys) that the command uses. Load this skill for deeper understanding of vision discovery concepts or when you need guidance beyond what the command provides.

## Overview

Vision discovery is the critical first step in the requirements lifecycle. A clear, well-articulated product vision provides direction for all subsequent work—epics, user stories, and tasks all flow from and align with the vision. This skill guides the process of discovering and documenting a compelling product vision through structured questioning and best practices.

## Purpose

A product vision defines:
- **What problem** is being solved
- **Who** will benefit from the solution
- **Why** this solution matters
- **What success looks like** when achieved

The vision serves as a north star for all product decisions, helping teams stay aligned and prioritize work that delivers the most value.

## Vision Discovery Process

### Step 1: Understand the Problem Space

Begin by exploring the problem being solved. Ask probing questions to uncover the root issue:

**Key Actions:**
- Explore the problem being solved and why it matters
- Identify who experiences this problem
- Document current workarounds, competitors, and manual processes
- Understand why the current situation is unsatisfactory
- Assess consequences if the problem remains unsolved

**Technique:** Use the "5 Whys" technique to dig deeper into root causes. When the user describes a problem, ask "why is that a problem?" repeatedly to uncover underlying issues.

**Output:** Clear problem statement with root cause identified. Documented current state, workarounds, and consequences of inaction.

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Users spend 3+ hours weekly manually reconciling data across spreadsheets, leading to errors and delays"
- ✅ Ask "Why is that a problem?" when user says "We need a dashboard" to uncover the actual pain point
- ❌ Accept "We need better reporting" without understanding what makes current reporting inadequate
- ❌ Skip problem exploration and jump straight to solution discussion

### Step 2: Identify Target Users

Clearly define who will use and benefit from the solution:

**Key Actions:**
- Identify the primary user or customer
- Determine secondary users (admins, support staff, etc.)
- Define key characteristics (role, expertise level, context)
- Understand user goals and motivations
- Document pain points users experience

**Technique:** Create user personas with specific, concrete details. Interview or research actual users when possible. Prioritize users by frequency of use and criticality of their needs.

**Output:** Documented user personas or archetypes with specific characteristics. Clear distinction between primary and secondary users. Avoid vague descriptions like "business users"—be specific: "marketing managers at mid-size B2B companies tracking campaign ROI."

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Marketing managers at mid-size B2B companies who need to track campaign ROI across 5+ channels"
- ✅ Identify both primary users (analysts) and secondary users (executives viewing reports, admins managing access)
- ❌ "Business users" or "stakeholders" without specific characteristics
- ❌ Focus only on one user type when multiple distinct personas exist

### Step 3: Define the Solution Vision

Articulate what the solution is and how it addresses the problem:

**Key Actions:**
- Articulate what the product does in one sentence
- Define what makes this solution different or better than alternatives
- Identify the 2-3 core capabilities that define this product
- Establish scope boundaries (what is explicitly NOT part of this vision)

**Technique:** Use the "elevator pitch" format: "For [target users] who [need/problem], [product name] is a [category] that [key benefit]. Unlike [alternatives], our product [unique differentiator]."

**Output:** One-sentence product description. Clear value proposition. Defined scope boundaries (what's included and explicitly excluded). Core capabilities identified.

**Examples:**
- ✅ "For marketing managers who struggle to measure ROI, CampaignTracker is a unified analytics platform that consolidates data from 10+ channels. Unlike manual spreadsheets, it provides real-time insights with zero data entry."
- ✅ Define clear boundaries: "Includes: campaign tracking, ROI calculation. Excludes: creative design tools, email delivery"
- ❌ "A platform that helps with marketing" (too vague, no differentiation)
- ❌ Include everything without clear scope boundaries

### Step 4: Establish Success Metrics

Define how success will be measured:

**Key Actions:**
- Define how product success will be measured
- Determine which metrics matter most (usage, revenue, satisfaction, efficiency)
- Establish what "good" looks like in 6 months and 1 year
- Identify user behaviors that indicate value delivery

**Technique:** Apply the SMART framework (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound). Focus on leading indicators of value rather than vanity metrics. Distinguish between adoption metrics, engagement metrics, and outcome metrics.

**Output:** Specific, measurable success criteria with clear targets and timeframes. Avoid vanity metrics—focus on indicators of genuine value and impact.

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Achieve 1,000 active users with 70%+ weekly retention within 6 months"
- ✅ "Reduce time spent on manual data reconciliation from 3 hours/week to 15 minutes"
- ❌ "Be the best product in the market" (unmeasurable)
- ❌ "Get lots of users" (no specific target or timeframe)

### Step 5: Document the Vision

Create a structured vision document in GitHub Projects as an issue with Type: Vision. Use the template structure from `references/vision-template.md`.

**Key Actions:**
- Verify all previous steps have been completed with clear outputs
- Confirm the problem statement is specific and well-articulated
- Ensure target users are clearly defined with concrete characteristics
- Validate the solution vision is differentiated and bounded
- Check that success metrics are specific and measurable

**Technique:** Use the vision template structure. Synthesize outputs from Steps 1-4 into a cohesive document. Keep it concise (500-1,000 words total). Review with stakeholders before finalizing.

**Output:** Complete vision document as a GitHub issue with all required sections and proper metadata (Type: Vision, labels, custom fields).

**Core Sections:**

1. **Problem Statement** - What problem exists and why it matters
2. **Target Users** - Who will use this and their key characteristics
3. **Solution Overview** - What the product is and does
4. **Core Value Proposition** - Why users will choose this solution
5. **Success Metrics** - How success will be measured
6. **Scope & Boundaries** - What's included and explicitly excluded

**Additional Sections (as applicable):**

7. **Strategic Alignment** - Business goals, market opportunity, competitive landscape
   - _Include when_: Vision supports broader organizational strategy, multiple stakeholders need market positioning context, or competitive differentiation is a key concern
   - _Skip when_: Internal tools, personal projects, or when strategic context is obvious from problem statement

8. **Risks & Assumptions** - Key assumptions that must hold true, known risks and mitigations
   - _Include when_: Product has significant dependencies or unknowns, major assumptions underpin viability, or stakeholders need visibility into potential blockers
   - _Skip when_: Low-risk well-understood domains, small-scope projects, or when risks are negligible

**Examples:**
- ✅ Create vision issue with all 6 core sections, Type=Vision custom field, and `type:vision` label
- ✅ Vision document is 600 words, clear, jargon-free, and answers all key questions from Steps 1-4
- ❌ Create vision with vague sections like "Users: various stakeholders"
- ❌ Skip metadata (custom fields and labels) when creating the issue

## Best Practices

### Keep It Concise

A vision should be digestible in 5-10 minutes. Aim for:
- 1-2 paragraphs for each major section
- Total length: 500-1,000 words
- Clear, jargon-free language

### Make It Inspiring Yet Realistic

Balance ambition with achievability:
- Articulate a compelling future state
- Ground it in real user needs and market realities
- Avoid buzzwords and hype
- Focus on genuine value creation

### Focus on "Why" Not "How"

The vision defines direction, not implementation:
- Describe outcomes and benefits, not technical solutions
- Avoid specifying features or architecture
- Leave room for discovery during epic and story creation
- Answer "what problem" and "why it matters," not "how we'll build it"

### Ensure Alignment

Before finalizing the vision:
- Review with key stakeholders
- Confirm it resonates with target users
- Verify it aligns with business goals
- Check that success metrics are measurable

### Iterate and Refine

Vision is not set in stone:
- Refine as new information emerges
- Update when market conditions or user needs change
- Use feedback from epic and story creation to improve clarity
- Treat vision as a living document

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

Watch for visions that are too vague, too prescriptive, have scope creep, unmeasurable success, missing user focus, or solution-before-problem thinking. See `references/common-pitfalls.md` for detailed examples and remediation.

## Quick Reference: Vision Discovery Flow

1. **Problem Space** → Understand what problem exists and why it matters
2. **Target Users** → Define who experiences the problem and will use the solution
3. **Solution Vision** → Articulate what the solution is and its core value
4. **Success Metrics** → Establish measurable success criteria
5. **Document** → Create vision issue in GitHub Projects
6. **Validate** → Review with stakeholders and refine
7. **Proceed** → Move to epic identification once vision is solid

## Integration with GitHub Projects

Create the vision as a GitHub issue in the relevant GitHub Project:

**Issue Title:** "Product Vision: [Product Name]"

**Issue Description:** Full vision document with all sections

**Two-Layer Metadata (both required):**

Set BOTH custom fields AND labels to ensure proper filtering:

| Layer | Field | Value | Purpose |
|-------|-------|-------|---------|
| Custom Field | Type | Vision | Project views and filtering |
| Custom Field | Status | Active | Project status tracking |
| Label | `type:vision` | - | Cross-project queries, API filtering |

**Why both?** Custom fields are project-specific and enable GitHub Projects views and filtering. Labels are portable across GitHub and enable API-based filtering and cross-project queries.

### Parent-Child Hierarchy

**The vision issue becomes the parent of ALL epics.** This establishes the root of the requirements hierarchy:

```text
Vision Issue (#1, Type: Vision)
  └── Epic Issue (#2, parent: #1)
  └── Epic Issue (#3, parent: #1)
  └── Epic Issue (#4, parent: #1)
```

This hierarchy enables:

- **Clear traceability**: Trace any task back to the originating vision
- **Impact analysis**: Understand what's affected when vision changes
- **Progress tracking**: Monitor completion across the entire requirements tree
- **Native GitHub features**: Leverage GitHub's built-in issue relationship tools

All epics will be created as child issues of this vision issue, establishing clear traceability throughout the requirements lifecycle.
