# Regulation S Offering Advisor

## Overview

Regulation S provides a safe harbor from the registration requirements of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 for offers and sales of securities that occur outside the United States. It is based on the territorial approach to Section 5, recognizing that U.S. registration requirements are primarily designed to protect U.S. investors.

### Key Principle

Regulation S establishes that Section 5 registration requirements do not apply to offers and sales of securities that occur outside the United States, provided certain conditions are met to prevent the securities from flowing back to U.S. persons during a restricted period.

### Two Safe Harbors

Regulation S contains two distinct safe harbors:

1. **Issuer Safe Harbor (Rule 903)**: For offers and sales by issuers, distributors, their affiliates, and persons acting on their behalf
2. **Resale Safe Harbor (Rule 904)**: For resales by persons other than the issuer, distributors, their affiliates, or persons acting on their behalf

---

## Quick Decision Workflow

### Step 1: Is Regulation S Potentially Available?

Ask these threshold questions:

- [ ] Is the offer or sale occurring **outside the United States**?
- [ ] Can the transaction qualify as an **"offshore transaction"**?
- [ ] Are there **no "directed selling efforts"** in the United States?

If YES to all → Proceed to Step 2
If NO to any → Regulation S safe harbors are not available

### Step 2: Are You the Issuer or a Reseller?

| If you are... | Use... |
|---------------|--------|
| Issuer, distributor, affiliate of issuer, or acting on their behalf | **Issuer Safe Harbor (Rule 903)** → Go to Step 3 |
| Any other person (investor, dealer, etc.) | **Resale Safe Harbor (Rule 904)** → See `references/resale-safe-harbor.md` |

### Step 3: Determine the Transaction Category (for Issuer Safe Harbor)

The Issuer Safe Harbor has three categories with progressively stricter requirements:

| Category | When It Applies | Restrictions |
|----------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Category 1** | Foreign issuer with no SUSMI; overseas directed offerings; certain government securities | Fewest restrictions |
| **Category 2** | Reporting foreign issuers (equity); reporting U.S. issuers (debt); non-reporting foreign issuers (debt) | Moderate restrictions |
| **Category 3** | All other offerings (typically non-reporting U.S. issuers, equity of non-reporting foreign issuers with SUSMI) | Most stringent restrictions |

**For detailed category determination**, see `references/category-determination.md`

### Step 4: Apply the Applicable Requirements

Based on your category, ensure compliance with:

1. **General conditions** (offshore transaction, no directed selling efforts)
2. **Offering restrictions** (if applicable)
3. **Distribution compliance period** requirements
4. **Legends and certifications** (if applicable)
5. **Special rules** for debt or equity securities

## Common Questions

### Can a U.S. issuer use Regulation S?
Yes. Regulation S is available to both U.S. and foreign issuers, though U.S. issuers typically fall into Category 2 (for debt) or Category 3 (for equity), which have more stringent requirements.

### Can Regulation S securities ever be sold to U.S. persons?
Yes, but generally only after the distribution compliance period has expired and in compliance with applicable resale restrictions. During the DCP, sales to U.S. persons are prohibited or heavily restricted depending on the category.

### What is the relationship between Regulation S and Rule 144A?
They are complementary. An offering can be structured with a Regulation S tranche (for non-U.S. investors) and a Rule 144A tranche (for U.S. qualified institutional buyers). See `references/resale-safe-harbor.md` for integration considerations.

### Does Regulation S provide a complete exemption from U.S. securities laws?
No. Regulation S only exempts offers and sales from Section 5 registration requirements. The antifraud provisions of U.S. securities laws continue to apply to offerings made in reliance on Regulation S.

## Using This Skill

When a user asks about Regulation S offerings:

1. **Start with the disclaimer** – remind users this is educational information, not legal advice
2. **Identify the transaction type** – issuer offering or resale?
3. **Determine the category** – use the workflow above
4. **Load relevant reference files** – provide detailed requirements from the appropriate reference documents
5. **Highlight key compliance points** – legends, certifications, DCP requirements
6. **Recommend legal counsel** – for any actual transaction

### Sample Prompt Handling

**User asks**: "We're a Delaware corporation wanting to sell equity offshore. What do we need to do?"

**Response approach**:
1. Note this is likely a Category 3 transaction (U.S. issuer, equity)
2. Load `references/issuer-safe-harbor.md` and `references/equity-securities.md`
3. Explain the strict Category 3 requirements
4. Provide the practical checklist from `references/practical-checklist.md`
5. Emphasize need for qualified securities counsel
