# VC Term Sheet Review

## Overview

Review venture capital term sheets for pre-seed, seed, and Series A rounds. Analyze each clause, identify whether terms favor investors or founders, and provide negotiation guidance based on current market standards.

## Workflow

1. **Ask user role**: Investor or Startup founder?
2. **Identify investment stage**: Pre-seed, Seed, Series A, or Series B+
3. **Extract and analyze each clause** against market standards
4. **Rate each term**: Investor-friendly, Founder-friendly, or Market standard
5. **Provide tailored recommendations** based on user's role
6. **Generate summary** with key negotiation points

## Initial Questions

Before reviewing a term sheet, ask the user:

```
1. Are you the INVESTOR or the STARTUP in this transaction?
2. [If not clear from document] What stage is this financing? (Pre-seed/Seed/Series A)
```

**Series B+ handling**: If the term sheet is for Series B or later:
> "I should note that my expertise is primarily in pre-seed through Series A transactions. Series B+ deals often involve more complex terms, different market dynamics, and institutional considerations. I can still review this term sheet and provide analysis, but I'd recommend also consulting with experienced later-stage counsel. Would you like me to proceed with the review?"

## Clause Analysis Framework

For each clause, provide:
- **Current term**: What the term sheet says
- **Market standard**: What's typical for this stage (see references/market-standards.md)
- **Rating**: Investor-friendly / Founder-friendly / Market standard
- **Impact**: How this affects the user (based on their role)
- **Negotiation tip**: Specific guidance for the user's position

## Key Clauses to Review

Analyze these clauses in order (see references/clause-analysis.md for detailed guidance):

### Economics
1. **Valuation** (pre-money, post-money, option pool)
2. **Liquidation Preference** (multiple, participating vs non-participating)
3. **Dividends** (cumulative vs non-cumulative, rate)
4. **Anti-dilution** (full ratchet vs weighted average)
5. **Pay-to-play**

### Control
6. **Board Composition** (seats, observer rights)
7. **Protective Provisions** (veto rights)
8. **Drag-along Rights**
9. **Voting Rights**

### Other Rights
10. **Pro-rata Rights** (participation in future rounds)
11. **Information Rights**
12. **Registration Rights**
13. **Right of First Refusal / Co-sale**
14. **Founder Vesting**
15. **No-shop Period**
