description: Process Fireflies meeting transcripts with mandatory full transcript analysis (not just Fireflies summary), extract action items from ALL participants, create GitHub issues with smart repo routing, run deterministic verification gates, and generate EOS Level 10 Meeting summaries. Use after team meetings or when the user mentions meetings, Fireflies, L10, or action item extraction. Use when this capability is needed.

## How This Skill Works

This skill processes meeting transcripts from Fireflies with mandatory full transcript analysis — not just the Fireflies automated summary. It extracts action items from ALL participants, routes GitHub issues to the correct repository via smart detection, and runs a deterministic verification script to ensure no items are dropped. It works with **any repository** you're currently in.

### Principle 1: Mandatory Full Transcript Analysis

Always fetch meeting data via Fireflies MCP tools:
- `mcp__fireflies__fireflies_search` to find meetings
- `mcp__fireflies__fireflies_get_summary` for action items, keywords, overview
- `mcp__fireflies__fireflies_get_transcript` — ALWAYS fetch the full transcript; it is mandatory, not optional

The Fireflies automated summary is a starting point. A subagent must read the entire transcript to extract additional action items that Fireflies missed. The verification script confirms no items were dropped.

### Principle 2: Dynamic Repository Context

At workflow start, detect the current repository:
- Repository owner and name via `gh repo view`
- Available labels via `gh label list`
- Available milestones via GitHub API
- GitHub Projects (if any exist)

**Never hardcode repo-specific values.** Always detect dynamically.

### Principle 3: Compare Before Creating

Before creating new GitHub issues:
1. Search existing issues in the **current repository** for potential duplicates
2. Check against project milestones (whatever naming convention the repo uses)
3. If related issue exists, suggest commenting/updating rather than duplicating

### Principle 4: Prompt for Confirmation

For each potential GitHub issue:
- Show extracted action item
- Display suggested labels (from detected available labels)
- Ask user to confirm/modify before creation
- Never auto-assign (leave unassigned)

### Principle 5: EOS Level 10 Format

All meeting summaries follow the Level 10 Meeting structure:
- Clear accountability (WHO is responsible)
- Specific deliverables (WHAT is agreed)
- Time-bound commitments (WHEN is the deadline)

### Principle 6: Action Items as Checklists

Action items MUST always use markdown checkbox format — never tables or plain bullets:
```markdown
- [ ] Action description -- **Owner Name** (due date)
```
This enables Obsidian task tracking and interactive checkboxes.

## Optional: Vault Integration

If you want meeting notes and transcripts saved to a personal knowledge base (Obsidian vault, SecondBrain, etc.), set these environment variables or define them in your project's CLAUDE.md:

| Variable | Purpose | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `MEETING_NOTES_DIR` | Where structured meeting notes are saved | `~/SecondBrain/02_Areas/notes` |
| `MEETING_TRANSCRIPTS_DIR` | Where raw transcripts are archived | `~/SecondBrain/02_Areas/notes/transcripts` |

**If not set:** The skill will only generate GitHub issues and L10 summaries without saving to a vault. It will ask the user where to save if they request it.

**If set:** The skill automatically saves:
1. **Structured meeting note** to `$MEETING_NOTES_DIR/YYYY-MM-DD - Entity - Topic.md`
2. **Raw transcript** (when piped in directly or fetched from Fireflies) to `$MEETING_TRANSCRIPTS_DIR/YYYY-MM-DD - Source - Topic.md`

### File Naming Convention

Notes: `YYYY-MM-DD - Entity - Topic.md` (e.g., `2026-03-13 - Hampton - Core Meeting.md`)
Transcripts: `YYYY-MM-DD - Source - Topic.md` (e.g., `2026-03-13 - Fireflies - Hampton Core Meeting.md`)

### Transcript Frontmatter

```yaml
---
date: YYYY-MM-DD
type: transcript
source: fireflies | pasted | plaud
meeting_type: sales | internal | peer-advisory | other
attendees: [...]
processed_note: "YYYY-MM-DD - Entity - Topic.md"
---
```

The `processed_note` field links the raw transcript to its structured meeting note.

<intake>
What would you like to do?

1. **Process recent meeting** - Analyze the most recent Fireflies meeting and extract action items
2. **Search specific meeting** - Find a meeting by date, keyword, or participant
3. **Create issues from notes** - I already have meeting notes to convert to GitHub issues
4. **Generate L10 summary only** - Create EOS Level 10 summary without creating issues

**Wait for response before proceeding.**
</intake>

<routing>
| Response | Workflow |
|----------|----------|
| 1, "recent", "latest", "today" | `workflows/process-recent-meeting.md` |
| 2, "search", "find", "specific" | `workflows/search-meeting.md` |
| 3, "create", "notes", "issues" | `workflows/create-issues-from-notes.md` |
| 4, "summary", "L10", "EOS" | `workflows/generate-l10-summary.md` |

**After reading the workflow, follow it exactly.**
