## Quick Start

### First-Time Setup

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - PocketSmith account with API access
   - Developer API key from PocketSmith (Settings > Security)
   - Python 3.9+ with uv package manager

2. **Configuration**:
   - Copy `.env.sample` to `.env`
   - Add `POCKETSMITH_API_KEY=<your_key>`
   - Set `TAX_INTELLIGENCE_LEVEL=smart` (reference|smart|full)
   - Set `DEFAULT_INTELLIGENCE_MODE=smart` (conservative|smart|aggressive)

3. **Installation**:
   ```bash
   # From the skill directory
   uv sync
   ```

4. **Guided Onboarding**:
   ```bash
   # Launch integrated onboarding (8 stages)
   /agent-smith:install
   ```

The onboarding process will:
- Discover your PocketSmith account structure
- Recommend and apply a rule template
- Help customize rules for your needs
- Configure intelligence modes
- Incrementally categorize transactions
- Show measurable improvement with health scores
- Provide ongoing usage guidance
- Generate intelligent suggestions

**Time required**: 30-60 minutes for first-time setup

### Daily Usage

**Two Usage Modes:**

1. **Guided Journey Mode** - When you start Claude Code, Agent Smith displays a status dashboard with:
   - Your health score
   - Uncategorized transaction count
   - Conflicts awaiting review
   - Suggested next steps with both natural language and command options

2. **Power User Mode** - Use slash commands directly for specific operations.

**Slash Commands** (7 specialized commands):
- `/smith:install` - Installation and onboarding wizard
- `/smith:categorize [--mode] [--period]` - Transaction categorization
- `/smith:review-conflicts` - Review transactions flagged for review
- `/smith:health [--full|--quick]` - Health check and recommendations
- `/smith:insights <spending|trends|scenario|report>` - Financial analysis and reports
- `/smith:tax <deductions|cgt|bas|eofy>` - Tax intelligence (ATO)
- `/smith:schedule [--setup|--status|--remove]` - Automated categorization scheduling

## Python Scripts

All Python scripts are in `scripts/` directory. **Always run with `uv run python -u`** for proper dependency resolution and unbuffered output.

### Core Operations

```bash
# Categorize transactions
uv run python -u scripts/operations/batch_categorize.py --mode=smart --period=2025-11

# Run health check
uv run python -u scripts/health/check.py --full

# Generate spending report
uv run python -u scripts/reporting/generate.py --period=2025 --format=all

# Tax deduction analysis
uv run python -u scripts/tax/deduction_detector.py --period=2024-25
```

### Script Organization

- **`scripts/core/`** - API client, rule engine, unified rules
- **`scripts/operations/`** - Categorization, batch processing, transaction updates
- **`scripts/analysis/`** - Spending analysis, trend detection
- **`scripts/reporting/`** - Multi-format report generation
- **`scripts/tax/`** - ATO mappings, deductions, CGT, BAS preparation
- **`scripts/scenarios/`** - Historical, projections, optimization, tax scenarios
- **`scripts/status/`** - Status dashboard for SessionStart hook
- **`scripts/scheduled/`** - Automated scheduled tasks (cron/launchd)
- **`scripts/health/`** - Health check engine, recommendations, monitoring
- **`scripts/workflows/`** - Interactive categorization workflows
- **`scripts/utils/`** - Backup, validation, logging, merchant normalization

## Unified Rule System

Agent Smith uses a YAML-based unified rule system for transaction categorization and labeling.

### Quick Start with Rules

```bash
# 1. Choose a template for your household type
uv run python scripts/setup/template_selector.py

# 2. Customize rules in data/rules.yaml

# 3. Test with dry run
uv run python scripts/operations/batch_categorize.py --mode=dry_run --period=2025-11

# 4. Apply to transactions
uv run python scripts/operations/batch_categorize.py --mode=apply --period=2025-11
```

### Example Rule

```yaml
rules:
  # Category rule - categorize transactions
  - type: category
    name: WOOLWORTHS → Groceries
    patterns: [WOOLWORTHS, COLES, ALDI]
    category: Food & Dining > Groceries
    confidence: 95

  # Label rule - apply labels based on context
  - type: label
    name: Shared Groceries
    when:
      categories: [Groceries]
      accounts: [Shared Bills]
    labels: [Shared Expense, Essential]
```

### Key Features
- **Two-phase execution**: Categories first, then labels
- **Pattern matching**: Regex patterns with exclusions
- **Confidence scoring**: 0-100% for auto-apply logic
- **LLM fallback**: AI categorization when rules don't match
- **Intelligence modes**: Conservative/Smart/Aggressive
- **Template system**: Pre-built rules for common household types
- **Operational modes**: DRY_RUN/VALIDATE/APPLY for safe testing

See [references/unified-rules-guide.md](references/unified-rules-guide.md) for complete documentation.

## Tax Intelligence

### ATO Compliance (Australian Tax Office)

**Three Levels**:

1. **Reference (Level 1)**:
   - ATO category mappings
   - Basic tax reports
   - GST tracking
   - Resource links

2. **Smart (Level 2)** - Recommended:
   - Deduction detection (14 pattern-based rules)
   - CGT tracking with FIFO matching
   - Confidence scoring
   - Substantiation threshold checking ($300, $75 taxi/Uber)
   - Time-based commuting detection
   - Instant asset write-off tracking

3. **Full (Level 3)** - Power Users:
   - BAS preparation with GST calculations
   - Compliance checks
   - Scenario planning
   - Audit-ready documentation
   - Professional advice disclaimers

**Configure Tax Level**:
```bash
# In .env file
TAX_INTELLIGENCE_LEVEL=smart  # reference|smart|full
TAX_JURISDICTION=AU
FINANCIAL_YEAR_END=06-30
```

### Deduction Detection Example

```python
from scripts.tax.deduction_detector import DeductionDetector

detector = DeductionDetector()
result = detector.detect_deduction(transaction)
# Returns: {"is_deductible": True, "confidence": "high",
#           "reason": "Office supplies", "substantiation_required": True}
```

### CGT Tracking Example

```python
from scripts.tax.cgt_tracker import CGTTracker, AssetType
from decimal import Decimal
from datetime import date

tracker = CGTTracker()
tracker.track_purchase(
    asset_type=AssetType.SHARES,
    name="BHP Group",
    quantity=Decimal("100"),
    purchase_date=date(2023, 1, 1),
    purchase_price=Decimal("45.50"),
    fees=Decimal("19.95")
)

event = tracker.track_sale(
    asset_type=AssetType.SHARES,
    name="BHP Group",
    quantity=Decimal("100"),
    sale_date=date(2024, 6, 1),
    sale_price=Decimal("52.00"),
    fees=Decimal("19.95")
)
# Returns CGTEvent with capital_gain, discount_eligible, holding_period_days
```

## Scenario Analysis

### Historical Analysis
```python
from scripts.scenarios.historical import calculate_what_if_spending

scenario = calculate_what_if_spending(
    transactions=transactions,
    category_name="Dining",
    adjustment_percent=-30.0,  # 30% reduction
    start_date="2025-01-01",
    end_date="2025-12-31"
)
print(f"Savings: ${scenario['savings']:.2f}")
```

### Spending Forecast
```python
from scripts.scenarios.projections import forecast_spending

forecast = forecast_spending(
    transactions=transactions,
    category_name="Groceries",
    months_forward=6,
    inflation_rate=3.0
)
```

### Optimization Suggestions
```python
from scripts.scenarios.optimization import suggest_optimizations

optimizations = suggest_optimizations(transactions=transactions)
print(f"Potential savings: ${optimizations['potential_annual_savings']:.2f}")
```

## Command Architecture Patterns

All Agent Smith commands follow consistent patterns for reliability and maintainability.

### 1. Deterministic Python Scripts

Commands delegate to git-tracked Python scripts in `scripts/` for all operations:

```
User Request → Slash Command → Python Script → PocketSmith API
     (UX)        (Guidance)      (Logic)         (Data)
```

**Why this matters**:
- Same inputs always produce same outputs
- All logic is testable and auditable
- No hidden state or side effects

### 2. Subagent Delegation Pattern

Commands use subagents to preserve main conversation context:

```markdown
**IMPORTANT: Delegate ALL work to a subagent to preserve main context window.**

Use the Task tool with `subagent_type: "general-purpose"` to execute...
```

**When to use subagents**:
- Batch operations (>50 transactions)
- Multi-step workflows with verbose output
- Operations that could pollute context

### 3. Guided Workflow Pattern

Every command follows this structure:

1. **Goal** - What will this accomplish?
2. **Why This Matters** - Business context
3. **Execution Steps** - Numbered steps with scripts
4. **Next Steps** - What to do after completion

### 4. Visual Style Guidelines

| Element | Usage |
|---------|-------|
| Emojis | Status: ✅ success, ⏳ processing, ⚠️ warning, ❌ error |
| Progress | `[23/100] Processing...` |
| Tables | Results summaries |
| ASCII bars | Health dimensions: `████████░░ 80%` |

### 5. Subagent Orchestration

Agent Smith uses intelligent subagent orchestration for complex operations:

**When to delegate to subagents**:
- Transaction count > 100
- Estimated tokens > 5000
- Bulk processing or deep analysis
- Multi-period operations
- Parallelization opportunities

**Subagent types**:
- `general-purpose` - Most operations (categorization, analysis, reporting)
- Purpose-built agents for specialized workflows

**Context preservation**: Main skill maintains user preferences, session state, and high-level decisions while subagents handle heavy processing.

## Health Check System

```bash
# Run comprehensive health check
uv run python scripts/health/check.py --full
```

**6 Health Dimensions** (scored 0-100):
1. **Data Quality (25%)** - Uncategorized rate, duplicates, gaps
2. **Category Structure (20%)** - Depth, unused categories, distribution
3. **Rule Engine (15%)** - Coverage, efficiency, conflicts
4. **Tax Readiness (15%)** - Tax categorization, compliance
5. **Automation (10%)** - Savings automation, bill scheduling
6. **Budget Alignment (15%)** - Variance, overspending

**Output includes**:
- Overall score with status (Poor/Fair/Good/Excellent)
- Individual dimension scores
- Top 3 prioritized recommendations
- Projected score after improvements

**Automated monitoring**:
- Weekly quick health checks
- Monthly full health analysis
- Pre-EOFY comprehensive check
- Post-major-operation validation

## Critical Operating Rules

**NEVER create custom one-off scripts for core Agent Smith operations.**

Agent Smith has a complete architecture with:
- Slash commands (`/smith:categorize`, `/smith:analyze`, etc.)
- Python workflows in `scripts/workflows/`
- Core operations in `scripts/operations/`
- Proper API client with correct endpoints in `scripts/core/api_client.py`

**If you find yourself writing a new Python script to:**
- Categorize transactions
- Analyze spending
- Generate reports
- Update PocketSmith data
- Run health checks

**STOP. You are reinventing the wheel.**

**Instead:**
1. Check if a slash command exists (`/smith:*`)
2. Check if a workflow exists in `scripts/workflows/`
3. Check if a core operation exists in `scripts/operations/`
4. Use the existing code that has been tested and uses correct API endpoints

**Why this matters:**
- Custom scripts may use wrong API endpoints (e.g., `/users/{id}/transactions/{id}` instead of `/transactions/{id}`)
- Custom scripts bypass rule engine, validation, backup, and audit systems
- Custom scripts duplicate functionality that already exists
- Custom scripts won't benefit from future improvements

**Exception:** Only create new scripts when building NEW features not yet in the design, and always place them in the correct `scripts/` subdirectory.

## Best Practices

### Transaction Categorization
1. **Always use `/smith:categorize`** - Never create custom categorization scripts
2. Start with a rule template matching your household type
3. Use dry-run mode to preview categorization
4. Review and adjust rules based on results
5. Monitor rule performance metrics
6. Let AI handle edge cases (LLM fallback)

### Tax Compliance
1. Configure appropriate tax level for your needs
2. Track all deductible expenses as they occur
3. Maintain receipt documentation (>$300 ATO requirement)
4. Review tax reports before EOFY (June 30)
5. Consult registered tax agent for complex situations

### Financial Health
1. Run health checks monthly
2. Address high-priority recommendations first
3. Maintain 95%+ categorization rate
4. Review and clean up unused categories
5. Set up automated alerts for budget overruns

### Backup and Safety
1. Always backup before bulk operations (automatic)
2. Use dry-run mode for untested operations
3. Review audit trail for unexpected changes
4. Maintain 30 days of recent backups
5. Export tax reports for 7-year ATO retention
