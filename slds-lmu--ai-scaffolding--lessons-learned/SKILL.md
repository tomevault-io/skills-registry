# Lessons Learned

Identify what was learned in this session and persist it so future sessions benefit.

## When to Run

- User explicitly asks (`/lessons-learned`, "save what we learned")
- End of a complex multi-session task (suggest proactively)
- After a significant debugging session that uncovered non-obvious behavior
- After a council-of-bots review that surfaced actionable fixes

## Selectivity Principle

**Default to NOT saving.** Memory files accumulate over time and consume context in
every future session. Each entry must earn its place. Ask: "Would a fresh Claude
session clearly benefit from knowing this?" If the answer is "maybe" — skip it.

Most sessions produce 0–2 lessons worth persisting. A session that yields 5+ is rare
and should prompt extra scrutiny. Prefer fewer high-signal entries over comprehensive
logs of everything that happened.

## Workflow

### 1. Mine the session for lessons

Review the conversation for insights that are **non-obvious, actionable, and verified**.
Skip anything a competent developer would figure out in context.

### 2. Scope and filter each candidate

Every candidate lesson has a **scope**:

| Scope | Bar | Destination | Example |
|-------|-----|-------------|---------|
| **Global** | Applies across most projects/sessions | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` or skill files | "R CMD check: use `--no-tests --no-vignettes` for fast iteration on compilation issues" |
| **Project** | Specific to this repo's setup/conventions | project MEMORY.md or topic file | "Air formatter pre-commit hook: re-stage then new commit" |

**Global lessons** have a higher bar: they must be useful regardless of which project
you're working on. Package-specific migration steps, repo-specific remote configs,
or one-time setup details are NOT global — they're project-specific at best, and
often not worth saving at all.

**Drop aggressively.** Filter out:
- One-time configuration steps unlikely to recur (e.g., "added flag X to Makevars")
- Project-specific facts with no transferable insight (e.g., "origin = user/repo")
- Details that are easily re-discoverable from docs or `--help`
- Anything that duplicates existing memory or skill content

### 3. Check for duplicates

Before writing anything:
- Read the current MEMORY.md and `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`
- Read any relevant topic files linked from MEMORY.md
- Read the SKILL.md of any skill you plan to update
- Skip lessons already captured (even if worded differently)

### 4. Present lessons to user for approval

Show candidates **grouped by scope**, with clear destinations:

```
Global (applies across projects):
  1. [lesson] → ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md

Project-specific:
  2. [lesson] → MEMORY.md

Nothing else worth persisting from this session.
```

Ask which to persist. Default: all shown (but the list should already be selective).
If no lessons pass the bar, say so — an empty result is fine.

### 5. Persist

**Global** (`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `~/.claude/skills/`):
- Read the target file first.
- Add concisely in the most natural location.
- Skills are loaded into context on every trigger — keep additions minimal.
- For skills with reference files, prefer adding there over bloating SKILL.md.
- **Always use `/skill-creator` to edit skill files.** Never edit SKILL.md directly
  without invoking the skill-creator skill first.

**Project memory** (`~/.claude/projects/<project>/memory/`):
- MEMORY.md: Keep concise (<200 lines). One-liners. Link to topic files for detail.
- Topic files (e.g., `sim-patterns.md`): Longer explanations with code examples.
- If MEMORY.md is approaching 200 lines, consolidate or move detail to topic files.

### 6. Confirm

Summarize what was written and where:

```
Persisted 2 lessons:
- ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md: 1 item (R CMD check fast iteration)
- MEMORY.md: 1 item (Air formatter hook behavior)
```

## Quality Bar

See `references/quality-guide.md` for examples of good vs bad lessons.

Key principles:
- **Actionable over observational**: "Use `on.exit()` to save/restore RNG" not "RNG can be tricky"
- **Specific over vague**: Include the code pattern, the file path, the exact error message
- **Non-obvious over common knowledge**: Skip things any competent developer would know
- **Verified over speculative**: Only persist what was confirmed in this session
- **Concise over thorough**: A 2-line lesson that's always read beats a 20-line essay that's skipped
