# Launch Planning Frameworks

Frameworks for planning and executing successful product launches including launch strategy, cross-functional coordination, and launch measurement.

## Why Launch Planning Matters

A great product poorly launched underperforms. A good product well-launched succeeds. Launch planning ensures:

- Products reach target customers
- Messaging resonates clearly
- Teams execute in coordination
- Success is measurable
- Issues are caught early

## When to Use This Skill

**Auto-loaded by agents**:

- `launch-planner` - For launch tiers, timelines, checklists, and go/no-go decisions

**Use when you need**:

- Launching new products/features
- Major releases or rebrands
- Market entry or expansion
- Coordinating cross-functional teams
- Post-launch analysis
- Creating launch timelines
- Defining launch tiers (soft, hard, tiered)
- Building launch checklists

---

## Launch Tier Framework

Not all launches are equal. Determine your launch tier first - it drives everything else.

### Three Tiers

**Tier 1: Major Launch** (Company-wide priority)

- New product line, platform launch, major strategic initiative
- 8-12 weeks planning, full cross-functional team
- High investment: PR, events, full marketing campaign

**Tier 2: Standard Launch** (Team priority)

- Significant feature, market expansion, competitive parity
- 4-6 weeks planning, core team (PM, Marketing, Sales)
- Medium investment: Email campaigns, blog, in-app

**Tier 3: Minor Launch** (Low-key release)

- Feature improvements, enhancements, quality updates
- 1-2 weeks planning, PM + minimal support
- Low investment: Release notes, in-app notification

### Decision Framework

Determine tier by scoring 6 factors (1-3 points each):

1. Customer reach (all/segment/small)
2. Customer importance (critical/important/nice)
3. Revenue opportunity (high/medium/low)
4. Strategic importance (critical/supportive/incremental)
5. Competitive impact (differentiation/parity/minor)
6. Complexity (high/medium/low)

**Total Score**: 15-18 = T1 | 10-14 = T2 | 6-9 = T3

**Full framework**: See `assets/launch-tier-decision-template.md` for scorecard, decision matrix, and examples.

---

### Launch Checklist

Comprehensive readiness checklist across all functions:

- Product readiness (features, QA, performance, security)
- Marketing readiness (website, content, campaign)
- Sales readiness (enablement, pipeline, demos)
- Customer Success readiness (comms, onboarding)
- Support readiness (training, runbooks, FAQs)
- Technical readiness (deployment, monitoring, rollback)

**Template**: `assets/launch-checklist-template.md`

100+ checklist items with critical items (⚠️ = go/no-go blockers) identified

**Use at T-2 weeks**: Begin checking items, hold readiness review, make go/no-go decision

---

### Go/No-Go Decision Framework

Final readiness decision at T-1 week from launch.

**Decision Criteria**:

- Must-Have (hard blockers): Product stable, teams ready, critical deliverables complete
- Nice-to-Have (soft preferences): Polish items, optional features
- Risk Assessment: Likelihood × Impact with mitigation plans
- Readiness Scores: Each function rates 1-5
- Confidence Poll: Team votes on launch confidence

**Decision**: GO (with conditions) or NO-GO (with new date and action plan)

**Template**: `assets/go-no-go-template.md`

Includes: Meeting agenda, decision matrix, sign-off template

---

## Launch Messaging Framework

Clear positioning and messaging are critical for launch success.

### Positioning Statement

**Format** (Geoffrey Moore):

```
For [target customer]
Who [customer need]
[Product] is a [category]
That [key benefit]
Unlike [competitors]
We [differentiation]
```

### Message Hierarchy

**Level 1: Headline** (8-12 words)

- Grab attention, communicate core value instantly
- Example: "Ship features 2x faster with continuous deployment"

**Level 2: Subhead** (20-30 words)

- Expand on headline, clarify specific value

**Level 3: Key Messages** (3-5 bullets)

- Core value propositions, each standing alone
- Use numbers, focus on outcomes

**Level 4: Proof Points**

- Stats, customer quotes, case studies
- Back up key messages with evidence

**Full framework**: `assets/launch-messaging-template.md`

Includes: Examples, audience-specific messaging, testing framework

---

## Cross-Functional Coordination

Successful launches require tight coordination across teams.

### Launch Roles

**Product (PM)**: Launch owner, strategy, coordination, go/no-go decisions

**Marketing**: Campaign strategy, content, PR, demand generation

**Sales**: Enablement, outreach, pipeline, competitive positioning

**Customer Success**: Customer comms, onboarding, adoption, feedback

**Engineering**: Development, deployment, monitoring, stability

**Support**: Training, runbooks, triage, escalation

**Design**: Marketing assets, landing page, demo video

### Coordination Patterns

**Weekly Launch Sync** (6-8 weeks before launch):

- Status updates per function
- Go/no-go checkpoints
- Key decisions
- Timeline review

**Launch Readiness Review** (T-1 week):

- Final go/no-go decision
- 60-minute meeting with full team

**Launch Day War Room**:

- Real-time monitoring and triage
- Dedicated Slack + Zoom
- All day with core team

**Comprehensive guide**: `references/launch-coordination-guide.md`

Includes: Full role descriptions, RACI matrix, meeting templates, escalation framework, solo operator adaptations

## Launch Metrics

### Leading Indicators (Week 1)

Early signals that predict success:

**Awareness**: Website visits, blog views, social impressions, email open rates

**Early Adoption**: Signups, activation rate, time to first use, D1 retention

**Technical Health**: Uptime, error rate, performance, support tickets

**Purpose**: Quick feedback, course correction

---

### Lagging Indicators (Months 1-3)

Longer-term measures of success:

**Adoption**: % of target segment using, DAU/MAU, retention (D7, D30), usage frequency

**Business Impact**: Revenue, conversion lift, expansion revenue, churn reduction, LTV impact

**Product Quality**: Bug rate, support volume, NPS, CSAT, app ratings

**Purpose**: Validate product-market fit, business impact

---

### Metrics by Launch Tier

**Tier 1**: All metrics, high targets, daily monitoring Week 1
**Tier 2**: Focus on adoption and business impact, weekly monitoring
**Tier 3**: Basic adoption and technical health, monthly check-ins

**Comprehensive guide**: `references/launch-metrics-guide.md`

Includes: Complete metrics catalog, success criteria examples, dashboard templates, measurement setup, red flags for pivoting

---

## Launch Best Practices

**DO**:

- Start planning early (8-12 weeks for Tier 1)
- Align on launch tier first
- Coordinate cross-functionally (not PM alone)
- Test messaging with customers
- Set clear success metrics
- Communicate internally before externally
- Have rollback plan ready
- Monitor closely post-launch
- Iterate based on feedback

**DON'T**:

- Launch without clear positioning
- Surprise internal teams
- Over-promise in messaging
- Forget support training
- Launch and disappear (no follow-through)
- Skip post-launch review
- Launch on Friday (no support over weekend)
- Make everything Tier 1 (save energy for what matters)

---

## For Solo Operators / Small Teams

If you don't have separate marketing, sales, CS teams:

**Simplify the framework**:

- You own all functions (PM + Marketing + Sales + CS)
- Focus on: positioning, website, email, blog, basic support
- Skip: elaborate sales training, press release (unless Tier 1), complex campaigns
- Use templates aggressively
- 4-6 weeks is plenty for Tier 1 solo launch

**Timeline**:

- Week 6-4: Strategy, positioning, messaging
- Week 4-2: Create content (website, blog, email)
- Week 2-1: Final prep, customer comms
- Week 0: Launch
- Week 1+: Monitor, iterate

**Key**: Do less, but do it well. Better to nail positioning + blog + email than to spread thin across 10 channels.

## Quick Start

**For your first launch**:

1. Determine launch tier using `assets/launch-tier-decision-template.md`
2. Choose timeline based on tier (12 weeks T1, 6 weeks T2, 2 weeks T3)
3. Create positioning using `assets/launch-messaging-template.md`
4. Use `assets/12-week-launch-plan-template.md` to plan activities
5. Track readiness with `assets/launch-checklist-template.md`
6. Make go/no-go decision using `assets/go-no-go-template.md`
7. Execute launch, monitor metrics
8. Post-launch: Review results, document learnings

**For repeat launches**:

- Update your launch playbook based on learnings
- Refine messaging based on what resonated
- Adjust timeline based on what took longer than expected
- Build on what worked, fix what didn't

---

**Key Principle**: Launch planning is about coordination and preparedness, not perfection. A well-coordinated launch of a good product beats a chaotic launch of a great product. Plan thoroughly, execute decisively, measure rigorously, iterate continuously.
