# E2E with Playwright (extension)

Aligned with [WXT’s Playwright E2E example](https://github.com/wxt-dev/examples/tree/main/examples/playwright-e2e-testing): Chromium only, extension loaded from `dist/chrome-mv3`.

## Layout

- Tests in [e2e/tests/](e2e/tests/) — main suite [e2e/tests/extension.spec.ts](e2e/tests/extension.spec.ts) with describe blocks: **Popup**, **Content injection**, **Per-domain activation**; [e2e/tests/toolbar-settings.spec.ts](e2e/tests/toolbar-settings.spec.ts) covers toolbar settings menu (Feature Voting upvotes multi-on + isolation, behaviour toggles)
- Shared fixture in [e2e/fixtures.ts](e2e/fixtures.ts)
- Page helpers in [e2e/pages/](e2e/pages/) (e.g. [e2e/pages/popup.ts](e2e/pages/popup.ts))
- Fixture page served via Playwright `webServer` + custom static server:
  - `e2e/serve-fixtures.mjs`
  - `playwright.config.ts` points `webServer.url` at `http://localhost:51234/inspector-playground.html`
  - `use.baseURL` is `http://localhost:51234`
  - Tests navigate with relative paths like `/inspector-playground.html`

## Fixture

The fixture extends Playwright with:

- **context:** Chromium persistent context that loads the unpacked extension from `dist/chrome-mv3`
- **extensionId:** Resolved from the service worker (MV3) or background page otherwise

Use `context` and `extensionId` in tests. Import the extended `test` and `expect` from the fixture.

## Popup

Navigate to `chrome-extension://${extensionId}/popup.html`. Use helpers like `openPopup(page, extensionId)` from [e2e/pages/popup.ts](e2e/pages/popup.ts) for consistent setup. Tests: "popup opens and shows active toggle" (Popup), "inspector root and app load on supported page" (Content injection), "when domain is enabled in storage, inspector is active on page load" (Per-domain activation).

## Run

- CI: [.github/workflows/playwright.yml](../../../.github/workflows/playwright.yml) uses `jdx/mise-action` then `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`.

- First-time: `pnpm exec playwright install chromium` (installs Chromium and headless shell; do not use `--no-shell` or default tests will fail).
- Build the extension: `pnpm build` so `dist/chrome-mv3` exists.
- Run tests: `pnpm test:e2e`

## Note

`playwright-webextext` is in devDependencies for potential future use; current tests use the custom extension fixture in `fixtures.ts`.

When a test needs deterministic inspector target setup (distances/side panel), prefer triggering the inspector via a synthetic `mouseover` on a known element (see `toolbar-distances.spec.ts`) rather than relying on hit-testing/hover in the presence of the overlay.
