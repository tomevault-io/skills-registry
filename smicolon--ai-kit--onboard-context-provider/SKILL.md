# Onboard Context Provider

Provides personalized explanations and assistance based on the engineer's background from their onboarding profile.

## Activation Triggers

This skill activates when:
- Engineer asks "how do I..." or "where do I put..." questions
- Engineer asks about project conventions or patterns
- Code written doesn't match project conventions (imports, naming, structure)
- Engineer seems confused about a technology in their knowledge gaps list

## Profile Location

```
.claude/onboard-profile.local.md
```

If this file doesn't exist, this skill does nothing. The engineer needs to run `/onboard` first.

## Behavior

### 1. Read Engineer Profile

Check `.claude/onboard-profile.local.md` for:
- **Primary Stack**: What they know well
- **New To**: What's unfamiliar
- **Knowledge Gaps**: Specific gaps with priority levels
- **Current Task**: What they're working on

### 2. Personalize Response

Based on the profile, adjust explanations:

**If the concept is in their knowledge gaps (NEW):**
- Explain using analogies to their primary stack
- Show a side-by-side comparison with what they know
- Point to an example file in the codebase

**If the concept is related to something they know (TRANSFERABLE):**
- Briefly note the difference, skip the basics
- Focus on what's different, not what's the same

**If they already know it (FAMILIAR):**
- Don't explain the concept at all
- Just show the project-specific convention

### 3. Always Include

- Specific file paths from this project as examples
- The project convention (from CLAUDE.md) for whatever they're doing
- A concrete next action they can take

## Personalization Strategies

### Backend Engineer → Frontend Project

| Concept | Explain As |
|---------|-----------|
| Components | "Like views that return HTML directly" |
| State (useState) | "Like a variable that re-renders the page when changed" |
| Props | "Like function arguments for components" |
| useEffect | "Like Django signals — side effects triggered by changes" |
| Client vs Server Components | "Server = Django view, Client = JavaScript in template" |

### Frontend Engineer → Backend Project

| Concept | Explain As |
|---------|-----------|
| ORM Models | "Like TypeScript interfaces that map to database tables" |
| Migrations | "Like schema changes — versioned database updates" |
| Serializers | "Like Zod schemas for API input/output validation" |
| Views/Controllers | "Like API route handlers" |
| Middleware | "Same concept — runs before your handler" |

### Senior → New Framework

- Skip conceptual explanations entirely
- Focus on: syntax, file locations, project conventions
- Example: "API routes at `app/api/*/route.ts`, export GET/POST/etc."

### Junior → Any Framework

- Include "why" not just "how"
- Provide more context about patterns
- Suggest reading material when appropriate

## What NOT to Do

- Don't activate if no profile exists (engineer hasn't onboarded)
- Don't over-explain things the engineer already knows
- Don't provide generic advice — always reference this specific project
- Don't interrupt the engineer's flow with unsolicited lectures
