# Git Worktree Manager Skill

Manages git worktrees for parallel development with automatic environment isolation.

## Activation Triggers

This skill activates when the user:
- Asks about "worktree" or "git worktree"
- Mentions "wt" in context of git/branches
- Wants to "work on multiple branches simultaneously"
- Needs a "separate workspace for a feature"
- Asks about "parallel development" setup
- Wants to "set up a new branch workspace"
- Has "docker port conflicts" between branches
- Needs "database isolation" for parallel work
- Asks about ".worktreeinclude" or "env isolation"

## Commands Reference

| Command | Alias | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| `/wt create <branch>` | `/wt c` | Create worktree with full isolation |
| `/wt list` | `/wt ls` | Show all worktrees |
| `/wt remove <branch>` | `/wt rm` | Remove worktree (stops Docker first) |
| `/wt open <branch> [--editor]` | `/wt o` | Open (--cursor\|-c, --agy\|-a, --code\|-v) |

## Naming Convention

Worktrees are created as siblings with `--` separator:

```
~/[PARENT_DIRECTORY]/[REPO_NAME]/              # main repo
~/[PARENT_DIRECTORY]/[REPO_NAME]--[BRANCH_NAME]/   # worktree for [BRANCH_NAME]
```

## Three-Layer Isolation

### Layer 1: `.worktreeinclude` — File Selection

Gitignore-style file at repo root controlling which untracked files to copy. Auto-generated with sensible defaults on first `wt create`.

```ini
.env*
# apps/*/.env*

[rewrite]
auto

[docker]
auto
```

### Layer 2: `[rewrite]` — Env Var Isolation

- **`auto`**: Suffixes DB_NAME, POSTGRES_DB, DATABASE_URL, COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME with branch slug
- **`{{BRANCH}}`**: Template placeholder for custom vars

### Layer 3: `[docker]` — Docker Compose Env Var Isolation

- Patches compose file with `${WT_PORT_*:-default}` and `${WT_CONTAINER_PREFIX:-default}` syntax
- Writes port/container env vars + `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` to `.env`
- Auto-creates databases in running Postgres

## Auto-Setup Features

When creating a worktree, the following happens automatically:

1. **Branch handling**: Creates new branch or checks out existing (local/remote)
2. **File copying**: Copies files matching `.worktreeinclude` patterns
3. **Env rewriting**: Suffixes database names and URLs with branch slug
4. **Docker isolation**: Patches compose with env var interpolation, writes `.env`
5. **Database creation**: Creates database in running Postgres (idempotent)
6. **Package manager**: Detects bun/pnpm/yarn/npm from lockfiles
7. **Dependencies**: Runs install at root (monorepo-aware)

## Behavioral Expectations

When user asks about worktrees or parallel development:

1. Suggest using `/wt create <branch>` for new worktrees
2. Explain the three-layer isolation if they have Docker/database conflicts
3. Mention `.worktreeinclude` for customizing which files are copied
4. Show the `cd` command output for easy navigation
5. Explain that `wt remove` stops Docker containers but preserves databases

## Example Interactions

**User**: "I need to work on the auth feature while keeping my current work"

**Response**: Use `/wt create feature/auth` to create a parallel workspace. This will:
- Create `project--feature-auth/` as sibling directory
- Copy your `.env` files and rewrite DB names with `_feature_auth` suffix
- Generate Docker port offsets so both worktrees can run simultaneously
- Install dependencies

**User**: "My worktrees are conflicting on port 5432"

**Response**: The `.worktreeinclude` file's `[docker]` section handles this. With `auto` enabled, `wt create` patches your compose file with `${WT_PORT_*:-default}` env var interpolation and writes offset values to `.env`. Each worktree gets a deterministic offset based on the branch name. The compose file defaults still work on main.

**User**: "How do I customize which files are copied to worktrees?"

**Response**: Edit `.worktreeinclude` in your repo root. It uses gitignore-style patterns:
```
.env*
config/local.yml
apps/*/.env*
```
