# Vision

Create or update the product vision document at `docs/strategy/vision.md`.

## Instructions

1. Check if `docs/strategy/vision.md` already exists
2. If it exists, read it and ask the user what they want to update
3. If it doesn't exist, gather information through conversation:
   - **Target Customer**: Who are we building for? Be specific about segments or personas.
   - **Customer Problem**: What job, pain, or need do they have today?
   - **Value Proposition**: What unique value do we deliver?
   - **Key Benefits**: What outcomes do customers get?
   - **Product Principles**: What guiding beliefs shape our decisions?
   - **Success Looks Like**: What changes for the customer when we succeed?

4. Create or update the vision document with the gathered information

## Output Format

Write to `docs/strategy/vision.md` using this structure:

```markdown
# Product Vision

## Target Customer
[Who we're building for]

## Customer Problem
[The pain or need we're addressing]

## Value Proposition
[The unique value we deliver]

## Key Benefits
[Outcomes customers get]

## Product Principles
[Guiding beliefs that shape decisions]

## Success Looks Like

```

## Notes

- Keep sections concise but meaningful
- Use the user's language, not generic business speak
- This document is context for Claude and developers during development
