# Python Performance Patterns

## Experiment Overview
| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Date** | 2025-12-12 |
| **Goal** | Implement safe, high-impact performance optimizations from audit |
| **Environment** | Python 3.10+, NumPy, scikit-image |
| **Status** | Success - 5 patterns verified |

## Context
After a performance audit identified 40+ issues, we needed to prioritize which fixes were safe to implement without extensive testing. These patterns are low-risk, high-reward optimizations.

## Pattern 1: @lru_cache for File Metadata

**Problem**: Functions that check file types open files repeatedly.

**Before** (3-5 file opens per call):
```python
def get_img_type(img_f):
    is_ome = check_is_ome(img_f)      # Opens file
    can_use_vips = check_to_use_vips(img_f)  # Opens file
    can_use_openslide = check_to_use_openslide(img_f)  # Opens file
```

**After** (cached after first call):
```python
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=256)
def check_is_ome(src_f):
    # ... implementation

@lru_cache(maxsize=256)
def check_to_use_vips(src_f):
    # ... implementation

@lru_cache(maxsize=256)
def get_img_type(img_f):
    # ... implementation
```

**Speedup**: 3-5x for batch file operations

**Safe because**: File metadata doesn't change during a session

## Pattern 2: Vectorized Overlap Matrix

**Problem**: O(n²) nested loop for pixel-by-pixel counting.

**Before**:
```python
overlap = np.zeros((max_label1 + 1, max_label2 + 1), dtype=np.int32)
for i in range(labels1.shape[0]):
    for j in range(labels1.shape[1]):
        l1 = labels1[i, j]
        l2 = labels2[i, j]
        overlap[l1, l2] += 1
```

**After**:
```python
overlap = np.zeros((max_label1 + 1, max_label2 + 1), dtype=np.int64)
np.add.at(overlap, (labels1.ravel(), labels2.ravel()), 1)
```

**Speedup**: 5-10x for large label arrays

**Safe because**: Mathematically equivalent, uses NumPy built-in

---

## Pattern 3: argpartition for Top-K

**Problem**: Full sort when only need k smallest/largest values.

**Before** (O(n log n)):
```python
neighbor_indices = np.argsort(distances[i])[1:n_neighbors+1]
```

**After** (O(n)):
```python
neighbor_indices = np.argpartition(distances[i], n_neighbors+1)[1:n_neighbors+1]
```

**Speedup**: 3-5x for large arrays

**Safe because**: Returns same indices, just not sorted (usually fine for k-NN)

**Caveat**: If you need the k values in sorted order, add a second sort on just k elements.

---

## Pattern 4: Parallel Image Loading

**Problem**: Sequential I/O when loading many images.

**Before**:
```python
img_list = [io.imread(os.path.join(src_dir, f)) for f in img_f_list]
```

**After**:
```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

img_paths = [os.path.join(src_dir, f) for f in img_f_list]
with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=min(8, len(img_paths))) as executor:
    img_list = list(executor.map(io.imread, img_paths))
```

**Speedup**: 10-20x for 50+ images

**Safe because**: Image reads are independent, thread-safe

---

## Pattern 5: Single Directory Scan

**Problem**: Multiple glob calls scan directory repeatedly.

**Before** (5 filesystem scans):
```python
patterns = ["*.tif", "*.tiff", "*.zarr", "*.ome.tif", "*.ome.tiff"]
for pattern in patterns:
    for f in cycle_dir.glob(pattern):
        process(f)
```

**After** (1 filesystem scan):
```python
valid_extensions = {".tif", ".tiff", ".zarr"}
valid_suffixes = {".ome.tif", ".ome.tiff"}
for f in cycle_dir.iterdir():
    suffix_lower = f.suffix.lower()
    name_lower = f.name.lower()
    if suffix_lower in valid_extensions or any(name_lower.endswith(s) for s in valid_suffixes):
        process(f)
```

**Speedup**: 2-3x for directories with many files

**Safe because**: Same files matched, just more efficiently

## Failed Attempts (Critical)

| Attempt | Why it Failed | Lesson Learned |
|---------|---------------|----------------|
| Caching image processing results | Wrong results for different inputs | Only cache metadata, not computed results |
| Caching BaSiC illumination profiles | 15-20% intensity errors for sparse markers | Each channel needs its own profile (see basic-caching-evaluation skill) |
| Parallelizing CPU-bound NumPy | GIL contention, no speedup | ThreadPoolExecutor only for I/O-bound tasks |
| Removing "unnecessary" array copies | Broke downstream code expecting copies | Test thoroughly before removing .copy() |

## Priority Matrix

| Priority | Pattern | Risk | Speedup |
|----------|---------|------|---------|
| P0 | Parallel image loading | Low | 10-20x |
| P1 | @lru_cache metadata | Low | 3-5x |
| P1 | Vectorized overlap | Low | 5-10x |
| P2 | argpartition | Low | 3-5x |
| P2 | Single directory scan | Low | 2-3x |
| P3 | Remove dask copies | Medium | 2x memory |

## When NOT to Apply These Patterns

1. **@lru_cache**: Don't cache if function has side effects or file might change
2. **argpartition**: Don't use if you need results in sorted order
3. **ThreadPoolExecutor**: Don't use for CPU-bound operations (use ProcessPoolExecutor)
4. **Removing copies**: Don't remove if downstream code modifies the array

## Key Insights

- Start with I/O optimizations - biggest wins with lowest risk
- Vectorization beats loops in NumPy, always
- Profile before optimizing - intuition is often wrong
- Test numerical accuracy after optimization, not just correctness
