# SnapLogic Export Data to CSV Skill

## Agentic Workflow (Claude: Follow these steps in order)

### Step 1: Load the Complete Guide
```
ACTION: Use the Read tool to load:
{{cookiecutter.primary_pipeline_name}}/.claude/skills/export-data-to-csv/SKILL.md
```
**Do not proceed until you have read the complete guide.**

### Step 2: Understand the User's Request
Parse what the user wants:
- Which database type? (Oracle, Snowflake, PostgreSQL, etc.)
- Which table to export?
- What column to order by?
- Where to save the CSV output file?
- Is this standalone or part of a larger test suite?

### Step 3: Follow the Guide — Create ALL Required Files (MANDATORY)
When creating export data test cases, you **MUST call the Write tool** to create ALL required files. Never skip any file. Never say "file already exists". Always write them fresh:
1. **Robot test file** (`.robot`) in `test/suite/pipeline_tests/[type]/` — WRITE this
2. **EXPORT_DATA_README.md** with file structure tree diagram in the same test directory — WRITE this

Use the detailed instructions from the file you loaded in Step 1 for templates and conventions.

### Step 4: Respond to User
Provide the created files or requested information based on the complete guide.
