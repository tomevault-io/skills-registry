# Snowflake MCP Server Setup

This skill guides you through connecting Cursor to a [Snowflake-managed MCP server](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/cortex-agents-mcp), enabling AI agents to securely interact with Snowflake data and services — including Cortex Search, Cortex Analyst, SQL execution, Cortex Agents, and custom tools (UDFs/stored procedures) — directly from the IDE.

## Setup

### 1. Create a Programmatic Access Token (PAT)

Authentication uses a [Programmatic Access Token](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/programmatic-access-tokens). Generate one in Snowsight under **Settings → Authentication → Programmatic Access Tokens**. Use the least-privileged role that has USAGE on your MCP server and its tools.

Or with SQL:

```sql
ALTER USER <YOUR_USERNAME> ADD PROGRAMMATIC ACCESS TOKEN <PAT_NAME>;
```

See the [SQL reference](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/alter-user-add-programmatic-access-token) for full details.

### 2. Get Your MCP Server URL

The URL follows this format:

```
https://<account_url>/api/v2/databases/<database>/schemas/<schema>/mcp-servers/<server_name>
```

Your [account URL](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/admin-account-identifier) is typically `<orgname>-<account_name>.snowflakecomputing.com`. Use hyphens (`-`) instead of underscores (`_`) in hostnames. Follow [Snowflake docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/cortex-agents-mcp) to create an MCP server.

### 3. Configure mcp.json

The `mcp.json` is already configured to read from environment variables:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Snowflake": {
      "url": "${SNOWFLAKE_MCP_SERVER_URL}",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer ${SNOWFLAKE_PAT_TOKEN}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Before using the MCP server, make sure the following environment variables are set in your shell:

- **`SNOWFLAKE_MCP_SERVER_URL`** — Your full MCP server URL (see step 2).
- **`SNOWFLAKE_PAT_TOKEN`** — The Programmatic Access Token generated in step 1.

For example, add them to your shell profile (e.g. `~/.zshrc`):

```sh
export SNOWFLAKE_MCP_SERVER_URL="https://<orgname>-<account_name>.snowflakecomputing.com/api/v2/databases/<database>/schemas/<schema>/mcp-servers/<server_name>"
export SNOWFLAKE_PAT_TOKEN="your-pat-token-here"
```

Then restart Cursor (or reload the window) so it picks up the new environment variables.
