# Deployment Skill — Astro v6 + Cloudflare Workers

This skill covers the full deploy pipeline for Astro v6 + Cloudflare Workers projects. Use it when:
- Setting up a new project for deployment
- Connecting GitHub repo via Workers Builds (push-to-deploy)
- Deploying to preview or production
- Debugging 500 errors, build failures, or wrangler issues after deploy
- Updating dependencies and checking compatibility
- A deploy that previously worked starts failing

## Key Facts

- Astro v6 + `@astrojs/cloudflare` v13 targets **Workers only** (Pages support was removed from the adapter)
- `astro dev` runs on the real `workerd` runtime — if it works locally, it works in production
- Static assets served by Workers are **free and unlimited** — only SSR requests count against quota
- Astro v6 includes **Zod 4 built-in** (`import { z } from 'astro/zod'`) — no separate Zod dependency needed
- Astro Sessions auto-configure with **Workers KV** for multi-step form state persistence
- Use **Astro Actions** for type-safe form handling with built-in validation
- The `fix-wrangler.mjs` hack from Pages deployments is **no longer needed** — delete it

---

## ⚠ Critical Checks (run before every deploy)

### 1. No `context.locals.runtime.env`

Removed in Astro v6. Use `import { env } from "cloudflare:workers"` instead.

```bash
grep -r "locals.runtime" src/
# ANY results → fix before deploy
```

### 2. No `process.env` in server code

Cloudflare Workers has no `process` global. Use `cloudflare:workers` env. Client-side `import.meta.env.PUBLIC_*` is fine.

```bash
grep -r "process\.env" src/pages/api/ src/lib/ src/middleware*
# ANY results in server code → fix
```

### 3. Worker name must match dashboard

The `name` in wrangler config must exactly match the Worker name in Cloudflare Dashboard. Mismatch → deploy fails or creates a new Worker.

### 4. Vite version override

Astro v6 uses Vite 7. Packages like `@tailwindcss/vite` can hoist Vite 8, causing `require_dist is not a function` in workerd. Add to package.json: `"overrides": { "vite": "^7" }`

```bash
npm ls vite | head -20
# vite@8.x anywhere → add override
```

### 5. Node.js 22+

Astro v6 dropped Node 18/20. Set `NODE_VERSION=22` in Workers Builds settings.

### 6. `nodejs_compat` flag

Required in wrangler config for Resend/Brevo fetch calls and any Node.js API usage in server code. Without it, server endpoints that use Node APIs will 500.

### 7. Build output

After `npm run build`, verify `dist/_worker.js/` (server) and `dist/client/` (static) exist.

---

## Deploy Flow — Workers Builds (primary)

Workers Builds is the recommended CI/CD. It provides GitHub push-to-deploy with automatic preview URLs — the same experience Pages had, but native to Workers.

### First-time setup

1. Cloudflare Dashboard → Workers & Pages → Create → Import from GitHub
2. Select repository and branch (`main` for production)
3. Build settings: command `npm run build`, deploy command `npx wrangler deploy`
4. Set `NODE_VERSION=22` in environment variables

### Day-to-day workflow

```
feature branch → push → Workers Builds → preview URL on PR comment
                                        → share with client for review
main branch    → push → Workers Builds → production deploy
```

Every pull request gets an automatic preview deployment with a unique URL. Build status shows as a GitHub check run. No need for a separate `staging` branch.

### Monorepo support

If multiple client sites live in one repo, configure watch paths in Workers Builds settings so only the relevant site rebuilds on push.

### CLI fallback (when Workers Builds isn't set up)

```bash
npx wrangler deploy --dry-run     # test without deploying
npx wrangler deploy               # deploy
npx wrangler tail                 # live logs
npx wrangler rollback             # undo last deploy
```

## Blocking Conditions (STOP — fix before deploy)

**Tier 1 — deploy blocker (won't build/deploy):**

| Condition | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Build fails | `npm run build` |
| Worker name mismatch | wrangler config `name` ≠ CF dashboard |
| Vite 8 hoisted | `npm ls vite` — must be ^7 |
| Node < 22 | `node -v` |
| TypeScript errors | `npx astro check` |
| Missing build output | `ls dist/_worker.js/ dist/client/` |
| Secret leak detected | Run secret leak detection checks below |
| Missing `nodejs_compat` flag | Check wrangler config `compatibility_flags` |

**Tier 2 — runtime crash (deploys but 500s):**

| Condition | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| `locals.runtime` in code | `grep -r "locals.runtime" src/` |
| `process.env` in server code | `grep -r "process\.env" src/pages/api/ src/lib/` |
| Missing env vars / secrets | Dashboard check, prod ≠ preview keys |
| Dependency compat unchecked | See living sources below |

**Tier 3 — quality (works but not ready):**

| Condition | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Lighthouse < 90 | All categories |
| Forms broken | Test submission |
| Preview indexable | noindex meta when `MODE !== 'production'` |
| No client approval | Written confirmation required |

Fix in order: Tier 1 → 2 → 3. Don't move to the next tier until the current one is clear.

## 500 Error Debug (post-deploy)

`astro dev` runs on the real `workerd` runtime in Astro v6. If the site works locally, the 500 is almost certainly an env var / secret issue, not a code issue. Start with `npx wrangler tail`.

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| 500 on all SSR pages | `locals.runtime` or `process.env` usage | grep + fix, redeploy |
| 500 on specific API route | Missing env var / secret for that route | Check dashboard bindings |
| 500 only on production (preview OK) | Env var difference between environments | Compare prod vs preview vars |
| Build succeeds, instant 500 | Worker entry point broken / wrangler config wrong | Check `dist/_worker.js/`, verify `main` field |
| Works locally, 500 on CF | Missing `nodejs_compat` flag or env var | Check wrangler config + dashboard |

---

## Secrets Rules

**Local:** `.dev.vars` only. **Production:** Dashboard or `wrangler secret put`. **wrangler.jsonc:** only secret names in `secrets.required`, never values.

### Secret leak detection (run before every deploy)

```bash
# .dev.vars must be in .gitignore
grep -q "\.dev\.vars" .gitignore || echo "FAIL: .dev.vars not in .gitignore"

# No secret values in wrangler config
grep -iE "(sk_|re_|key|secret|password|token).*[:=].*['\"][a-zA-Z0-9]" wrangler.* 2>/dev/null && echo "FAIL: possible secret value in wrangler config"

# No API keys hardcoded in source
grep -rnE "(sk_live|re_|supabase.*eyJ|RESEND_API_KEY\s*=\s*['\"]re_)" src/ && echo "FAIL: hardcoded API key in src/"

# No secret logged in server code
grep -rnE "console\.(log|info|warn|error).*\b(key|secret|token|password|api_key)\b" src/pages/api/ src/lib/ src/middleware* 2>/dev/null && echo "FAIL: possible secret in console.log"

# No secret rendered to client (Astro frontmatter leak)
grep -rnE "import\.meta\.env\.(?!PUBLIC_)" src/pages/ src/components/ 2>/dev/null | grep -v "frontmatter\|---" | grep -v "\.ts$\|\.js$" && echo "FAIL: non-PUBLIC_ env var may be exposed to client HTML"

# .dev.vars not tracked by git
git ls-files --error-unmatch .dev.vars 2>/dev/null && echo "FAIL: .dev.vars is tracked by git"
```

If any `FAIL` → **deployment BLOCKED**. Fix the leak before pushing.

## Astro v6 Server Patterns

### Env vars in server code

```ts
// ✅ Correct
import { env } from "cloudflare:workers";
const key = env.RESEND_API_KEY;

// ❌ Wrong — both throw
const key = process.env.RESEND_API_KEY;
const { env } = context.locals.runtime;
```

### Astro Actions (form handling)

Use Astro Actions for type-safe server endpoints with built-in Zod validation:

```ts
// src/actions/index.ts
import { defineAction } from 'astro:actions';
import { z } from 'astro/zod';  // built-in, no install needed

export const server = {
  submitLead: defineAction({
    input: z.object({
      name: z.string().min(1),
      email: z.string().email(),
      phone: z.string().optional(),
    }),
    handler: async (input) => {
      // Resend email, Google Sheets, etc.
      return { success: true };
    },
  }),
};
```

### SSR endpoints (selective)

Keep pages static by default. Only opt into SSR where needed:

```ts
// src/pages/api/calculate.ts
export const prerender = false;  // this endpoint runs on Workers

export async function POST({ request }) {
  // calculator logic
}
```

### Sessions (multi-step form state)

Astro Sessions auto-configure with Workers KV:

```ts
// In any server endpoint
const session = await Astro.session;
session.set('step1Data', formData);
// Persists across requests via Workers KV
```

## Dependency Compatibility Check (before first deploy)

**Do NOT hardcode version pins.** Check living sources, pin only if needed (with comment + issue link). Re-check every 2 months.

### Living sources

**Astro + Cloudflare adapter:**
- Adapter changelog: https://github.com/withastro/astro/blob/main/packages/integrations/cloudflare/CHANGELOG.md
- Adapter docs: https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/cloudflare/

**Cloudflare runtime:**
- Workers changelog: https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/changelog/
- Compatibility flags: https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/compatibility-flags/
- Wrangler releases: https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/releases

**Vite:** https://github.com/vitejs/vite/releases — check if Astro still pins Vite 7.

**Resend (email):**
- Open issues: https://github.com/resend/resend-node/issues?q=is%3Aissue+cloudflare
- Prefer direct `fetch()` to Resend REST API over the npm package to avoid bundling issues in Workers.

**Brevo (fallback email):**
- Open issues: https://github.com/getbrevo/brevo-node/issues?q=is%3Aissue+cloudflare+OR+workers

**Image processing:**
- Astro v6 defaults to Cloudflare Images binding — prefer over Sharp.
- Sharp uses native binaries that may not work in `workerd`.

**@astrojs/sitemap:**
- Changelog: https://github.com/withastro/astro/blob/main/packages/integrations/sitemap/CHANGELOG.md

### Quick CLI check

```bash
npm ls vite                           # Vite version
npm ls @astrojs/cloudflare            # Adapter version
npx wrangler --version                # Wrangler version
npm ls 2>&1 | grep -i "WARN\|ERR"    # Peer dep warnings
```

---

## MCP Integration (GitHub + Cloudflare)

If GitHub or Cloudflare MCP is connected, prefer over CLI/manual checks.

### GitHub MCP — use for:

**Dependency compat check:**
- Search open issues in `resend/resend-node` for "cloudflare"
- Search open issues in `withastro/astro` for "cloudflare adapter"
- Search open issues in `cloudflare/workers-sdk` for "astro"
- Read adapter CHANGELOG.md in `withastro/astro`

### Cloudflare MCP — use for:

**Pre-deploy:** Confirm Worker exists with correct name, check env vars/secrets, verify DNS, check Workers Builds status.
**Post-deploy:** Check deployment status, tail logs for errors, verify preview URLs.

The Cloudflare MCP server exposes the full Cloudflare API (2,500+ endpoints) via `search()` and `execute()` tools. It can create, configure, and deploy Workers directly.

---

## Pre-Production (first deploy only)

Beyond blocking conditions, also verify: Lighthouse > 90, forms sending, GTM firing, no broken links, mobile tested on real device, 404 page exists, legal pages present, contact info correct, client approved preview, sitemap submitted to Search Console.

---

## Migration from Pages (existing sites)

For sites currently on Cloudflare Pages with the `fix-wrangler.mjs` hack:

1. Delete `fix-wrangler.mjs` and any `scripts/` related to it
2. Remove the `postbuild` script from `package.json` that called it
3. Update `@astrojs/cloudflare` to v13+
4. Replace wrangler config with the minimal Workers template (see references/wrangler-template.md)
5. Add `"nodejs_compat"` to `compatibility_flags`
6. Create a new Worker in CF Dashboard (or connect via Workers Builds)
7. Move env vars/secrets from Pages project to Worker settings
8. Update DNS: custom domain → Worker instead of Pages project
9. Test with `astro dev` (runs on real `workerd`)
10. Deploy and verify

Estimated time per site: 15–30 minutes. Code, components, routing, and Tailwind don't change.
