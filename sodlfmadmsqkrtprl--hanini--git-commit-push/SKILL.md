# Git Commit + Push

Follow this workflow to commit and push changes safely with the project's branch rules.

## Workflow

1. Confirm repository root and show status.
2. Ensure the working tree is clean after staging.
3. Enforce branch policy:

- If current branch is `main`, create or request a `feature/*`, `chore/*`, `fix/*`, `docs/*`, `refactor/*`, or `test/*` branch before committing.
- Before creating a new branch from `main`, sync `main` first with `git fetch origin main` then `git pull --ff-only origin main`.
- Prefer `chore/<short-desc>` for environment/tooling changes.

4. Stage changes with `git add -A`.
5. If behavior/logic changed, confirm tests were added or updated in the same diff.
6. Create a commit with a clear message.
7. Push with upstream tracking: `git push -u origin <branch>`.

## Preferred Commands

- Status: `git status -sb`
- Branch: `git branch --show-current`
- Sync main then create branch: `git fetch origin main && git pull --ff-only origin main && git checkout -b chore/<short-desc>`
- Stage: `git add -A`
- Commit: `git commit -m "<message>"`
- Push: `git push -u origin <branch>`

## Bundled Script

Use `scripts/commit_push.sh` for a consistent flow:

```
./scripts/commit_push.sh ["<message>"] [chore/<short-desc>]
```

Behavior:

- If on `main`, requires a branch name as the second argument.
- If on `main`, it syncs local `main` to latest `origin/main` before creating the new branch.
- Enforces `feature/*`, `chore/*`, `fix/*`, `docs/*`, `refactor/*`, or `test/*` naming.
- Stages, commits, and pushes.
- If message is omitted, generates one from staged file names.

## Notes

- If there are no changes to commit, stop and report.
- If behavior changed without corresponding test updates, pause and add tests first.
- If push fails, surface the error and suggest `git pull --rebase` only when needed.
