# SDLC Reconciliation

Analyse divergences between the SDLC manifest and actual development state, then propose and execute corrections to bring them into agreement.

## Process overview

```
[1. Collect state]
Git: log, branch, status, diff
Manifest: .sdlc/manifest.yaml
Files: .sdlc/stories/*/

[2. Detect divergences]
Compare expected vs actual state
Categorise by type and severity

[3. Generate report]
Summary of manifest state
Summary of git state
List of divergences

[4. Propose corrections]
Safe corrections (auto-apply candidates)
Unsafe corrections (require confirmation)

[5. Execute corrections]
Apply approved changes
Update manifest
```

## Commands

| Command | Behaviour |
|---------|-----------|
| `/reconcile` | Full analysis and interactive correction |
| `/reconcile --report` | Report only, no corrections |
| `/reconcile --auto` | Apply safe corrections automatically |
| `/reconcile --story US-XXX` | Focus on specific story |

## Divergence types

| Type | Description | Severity |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Phase drift | Manifest phase behind actual progress | Medium |
| Uncommitted implementation | Code exists but not committed | High |
| Missing artifacts | Manifest references non-existent files | Medium |
| Orphan artifacts | Files exist but not in manifest | Low |
| Stale branch | Merged branch still exists locally | Low |
| Status mismatch | Story marked complete but has issues | High |
| Untracked functionality | Implementation exists with no story | High |
| Branch mismatch | Wrong branch checked out for story | Medium |

See [references/divergence-types.md](references/divergence-types.md) for detailed detection methods and resolution strategies.

## Workflow

### 1. Collect state

Gather information from three sources:

**Git state:**
```bash
git log --oneline -20           # Recent commits
git branch -a                    # All branches
git status                       # Working tree state
git diff --name-only             # Changed files
git diff --cached --name-only    # Staged files
```

**Manifest state:**
- Read `.sdlc/manifest.yaml`
- Extract current_story, story phases, artifact references
- Note backlog and completed stories

**File state:**
- List `.sdlc/stories/*/` directories
- Check for spec.md, design.md, and other artifacts
- Compare against manifest references

### 2. Detect divergences

For each story in manifest:

1. **Check phase accuracy:**
   - If phase is "spec" but design.md exists → phase drift
   - If phase is "design" but implementation files exist → phase drift
   - If phase is "implement" but tests pass and code committed → phase drift

2. **Check artifacts:**
   - For each artifact in manifest, verify file exists
   - For each file in story directory, verify manifest reference

3. **Check git state:**
   - If story branch exists and is merged → stale branch
   - If uncommitted files match story scope → uncommitted implementation
   - If current branch doesn't match current_story → branch mismatch

4. **Check for untracked work:**
   - New files not matching any story
   - Commits not associated with any story

### 3. Generate report

Format:

```markdown
# Reconciliation report

## Manifest state

- Project: {name}
- Current story: {id} - {title}
- Current phase: {phase}
- Stories in progress: {count}
- Stories complete: {count}

## Git state

- Current branch: {branch}
- Uncommitted files: {count}
- Staged files: {count}
- Recent commits: {list}

## Divergences found

### High severity

- [ ] **Uncommitted implementation** (US-004)
  - Files: scoring.py, triage.py, writeback.py
  - Expected: committed during implement phase
  - Actual: exist but uncommitted

### Medium severity

- [ ] **Phase drift** (US-004)
  - Manifest phase: design
  - Actual progress: implementation exists
  - Evidence: scoring.py, triage.py present

### Low severity

- [ ] **Stale branch**
  - Branch: story/US-003-match-gmail-correspondence
  - Status: merged to main
  - Action: can be deleted

## Stale branches

| Branch | Status | Last commit |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| story/US-003-match-gmail-correspondence | merged | cc3128f |
```

### 4. Propose corrections

Present corrections in two categories:

**Safe corrections (can auto-apply):**

```markdown
## Safe corrections

These can be applied automatically with `--auto`:

1. **Update US-004 phase** design → implement
   - Reason: implementation files exist

2. **Add artifact references to US-004**
   - Add: scoring.py, triage.py, writeback.py

3. **Delete stale branch**
   - Branch: story/US-003-match-gmail-correspondence
```

**Unsafe corrections (require confirmation):**

```markdown
## Unsafe corrections

These require explicit approval:

1. **Commit uncommitted changes for US-004**
   - Files: scoring.py, triage.py, writeback.py
   - Message: "feat(scoring): implement lead scoring (US-004)"
   - Risk: may include unintended changes

2. **Create story for untracked functionality**
   - Files: collect.py, match.py, next.py
   - Suggested: US-005 "Additional utility scripts"
   - Risk: may miscategorise functionality

3. **Mark US-004 as current_story**
   - Current: null
   - Proposed: US-004
   - Risk: overwrites any existing current_story intent
```

### 5. Execute corrections

For safe corrections with `--auto`:
1. Apply each correction in sequence
2. Update manifest after each change
3. Report results

For unsafe corrections:
1. Present each correction individually
2. Wait for explicit yes/no
3. Apply only approved corrections
4. Update manifest

## Safe vs unsafe corrections

### Safe (auto-apply candidates)

These corrections have low risk and clear intent:

- Update phase forward (spec → design → implement → etc.)
- Add artifact references to manifest for existing files
- Delete merged feature branches
- Add missing story directories for manifest entries

### Unsafe (require confirmation)

These corrections could lose work or make incorrect assumptions:

- Create new stories
- Delete or modify existing stories
- Commit changes
- Change current_story
- Mark stories as complete
- Delete uncommitted files
- Revert changes
- Update phase backward

## Edge cases

### No manifest exists

If `.sdlc/manifest.yaml` does not exist:

1. Report: "No SDLC manifest found"
2. Check for `.sdlc/` directory
3. If story artifacts exist without manifest, offer to reconstruct
4. Otherwise, suggest running project initialisation

### Multiple stories in uncommitted changes

When uncommitted files could belong to multiple stories:

1. Group files by likely story based on:
   - File paths matching story scope
   - Recent commit messages
   - Manifest artifact patterns
2. Present groupings for user confirmation
3. Allow manual reassignment

### Partial artifacts

When some artifacts exist but story phase suggests they shouldn't:

1. If earlier artifacts missing (e.g., design exists but no spec):
   - Offer to create retrospective spec
   - Or mark as "spec skipped" in manifest
2. If later artifacts missing (e.g., spec exists but no design):
   - Normal state, no correction needed

### Orphan implementation files

Files that look like implementation but match no story:

1. Check commit history for associated story references
2. Check file contents for story ID comments
3. If no association found:
   - Offer to create new story
   - Or associate with existing story
   - Or mark as infrastructure/utility

## Integration with orchestrate

When orchestrate skill detects potential drift:

1. Pause pipeline
2. Invoke `/reconcile --report`
3. Present findings to user
4. Offer to apply corrections or continue anyway

Triggers for drift check:
- Before picking next story
- At phase transitions
- When resuming after pause
