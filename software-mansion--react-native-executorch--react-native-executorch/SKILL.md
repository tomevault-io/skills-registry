## Understanding Model Loading

Before using any AI model, you need to load it. Models can be loaded from three sources:

**1. Bundled with app (assets folder)**

- Best for small models (< 512MB)
- Available immediately without download
- Increases app installation size

**2. Remote URL (downloaded on first use)**

- Best for large models (> 512MB)
- Downloaded once and cached locally
- Keeps app size small
- Requires internet on first use

**3. Local file system**

- Maximum flexibility for user-managed models
- Requires custom download/file management UI

**Model selection strategy:**

1. Small models (< 512MB) → Bundle with app or download from URL
2. Large models (> 512MB) → Download from URL on first use with progress tracking
3. Quantized models → Preferred for lower-end devices to save memory

**Reference:** [./references/reference-models.md](./references/reference-models.md) - Loading Models section

---

## Device Constraints and Model Selection

Not all models work on all devices. Consider these constraints:

**Memory limitations:**

- Low-end devices: Use smaller models (135M-1.7B parameters) and quantized variants
- High-end devices: Can run larger models (3B-4B parameters)

**Processing power:**

- Lower-end devices: Expect longer inference times
- Audio processing requires specific sample rates (16kHz for STT and VAD, 24kHz for TTS output)

**Storage:**

- Large models require significant disk space
- Implement cleanup mechanisms to remove unused models
- Monitor total downloaded model size

**Guidance:**

- Always check model memory requirements before recommending models
- Prefer quantized model variants on lower-end devices
- Show download progress for models > 512MB
- Test on target devices before release

**Reference:** [./references/reference-models.md](./references/reference-models.md)

---

## Important Technical Requirements

### Audio Processing

Audio must be in correct sample rate for processing:

- **Speech-to-Text or VAD input:** 16kHz sample rate
- **Text-to-Speech output:** 24kHz sample rate
- Always decode/resample audio to correct rate before processing

**Reference:** [./references/reference-audio.md](./references/reference-audio.md)

### Image Processing

Images can be provided as:

- Remote URLs (http/https) - automatically cached
- Local file URIs (file://)
- Base64-encoded strings

Image preprocessing (resizing, normalization) is handled automatically by most hooks.

**Reference:** [./references/reference-cv.md](./references/reference-cv.md) and [./references/reference-cv-2.md](./references/reference-cv-2.md)

### Text Tokens

Text embeddings and LLMs have maximum token limits. Text exceeding these limits will be truncated. Use `useTokenizer` to count tokens before processing.

**Reference:** [./references/reference-nlp.md](./references/reference-nlp.md)

---

## Core Utilities and Error Handling

The library provides core utilities for managing models and handling errors:

**ResourceFetcher:** Manage model downloads with pause/resume capabilities, storage cleanup, and progress tracking.

**Error Handling:** Use `RnExecutorchError` and error codes for robust error handling and user feedback.

**useExecutorchModule:** Low-level API for custom models not covered by dedicated hooks.

**Reference:** [./references/core-utilities.md](./references/core-utilities.md)

---

## Common Troubleshooting

**Model not loading:** Check model source URL/path validity and sufficient device storage

**Out of memory errors:** Switch to smaller model or quantized variant

**Poor LLM quality:** Adjust temperature/top-p parameters or improve system prompt

**Audio issues:** Verify correct sample rate (16kHz for STT and VAD, 24kHz output for TTS)

**Download failures:** Implement retry logic and check network connectivity

**Reference:** [./references/core-utilities.md](./references/core-utilities.md) for error handling details, or specific reference file for your use case
