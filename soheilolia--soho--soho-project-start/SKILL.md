description: Use as the Soho project-start/context-engineering skill when starting a new project, major spec, PRP, architecture brief, agent handoff, or workflow that must keep durable project markdown surfaces aligned, including AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, CODEX.md, README.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, PLANNING.md, TASK.md, lessons.md, docs/specs, docs/plans, docs/receipts, Linear, and issue-tracker or handoff notes. Use when this capability is needed.

# Soho Project Start

Use this with `using-soho` before substantial project/spec work. The goal is a context package that future agents can execute from, not a chat-only plan.

## Mode

- Use `recommend` when the project direction or ownership is still undecided.
- Use `solo` when one agent can inspect, write the context package, and verify it.
- Use `swarm` only when independent architecture, product, security, design, or implementation tracks genuinely need separate passes.

Record the mode and runtime in the receipt.

## 1. Orient

Before writing, inspect the existing project truth:

```bash
pwd
git status --short --branch
find . -maxdepth 3 -type f \( -name 'AGENTS.md' -o -name 'CLAUDE.md' -o -name 'CODEX.md' -o -name 'README.md' -o -name 'ARCHITECTURE.md' -o -name 'PLANNING.md' -o -name 'TASK.md' -o -name 'lessons.md' -o -path './docs/*' \) | sort
```

Also inspect local equivalents when present:

- `BUILDERBOT.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `GOOSE.md`, `.cursor/commands/`
- `.agentops/context/`, `.agentops/tasks/`, `.agentops/receipts/`
- `docs/specs/`, `docs/plans/`, `docs/receipts/`
- open PR, Linear, Slack, or handoff notes referenced by the user or repo

Do not create every possible file. Use existing conventions first. For a new empty project, the safe default is `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/specs/`, `docs/plans/`, and `docs/receipts/`.

## 2. Build The Context Package

Borrow the useful Context Engineering pattern:

1. Initial request: what is being built and why.
2. Project rules: durable agent instructions and constraints.
3. Examples and patterns: files or prior artifacts to mirror.
4. PRP/spec: implementation blueprint with enough context for one-pass execution.
5. Validation gates: commands the agent can run and iterate on.
6. Receipt: what changed, what is proven, and what is not claimed.

The package must answer:

- Problem statement and user-visible outcome.
- Current truth layer: working tree, `HEAD`, generated artifacts, external systems.
- Non-goals and privacy/safety constraints.
- Source inventory and ownership.
- Existing patterns/examples to follow.
- Architecture decision and tradeoffs.
- Interfaces or artifact contracts.
- Manual curation or override path when generated output is involved.
- Tests, validation commands, and success criteria.
- Open questions with owner or next action.

## 3. Update Markdown Surfaces In Lockstep

Update only the files that are present, expected by the repo, or necessary for the new project.

- `AGENTS.md`: repo-specific agent rules and required read order. Preserve managed blocks exactly.
- `CLAUDE.md` / `CODEX.md`: runtime-specific guidance only when the repo uses those files. Keep them aligned with `AGENTS.md` instead of creating conflicting rules.
- `README.md`: human entrypoint, run commands, and current status.
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` / `PLANNING.md`: system design, boundaries, source-of-truth decisions, and sequencing.
- `TASK.md`: active tasks, discovered work, and dated next actions.
- `lessons.md`: durable lessons and repeated failure modes only. Do not use it as a scratchpad.
- `docs/specs/`: product and technical spec.
- `docs/plans/`: executable implementation plan with exact paths and validation.
- `docs/receipts/`: proof, commands run, outputs, blockers, non-claims, and external update state.
- Issue tracker / Linear / PR notes: post only when explicitly authorized; otherwise draft exact text and label it not posted.

If two files would say the same thing, prefer one canonical file and add a pointer from the other. Avoid duplicate narratives that can drift.

## 4. PRP / Spec Minimum

A build-ready PRP or spec needs:

- Goal, why, and user-visible behavior.
- Current codebase/project tree and desired tree.
- Files to create or modify.
- Data models, interfaces, or artifact schemas.
- Implementation steps in execution order.
- Validation gates that are actually runnable.
- Risks, failure modes, and mitigations.
- Success metrics or acceptance criteria.
- Explicit fixture/local proof versus live integration proof.

For agent-facing PRPs, include exact files and examples to read. Do not rely on a model guessing the project conventions.

## 5. Validation

Before claiming the context package is ready:

- Re-read the changed markdown files for contradictions.
- Verify JSON/YAML receipts or schemas parse when applicable.
- Verify referenced files exist or are explicitly marked future/nonexistent.
- Verify validation commands are concrete, not placeholders.
- Re-run `git status --short --branch` and classify unrelated dirty work.
- Record any live-system action as `posted`, `drafted`, `blocked`, or `not attempted`.

## 6. Receipt

End with a receipt containing:

- mode and runtime
- files created or updated
- commands run and results
- context-engineering inputs used
- live systems contacted or explicitly not contacted
- what is proven now
- what is not claimed
- next recommended action

## Guardrails

- Preserve managed blocks and user-owned edits.
- Do not overwrite existing project doctrine with generic templates.
- Do not claim fixture proof as live integration proof.
- Do not create `CLAUDE.md`, `CODEX.md`, or `lessons.md` just to satisfy a checklist if the repo has another canonical context surface.
- Do not post Slack, Linear, email, or PR comments without explicit authorization.
- If sending on the user's behalf after authorization, prefix the message with `🤖`.
