# Mobile Wallet Adapter - Router

This is the entry point for MWA integration. **Assess what the user needs, then use the appropriate sub-skill.**

## Quick Assessment

1. **Does the project have MWA set up?** (polyfills, providers, dependencies)
   - If NO → Use `mwa-setup` skill first
   - If YES → Continue to step 2

2. **What does the user want?**
   - Wallet connection (connect/disconnect button) → Use `mwa-connection` skill
   - Send transactions (SOL transfers, signing) → Use `mwa-transactions` skill
   - Both → Do connection first, then transactions

## Sub-Skills

| Skill | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|
| `mwa-setup` | Fresh project needs MWA dependencies, polyfills, providers |
| `mwa-connection` | Add connect/disconnect wallet functionality |
| `mwa-transactions` | Add SOL transfers or transaction signing |

## Prerequisites

- React Native Expo project
- Development build (NOT Expo Go - MWA uses native modules)
- Android development environment

## SDK Used

All sub-skills use `@wallet-ui/react-native-web3js` (Beeman's Wallet UI SDK).
