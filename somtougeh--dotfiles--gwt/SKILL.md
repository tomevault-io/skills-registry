# Git Worktree Manager (gwt)

Use a **centralized `worktrees/` folder** to keep all worktrees organized and your main code directory clean.

Naming: `{repo-name}--{branch-name}` (double dash separator, slashes become dashes)

## Instructions

1. If no action specified, show `gwt ls` output and explain available commands

2. For `new`:
   - Run `gwt new <branch>`
   - Report the created path
   - Remind user to run `bun install` after switching

3. For `ls`:
   - Run `gwt ls --json` for parsing
   - Format output nicely for user

4. For `go`:
   - Run `gwt go <branch>` to get path
   - Output a `cd` command the user can copy

5. For `switch`:
   - Run `gwt switch <branch>`
   - Inform user the command is in their clipboard

6. For `rm`:
   - Confirm with user before removing
   - Run `gwt rm <branch>`
   - Report success

7. For `here`:
   - Run `gwt here`
   - Show current worktree information

## Flags

- `--json` - Machine-readable output (for ls, here)
- `--no-env` - Skip .env file copying (for new)
- `--keep-branch` - Don't delete branch on rm

## Notes

- This avoids Turbopack/IDE conflicts with multiple lockfiles
- `.env*` and `.dev.vars` are automatically copied from main repo
- Set `GWT_EXTRA_FILES` for additional file patterns (space-separated)
- `GWT_WORKTREE_DIR` env var overrides the worktrees directory

### Cleanup

```bash
# Remove worktree and branch
gwt rm my-feature

# Keep the branch, just remove worktree
gwt rm my-feature --keep-branch
```

## Agent Rules

- Always use absolute paths -- `cd` does not persist between Bash calls
- Display worktree name as directory basename for statusline
- Prefer `gwt` commands over raw `git worktree`
- **CRITICAL: `gwt new <branch>` without `[from]` creates from HEAD** — this is almost always wrong for remote branches. Always specify the starting point for remote work.
- **Never use `git reset --hard` or `git checkout .` to fix a wrongly-created worktree** — user hooks may block destructive commands. Instead: `gwt rm` + recreate.

### Creating worktrees for remote branches

Any time you create a worktree for a branch that exists on a remote (PR review, checking out someone's branch, etc.), you MUST:

1. **Fetch first**: `git fetch origin <branch>` — the ref may not exist locally
2. **Specify `[from]`**: `gwt new <branch> origin/<branch>`
3. **Verify**: `cd "$WT" && git log --oneline -1` — confirm HEAD matches expected commit

```bash
# CORRECT — remote branch worktree
git fetch origin feat/auth
gwt new feat/auth origin/feat/auth

# WRONG — creates from current HEAD, not the remote branch
gwt new feat/auth
```

### PR review workflow

When the user asks to review a PR or create a worktree for one, **always infer the branch automatically**. The user may provide:
- A PR URL: `https://github.com/org/repo/pull/728`
- A PR number: `728`
- A conversational reference with a URL/number in the message

In all cases, extract the branch name via `gh pr view` — never ask the user for the branch name if you have a PR URL or number.

```bash
# 1. Extract branch name (works with URL or number)
BRANCH=$(gh pr view <url-or-number> --json headRefName --jq '.headRefName')

# 2. Fetch + create from remote ref
git fetch origin "$BRANCH"
gwt new "$BRANCH" "origin/$BRANCH"

# 3. Verify and get path
WT=$(gwt go "$BRANCH")
cd "$WT" && git log --oneline -1
```

If the user says "review this PR" without a number, check the conversation for a URL. If none found, ask for the PR number/URL.

### Error recovery

If a worktree was created from the wrong starting point:
- Do NOT attempt `git reset --hard` or `git checkout` — hooks may block these
- Instead, remove and recreate:

```bash
gwt rm <branch>
git fetch origin <branch>
gwt new <branch> origin/<branch>
```

This is idempotent and hook-safe.

## When to Use

- **Reviewing PRs** in isolation without switching branches
- **Parallel development** on multiple features
- **Testing changes** without affecting main branch state
- **Overnight/long-running** work that shouldn't block other work
