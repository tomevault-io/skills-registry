# Generate changelog

When you're asked to generate a changelog for a new release for the
`StackedDeck.Project.Templates` package, review the `git` log for this
repository to determine the delta between the previous release and the
latest commit.

Use the following algorithm:

1. Determine the previously released version.
   1.1 Check the `<PackageVersion>` in `../../../StackedDeck.Project.Templates.csproj`
   1.2 Determine the commit delta between the previous release version and the
   current one
   1.3 Feel free to use `git blame`, `git log` or `git tags` to determine the delta
2. Analyze the commit messages and collect information for the changes
3. If there are multiple `chore` related tasks like bumping dependencies, etc.,
   consolidate that into a single point in the change log
4. Write the change log in a nice human readable format, try to use lists,
   sections, etc. Attach a reference to a short version of the commit SHA
5. Make use of emojis semantically to prefix the changes; Use them to prefix the
   section headers as well as the individual change entries;
6. Keep the change entries as concise as possible, try to have one entry per
   major/minor change
7. After you've composed the list, update the `<PackageReleaseNotes>` section in
   `../../../StackedDeck.Project.Templates.csproj`. Make sure that the previous
   changelog is deleted/overwritten entirely. Don't skip this step.
