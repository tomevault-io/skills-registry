# Create Branch

Create git branches following consistent naming conventions.

## Branch Naming Convention

Branch names should follow the pattern: `<type>/<short-description>`

The type should match the primary type of work being done (same as commit
types).

### Branch Types

| Type    | When to Use                           | Example                      |
| ------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `feat`  | New feature or functionality          | `feat/add-user-auth`         |
| `fix`   | Bug fix                               | `fix/null-pointer-error`     |
| `ref`   | Refactoring (no behavior change)      | `ref/extract-validation`     |
| `perf`  | Performance improvement               | `perf/optimize-queries`      |
| `docs`  | Documentation changes                 | `docs/update-readme`         |
| `test`  | Adding or correcting tests            | `test/add-integration-tests` |
| `build` | Build system or dependencies          | `build/upgrade-webpack`      |
| `ci`    | CI/CD configuration                   | `ci/add-github-actions`      |
| `chore` | Maintenance, cleanup, or housekeeping | `chore/update-deps`          |
| `style` | Code formatting (no logic change)     | `style/format-components`    |

### Description Guidelines

The description should be:

- **Short**: 2-4 words maximum
- **Descriptive**: Clearly indicates what the branch is for
- **Lowercase**: Use lowercase with hyphens (kebab-case)
- **No special characters**: Only letters, numbers, and hyphens

### Good Branch Names

```bash
feat/add-user-auth              # Clear, concise, descriptive
fix/null-pointer-dashboard      # Specific about what's being fixed
ref/extract-validation-logic    # Clear refactoring goal
test/add-api-tests              # Clear testing scope
```

### Bad Branch Names

```bash
feature/add-authentication-system-for-users    # Too long
fix-bug                                         # Too vague
feat/AddUserAuth                                # Wrong case (use lowercase)
john/my-work                                    # Personal prefix (not descriptive)
feat_add_auth                                   # Wrong separator (use hyphens)
```

## Creating a Branch

### Check Current Branch First

Before creating a new branch, verify where you are:

```bash
# Check current branch
git branch --show-current

# See if you have uncommitted changes
git status
```

**If you have uncommitted changes:**

- Commit them first, OR
- Stash them: `git stash`

### Create and Switch to New Branch

```bash
# Create and switch to new branch from current location
git checkout -b <type>/<short-description>
```

### Create from Specific Base Branch

If you need to branch from a specific base (like `main` or `develop`):

```bash
# Make sure base branch is up to date
git checkout main
git pull

# Create new branch from main
git checkout -b feat/add-user-auth
```

## Examples

### Creating a Feature Branch

```bash
# Starting from main
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b feat/add-oauth

# Verify you're on the new branch
git branch --show-current  # Should output: feat/add-oauth
```

### Creating a Fix Branch

```bash
# Starting from develop
git checkout develop
git pull
git checkout -b fix/session-timeout

# Verify
git branch --show-current  # Should output: fix/session-timeout
```

### Creating a Refactor Branch

```bash
# From current branch (already has related work)
git checkout -b ref/extract-utils

# Verify
git branch --show-current  # Should output: ref/extract-utils
```

## Branch Workflow

### 1. Check Base Branch

```bash
# If you need to branch from main/master
git checkout main
git pull
```

### 2. Create Branch

```bash
# Create with appropriate type and description
git checkout -b feat/add-feature-name
```

### 3. Verify Branch

```bash
# Confirm you're on the new branch
git branch --show-current

# Should show: feat/add-feature-name
```

### 4. Push Branch (When Ready)

```bash
# Push and set upstream tracking
git push -u origin feat/add-feature-name
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake         | Bad Example          | Good Example       |
| --------------- | -------------------- | ------------------ |
| Too long        | feat/add-user-system | feat/add-user-auth |
| Too vague       | fix/bug              | fix/null-pointer   |
| Wrong case      | Feat/AddAuth         | feat/add-auth      |
| Personal prefix | john/feature         | feat/feature-name  |
| Wrong separator | feat_add_auth        | feat/add-auth      |
| No type         | add-authentication   | feat/add-auth      |

## Referencing Branch Names

Other skills reference these conventions:

- **commit skill**: Uses branch naming to ensure commits are on feature
  branches, not main/master
- **create-pr skill**: Uses branch naming for PR titles and validation

## Checklist Before Creating Branch

- [ ] Verified current branch and location
- [ ] Base branch is up to date (if branching from main/develop)
- [ ] No uncommitted changes (or stashed)
- [ ] Branch name follows `<type>/<short-description>` format
- [ ] Type matches the work being done
- [ ] Description is 2-4 words, lowercase, hyphen-separated
- [ ] Branch name is descriptive and clear

## Tool Usage

- **Use `git checkout -b <branch-name>`** to create and switch to new branch
- **Use `git branch --show-current`** to verify current branch
- **Use `git status`** to check for uncommitted changes
- **Use `git push -u origin <branch-name>`** to push new branch and set tracking
- **DO NOT use `git checkout -b` with `-i` or interactive flags** (not
  supported)
