# Feature Planning

Create structured planning documents before implementation.

## When to Plan

Create a plan for:
- New features with multiple components
- Changes affecting multiple files
- Backend + frontend integration work
- Architecture decisions
- Refactoring efforts

Skip planning for:
- Single-file bug fixes
- Minor styling tweaks
- Documentation updates

## Planning Workflow

```
- [ ] Step 1: Clarify requirements with user
- [ ] Step 2: Research existing patterns in codebase
- [ ] Step 3: Identify affected files/components
- [ ] Step 4: Create planning document
- [ ] Step 5: Get user approval before implementing
```

## Plan Location

```
.github/plans/feature-name-plan.md
```

Use kebab-case for filenames.

## Plan Template

See [TEMPLATE.md](TEMPLATE.md) for the full template.

## Quick Plan Structure

```markdown
# Feature: [Name]
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Status**: Planning

## Objective
What problem does this solve?

## Technical Approach
- Architecture decisions
- Components to create/modify
- API endpoints needed

## Implementation Steps
1. [Step with file path]
2. [Step with file path]

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests needed
- Manual testing checklist

## Checklist
- [ ] Audio integration considered
- [ ] Responsive design planned
- [ ] Error handling defined
- [ ] No new dependencies (or approval obtained)
```

## Architecture Considerations

Always address:

| Aspect | Question |
|--------|----------|
| Audio | What sounds should play? |
| Responsive | Mobile behavior at 768px? |
| State | Local state or context? |
| Data | tRPC query or static? |
| Auth | Protected or public? |
| Performance | Memoization needed? |

## After Implementation

Create completion doc at:
```
.github/documentation/feature-name-complete.md
```
