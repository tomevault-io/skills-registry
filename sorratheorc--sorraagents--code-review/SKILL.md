# Code Reviewer

This skill guides the agent in conducting professional and thorough code reviews for local development.

## Workflow

### 1. Determine Review Target
**Local Changes**: Target the current local file system states (staged and unstaged changes).

### 2. Preparation

1.  **Identify Changes**:
    *   Check status: `git status`
    *   Read diffs: `git diff` (working tree) and/or `git diff --staged` (staged).

### 3. In-Depth Analysis
Analyze the code changes based on the following pillars:

*   **Correctness**: Does the code achieve its stated purpose without bugs or logical errors?
*   **Maintainability**: Is the code clean, well-structured, and easy to understand and modify in the future? Consider factors like code clarity, modularity, and adherence to established design patterns.
*   **Readability**: Is the code well-commented (where necessary) and consistently formatted according to our project's coding style guidelines?
*   **Efficiency**: Are there any obvious performance bottlenecks or resource inefficiencies introduced by the changes?
*   **Security**: Are there any potential security vulnerabilities or insecure coding practices?
*   **Edge Cases and Error Handling**: Does the code appropriately handle edge cases and potential errors?
*   **Testability**: Is the new or modified code adequately covered by tests (even if preflight checks pass)? Suggest additional test cases that would improve coverage or robustness.

### 4. Provide Feedback

Structure:
**Summary**: A high-level overview of the review.
**Findings**:
  *   **Critical**: Bugs, security issues, or breaking changes.
  *   **Smells**: Suggestions for better code quality or performance.
  *   **Nitpicks**: Formatting or minor style issues (optional).

#### Tone
*   Be constructive, professional, and friendly.
*   Explain *why* a change is requested.

## Scripts (canonical runner & modules)

This skill does not ship a canonical in-repo CLI script. Agents should perform code review analysis using local git commands and project tooling. When automating reviews prefer the project's linters, test runners, and pre-existing CI scripts.

Preferred execution behaviour (policy)

- Agents SHOULD prefer running the repository's canonical linters and test scripts rather than issuing ad-hoc checks.
- Do NOT make automatic commits or push changes without explicit human approval.

Usage example (worklog context)

- To fetch the work item context before a review:

  wl show SA-0MPYMFZXO0004ZU4 --json

End.
