# Animation Performance Tips

## Overview

Performance optimization guide for React Native Reanimated animations, covering shared values, worklets, memoization, and rendering optimizations. These guidelines ensure buttery smooth animations at 60fps.

## When to Apply

Reference these guidelines when:
- Debugging janky or stuttering animations
- Optimizing animation performance (FPS drops)
- Working with shared values and worklets
- Implementing gesture handlers
- Optimizing animated lists and scroll handlers
- Reviewing Reanimated code for performance issues

## Priority-Ordered Guidelines

| Priority | Category | Impact | Prefix |
|----------|----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Shared Values Usage | CRITICAL | `shared-values-*` |
| 2 | Re-renders | CRITICAL | `re-renders-*` |
| 3 | Memoization | HIGH | `memoization-*` |
| 4 | Animation Calculations | HIGH | `calculations-*` |
| 5 | Layout vs Transform | HIGH | `layout-*` |
| 6 | Reactions | HIGH | `reactions-*` |
| 7 | Hooks Selection | HIGH | `hooks-*` |
| 8 | Animation Lifecycle | MEDIUM | `animations-*` |
| 9 | Component Limits | MEDIUM | `limits-*` |
| 10 | Scroll Optimization | MEDIUM | `scroll-*` |

## Quick Reference

### Critical: Shared Values Usage

**Common mistakes:**
- Reading shared values on JS thread (causes thread blocking)
- Accessing shared values during render (violates Rules of React)
- Using component state for animation values (triggers re-renders)

**Quick fixes:**
- Read shared values only in worklets (`useAnimatedStyle`, `useDerivedValue`) - see `shared-values-read-in-worklets.md`
- Access shared values in `useEffect` or callbacks, not during render - see `shared-values-during-render.md`
- Use `useSharedValue` instead of `useState` for animation values - see `re-renders-use-shared-values.md`
- Track animation state with `useRef` instead of reading shared values - see `shared-values-track-state-with-ref.md`
- Initialize with simple values, compute complex ones in worklets - see `shared-values-initialization.md`

### Critical: Re-renders

**Common fixes:**
- Use shared values instead of component state for animations
- Memoize animation objects outside component or with constants
- Memoize frame callbacks with `useCallback`
- Memoize gesture objects with `useMemo`

### High: Animation Calculations

**Common fixes:**
- Use `useDerivedValue` for expensive calculations - see `calculations-use-derived-value.md`
- Avoid conditional logic in worklets - see `calculations-avoid-conditionals.md`
- Use `clamp` instead of manual Math.min/max - see `calculations-use-clamp.md`
- Batch updates with `scheduleOnUI` - see `calculations-batch-with-schedule-on-ui.md`
- Prefer transform properties over layout properties - see `layout-prefer-transform.md`
- Choose the right hook (`useAnimatedProps` vs `useAnimatedStyle`) - see `hooks-choose-animated-props.md`
- Optimize `useAnimatedReaction` dependencies - see `reactions-optimize-dependencies.md`
- Cancel animations properly before starting new ones - see `animations-cancel-properly.md`
