Invoke at the rejection-handling point when a feedback gate recommends REJECTED or the captain rejects at a feedback-to stage. Use when this capability is needed.

# Feedback Rejection Flow

This skill carries the first-officer's feedback-rejection routing procedure. The rejection DETECTION stays always-on in the FO contract's gate flow; this skill loads at the rejection-handling point to route the findings back to the target stage and re-run the reviewer. The `### Feedback Cycles` write-scope rules, the reuse conditions, and the budget probe stay always-on in the FO contract — this procedure references them by name.

## Feedback Rejection Flow

When a feedback stage recommends REJECTED:

1. Read the rejected stage's `feedback-to` target — the stage that receives the fix request, not the reviewer.
2. Track cycles in `### Feedback Cycles` in the entity body.
3. On cycle 3, escalate to the human instead of another round.
4. Consult the budget probe (reuse condition 0). If the old ensign is over budget or the source is unavailable, shut down and fresh-dispatch; if no probe is declared, proceed to reuse below.
5. Route findings back to the target stage in the same worktree using `«addressable-worker»` when the existing handle is addressable and reuse conditions pass; otherwise shut down and fresh-dispatch. The routed message must carry the concrete next-stage assignment and fix work, not just an acknowledgment request. Do not treat the immediate routing response as the new completion result: if the follow-up is on the entity's critical path, wait for the reused worker's next completion through `«completion-signal»` before advancing or shutting it down. Attribute completion by mailbox content, task path, or durable workflow state, not by narration.
6. Re-run the reviewer after fixes. When the existing reviewer remains addressable and reuse conditions pass, re-run the kept-alive reviewer through the same `«addressable-worker»` capability used for feedback routing; the message must ask that reviewer to re-review the updated entity state, not validate its own fix work. Fresh-dispatch the reviewer only when the existing reviewer is no longer addressable or reuse conditions fail.
7. Re-enter the normal gate flow with the updated result.

The FO owns `### Feedback Cycles`. Routing follows the first-officer write scope (`Skill(skill="spacedock:fo-write-core")`): worktree-side when `worktree:` is set, main-side otherwise.
