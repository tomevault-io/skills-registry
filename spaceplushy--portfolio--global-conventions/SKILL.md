- When writing git commit messages using conventional commits format (feat:, fix:, docs:)
- When managing dependencies in package.json and lock files
- When configuring Astro integrations or adapters in astro.config.mjs
- When establishing code review processes and pull request templates
- When setting up build modes (SSG, hybrid, SSR) and deployment strategies
- When creating project documentation (README.md, Architecture Decision Records)
- When implementing performance standards (Lighthouse scores, bundle size budgets)
- When organizing files by feature or colocation patterns
