# CLI Session Recorder

Record CLI sessions and generate shareable feedback with human-readable summaries and machine-readable data.

## ⚠️ MANDATORY: Comprehensive Output

**EVERY saved report MUST include the complete `exchanges` array with:**
- All user prompts (verbatim)
- All tool calls with full parameters AND results
- All assistant responses
- All errors with context
- Timing information

**This is NOT optional.** A report without detailed exchanges is incomplete and useless for debugging. Never save a summary-only report.

## Workflow

### Starting a Recording

When the user wants to record their session:

1. Generate a unique session ID (use timestamp or UUID)
2. Detect the current model from context
3. Get git branch if in a repository: `git branch --show-current`
4. Begin capturing all exchanges

```python
from resources.session_recorder import SessionRecorder
import subprocess

# Get git branch
try:
    branch = subprocess.run(
        ["git", "branch", "--show-current"],
        capture_output=True, text=True, check=True
    ).stdout.strip()
except:
    branch = None

# Initialize recorder with optional debug log parsing
recorder = SessionRecorder(
    session_id=f"session-{datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d-%H%M%S')}",
    model="claude-sonnet-4-20250514",  # from context
    log_dir=".logs"  # Optional: path to Copilot debug logs
)
recorder.start_recording(git_branch=branch, capture_environment=True)
```

### During the Session (VERBOSE CAPTURE)

**IMPORTANT**: Capture EVERY exchange with full verbosity. This is critical for debugging and feedback analysis.

For **EACH** exchange, you MUST capture:
- The exact user prompt (verbatim)
- ALL tool calls with:
  - Full tool name
  - Complete parameters object
  - Full result/output (truncate only if >2000 chars)
  - Timing information
  - Retry counts
- The complete assistant response
- Any errors with full context
- Exchange timing

```python
# When user sends a prompt - capture EXACTLY what they typed
recorder.add_user_prompt("help me deploy my app to azure")

# For EVERY tool call - capture full details
recorder.start_tool_call()  # Start timing
recorder.add_tool_call(
    name="bash",
    parameters={
        "command": "ls -la && cat index.html",
        "description": "List files and view content"
    },
    result="total 8\n-rw-r--r--  1 user  staff  123 Jan 28 index.html\n<!DOCTYPE html>...",
    retry_count=0
)

recorder.start_tool_call()
recorder.add_tool_call(
    name="glob",
    parameters={"pattern": "**/*.{json,yaml,yml}"},
    result=".github/workflows/run_test_deploy.yml",
    retry_count=0
)

recorder.start_tool_call()
recorder.add_tool_call(
    name="bash",
    parameters={"command": "az group create --name rg-myapp --location eastus2"},
    result='{"id": "/subscriptions/.../resourceGroups/rg-myapp", "location": "eastus2", "name": "rg-myapp"}',
    retry_count=0
)

# Capture COMPLETE assistant response
recorder.add_assistant_response(
    "I detected a static HTML site. I'll deploy it to Azure Static Web Apps.\n\n"
    "Created resource group `rg-myapp` and deploying..."
)

# When errors occur - capture FULL context
recorder.add_error(
    error_type="ToolError",
    message="SWA CLI artifact folder constraint - current directory cannot be identical to artifact folder",
    context={
        "tool": "bash",
        "command": "swa deploy . --deployment-token ...",
        "resolution": "Created dist folder and copied files"
    }
)
```

### Verbose Capture Checklist

For each turn, ensure you record:

| Item | Required | Details |
|------|----------|---------|
| User prompt | ✅ Yes | Exact text, no summarization |
| Tool name | ✅ Yes | Full tool identifier |
| Tool parameters | ✅ Yes | Complete parameters object |
| Tool result | ✅ Yes | Full output (truncate >2000 chars with "[truncated]") |
| Tool timing | ✅ Yes | Use `start_tool_call()` before each call |
| Tool errors | ✅ Yes | Include if tool failed |
| Assistant response | ✅ Yes | Complete response text |
| Exchange timestamp | ✅ Auto | Captured automatically |

### Stopping Recording

When the user says "stop recording" or "save feedback":

1. Stop the recorder
2. Scrub sensitive data
3. Ask for summary information
4. Generate the feedback file **with FULL exchange data**

```python
recorder.stop_recording()
recorder.scrub_sensitive_data()
```

### Generating Feedback (ALWAYS COMPREHENSIVE)

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: The generated feedback MUST always include the complete `exchanges` array with all tool calls, parameters, and results. This is mandatory, not optional.

When stopping the recording, **auto-generate** the summary by analyzing the recorded session:

1. **Task Summary**: Infer from the first user prompt and overall conversation flow
2. **Problems**: Identify from errors, retries, tool failures, or user corrections
3. **Outcome**: Determine from final exchanges - did the task complete successfully?

Then present to user for confirmation:

```
I've generated a summary of this session:

**Task**: Fix login authentication bug causing 401 errors
**Problems**: 
- Initial grep search returned too many results
- Had to inspect multiple files before finding the issue
**Outcome**: Success - Bug identified and fixed in src/auth.py

Accept this summary, or provide your own?
```

If user accepts, proceed. If they provide edits, use their version.

```python
from resources.format_feedback import format_feedback, save_feedback

# Auto-generated from session analysis
feedback = format_feedback(
    session=recorder.get_session_data(),
    task_summary="User attempted to fix authentication bug...",  # AI-generated
    problems=["Initial search returned too many results"],        # AI-detected
    outcome="Success - Bug fixed in auth.py"                      # AI-inferred
)

filepath = save_feedback(feedback, output_dir="./feedback/")
print(f"Saved to: {filepath}")
```

### Sharing Options

Present the user with sharing choices:

**1. Local file (default)**
```python
from resources.format_feedback import save_feedback
filepath = save_feedback(feedback)
```

**2. GitHub Gist**
```python
from resources.share_gist import create_gist
url = create_gist(filepath, public=False)
```

**3. GitHub Issue**
```python
from resources.share_issue import create_issue
url = create_issue("owner/repo", filepath, labels=["feedback"])
```

## Commands Reference

Both explicit commands and natural language work. **Use explicit commands if natural language isn't giving good results.**

| Command | Natural Language | Action |
|---------|------------------|--------|
| `/cli-session-recorder start` | "record this", "start recording" | Begin capturing session |
| `/cli-session-recorder stop` | "stop recording" | Stop and auto-generate summary |
| `/cli-session-recorder save` | "save feedback" | Save to local file |
| `/cli-session-recorder save --gist` | "share as gist" | Upload to GitHub Gist |
| `/cli-session-recorder save --issue` | "create issue", "report this" | Create GitHub Issue |
| `/cli-session-recorder status` | "show recording status" | Report if recording is active |

## Summary Generation

When stopping a recording, analyze the session to auto-generate:

| Field | How to Infer |
|-------|--------------|
| **Task** | First user prompt + overall goal from conversation |
| **Problems** | Errors, tool failures, retries, user corrections, "that's not right" |
| **Outcome** | Final state - did task complete? User satisfaction signals |

**Always present the generated summary and ask**: "Accept this summary, or provide your own?"

## Guidelines

1. **Always scrub sensitive data** before sharing - the recorder does this automatically but verify no secrets leak
2. **Generate meaningful summaries** - don't just echo back what happened, synthesize the key points
3. **Be specific about problems** - vague feedback isn't helpful to developers
4. **Include context** - working directory, git branch, and model info help reproduce issues
5. **Respect user privacy** - don't share without explicit consent

## Verbose/Debug Mode Best Practices

To ensure maximum detail in recordings:

### Capture Everything

1. **User Input**: Record the exact prompt text, not a summary
2. **Tool Invocations**: Every tool call with full parameters
3. **Tool Responses**: Complete output (truncate only if necessary)
4. **Errors**: Full error messages with stack traces if available
5. **Timing**: How long each operation took

### What Verbose Output Looks Like

For each exchange, the output should show:

```
Exchange #2:
├── User: "help me deploy my app to azure"
├── Tools:
│   ├── bash(command="ls -la && cat index.html") → "total 8\n-rw-r--r--..."
│   ├── glob(pattern="**/*.{json,yaml,yml}") → ".github/workflows/..."
│   ├── bash(command="az account show") → "shboyer subscription"
│   ├── bash(command="az group create...") → "Created rg-..."
│   ├── bash(command="swa deploy .") → ERROR: "artifact folder constraint"
│   └── bash(command="mkdir -p dist && cp...") → "deployed to https://..."
├── Assistant: "Detected static HTML site..."
└── Duration: 2m 15s
```

### Common Issues That Reduce Verbosity

| Issue | Problem | Fix |
|-------|---------|-----|
| Summarized prompts | "User asked about deployment" | Record exact: "help me deploy my app to azure" |
| Missing tool params | `{...}` or empty | Include full parameters object |
| Truncated results | "..." | Keep full output, truncate only >2000 chars |
| Missing errors | Error not recorded | Always call `add_error()` on failures |
| No timing | `null` duration | Always call `start_tool_call()` before each tool |

### Debug Log Integration

If Copilot debug logs are available (typically in `~/.copilot/logs/`), the recorder can parse them:

```python
recorder = SessionRecorder(
    session_id="session-123",
    model="claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
    log_dir="~/.copilot/logs"  # Parse debug logs for extra detail
)
```

This adds `debug_logs` to the output with API calls, timing, token usage, and errors from the log files.
