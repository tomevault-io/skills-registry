# Landing Page Architect

Generate marketing copy and landing pages for Raamattu Nyt by translating the canonical user
model into benefits and value.

## Authority

- Consumes `Docs/ai/core-user-model.json` as the single source of truth
- NEVER redefines tasks or paths — translates them into benefits and value
- The `core-ux-detective` skill owns definitions; this skill owns marketing presentation

## Workflow

### 1. Read the User Model

```
Read Docs/ai/core-user-model.json
```

If file doesn't exist, inform the user to run `core-ux-detective` first.

### 2. Determine Scope

From user request, determine what to generate:
- **Full landing page**: Hero + feature sections + CTAs
- **Feature page**: Single feature deep-dive
- **CTA copy**: Call-to-action suggestions
- **Messaging framework**: Benefit mapping for all tasks/paths

### 3. Transform Paths → Narratives

For each `user_path`, generate a benefit narrative:

| Model Field | Marketing Use |
|-------------|---------------|
| `user_paths[].intent` | Problem statement / user need |
| `user_paths[].label` | Section heading (Finnish) |
| `user_paths[].steps` | Implied complexity → simplicity promise |
| `user_paths[].primary` | Hero section (true) vs. feature section (false) |

**Primary paths** → hero section and main value proposition.
**Secondary paths** → feature cards / supporting sections.

### 4. Transform Tasks → Benefits

For each `core_task`, map to a user benefit:

```
Task intent (English)  →  What problem it solves
Task label (Finnish)   →  Feature name in copy
Task appears_in        →  Context for where to show it
```

Focus on **outcomes**, not mechanics:
- "Löydä jakeet hetkessä" (Find verses instantly) — not "Hakutoiminto käyttää tekstihakua"
- "Kuuntele Raamattu matkalla" (Listen to the Bible on the go) — not "TTS-toisto ElevenLabs APIlla"

### 5. Generate Copy

See [references/copy-patterns.md](references/copy-patterns.md) for page structure templates and
Finnish copywriting patterns.

### 6. Output

| Output | Format | Location |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Landing page | React component or HTML | `apps/raamattu-nyt/src/pages/LandingPage.tsx` |
| Feature sections | Component per section | `apps/raamattu-nyt/src/components/landing/` |
| Copy data | JSON | `apps/raamattu-nyt/src/data/marketing-copy.json` |
| Static landing | HTML (if standalone) | `apps/raamattu-nyt/public/landing/` |

## Messaging Rules

1. **Never rename** tasks or paths from the canonical model
2. **Never invent** features that don't exist in `core-user-model.json`
3. **User intent language** — describe what the user wants, not what the app does
4. **Finnish first** — all user-facing copy in Finnish, English for dev comments only
5. **No superlatives** — avoid "paras", "vallankumouksellinen", "uskomaton"
6. **Trustworthy tone** — clear, honest, non-pushy
7. **No step-by-step** — marketing explains why, not how (help-system-architect owns how)

## Tone

- **Trustworthy**: Honest about what the app does, no exaggeration
- **Clear**: Short sentences, concrete benefits, no jargon
- **Non-pushy**: Invite, don't pressure — "Kokeile" over "Osta nyt"
- **Warm**: The Bible is personal; copy should feel respectful and inviting
