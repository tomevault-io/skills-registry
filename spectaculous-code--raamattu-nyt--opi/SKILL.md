# Opi - Learning Extractor

Extract learnings from recent work to improve future Claude sessions. Captures **two types**:

1. **Reactive** — What went wrong and how it was fixed (bugs, corrections, failed attempts)
2. **Preventive** — Reusable patterns that prevent future problems (safe components, conventions, security defaults)

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Sources

```bash
# Recent commits (last 20)
git log --oneline -20

# Today's commits with details
git log --since="midnight" --format="%h %s"

# Fix/refactor/security commits
git log --oneline -50 | grep -iE "(fix|korja|refactor|bugfix|secur|safe|harden)"
```

Also check:
- Current conversation for corrections, discoveries, new patterns
- Recent security reviews or audit results
- New reusable components or utilities created this session

### Step 2: Classify Each Finding

For each potential learning, determine the **type**:

| Type | Signal | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| **Reactive fix** | Bug fixed, user corrected, test failed | "useEffect infinite loop — wrap in useCallback" |
| **Preventive pattern** | New convention, safe default, reusable component | "Use SafeTextarea for user-facing text inputs" |
| **Security hardening** | Vulnerability found, RLS gap, input validation | "Always enforce maxLength on text inputs" |
| **Anti-pattern** | Repeatedly wrong approach discovered | "Don't use bare Textarea without maxLength" |

### Step 3: Route to Destination

See [references/learnings-router.md](references/learnings-router.md) for the full routing table.

Quick reference:

| Learning Domain | Destination |
|----------------|-------------|
| React/TypeScript, Supabase/DB, CSS, i18n | `.claude/LEARNINGS.md` |
| Security patterns, input validation | `.claude/LEARNINGS.md` (Security section) |
| CI/CD | `ci-doctor/references/learnings.md` |
| Lint/formatting | `lint-fixer/references/learnings.md` |
| Tests | `test-writer/references/learnings.md` |
| Security audits, RLS | `security-auditor/references/learnings.md` |
| Supabase migrations | `supabase-migration-writer/references/learnings.md` |
| Other skill-specific | `[skill]/references/learnings.md` |

### Step 4: Format Learnings

**Reactive fix format:**
```markdown
### [Issue Title]
- **Pattern:** What triggers this mistake
- **Wrong:** ❌ The incorrect approach
- **Right:** ✅ The correct approach
- **Why:** Root cause
```

**Preventive pattern format:**
```markdown
### [Convention Title]
- **Rule:** Always do X when Y
- **Wrong:** ❌ The old/unsafe way
- **Right:** ✅ The new/safe way
- **Why:** What this prevents
- **Since:** date or commit ref
```

**Recent Corrections table row:**
```markdown
| Date | Issue | Fix | Applies To |
```

### Step 5: Propose & Write

1. Present all proposed learnings grouped by destination file
2. User approves/rejects each
3. Write approved learnings to files
4. Commit changes

## Learning Quality Criteria

Only propose learnings that are:

- **Non-obvious** — Claude wouldn't know without being told
- **Actionable** — Concrete wrong/right examples, not vague advice
- **Recurring** — Likely to come up again in this codebase
- **Preventive OR Corrective** — Either prevents future bugs or fixes repeated mistakes

**Skip:** Typo fixes, one-off configs, project-specific constants, things Claude already knows.

## Preventive Patterns to Watch For

When analyzing commits, specifically look for these signals that indicate a preventive learning:

| Signal in Commit | Learning Type |
|-----------------|---------------|
| New reusable component created | "Always use X instead of Y" convention |
| Security hardening (maxLength, validation, RLS) | Security default rule |
| `feat(security):` or `fix(security):` prefix | Security learning |
| Wrapper/helper replacing bare primitive | Anti-pattern (bare primitive) + convention (use wrapper) |
| Migration adding constraints/checks | DB convention |
| New utility extracted from repeated code | "Use X utility" convention |

## Commands Reference

```bash
# Commits since specific date
git log --since="2025-01-10" --oneline

# Commits by pattern
git log --all --oneline | grep -i "fix"

# Show specific commit
git show <hash> --name-only

# Diff for a commit
git diff <hash>^..<hash>

# Security-related commits
git log --oneline -50 | grep -iE "(secur|rls|grant|xss|valid|sanitiz|safe|harden)"
```
