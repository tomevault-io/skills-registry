# Performance Auditor

Expert performance optimization for the Raamattu Nyt application across database, frontend, and AI systems.

## Quick Start

Choose your performance concern:

- **Database performance**: Slow queries, missing indexes, sequential scans → See `references/sql-queries.md`
- **React Query optimization**: Caching strategy, stale times, unnecessary refetches → See `references/react-query-patterns.md`
- **AI performance**: Latency, costs, cache effectiveness → See `references/ai-monitoring.md`
- **N+1 query detection**: Finding and fixing N+1 patterns → See `references/n+1-detection.md`
- **Optimization checklist**: Complete performance audit → See `references/checklist.md`
- **Common gotchas**: Known issues and pitfalls → See `references/learnings.md`

## Performance Targets

Reference targets for healthy performance:

| Operation | Target |
|-----------|--------|
| Single verse lookup | <20ms |
| Chapter load | <50ms |
| Text search | <100ms |
| AI translation | <500ms |
| Page load (FCP) | <1.5s |
| API response | <200ms |

## How to Use This Skill

1. Identify your performance issue (database, frontend, AI, or N+1)
2. Read the appropriate reference file above
3. Run SQL scripts or code patterns from `scripts/` if needed
4. Check `references/learnings.md` if results seem unexpected

## Key Tools

- **Database analysis**: Read `references/sql-queries.md` then run `scripts/analyze-queries.sql`
- **N+1 detection**: See `references/n+1-detection.md` and `scripts/detect-n+1.js`
- **Cache optimization**: See `references/react-query-patterns.md` for staleTime/gcTime strategy
- **AI monitoring**: See `references/ai-monitoring.md` for latency and cost tracking

## Context Files

For codebase structure reference:
- `Docs/context/db-schema-short.md` - Database tables and indexes
- `Docs/context/supabase-map.md` - Edge functions to monitor
