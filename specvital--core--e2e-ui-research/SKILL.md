# UI E2E Test Research Command

## Prerequisites

- ✅ Frontend server must be already running
- ✅ Playwright MCP server must be running

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

Consider any additional context from user input (if not empty). Port and base URL will be extracted from `playwright.config.ts`.

---

## Overview

This command performs comprehensive UI E2E test research including **actual browser exploration via Playwright MCP**.

### Key Features

- 🎭 **Actual Browser Exploration**: Direct app manipulation via Playwright MCP
- 📊 **Codebase Analysis**: Static analysis to understand routes and components
- 🔄 **Bilingual Documentation**: Simultaneous Korean/English version generation
- 🧠 **Business Domain Understanding**: Backend analysis for domain context
- 📝 **Always Create Fresh**: Delete existing docs and create completely new ones

---

## Execution Steps

### 1. Preparation and Context Gathering

#### Detect Project Type and Configuration

**Read `playwright.config.ts` (or `.js`) and `package.json` together**:

From `playwright.config.ts`:

- Base URL and port (from `webServer.url` or `use.baseURL`)
- Test directory location (from `testDir` or `testMatch`)
- Browser configuration and test settings

From `package.json` (in same directory as playwright.config.ts):

- Framework detection via dependencies: `next`, `react`, `vue`, `svelte`, `@angular/core`, etc.
- Build tools: `vite`, `webpack`, `turbopack`, etc.
- This is more reliable than inferring from webServer command

**Fallback** (if playwright.config not found):

- Analyze `package.json` dependencies and scripts
- Check directory patterns to infer framework

AI should use both files together for accurate project understanding.

#### Understand Backend Business Domain (if applicable)

**Detect Backend Presence**:

- Backend-related directories (e.g., `backend/`, `server/`, `api/`, or similar)
- Server frameworks in package.json (Express, Fastify, NestJS, etc.)
- Backend services in docker-compose.yml

AI should flexibly identify backend components regardless of specific naming conventions.

**Analyze Project**:

- `README.md`: Project overview, architecture
- `CLAUDE.md`: Domain knowledge, business rules
- REST API or GraphQL API endpoints (if backend exists)
- Data models (if backend exists)
- OpenAPI/Swagger docs (if exists)

**Information to Gather**:

- Main domain entities (User, Product, Order, etc.)
- Core business flows (ordering, payment, auth, etc.)
- Permission model (RBAC, ABAC)
- External service integrations

### 2. Analyze Existing UI E2E Test Files (For Context Only)

**Use `playwright.config.ts` to locate test files**:

- Read `testDir` or `testMatch` from playwright.config to find test location
- If config specifies patterns, use those (e.g., `tests/e2e/**/*.spec.ts`)
- **Fallback**: If not found in config, search with Glob (`**/*.e2e.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}`, `e2e-ui/**/*`, `e2e/**/*`)

**Analyze existing tests**:

- Read existing test **case descriptions (describe/test/it) all** to understand coverage
- Understand test patterns and structure
- **Important**: Do NOT read existing docs (`docs/e2e-ui/test-targets.md`) - will delete and recreate

### 3. Static Codebase Analysis

**Frontend Structure Analysis**:

- Find route definitions with Glob (adapt patterns to project structure)
  - **Examples** (not exhaustive):
    - Next.js: `app/**/page.{ts,tsx}`, `pages/**/*.{ts,tsx}`
    - React Router: `src/routes/**/*.{ts,tsx}`, `src/pages/**/*.{ts,tsx}`
    - Other frameworks: Analyze directory structure and adapt accordingly
- Read main page components
- Map user flows and interactions
- List main UI components and features

AI should flexibly explore the codebase based on detected framework and project structure.

### 4. 🎭 Playwright MCP Actual Browser Exploration (Required)

**This is the most important step!** Code analysis alone cannot reveal actual user experience.

**Get base URL from `playwright.config.ts`**:

- Read `webServer.url` or `use.baseURL` to get the application URL
- Extract port number from the URL
- If not found in config, ask user to provide base URL

#### 4.1 Initial Access and Basic Structure Understanding

```javascript
// MCP tool usage example (use URL from playwright.config.ts)
browser_navigate: {baseURL from config}
browser_snapshot: Capture initial page DOM structure
```

- Analyze main page structure
- Identify navigation menu elements
- List main links and buttons

#### 4.2 Major Page Traversal

Based on route list identified from code:

```javascript
// For each page (use baseURL from playwright.config.ts)
browser_navigate: {baseURL}/{route}
browser_snapshot: Capture page DOM structure
```

- Identify interactive elements on each page (buttons, links, forms, dropdowns)
- Check dynamic elements (modals, toasts, dialogs)
- Understand navigation flow between pages

#### 4.3 User Flow Experiments

Simulate main workflows:

```javascript
// Example: Login flow
browser_click: "login button selector";
browser_type: ("email input", "test@example.com");
browser_type: ("password input", "password123");
browser_click: "submit button";
browser_wait_for: "dashboard loaded";
browser_snapshot: "after login state";
```

**Flows to Explore**:

- Login/logout (if exists)
- CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
- Form submission and validation
- Modal/dialog interactions
- Search and filtering
- Pagination
- File upload (if exists)

Capture snapshots at each step to record state changes

#### 4.4 Edge Case Exploration

- Empty state: UI when no data
- Loading state: During network requests
- Error state: Validation failures, API errors
- Unauthorized page access
- Invalid input handling
- Long text, special character input

#### 4.5 Responsive and Accessibility Check (briefly)

- Various viewport sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Keyboard navigation availability
- Focus state verification

### 🐛 Bug Discovery Handling Guidelines

**Important**: Even if bugs are found during Playwright MCP browser exploration:

❌ **DON'T**:

- Report bugs or provide feedback to user
- Suggest bug fixes
- Suggest bug workarounds in test scenarios

✅ **DO**:

- Write scenarios for buggy features **as they should work normally**
- Include "currently broken but should work" features in test targets
- Bugs will be naturally discovered and fixed during UI E2E test **execution phase**

**Reason**:

- Research phase is for defining "what to test"
- Bug discovery and fixing proceeds in execution phase
- Test scenarios should be complete even with bugs (TDD mindset)

### 5. Define Test Scenarios

**Integrate Code Analysis + Browser Exploration Results**:

Mark source for each scenario:

- 📊 Found via code analysis
- 🎭 Found via browser exploration
- 📊🎭 Found via both

### 6. Verify Against Existing Tests

**After defining test scenarios, cross-check with existing E2E tests**:

- Compare defined scenarios with existing test cases (describe/test/it)
- Identify duplicates or overlapping coverage
- Mark scenarios as:
  - ✨ New scenario (not covered)
  - ✅ Already implemented (skip or note in docs)
  - 🔄 Partial coverage (extend existing test)

This prevents duplicate test implementation and helps identify coverage gaps accurately.

**Prioritize (Critical/High/Medium)**:

**Critical**: Core functionality where failure breaks the app

- User authentication
- Main feature workflows
- Data integrity operations

**High**: Important features used frequently

- Secondary workflows
- Common user interactions
- UI component behaviors

**Medium**: Nice-to-have features

- Visual regression
- Performance checks
- Accessibility tests

**Each Scenario Should Include**:

1. **Clear Description**: What is being tested
2. **Source**: 📊 Code Analysis | 🎭 Browser Exploration
3. **Coverage Status**: ✨ New | ✅ Already Implemented | 🔄 Partial
4. **Test Steps**: Detailed user actions
5. **Expected Results**: What should happen
6. **Verification Points**: What to check with MCP tools
7. **Priority Level**: Critical/High/Medium
8. **Dependencies**: Required setup or previous tests

### 7. Generate Completely Fresh Bilingual Documentation

**Files to Create**:

- `docs/e2e-ui/test-targets.ko.md` (Korean)
- `docs/e2e-ui/test-targets.md` (English)

**Document Synchronization**:

- Content identical except language
- Code examples, technical terms identical on both sides
- Language switch links at top of file

**Important - Existing Document Handling**:

- If existing docs exist, **completely delete and recreate**
- Do not reference past content (only reference test file cases)
- Always start from clean slate

---

## Key Rules

### Required Steps

1. **Read configuration first** - Extract from `playwright.config.ts` and `package.json`:
   - Base URL and port (webServer.url or use.baseURL)
   - Test directory (testDir or testMatch)
   - Framework (from package.json dependencies: next, react, vue, etc.)

2. **Browser exploration** - Use Playwright MCP for actual testing (code analysis alone misses UX issues)

3. **Fresh documentation** - Delete existing docs and create new ones. Do not merge with old content.

4. **Verify against existing tests** - Read test file cases (describe/test/it) to prevent duplicates

5. **Bilingual output** - Generate both ko.md and .md versions

### Guidelines

**Do:**

- Use values from playwright.config.ts (not hardcoded URLs)
- Adapt flexibly to project structure
- Group scenarios by page/feature
- Include both happy paths and error cases
- Mark source (📊 code analysis, 🎭 browser) and coverage status

**Avoid:**

- Skipping configuration file reading
- Referencing old docs (create fresh)
- Reporting bugs during research (save for execution phase)
- Vague or untestable scenarios
- Single language documentation

### 🎯 Test Scenario Quality

Each scenario should include:

1. **Clear Description**: What is being tested
2. **Source**: 📊 Code Analysis | 🎭 Browser Exploration
3. **Coverage Status**: ✨ New | ✅ Already Implemented | 🔄 Partial
4. **Test Steps**: Detailed user actions
5. **Expected Results**: What should happen
6. **Verification Points**: What to check with MCP tools
7. **Priority Level**: Critical/High/Medium
8. **Dependencies**: Required setup or previous tests
