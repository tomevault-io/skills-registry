# Issue Analysis Command

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

---

## Outline

1. **Parse User Input**:
   - Extract task description from $ARGUMENTS
   - Generate task name (2-4 words, English, hyphen-separated)

2. **Define Problem**:
   - Identify current situation, problem to solve, and goals

3. **Investigate Solutions**:
   - Research 2-4 approaches
   - Analyze pros/cons of each approach
   - Evaluate based on coding principles

4. **Final Selection**:
   - Choose the most appropriate approach
   - Clarify rejection reasons

5. **Generate Questions**:
   - Select **maximum 3** unclear items only
   - Use reasonable defaults + Assumptions for the rest

6. **Write Documents** (Dual Language):
   - Create `docs/work/WORK-{task-name}/analysis.ko.md` (Korean - for user reference)
   - Create `docs/work/WORK-{task-name}/analysis.md` (English - for agent consumption)
   - Use template structure below for both versions

## Key Rules

### 🎭 Anti-Bias Rules (CRITICAL)

**Core Principle**: "Be honest. Don't hide what exists, don't invent what doesn't."

1. **Analyze first, conclude later**: Complete analysis of all approaches before making selection
2. **Write what's true**: If A has 5 pros and B has 1, write exactly that
3. **Acknowledge trade-offs**: When rejecting an approach, state what you're giving up
4. **Use neutral language**: Avoid "obviously", "simply", "clearly" — use "may", "could", "might"

### 📝 Documentation Language

**CRITICAL**: You must generate **TWO versions** of all documents:

1. **Korean version** (`analysis.ko.md`): For user reference - written in Korean
2. **English version** (`analysis.md`): For agent consumption - written in English

**Both versions must contain identical structure and information**, only the language differs.

### 🎯 Balanced Analysis Principles

1. **Problem Definition**: Include concrete scenarios rather than abstract descriptions
2. **Solution Approach**: Consider both user perspective and technical feasibility
3. **Implementation Method**: Keep core changes concise, specify new dependencies
4. **Completion Criteria**: Separate feature verification and technical implementation

### ✅ Must Do

- Conclusion first (Executive Summary)
- **Include concrete scenarios** (Problem Definition) - 1-4 cases depending on issue
- **Explain user impact** (Solution Approach) - How will it be used?
- **Evaluate technical feasibility** (Solution Approach) - Why is it suitable?
- Evaluate solutions based on coding principles
- Concise bullet points
- **NEEDS CLARIFICATION maximum 3**
- Use reasonable defaults

### ❌ Must Not Do

- Verbose explanations
- Duplicate content
- **Only abstract problem definitions** (without concrete examples)
- **Excessive technical details** (going into implementation level)
- **Missing user perspective** (talking only about technology)
- Solutions that conflict with coding principles
- Infinite questions
- **Listing obvious things** (e.g., React state, JSON schema)

### 📋 Clarification Priority

**Priority**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details

### 🎯 Informed Guesses Principles

1. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps
2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section
3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers

## 📚 Good/Bad Examples

### Problem Definition Section

**❌ Bad (Abstract only)**:

```markdown
**Current Situation**: Problem occurs when using feature A
**Problem to Solve**: X is impossible
**Goal**: Make Y possible
```

**✅ Good (Concrete + Abstract)**:

```markdown
**Concrete Scenarios**:

- [Case 1: What problem occurs in specific situation]
- [Case 2: Another real situation]

**Current Problem**: [What is generally impossible]
**Goal**: [What becomes possible with this task]
```

---

### Solution Investigation Section

**❌ Bad (Technical only or User only)**:

```markdown
### Approach 1: Use API X

**Method**: Call `function(param, flag: false)`

**Cons**: Complex testing
```

Or

```markdown
### Approach 1: Add Option

**User Experience**: Click checkbox → behavior changes
**Pros**: Simple
**Cons**: Limited
```

**✅ Good (Balanced explanation)**:

```markdown
### Approach 1: [Approach Name]

**Method**:

- [How to solve - how user experiences it and how it works technically]
- If needed: Concrete usage flow (1→2→3)
- If needed: Core technical method

**Pros**:

- [Why it's good from user/technical perspective]

**Cons**:

- [What limitations or trade-offs exist]
```

---

### Completion Criteria Section

**❌ Bad (Technical implementation only)**:
