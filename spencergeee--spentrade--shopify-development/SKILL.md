## ROUTING: What to Build

**IF user wants to integrate external services OR build merchant tools OR charge for features:**
→ Build an **App** (see `references/app-development.md`)

**IF user wants to customize checkout OR add admin UI OR create POS actions OR implement discount rules:**
→ Build an **Extension** (see `references/extensions.md`)

**IF user wants to customize storefront design OR modify product/collection pages:**
→ Build a **Theme** (see `references/themes.md`)

**IF user needs both backend logic AND storefront UI:**
→ Build **App + Theme Extension** combination
