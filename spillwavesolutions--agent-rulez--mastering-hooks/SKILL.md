## Overview

RuleZ is a **high-performance AI policy engine** that intercepts AI coding assistant events and executes configured actions. It works across multiple platforms through adapter-based event translation.

```
User Prompt --> AI Assistant --> RuleZ Binary --> [Match Rules] --> Execute Actions
                    |                                 |
                    v                                 v
              PreToolUse                       inject/run/block
              PostToolUse                      context/validation
              BeforeAgent
              PermissionRequest
```

**Supported platforms**:
- **Claude Code** (native) - Full event support
- **Gemini CLI** - Via adapter with dual-fire events
- **GitHub Copilot** - Via adapter
- **OpenCode** - Via adapter with dual-fire events

**System components**:
- **RuleZ Binary** (Rust): Fast, deterministic hook execution at runtime
- **hooks.yaml**: Declarative configuration defining rules, matchers, and actions
- **Platform Adapters**: Translate platform-specific events to unified RuleZ event types
- **This Skill**: Intelligent assistant for setup, debugging, and optimization

```

## Capabilities

### 1. Install & Initialize RuleZ

**Use when**: Setting up RuleZ for the first time in a project or user-wide.

**Checklist**:
1. Verify RuleZ binary is installed: `rulez --version`
2. Initialize configuration: `rulez init` (creates `.claude/hooks.yaml`)
3. Register with Claude Code: `rulez install` (project-local) or `rulez install --global`
4. Validate configuration: `rulez validate`
5. Verify installation: Check `.claude/settings.json` for hook entries

**Reference**: [cli-commands.md](references/cli-commands.md)

---

### 2. Create Hook Rules

**Use when**: Adding new behaviors like context injection, command validation, or workflow automation.

**Checklist**:
1. Identify the event type (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, BeforeAgent, etc.)
2. Define matchers (tools, extensions, directories, patterns)
3. Choose action type (inject, run, block, require_fields)
4. Write the rule in hooks.yaml
5. Validate: `rulez validate`
6. Test with: `rulez debug <event> --tool <tool_name>`

**Rule anatomy**:
```yaml
rules:
  - name: rule-name           # kebab-case identifier
    matchers:
      operations: [PreToolUse]  # When to trigger
      tools: [Write, Edit]    # What to match
      extensions: [.py]       # Optional: file filters
    actions:
      inject: .claude/context/python-standards.md  # What to do
```

**Reference**: [hooks-yaml-schema.md](references/hooks-yaml-schema.md) | [rule-patterns.md](references/rule-patterns.md)

---

### 3. Explain Configuration

**Use when**: Understanding what existing hooks do, why they exist, or how they interact.

**Checklist**:
1. Run `rulez explain rule <rule-name>` for specific rule analysis
2. Run `rulez explain rules` for full configuration overview
3. Check rule precedence (first match wins within same event)
4. Identify potential conflicts or overlaps

**Example output** from `rulez explain rule python-standards`:
```
Rule: python-standards
Event: PreToolUse
Triggers when: Write or Edit tool used on .py files
Action: Injects content from .claude/context/python-standards.md
```

**Reference**: [cli-commands.md](references/cli-commands.md)

---

### 4. Troubleshoot Hook Issues

**Use when**: Hooks not firing, unexpected behavior, or error messages.

**Diagnostic checklist**:
1. **Validate config**: `rulez validate` - catches YAML/schema errors
2. **Check registration**: `cat .claude/settings.json | grep hooks`
3. **Enable debug logging**: `rulez debug PreToolUse --tool Write --verbose`
4. **Check logs**: `rulez logs --limit 20`
5. **Verify file paths**: Ensure all `path:` references exist

**Common issues**:

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| Hook never fires | Event/matcher mismatch | Use `rulez debug` to trace matching |
| "file not found" | Invalid path in action | Check relative paths from project root |
| Context not injected | Script returns invalid JSON | Validate script output format |
| Permission denied | Script not executable | `chmod +x script.sh` |
| Event not firing on Gemini | Wrong event name | Check [platform-adapters.md](references/platform-adapters.md) for mappings |

**Reference**: [troubleshooting-guide.md](references/troubleshooting-guide.md)

---

### 5. Optimize Configuration

**Use when**: Too many rules, slow execution, or complex maintenance.

**Optimization checklist**:
1. Consolidate overlapping rules with broader matchers
2. Use `enabled_when` for conditional rules instead of duplicates
3. Move shared context to reusable markdown files
4. Order rules by frequency (most common first)
5. Use `block` early to short-circuit unnecessary processing

**Reference**: [rule-patterns.md](references/rule-patterns.md)

---

### 6. Multi-Platform Setup

**Use when**: Configuring RuleZ to work with Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, or OpenCode in addition to Claude Code.

**Key concepts**:
- RuleZ uses **platform adapters** to translate each platform's native events into unified RuleZ event types
- Write rules using RuleZ event types (e.g., `PreToolUse`) — adapters handle translation automatically
- Some platforms fire **dual events** (e.g., Gemini's `BeforeAgent` fires both `BeforeAgent` and `UserPromptSubmit`)

**Checklist**:
1. Install RuleZ: `rulez install`
2. Write rules using standard RuleZ event types
3. Test with `rulez debug <event>` to verify matching
4. Review [platform-adapters.md](references/platform-adapters.md) for platform-specific event mappings

**Reference**: [platform-adapters.md](references/platform-adapters.md)

---

## When NOT to Use This Skill

- **Simple Claude Code configuration**: Use `settings.json` directly for basic permissions
- **One-time context injection**: Just paste into your prompt
- **Dynamic runtime decisions**: RuleZ is deterministic; use MCP servers for complex logic
