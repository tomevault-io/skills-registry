# Automating Excel (JXA-first, AppleScript discovery)

## Relationship to the macOS automation skill
- Standalone for Excel, but aligned with `automating-mac-apps` patterns.
- Use `automating-mac-apps` for permissions, shell, and UI scripting guidance.
- **PyXA Installation:** To use PyXA examples in this skill, see the installation instructions in `automating-mac-apps` skill (PyXA Installation section).

## Core Framing
- Excel AppleScript dictionary is AppleScript-first; use Script Editor for discovery.
- JXA is the production language for logic and data processing.
- Collections are specifiers; read via methods, set via assignments.
- Handle errors from Excel operations using try/catch blocks and Application error checking.

## Workflow (default)
1) [ ] Discover dictionary terms in Script Editor (Excel).
2) [ ] Prototype a minimal AppleScript command.
3) [ ] Port to JXA and add defensive checks.
4) [ ] Use bulk read/write (2D arrays) for performance.
5) [ ] Use VBA `run()` when dictionary coverage is missing.

## Validation Steps
- Test with empty documents to verify error handling
- Verify data integrity after batch operations
- Check Excel UI responsiveness after automation runs
- Log errors with specific Excel object paths for debugging

## Examples

**Basic workbook read:**
```javascript
const Excel = Application('Microsoft Excel');
const workbook = Excel.workbooks[0];
const worksheet = workbook.worksheets['Sheet1'];
const range = worksheet.ranges['A1:B10'];
const data = range.value();  // Returns 2D array
```

**Bulk write with performance toggle:**
```javascript
Excel.screenUpdating = false;
Excel.calculation = 'manual';
try {
  const range = worksheet.ranges['C1:D100'];
  range.value = my2DArray;
} finally {
  Excel.calculate();
  Excel.screenUpdating = true;
}
```

**VBA escape hatch:**
```javascript
Excel.run('MyMacro', {arg1: 'value', arg2: 123});  // Calls VBA subroutine
```

## When Not to Use
- For general macOS automation without Excel involvement
- When AppleScript alone suffices (no JXA logic needed)
- For Excel tasks requiring complex UI interactions (use `automating-mac-apps` for that)
- When cross-platform compatibility is required
