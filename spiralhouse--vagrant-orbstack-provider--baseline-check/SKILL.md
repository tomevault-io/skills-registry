# Baseline Check Skill

## Purpose

This skill maintains code quality throughout development by:
- Establishing baseline quality metrics before development
- Detecting regressions after code changes
- Tracking quality trends over time
- Providing clear feedback on code health

## When to Use

Invoke this skill:

1. **Before starting development work** - Establish current baseline
2. **After completing changes** - Check for regressions
3. **After GREEN phase** - Verify tests exist and pass
4. **After REFACTOR phase** - Verify tests still pass after refactoring
5. **Before committing code** - Verify quality standards
6. **When explicitly requested** - User asks for quality check, baseline, or regression analysis
7. **During code review** - Validate changes meet quality bar

## How to Execute

### Step 1: Run the Baseline Check

Execute the wrapper script (from project root):

```bash
./.claude/skills/baseline-check/baseline-check.sh
```

The script will:
- Run RuboCop (if available)
- Run RSpec (if available)
- Generate a timestamped JSON report
- Output the filepath to the generated report

**Expected output:**
```
Running baseline checks...
✓ RuboCop check completed
✓ RSpec check completed
Baseline saved to: .claude/baseline/main-20251117-084523.json
```

**Error handling:**
- If script fails, report the error to user
- If tools are unavailable, the JSON will reflect `"available": false`
- Empty test suite is acceptable (allows pre-implementation baselines)

### Step 2: Read the Results

Parse the generated JSON file to extract metrics:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-11-17T08:45:23Z",
  "branch": "main",
  "commit": "168d4ea",
  "checks": {
    "rubocop": {
      "available": true,
      "status": "passed",
      "files_inspected": 15,
      "offenses": 3,
      "offenses_by_severity": {
        "convention": 2,
        "warning": 1,
        "error": 0,
        "fatal": 0
      },
      "execution_time": 1.45
    },
    "rspec": {
      "available": true,
      "status": "passed",
      "examples": 42,
      "failures": 0,
      "pending": 2,
      "execution_time": 3.21
    }
  },
  "overall_status": "passed",
  "summary": "All checks passed"
}
```

### Step 3: Find Previous Baseline (If Any)

Search for previous baselines on the current branch:

```bash
ls -t .claude/baseline/{current-branch}-*.json 2>/dev/null | head -2
```

This returns the two most recent baseline files (including the one just created).

**Scenarios:**
- **One file returned**: This is the first baseline (nothing to compare)
- **Two files returned**: Compare the newest against the previous
- **Zero files returned**: This should not happen if Step 1 succeeded

### Step 4: Compare Baselines

If a previous baseline exists, compare key metrics:

#### RuboCop Comparison

| Metric | Check |
|--------|-------|
| Total offenses | `current.offenses` vs `previous.offenses` |
| Convention offenses | `current.offenses_by_severity.convention` vs `previous` |
| Warning offenses | `current.offenses_by_severity.warning` vs `previous` |
| Error offenses | `current.offenses_by_severity.error` vs `previous` |
| Fatal offenses | `current.offenses_by_severity.fatal` vs `previous` |
| Files inspected | `current.files_inspected` vs `previous.files_inspected` |

**Classifications:**
- **Improvement**: Offenses decreased, files inspected increased
- **Regression**: Offenses increased (especially errors/fatals)
- **Stable**: No change in offense counts

#### RSpec Comparison

| Metric | Check |
|--------|-------|
| Test count | `current.examples` vs `previous.examples` |
| Failures | `current.failures` vs `previous.failures` |
| Pending tests | `current.pending` vs `previous.pending` |

**Classifications:**
- **Improvement**: More tests, fewer failures, fewer pending
- **Regression**: New failures introduced, test count decreased
- **Stable**: Metrics unchanged or expected changes (e.g., pending tests fixed)

### Step 5: Report Findings

Provide a clear, actionable summary.

#### Report Format: First Baseline

When no previous baseline exists:

```
Baseline Quality Check - Initial Assessment
==========================================

Branch: main
Commit: 168d4ea
Timestamp: 2025-11-17T08:45:23Z

RuboCop Analysis:
  Status: passed
  Files Inspected: 15
  Total Offenses: 3
    - Convention: 2
    - Warning: 1
    - Error: 0
    - Fatal: 0

RSpec Analysis:
  Status: passed
  Examples: 42
  Failures: 0
  Pending: 2

Overall Status: PASSED ✓

This is the first baseline for this branch. Future checks will compare against these metrics.

Baseline file: .claude/baseline/main-20251117-084523.json
```

#### Report Format: Comparison with Previous Baseline

When comparing against previous baseline:

```
Baseline Quality Check - Regression Analysis
============================================

Branch: feat/ssh-integration
Commit: abc123d
Timestamp: 2025-11-17T09:15:42Z
Previous: 2025-11-17T08:45:23Z

RuboCop Changes:
  Status: passed → passed
  Files Inspected: 15 → 18 (+3)
  Total Offenses: 3 → 5 (+2) ⚠️ REGRESSION
    - Convention: 2 → 3 (+1)
    - Warning: 1 → 2 (+1)
    - Error: 0 → 0 (stable)
    - Fatal: 0 → 0 (stable)

RSpec Changes:
  Status: passed → passed
  Examples: 42 → 48 (+6) ✓ IMPROVEMENT
  Failures: 0 → 0 (stable)
  Pending: 2 → 1 (-1) ✓ IMPROVEMENT

Overall Status: PASSED (with quality regressions)

FINDINGS:
⚠️  2 new RuboCop offenses introduced
✓  6 new tests added
✓  1 pending test resolved

RECOMMENDATION:
Address the new RuboCop offenses before committing. Run 'bundle exec rubocop' for details.

Baseline file: .claude/baseline/feat-ssh-integration-20251117-091542.json
Previous baseline: .claude/baseline/feat-ssh-integration-20251117-084523.json
```

#### Report Format: Critical Regression

When significant regressions occur:

```
Baseline Quality Check - CRITICAL REGRESSIONS DETECTED
======================================================

Branch: feat/provider-class
Commit: def456e
Timestamp: 2025-11-17T10:30:15Z

⚠️  CRITICAL ISSUES DETECTED ⚠️

RuboCop Changes:
  Status: passed → FAILED ❌
  Total Offenses: 3 → 12 (+9) ❌ CRITICAL REGRESSION
    - Error: 0 → 2 (+2) ❌ NEW ERRORS
    - Fatal: 0 → 1 (+1) ❌ NEW FATAL

RSpec Changes:
  Status: passed → FAILED ❌
  Examples: 42 → 42 (stable)
  Failures: 0 → 3 (+3) ❌ NEW FAILURES

Overall Status: FAILED ❌

CRITICAL FINDINGS:
❌ 1 fatal RuboCop offense (code will not run correctly)
❌ 2 error-level RuboCop offenses (serious code issues)
❌ 3 failing tests (broken functionality)

REQUIRED ACTIONS:
1. Run 'bundle exec rubocop' to see fatal/error details
2. Run 'bundle exec rspec' to see test failures
3. Fix all critical issues before proceeding
4. Re-run baseline check to verify fixes

DO NOT COMMIT until these critical issues are resolved.

Baseline file: .claude/baseline/feat-provider-class-20251117-103015.json
```

## Interpretation Guidelines

### Status Indicators

Use these indicators in reports:
- ✓ `IMPROVEMENT` - Metrics got better
- ⚠️ `REGRESSION` - Metrics got worse (non-critical)
- ❌ `CRITICAL REGRESSION` - Serious issues (errors, fatals, test failures)
- `(stable)` - No change
- `PASSED` - All checks passed
- `FAILED` - One or more checks failed

### Severity Assessment

**Critical (❌):**
- RuboCop fatal offenses
- RuboCop error offenses
- RSpec test failures
- Overall status changed to "failed"

**Warning (⚠️):**
- Increased convention offenses
- Increased warning offenses
- Decreased test count
- Increased pending tests

**Positive (✓):**
- Decreased offenses
- Increased test count
- Decreased pending tests
- Resolved failures

### Recommendations

Based on findings, provide actionable guidance:

**No regressions:**
- "Quality baseline looks good. Proceed with confidence."

**Minor regressions:**
- "Consider addressing new offenses before committing."
- "Run 'bundle exec rubocop -a' to auto-fix some issues."

**Critical regressions:**
- "DO NOT COMMIT until critical issues are resolved."
- "Run diagnostic commands to investigate failures."
- "Re-run baseline check after fixes to verify."

## Edge Cases

### No Tools Available

If both RuboCop and RSpec are unavailable:

```
Baseline Quality Check - Tools Not Available
============================================

Neither RuboCop nor RSpec are available in this environment.

To enable quality checks:
1. Run 'bundle install' to install dependencies
2. Ensure RuboCop and RSpec gems are in Gemfile
3. Re-run this baseline check

Baseline file: .claude/baseline/main-20251117-084523.json
```

### Empty Test Suite

If no tests exist yet (pre-implementation):

```
Baseline Quality Check - Pre-Implementation
===========================================

RuboCop: passed (3 files inspected, 0 offenses)
RSpec: No tests exist yet

This appears to be a pre-implementation baseline. As you add tests,
future checks will track test coverage growth.

Baseline file: .claude/baseline/feat-new-feature-20251117-084523.json
```

### Branch Comparison

If comparing across branches (e.g., feature branch vs main):

```
Note: Previous baseline is from a different branch or significantly
older commit. Comparison may include expected differences from other work.
```

## TDD Integration

baseline-check plays a critical role in TDD workflow:

**After GREEN Phase (before REFACTOR)**:
- Verify tests exist for new implementation (test count must increase)
- Confirm all tests are passing (0 failures required)
- Measure test coverage increase compared to pre-GREEN baseline
- Flag if implementation added code without corresponding tests
- Confirm implementation met minimum requirements (tests green)
- Establish pre-REFACTOR baseline for comparison

**After REFACTOR Phase**:
- Confirm all tests STILL pass after refactoring (no regressions)
- Verify test count unchanged (refactoring doesn't need new tests)
- Compare RuboCop metrics (offenses should decrease or stay stable)
- Verify no test coverage regression from refactoring changes

**Quality Gate**:
- No implementation accepted without tests
- Test count should increase with new features (GREEN phase)
- Test pass rate must remain 100% (always)
- REFACTOR cannot introduce test failures or reduce coverage

## Best Practices

1. **Run before starting work** - Establishes clean baseline
2. **Run after each significant change** - Catches issues early
3. **Run after GREEN phase** - Verify tests exist and pass
4. **Run after REFACTOR phase** - Confirm tests still pass
5. **Don't ignore warnings** - Small regressions accumulate
6. **Celebrate improvements** - Acknowledge quality improvements
7. **Block on critical issues** - Never commit with fatals/errors/failures

## Technical Notes

- Baseline files are timestamped: `{branch}-{YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS}.json`
- Files are stored in `.claude/baseline/` (gitignored)
- Script exits 0 even if checks fail (allows baseline capture)
- Execution times are informational only (don't compare)
- Branch name is sanitized (slashes replaced with dashes)

## Example Workflow

**Starting new feature:**
```
1. User: "I want to add SSH support"
2. Claude: Runs baseline-check skill → establishes baseline
3. Claude: Reports current state (e.g., "15 files, 0 offenses, 42 passing tests")
4. Claude: Proceeds with implementation
5. Claude: After implementation, runs baseline-check again
6. Claude: Compares results, reports findings
7. Claude: If regressions, recommends fixes before commit
```

## Output Files

The skill reads but does not create files (wrapper script creates them):
- Input: `.claude/baseline/{branch}-{timestamp}.json`
- Format: See Step 2 for JSON structure

## Success Criteria

The skill succeeds when it:
- Executes the wrapper script without errors
- Reads and parses the JSON results
- Compares against previous baseline (if available)
- Provides clear, actionable report
- Highlights any regressions prominently
- Guides next steps based on findings

The skill fails when:
- Wrapper script cannot be executed
- JSON file cannot be read or parsed
- Report is unclear or incomplete
