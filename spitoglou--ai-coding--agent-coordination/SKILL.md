name: agent-coordination
description: Coordination protocol for main Claude Code agent. Explicit user invocation required ("mobilize agents", "coordinate", "check registry"). Provides agent orchestration, registry management, and handoff protocols. Subagents never access this - main agent provides context in task prompts. Use when this capability is needed.

# Agent Coordination Protocol

## Core Principle

**Build on existing work. Never recreate.**

---

## Two Registries

The system maintains two distinct registries:

| Registry | Purpose | Updated When |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| `_registry.md` | Index of completed work (reports) | After each agent produces a report |
| `_tech-debt.md` | Tracked improvements to address later | When issues are deferred, incidents occur |

**Decision rule:**
- **Registry** → "What work has been done?" (past/present state)
- **Tech Debt** → "What do we need to fix later?" (future work)

---

## 4-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Check Prior Work

Before invoking any agent, check what already exists:

```bash
# Check registry for recent reports
cat .claude/reports/_registry.md | head -50

# Check if archiving needed (>50 entries)
ENTRIES=$(grep -c "^- .*|.*|" .claude/reports/_registry.md 2>/dev/null || echo 0)
[ "$ENTRIES" -gt 50 ] && echo "⚠️ Registry has $ENTRIES entries - suggest /archive"

# Check relevant tech debt (if working on that area)
grep -i "[area-keyword]" .claude/reports/_tech-debt.md
```

**Read relevant reports** before proceeding to understand current state.

### Step 2: Context Injection

Subagents NEVER read registry or reports directly. Main agent provides ALL context:

```
Task(agent-name, "
[Objective]

Context from prior work:
- [Report X]: [key decisions/findings]
- [Tech debt TD-NNN]: [relevant constraint]
- Current state: [what exists now]

Requirements:
- [Specific deliverables]

Output location:
- Report: .claude/reports/[category]/[name]-YYYYMMDD.md
")
```

### Step 3: Sequencing

**Rule:** Will Agent B need Agent A's output?
- YES → Sequential (verify between each)
- NO → Parallel

### Step 4: Verify and Update

After each agent completes:

```bash
# Verify deliverables exist
uv run .claude/skills/agent-coordination/scripts/verify.py "[category]" "[name]" "[date]"
```

**Then update registries:**

1. **Always:** Add report to `_registry.md`
   ```
   - [report-name] | [Status] | [1-line summary]
   ```

2. **If issues deferred:** Add to `_tech-debt.md`
   ```
   - [ ] **TD-NNN**: [Description]
     - **Impact:** [Critical|High|Medium|Low]
     - **Source:** [report-name or postmortem-name]
   ```

---

## Task() Invocation Protocol

The `Task(agent-name, "prompt")` pattern invokes specialized subagents:

### Syntax
```
Task(agent-name, "
[Objective]

Context from prior work:
- [Key findings from reports]

Requirements:
- [Specific deliverables]

Output location:
- Report: .claude/reports/[category]/[name]-YYYYMMDD.md
")
```

### Parameters
| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `agent-name` | Must match a file in `.claude/agents/` (without .md) |
| `prompt` | Full context and instructions - agents have no prior context |

### Execution Model
- **Parallel:** Independent tasks with no dependencies
- **Sequential:** When Agent B needs Agent A's output
- **Background:** Use `run_in_background: true` for long tasks

### Context Rules
1. Subagents NEVER access registry or prior reports directly
2. Main agent MUST inject all relevant context into prompt
3. Include specific file paths, not vague references
4. Specify exact output location for reports

## Report Categories

All reports go to `.claude/reports/[category]/`:

| Category | Folder | Use For | Typical Agents |
|----------|--------|---------|----------------|
| analysis | `analysis/` | Research, EDA, data exploration | data-engineer, data-viz |
| arch | `arch/` | Architecture decisions, ADRs, system design | architect, rfc |
| bugs | `bugs/` | Bug reports, root cause analysis | code-quality (debug) |
| commits | `commits/` | Commit summaries, changelog entries | devops (git) |
| design | `design/` | UI/UX reviews, design specs | ux-designer |
| exec | `exec/` | Execution logs, command outputs | devops |
| handoff | `handoff/` | Agent coordination, context transfers | (main agent) |
| implementation | `implementation/` | Implementation plans, code specs | backend, frontend |
| review | `review/` | Code reviews, PR reviews | code-quality (review) |
| tests | `tests/` | Test plans, test results, coverage | test-engineer, qa |
| security | `security/` | Security scans, threat models, compliance | security-engineer |
| sre | `sre/` | SLOs, postmortems, capacity plans | sre |
| rfc | `rfc/` | Design proposals, RFCs | rfc |
| ci | `ci/` | CI pipeline results | (bash/devops) |
| archive | `archive/` | Old reports (moved, not deleted) | (archive script) |

**Naming convention:** `[category]-[topic]-YYYYMMDD.md`

---

## Agent Reference

| Agent | Modes | Primary Output Category |
|-------|-------|------------------------|
| code-quality | review, debug, qa-strategy | review/, bugs/, tests/ |
| test-engineer | - | tests/ |
| architect | system, pipeline | arch/ |
| security-engineer | scan, threat-model, compliance | security/ |
| sre | reliability-review, incident, capacity | sre/ |

| ml-engineer | train, evaluate, deploy | analysis/, implementation/ |
| lrl-nlp-expert | - | analysis/ |
| ux-designer | design, copy | design/ |

## When to Update Tech Debt

Tech debt entries are created when:

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Code review finds issue, won't fix now | Add as Medium/Low priority |
| Postmortem identifies prevention action | Add as Critical/High priority |
| RFC defers a requirement | Add as Medium priority |
| Security scan finds non-blocking issue | Add as High priority |
| Manual identification | Use `/debt add` |

**Format in `_tech-debt.md`:**
```markdown
- [ ] **TD-NNN**: Brief description
  - **Impact:** Critical | High | Medium | Low
  - **Source:** [link to originating report]
  - **Created:** YYYY-MM-DD
```

---

## OpenSpec Integration

The agent coordination system works alongside OpenSpec for spec-driven development.

### When Agent Findings Become OpenSpec Proposals

Agent findings that require code changes SHOULD become OpenSpec proposals:

| Agent Finding | Action |
|---------------|--------|
| Critical security vulnerability | Create OpenSpec change proposal |
| Architecture recommendation requiring refactor | Feed into OpenSpec `design.md` |
| Test gap in critical path (significant) | Create OpenSpec change proposal |
| Performance issue requiring refactor | Create OpenSpec change proposal |
| Minor issues, style, small fixes | Track as tech debt only |

### Linking Reports to OpenSpec

When agent work relates to an existing OpenSpec change:

1. **Reference in report header:**
   ```markdown
   **OpenSpec Change:** [change-id](../../openspec/changes/[change-id]/)
   ```

2. **Update tech debt with OpenSpec link:**
   ```markdown
   - [ ] **TD-NNN**: Description
     - **OpenSpec:** [change-id](../../openspec/changes/[change-id]/)
   ```

3. **Cross-reference in OpenSpec tasks.md:**
   ```markdown
   ## 3. Verification
   - [x] 3.1 Security scan - see `.claude/reports/security/[report].md`
   ```

### Report Categories → OpenSpec Mapping

| Report Category | OpenSpec Relationship |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| `rfc/` | May become OpenSpec proposal if proposing changes |
| `arch/` | Can feed into OpenSpec `design.md` files |
| `review/` | Evidence for OpenSpec pre-archive quality checks |
| `security/` | May trigger OpenSpec security-related proposals |
| `tests/` | Verification for OpenSpec implementation |

### OpenSpec Pre-Archive Verification

Before archiving an OpenSpec change, consider running verification agents:

```bash
# For security-sensitive changes (auth, data handling, input validation)
Task(security-engineer, "Scan [affected files] for OWASP vulnerabilities")

# For all changes with significant new code
Task(code-quality, "Review [affected files] for correctness and maintainability")

# For changes affecting critical user paths
Task(test-engineer, "Verify test coverage for [affected functionality]")
```

**Link verification reports** in the archived change's `tasks.md`.
