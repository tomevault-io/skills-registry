## Output Guidelines

- Match complexity to learner level (ask if unsure)
- Use concrete examples before abstract principles
- Build on prior knowledge
- Include practice opportunities
- Provide immediate feedback on exercises
- Use analogies from familiar domains

## Chaining Suggestions

- After `explain_terms` → offer `create_quiz` to test understanding
- After `create_reading_plan` → offer to explain first topic
- After `create_quiz` → offer `analyze_answers` for submitted responses
