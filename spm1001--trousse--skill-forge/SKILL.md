# Skill Forge

Unified skill development toolkit. Supersedes `skill-creator` — combines its creation process with quality validation, description optimization, and testing.

**Iron Law: Skills must be discovered to be useful.** The description is everything.

## When to Use

- Before writing or editing any SKILL.md file
- When creating a new skill from scratch
- When improving an existing skill's discovery rate
- When validating skill quality before deployment
- When scanning a skill/repo before sharing publicly

## Boundaries

- One-off instructions belong in CLAUDE.md, not a skill
- Simple tool usage Claude already knows
- Tasks that don't repeat across sessions

## Why This Skill Exists

Even when the task seems simple, forge adds value you can't get from training alone:
- **CSO scoring** catches description patterns that look fine but won't trigger discovery
- **Register checks** ensure skills create a calm, productive emotional baseline
- **Lint validation** catches structural issues (naming, frontmatter, section depth) before they cause silent failures
- **Small description edits** are exactly where CSO scoring matters most — a word change can shift discovery rates

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Initialize new skill
scripts/init_skill.py my-skill --path ~/.claude/skills

# 2. Edit SKILL.md (see Workflow below)

# 3. Lint for structure issues
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/lint_skill.py /path/to/skill

# 4. Score description quality (CSO)
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/score_description.py /path/to/skill

# 5. Test with subagent (optional but recommended)
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/test_skill.py /path/to/skill

# 6. Package for distribution (optional)
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/package_skill.py /path/to/skill
```

## Workflow: 6-Step Process

### Step 1: Understand with Concrete Examples

**Goal:** Know exactly how the skill will be used before building.

Questions to answer:
- "What would a user say that should trigger this skill?"
- "Can you give examples of how this skill would be used?"
- "What should happen after the skill triggers?"

**Exit criterion:** Clear list of trigger phrases and expected behaviors.

### Step 2: Plan Reusable Contents

Analyze each example to identify:

| Content Type | When to Include | Example |
|--------------|-----------------|---------|
| `scripts/` | Same code rewritten repeatedly | `rotate_pdf.py` |
| `references/` | Documentation Claude should reference | `schema.md` |
| `assets/` | Files used in output (not loaded) | `template.pptx` |

**Exit criterion:** List of scripts/references/assets to create.

### Step 3: Initialize

```bash
scripts/init_skill.py <skill-name> --path <directory>
```

Creates SKILL.md template, example scripts/references/assets. Delete unneeded files.

### Step 4: Edit

**Order matters:**
1. Create scripts/references/assets first
2. Test scripts actually work
3. Write SKILL.md last (it references the resources)

#### SKILL.md Structure

```yaml
---
name: kebab-case-name
description: [See CSO Patterns below]
---
```

**Body sections:**
- Core principle / Iron Law
- When to Use / When NOT to Use
- Workflow with success criteria
- Anti-patterns
- Quick reference
- Integration with other skills

#### Naming

- Lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens only. Max 64 chars.
- **Must match directory name exactly.**
- Gerund or capability form preferred.

| Good | Bad | Why |
|------|-----|-----|
| `systematic-debugging` | `debug` | Verb, not capability |
| `workspace-fluency` | `utils` | Generic, no information |
| `test-driven-development` | `pdf-helper` | "helper" is meaningless |
| `desired-outcomes` | `my-skill` | Doesn't describe purpose |

#### CSO Patterns

**The description determines discovery.** Pattern: `[ACTION VERB] + [LIFECYCLE CONTEXT] + [METHOD/VALUE PREVIEW]`

**Best: Clear lifecycle positioning with specific context**
```yaml
description: Orchestrates skill development — required before writing or editing any SKILL.md file. Unified 6-step workflow with automated validation, CSO scoring, and subagent testing.
```
Why: third-person verb, "required before" positioning, specific context ("any SKILL.md file"), method preview.

**Good: Specific trigger with method preview**
```yaml
description: Guides systematic debugging before proposing fixes. 4-phase framework (root cause, pattern analysis, hypothesis testing, implementation) ensures understanding before solutions. Triggers on 'test failing', 'unexpected behavior', 'debug this'.
```
Why: specific trigger + lifecycle positioning + method preview + value statement.

**Good: Natural phrase triggers**
```yaml
description: Coaches on outcome quality. Triggers on 'check my outcomes', 'is this a good outcome', 'review my Todoist' when discussing strategic work.
```
Why: explicit phrases in quotes, context qualifier.

**Good: Scope boundaries to prevent over-triggering**
```yaml
description: Advanced data analysis for CSV files — statistical modelling, regression, clustering. For simple data exploration, use data-viz skill instead.
```
Why: clear scope boundary in description steers Claude before body loads.

**When to add scope boundaries:**
- Skill overlaps with another skill's domain
- Skill triggers on common words that appear in unrelated requests
- Users report the skill loading when it shouldn't

**Patterns to improve:**

| Pattern | Problem | Better |
|---------|---------|--------|
| "Helps with..." | Vague, no trigger | Specific phrases in quotes |
| "Use when creating..." | Too generic | "Required before..." or "Orchestrates..." |
| No timing condition | Claude treats invocation as optional | Add lifecycle positioning: "before", "first" |
| Generic actions | Claude "knows" without loading | Domain-specific phrases |
| Command doesn't name skill | Skill not discoverable | "**Invoke the `name` skill**" |
| Over-triggers on related topics | Loads when it shouldn't | Add scope boundary in description |

Run `scripts/score_description.py` to validate. See `references/cso-guide.md` for full guidance.

### Step 5: Validate

```bash
# Automated lint (structure, naming, frontmatter)
scripts/lint_skill.py <skill-path>

# CSO score (description quality)
scripts/score_description.py <skill-path>

# Subagent test (discovery + workflow)
scripts/test_skill.py <skill-path>
```

All checks should pass before Step 6.

### Step 6: Package (Optional)

```bash
scripts/package_skill.py <skill-path> [output-dir]
```

Creates `.skill` file (zip format) for distribution.

## Skill Patterns

See `references/skill-patterns.md` for full taxonomy. Summary:

| Type | Key Feature | Description Pattern |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Process** | Phases with gates | Lifecycle positioning (before/first) |
| **Fluency** | Tool best practices | Specific trigger phrases |
| **Coaching** | Quality criteria | Natural language triggers |
| **Gate** | Checklist validation | Required before... |
| **Skill+CLI** | Orchestrates CLI tool | Required before any `cli` command |

### Skill+CLI Pattern (Most Powerful)

When skill orchestrates a CLI tool. See `references/skill-cli-pattern.md` for full template.

```markdown
# {skill-name}
Orchestrates {domain} using `{cli}` command.
## CLI Reference
## Workflows
## When Skill Extends CLI (coaching, quality criteria)
## Error Recovery
```

### What High-Invocation Skills Share

1. **Clear lifecycle positioning** — "before", "first", "required"
2. **Specific trigger phrases** in quotes
3. **Method preview** that's actionable
4. **Clear pitfall documentation** that catches mistakes
5. **Integration points** that compose with other skills
6. **Calm, craft-oriented register** — constraints as quality standards

### What Low-Invocation Skills Suffer From

1. Generic "Use when..." descriptions
2. Vague propositions ("helps with", "guides", "assists")
3. Missing lifecycle positioning
4. Documenting what Claude already knows

## Common Mistakes

### Discovery

| Mistake | Symptom | Better |
|---------|---------|--------|
| "Use when creating..." | Claude bypasses skill | "Required before..." |
| "Helps with..." | Skill never invoked | Specific trigger phrases |
| No lifecycle positioning | Claude treats invocation as optional | Add "before", "first", "required" |
| Generic actions | Claude "knows" without loading | Domain-specific phrases |

### Structure

| Mistake | Symptom | Better |
|---------|---------|--------|
| SKILL.md > 500 lines | Token bloat | Split into references/ |
| Name doesn't match dir | Skill not found | Keep synchronized |
| Deeply nested refs | Discovery fails | One level deep max |

### Content

| Mistake | Symptom | Better |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Explaining known things | Wastes tokens | Domain-specific only |
| Magic constants | Unclear reasoning | Justify all values |
| Many options, no default | Analysis paralysis | Recommend one path |
| Heavy threat/urgency language | Corner-cutting, concealment | Frame constraints as craft standards |
