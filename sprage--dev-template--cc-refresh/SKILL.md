# AI Context Refresh

Audit all shared AI, Codex, and Claude Code artifacts for staleness, score guidance quality, report findings,
propose fixes, and execute approved changes. This is the maintenance counterpart to `/cc-setup`.

**This skill modifies files.** It updates `AI.md`, `.ai/`, `.agents/`, `.codex/`, `AGENTS.md`, `CODEX.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, memory files,
and can archive old sessions. All changes require user approval.

## Modes

**Full refresh** (default): Sync latest dev-template-managed assets, then audit all targets — `AI.md`, `.ai/`, `.agents/`, `.codex/`, `AGENTS.md`, `CODEX.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, memory, rules.

**Dry-run** (`--dry-run`): Audit and Report phases only. Skip Propose, Approve, Execute.

**Guidance only** (`--guidance-only`): Run only Agent 1 (Project Guidance Auditor) with full
quality scoring. Skip memory and rules agents. Use when you just want to audit or improve
`AI.md`, `.ai/`, `AGENTS.md`, `CODEX.md`, and `CLAUDE.md` files without touching anything else.

**Sync only** (`--sync-only`): Run only Phase 0 to pull the latest dev-template shared skills,
Codex repo skill links/config/custom agents, Codex compatibility links, Claude skill links, provider adapters, hooks, and missing AI context templates into the current repo.

## Phase 0: Pull Latest dev-template Assets

Unless the user passed `--dry-run`, first run:

```bash
nix run github:SPRAGE/dev-template#sync-skills
```

This is safe for existing repos:
- It updates shared skills and refreshes Codex/Claude provider skill links while migrating existing provider-specific additions into `.ai/skills/`.
- It adds or refreshes managed Codex project config and custom agents under `.codex/`.
- It updates managed adapters (`AGENTS.md`, `CODEX.md`, `CLAUDE.md`) when they are still dev-template adapters.
- It adds missing `AI.md`, `.ai/` templates, hooks, and adapters.
- It preserves customized `AI.md`, customized adapters, and populated `.ai/context/` files.

If the command fails because the repo cannot access GitHub, report the failure and continue
with the audit using local files. In `--sync-only` mode, stop after this phase.

## Phase 1: Audit

Dispatch parallel Agent tool subagents, each auditing one target area:

### Agent 1: Project Guidance Auditor (with Quality Scoring)

**Prompt for agent:**
> Audit ALL shared AI guidance files in the repository for accuracy and quality.
>
> **Step 1: Discovery**
> Find all guidance files:
> ```bash
> find . \( -name "AI.md" -o -name "CLAUDE.md" -o -name "AGENTS.md" -o -name "CODEX.md" -o -path "*/.ai/instructions.md" -o -path "*/.ai/context/*.md" \) 2>/dev/null | head -100
> ```
>
> File types to look for:
> | Type | Location | Purpose |
> |------|----------|---------|
> | Shared top-level guide | `./AI.md` | Provider-neutral project guide for all agents |
> | Shared instructions | `./.ai/instructions.md` | Provider-neutral project instructions |
> | Shared context | `./.ai/context/*.md` | Active context, architecture, conventions, decisions |
> | Codex auto-load adapter | `./AGENTS.md` | Codex-compatible entry point |
> | Codex named adapter | `./CODEX.md` | Named Codex adapter for humans and tools |
> | Claude adapter | `./CLAUDE.md` | Claude Code compatibility entry point |
> | Local overrides | `./.claude.local.md` | Personal settings (gitignored) |
> | Global defaults | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | User-wide defaults |
> | Package-specific | `./packages/*/CLAUDE.md` | Module-level context in monorepos |
>
> **Step 2: Staleness Audit** (for each file)
> 1. Every command listed — does it actually work? Check if the binary/script exists.
> 2. Architecture section — do the listed directories exist? Are there new ones not mentioned?
> 3. Conventions — sample 3-5 source files and check if stated conventions match actual code.
> 4. Stack — does the listed stack match config files (package.json, Cargo.toml, etc.)?
>
> **Step 3: Quality Scoring** (for each file)
> Score against 6 criteria (see `references/quality-criteria.md` for full rubric):
> | Criterion | Max Points | What to Check |
> |-----------|-----------|---------------|
> | Commands/workflows | 20 | Are build/test/deploy commands present and working? |
> | Architecture clarity | 20 | Can Claude understand the codebase structure? |
> | Non-obvious patterns | 15 | Are gotchas and quirks documented? |
> | Conciseness | 15 | No verbose explanations or obvious info? |
> | Currency | 15 | Does it reflect current codebase state? |
> | Actionability | 15 | Are instructions executable, not vague? |
>
> Grades: A (90-100), B (70-89), C (50-69), D (30-49), F (0-29)
>
> **Step 4: Red Flags**
> Flag: commands that would fail, references to deleted files, outdated tech versions,
> copy-paste from templates without customization, generic advice, unresolved TODOs,
> duplicate info across AI.md and provider adapters.
>
> Return structured findings per file:
> ```
> ## Project Guidance Audit
>
> ### ./AI.md (Project Root)
> **Score: XX/100 (Grade: X)**
> | Criterion | Score | Notes |
> |-----------|-------|-------|
> | Commands/workflows | X/20 | ... |
> | Architecture clarity | X/20 | ... |
> | Non-obvious patterns | X/15 | ... |
> | Conciseness | X/15 | ... |
> | Currency | X/15 | ... |
> | Actionability | X/15 | ... |
>
> #### Stale Items
> - [item]: [what's wrong] (severity: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
> #### Missing Items
> - [item]: [what should be added]
> #### Accurate Items
> - [item]: confirmed current
> #### Red Flags
> - [flag]: [details]
> ```

### Agent 2: AI Context Auditor

**Prompt for agent:**
> Audit all files in `.ai/context/` for accuracy:
> 1. `active-context.md` — does "Current Focus" reference real work? Do "Key Files in Play"
>    exist? Are "Blockers" still relevant?
> 2. `decisions.md` — for each decision marked "active", is it still reflected in the code?
>    Any decisions that appear to have been reversed?
> 3. `architecture-snapshot.md` — do listed directories/entry points exist? Any new ones?
> 4. `conventions.md` — sample files and compare to stated conventions.
> 5. Check frontmatter `last_updated` dates — flag anything older than 14 days.
>
> Return structured findings per file with staleness indicators.

### Agent 3: Memory & Session Auditor

**Prompt for agent:**
> Audit Claude Code auto-memory and session history.
>
> 1. Find the project memory directory. Try these patterns:
>    - `~/.claude/projects/*/memory/` where the directory name matches the project path
>    - Look for MEMORY.md index file
>    If not found, report "Auto-memory directory not found" and skip memory audit.
>
> 2. For each memory file found:
>    - Read its content
>    - Check if it references files, functions, or patterns that still exist in the codebase
>    - Flag memories that reference deleted/renamed things
>    - Flag memories older than 30 days
>
> 3. Find session JSONL files in the same project directory:
>    - Count total sessions
>    - Sum total file sizes (use `stat` or `ls -l`, don't read the files)
>    - Note age of oldest session
>    - Recommend archiving sessions older than 7 days
>
> Return structured findings with sizes and dates.

### Agent 4: Rules Auditor

**Prompt for agent:**
> Audit all files in `.claude/rules/` (if the directory exists).
> For each rule file:
> 1. Read its content
> 2. Check if the patterns/conventions it enforces match current code
> 3. Check if it references tools, frameworks, or patterns no longer in use
> 4. Flag rules that duplicate what a linter/formatter already handles
>
> If `.claude/rules/` doesn't exist or is empty, report "No rules found" and skip.
>
> Return findings per rule file.

## Phase 2: Report

Synthesize all agent findings into a structured report. Format:

```
## Context Refresh Report

### Summary
- Targets audited: [N]
- Total findings: [N] (HIGH: [n], MEDIUM: [n], LOW: [n])
- Recommended actions: [N]

### Project Guidance
[Agent 1 findings]

### AI Context
[Agent 2 findings]

### Auto-Memory & Sessions
[Agent 3 findings]

### Rules
[Agent 4 findings]
```

Present this report to the user. In dry-run mode, stop here.

## Phase 3: Propose Actions

For each finding, propose a specific action:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Update** | Rewrite stale content with current state. Show exact diff. |
| **Archive** | Move old sessions to `.claude/archive/` |
| **Prune** | Remove stale memory file (content logged to stale-log.md first) |
| **Supersede** | Mark reversed decision as `superseded by [new decision]` |
| **Add** | Add missing information discovered during audit |
| **Skip** | Finding is informational, no action needed |

Group proposals by target (AI.md, adapters, AI context store, memory, sessions, rules).

## Phase 4: Approve

Present proposals grouped by category. Ask user:
> "Apply all changes? Or review per category? (all / by-category / per-item)"

- **all**: Apply everything proposed
- **by-category**: Ask approval for each category (AI.md changes, adapter changes, knowledge changes, etc.)
- **per-item**: Ask approval for each individual change

Declined items are logged to stdout: "Skipped: [item] — [reason: user declined]"
Do not re-prompt for declined items.

## Phase 5: Execute

Apply approved changes:
1. For each **Prune**: append the full content being removed to `stale-log.md` with timestamp and reason, then delete
2. For each **Update/Add**: apply the edit using Edit tool
3. For each **Archive**: create `.claude/archive/` if needed, move files there
4. For each **Supersede**: update the decision entry in decisions.md
5. Update `active-context.md` frontmatter with current timestamp
6. Append summary to `stale-log.md`:
   ```
   [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] [cc-refresh] Refresh completed: N updates, N prunes, N archives, N superseded
   ```

## Stale-Log Format

Every removal/prune appends an entry:

```markdown
---
### [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] [cc-refresh] Pruned: [filename or item]
**Reason:** [why it was pruned]
**Original content:**
[full content of what was removed]
---
```

This ensures nothing is permanently lost. Users can recover incorrectly pruned items.

## Guidance Update Format

For AI.md and adapter changes, use diff-based proposals. See `references/update-guidelines.md` for
detailed guidelines on what to add vs what to avoid. For each proposed change, show:

```markdown
### Update: ./AI.md
**Why:** [reason this helps future sessions]
```diff
+ [addition]
- [removal]
```
```

## User Tips

When presenting the audit report, remind users:
- **`#` key shortcut**: During a Claude session, press `#` to auto-incorporate learnings into Claude's adapter, then move durable shared guidance into AI.md or `.ai/`.
- **Keep it concise**: Dense is better than verbose — every line must earn its place
- **Actionable commands**: All documented commands should be copy-paste ready
- **Use `.claude.local.md`**: For personal preferences not shared with team (add to `.gitignore`)
- **Global defaults**: Put user-wide preferences in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`
