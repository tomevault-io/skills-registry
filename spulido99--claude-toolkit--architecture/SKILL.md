# DeepAgents Architecture Design

Design production-ready agent architectures using Team Topologies principles.

## Core Principles

### 1. Capability-First Design

Design subagents based on **business capabilities**, not technical implementation.

```python
# Good: Capability-focused
{"name": "market-analyst", "description": "Analyzes market trends"}

# Bad: Implementation-focused
{"name": "postgres-agent", "description": "Queries PostgreSQL"}
```

### 2. Context Isolation (Bounded Contexts)

Each subagent operates within its own vocabulary and mental model.

```python
subagents = [
    {
        "name": "support-agent",
        "system_prompt": """In support context:
        - 'Ticket' = customer inquiry
        - 'Resolution' = issue fix
        - 'Escalation' = route to specialist"""
    },
    {
        "name": "billing-agent",
        "system_prompt": """In billing context:
        - 'Invoice' = payment request
        - 'Credit' = account adjustment
        - 'Subscription' = recurring charge"""
    }
]
```

### 3. Cognitive Load Management

| Tools | Recommended Architecture |
|-------|--------------------------|
| < 10 | Single agent, no subagents |
| 10-30 | Platform subagents (capability groups) |
| > 30 | Domain-specialized subagents |

## Agent-Native Principles

Design applications where agents are first-class citizens, not add-ons.

### 1. Parity

Whatever users can do through the UI, agents should achieve through tools.

```python
# ❌ BAD: UI has features agent cannot access
ui_features = ["bulk_delete", "export_csv", "advanced_filters"]
agent_tools = [delete_single_item]  # Missing capabilities

# ✅ GOOD: Full parity
agent_tools = [delete_items, export_data, search_with_filters]
```

### 2. Granularity

Tools should be atomic primitives. Features emerge from agents composing tools in loops—not bundled workflows.

```python
# ❌ BAD: Workflow bundled into single tool
@tool
def handle_order(order_id: str) -> str:
    """Validates, processes payment, ships, and emails."""
    # Agent can't customize or retry individual steps

# ✅ GOOD: Atomic primitives
tools = [validate_order, process_payment, create_shipment, send_notification]
# Agent composes and handles failures at each step
```

### 3. Composability

With atomic tools and parity, create new features by writing prompts—no code changes needed.

```python
# New "rush order" feature = prompt change, not code
system_prompt = """For rush orders:
1. validate_order with priority=high
2. process_payment immediately
3. create_shipment with express=True
4. send_notification with urgency=high"""
```

### 4. Emergent Capability

Agents accomplish unanticipated tasks by composing tools creatively. Design for discovery, not restriction.

```python
# User asks: "Send weekly stakeholder updates every Friday"
# Agent CREATIVELY composes tools not originally designed for this:
tools = [query_db, aggregate_metrics, generate_summary, send_email]

# Agent figures out a workflow:
# 1. Query project metrics from database
# 2. Aggregate into weekly summary
# 3. Generate human-readable report
# 4. Email to stakeholder list
# No "create_weekly_report" tool needed—agent composes existing tools!
```

### 5. Improvement Over Time

Applications enhance through accumulated context (`AGENTS.md`) and prompt refinement—not code rewrites.

```markdown
# Example: Agent learns from user feedback

## Before feedback
Agent generates text-only reports.

## User feedback
"Include chart images in reports"

## Agent updates AGENTS.md:
### Learned Preferences
- Reports should include visual charts
- Use generate_chart tool before send_email
- Chart style: bar charts for comparisons, line charts for trends
```

## Data Architecture

### When to Use Files vs Databases

| Use Files For | Use Databases For |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Content users should read/edit | High-volume structured data |
| Configuration (version control) | Complex relational queries |
| Agent-generated reports | Ephemeral session state |
| Large text/markdown content | Data requiring indexes |

### Context Management with AGENTS.md

`AGENTS.md` files are **injected into the system prompt** at session start via the `memory` parameter. This is the file-first approach to providing persistent context.

```python
from deepagents import create_deep_agent
from deepagents.backends import FilesystemBackend

agent = create_deep_agent(
    backend=FilesystemBackend(root_dir="./"),  # Scope to project directory
    memory=[
        "~/.deepagents/AGENTS.md",      # Global preferences
        "./.deepagents/AGENTS.md",      # Project-specific context
    ],
    system_prompt="You are a project assistant."  # Minimal, AGENTS.md has the rest
)
```

> **Security Warning**: Never use `root_dir="/"` — it grants the agent read/write access to your entire filesystem. Always scope to the project directory or a dedicated workspace.

**Two levels of AGENTS.md:**

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `~/.deepagents/AGENTS.md` | Global: personality, style, universal preferences |
| `./.deepagents/AGENTS.md` | Project: architecture, conventions, team guidelines |

**Global AGENTS.md example** (`~/.deepagents/AGENTS.md`):

```markdown
# Global Preferences

## Communication Style
- Tone: Professional, concise
- Format output as Markdown tables when showing data
- Always cite sources for claims

## Universal Coding Preferences
- Use type hints in Python
- Prefer functional patterns where appropriate
- Write tests for new functionality
```

**Project AGENTS.md example** (`.deepagents/AGENTS.md`):

```markdown
# Project Context

## Architecture
- FastAPI backend in /api
- React frontend in /web
- PostgreSQL database

## Conventions
- API endpoints follow REST naming
- Use Pydantic for validation
- Run `pytest` before committing

## Available Resources
- /data/reports/ - Historical reports
- /config/sources.json - Approved data sources
```

**For internal/trusted agents only:** The agent can update these files using `edit_file` when learning new preferences or receiving feedback. By default, treat `AGENTS.md` as read-only.

> **Security Note**: Writable `AGENTS.md` is appropriate for internal/trusted agents only. For customer-facing agents, see the [Security for Customer-Facing Agents](../patterns/SKILL.md#security-for-customer-facing-agents) section in patterns/SKILL.md to prevent Persistent Prompt Injection attacks.

### Long-Term Memory with CompositeBackend

For persistent memory across conversations, use `CompositeBackend` to route specific paths to durable storage:

```python
from deepagents import create_deep_agent
from deepagents.backends import CompositeBackend, StateBackend, StoreBackend
from langgraph.store.memory import InMemoryStore

store = InMemoryStore()

agent = create_deep_agent(
    store=store,
    backend=CompositeBackend(
        default=StateBackend(),                         # Ephemeral by default
        routes={"/memories/": StoreBackend(store=store)},  # Persistent for /memories/
    ),
    memory=["./.deepagents/AGENTS.md"],
    system_prompt="You have persistent memory. Write to /memories/ to remember across sessions."
)
```

| Path | Backend | Persistence |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `/memories/*` | StoreBackend | Cross-conversation |
| Everything else | StateBackend | Conversation only |

## Agent Topologies

Based on Team Topologies, map to these agent types:

### Stream-Aligned (Main Orchestrator)

Primary agent that coordinates the workflow and delegates to specialists.

```python
agent = create_deep_agent(
    system_prompt="You coordinate customer operations...",
    subagents=[support, billing, orders]  # Delegates work
)
```

### Platform (Reusable Capabilities)

Self-service capabilities consumed by other agents.

```python
{
    "name": "data-platform",
    "description": "Provides data access services",
    "tools": [db_query, api_fetch, file_parse]
}
```

### Complicated Subsystem (Specialized Expertise)

Deep domain expertise requiring isolation.

```python
{
    "name": "risk-analyst",
    "description": "Calculates financial risk metrics",
    "system_prompt": "Expert in VaR, volatility, Sharpe ratio...",
    "tools": [risk_calculator, market_data]
}
```

### Enabling (Temporary Assistance)

Knowledge transfer, then steps back.

```python
{
    "name": "methodology-advisor",
    "description": "Teaches research methods",
    "system_prompt": "Guide others to self-sufficiency..."
}
```

## Topology Selection

```
Start
  |
  v
Clear domain boundaries?
  |-- Yes --> Domain-Specialized subagents
  |-- No --> Continue
         |
         v
     How many tools?
       |-- < 10 --> Single agent (no subagents)
       |-- 10-30 --> Platform subagents (group by capability)
       |-- > 30 --> Hierarchical decomposition
```

### Additional Decision Factors

Beyond tool count and domain boundaries, consider:

| Factor | Single Agent | Subagents |
|--------|--------------|-----------|
| **Latency** | Need sub-100ms response | Can tolerate delegation overhead |
| **Failure isolation** | All-or-nothing acceptable | Need independent failure domains |
| **Cost** | Token budget limited | Can afford summarization overhead |
| **Observability** | Simple tracing sufficient | Need per-domain visibility |

> **Note**: The 10/30 tool thresholds align with cognitive load research (7±2 items). Adjust based on tool complexity—10 simple tools may be fine, while 5 complex tools might warrant decomposition.

### Token Economy Considerations

Each subagent call creates a new LLM context (system prompt + task + tool schemas). Keep in mind:

| Pattern | Token Impact |
|---------|-------------|
| Each subagent delegation | ~2,000-5,000 tokens overhead per call |
| Hierarchical nesting (N levels) | N x single-call latency minimum |
| Parallel subagents | Multiplies cost by number of parallel agents |
| Large system prompts on high-frequency agents | Repeated on every API call |

**Tip**: Use the AGENTS.md file-first approach to load context once at session start rather than repeating it in every system prompt.

## Design Process

### Step 1: Map Business Capabilities

```
Enterprise Capabilities
├── Customer Management
│   ├── Support
│   └── Retention
├── Order Fulfillment
│   ├── Processing
│   └── Shipping
└── Financial Operations
    ├── Billing
    └── Refunds
```

### Step 2: Define Bounded Contexts

For each capability, identify:
- Unique vocabulary
- Required expertise
- Can evolve independently?

### Step 3: Design Subagent Topology

Map capabilities to subagents:

| Business Pattern | Agent Pattern |
|------------------|---------------|
| Single capability | No subagent needed |
| 2-3 related capabilities | Platform subagent |
| Distinct bounded contexts | Specialized subagents |
| Hierarchical capabilities | Nested subagents |

### Step 4: Define Interaction Modes

```python
interactions = {
    "x-as-a-service": "Self-service consumption",
    "collaboration": "Temporary intensive work",
    "facilitation": "One-time knowledge transfer"
}
```

## Quick Patterns

### Pattern 1: Simple Stream-Aligned

```python
# < 10 tools, linear workflows
agent = create_deep_agent(
    tools=[search, summarize, report],
    system_prompt="You are a research assistant..."
)
```

### Pattern 2: Platform-Supported

```python
# 10-30 tools, clear capability groups
agent = create_deep_agent(
    subagents=[
        {"name": "data-platform", "tools": [db, api, files]},
        {"name": "analysis-platform", "tools": [stats, ml, viz]}
    ]
)
```

### Pattern 3: Domain-Specialized

```python
# > 30 tools, distinct business domains
agent = create_deep_agent(
    subagents=[
        {"name": "billing-specialist", "tools": [billing_api]},
        {"name": "support-specialist", "tools": [ticket_system]},
        {"name": "fulfillment-specialist", "tools": [warehouse_api]}
    ]
)
```

## Validation Checklist

Before finalizing architecture:

- [ ] Clear subagent boundaries (no overlap)
- [ ] Business capability alignment
- [ ] Distinct vocabularies per context
- [ ] Appropriate cognitive load (3-10 tools per agent)
- [ ] Stakeholders recognize the structure
- [ ] New subagent description tested for routing ambiguity against all existing descriptions
- [ ] Eval scenarios planned for new subagent capabilities (`/add-scenario`)

### Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/design-topology` | Interactive full architecture design from scratch |
| `/add-subagent` | Add a single subagent to an existing architecture (incremental) |
| `/add-tool` | Add a single tool to an existing catalog |
| `/validate-agent` | Full architecture scan for anti-patterns |
| `/evolve` | Guided architecture evolution and refactoring |
| `/assess` | Assess agent maturity level |

**Incremental subagent workflow**: Use `/add-subagent` when you already have a running agent and want to expand it with a new capability. It analyzes the existing topology, designs a new subagent matching your conventions, checks for routing ambiguity, and inserts the code — without redesigning the full architecture.
