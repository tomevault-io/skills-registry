# Evals-Driven Development (EDD)

Evals-Driven Development is to agents what TDD is to code. Define what your agent should do *before* (or alongside) building it, then iterate until it does.

```
JTBD → Scenarios → Dataset → Evaluate → Improve
  ↑                                        |
  └──────────── new scenarios ─────────────┘
```

**Adaptive entry point**: EDD works whether you have an existing agent or are starting from scratch.
- **Existing agent**: Read its tools, subagents, and prompts to generate scenarios from current behavior.
- **Greenfield**: Define JTBD and scenarios first. The dataset becomes your spec — build the agent to pass it.

**Getting started**: Run `/design-evals` to scaffold your eval suite interactively.

## Step 1: Define Scenarios from JTBD

Every eval starts from a **Job-To-Be-Done** — what your agent's end-user wants to accomplish. You don't need to know the JTBD framework; just answer: *"What does your user want to get done?"*

### Narrative First (Low Friction)

Start by describing scenarios in plain language:

```
Job: "Customer wants to track their order and change delivery address"
Happy path: Ask for order → agent looks it up → user asks to change address →
            agent requests approval → human approves → agent confirms
Edge case:  Order not found → agent asks for alternative info
Failure:    Agent changes address without approval
```

### Structured YAML (When Ready for Automation)

The narrative converts to a structured format the eval system can execute:

```yaml
- job: Track and modify order
  actor: Customer
  trigger: "Where is my order?"
  scenarios:
    - name: happy_path_track_and_modify
      tags: [smoke, e2e]
      turns:
        - user: "Where is my order #1234?"
        - expected_tools: [lookup_order]
          mock_responses:
            lookup_order:
              status: "shipped"
              tracking: "1Z999AA10123456784"
              eta: "2026-02-21"
        - user: "Change delivery to 123 Main St"
        - expected_tools: [update_order]
          mock_responses:
            update_order:
              status: "pending_confirmation"
              changes: { address: "123 Main St" }
          interrupt: true
        - approval: approve
        - expected_tools: []
      success_criteria:
        - judge_criteria: "Agent confirmed the address was updated to 123 Main St"
        - max_turns: 5

    - name: order_not_found
      tags: [edge_case]
      turns:
        - user: "Where is my order #9999?"
        - expected_tools: [lookup_order]
          mock_responses:
            lookup_order:
              error: "not_found"
              message: "No order found with ID #9999"
      success_criteria:
        - judge_criteria: "Agent informed user the order was not found and asked for alternative information"
        - no_tools: [update_order]

    - name: change_address_mid_conversation
      tags: [e2e]
      history:
        - role: user
          content: "Where is my order #1234?"
        - role: assistant
          content: "Your order #1234 is shipped. Tracking: 1Z999AA. ETA: Feb 21."
      turns:
        - user: "Change the delivery to 789 Elm St"
        - expected_tools: [update_order]
          mock_responses:
            update_order:
              status: "pending_confirmation"
              changes: { address: "789 Elm St" }
          interrupt: true
        - approval: approve
      success_criteria:
        - judge_criteria: "Agent confirmed the delivery address change"
```

**Key fields**:
- `history`: Prior conversation turns that establish context. Required when the user's first message in `turns` responds to prior agent output (e.g., "Si dale", "Actually, can you change..."). The eval runner pre-loads these before executing the scenario.
- `mock_responses`: Tool return values for Tier 1 scripted tests — the eval runner intercepts tool calls and returns these instead of calling real services. If the agent calls a tool not in `expected_tools`, the test fails immediately (contract test).
- `approval`: Handles `interrupt_on` HITL flows — the eval runner auto-responds with `approve` or `reject` when the agent pauses for human decision. Test both paths. (Cross-ref: [Patterns — interrupt_on](../patterns/SKILL.md))
- `judge_criteria`: Semantic content assertion (default for response checks). Uses a cheap LLM to evaluate whether the agent's response satisfies the stated criteria. Preferred over `response_contains` because agents rephrase everything.
- `tags`: Organize scenarios for selective runs (`@smoke`, `@e2e`, `@edge_case`, `@error_handling`, `@multi_agent`).

See [`references/01-scenarios.md`](references/01-scenarios.md) for full templates, E2E examples, and anti-patterns.

## Agent Eval vs Unit Test: Which Do You Need?

Before writing a scenario, determine whether you need an agent eval or a unit test:

| Signal | Agent Eval | Unit Test |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Tests tool selection (which tool?) | Yes | No |
| Tests conversation flow (multi-turn) | Yes | No |
| Tests input validation logic | No | Yes |
| Tests data transformation | No | Yes |
| Tests API error handling in tool code | No | Yes |
| Tests routing to correct subagent | Yes | No |
| Tests prompt adherence | Yes | No |
| Tests business logic in tool implementation | No | Yes |

```
Does the test require an LLM to make a decision?
  ├── Yes → Agent eval (YAML scenario)
  │   "Agent should call lookup_order when user asks about their order"
  │   "Agent should escalate when refund exceeds $100"
  │   "Agent should ask for clarification when order ID is missing"
  │
  └── No → Unit test (pytest, standard assertions)
      "lookup_order returns 404 when order doesn't exist"
      "validate_email rejects malformed addresses"
      "process_refund calculates correct prorated amount"
```

**Common mistake**: Writing agent evals for input validation. If the logic can be tested by calling a function directly, it's a unit test, not an agent eval.

## Step 2: Build Your Dataset

### Local-First Storage

Datasets live as YAML/JSON files in `evals/datasets/`. Version-controlled, PR-reviewable, zero external dependencies.

```
evals/
  datasets/
    support-agent.yaml       # Scenario definitions
  __snapshots__/             # Trajectory snapshots (auto-generated)
  .results/                  # Run results (gitignored)
    latest.json
    history/
  conftest.py                # Agent discovery fixture
  eval-config.yaml           # Snapshot comparison + eval settings
```

### Agent Discovery Convention

The eval system finds your agent through a `conftest.py` fixture:

```python
# evals/conftest.py (scaffolded by /design-evals)
import pytest
from agent import create_agent  # Convention: project exposes create_agent()

@pytest.fixture
def agent():
    """Create a fresh agent instance per test."""
    return create_agent()
```

`/design-evals` auto-detects the entry point by searching for `create_agent` or `create_deep_agent` in `agent.py`, `main.py`, or `src/agent.py`. If not found, it asks for the module path.

For multi-agent projects:

```python
@pytest.fixture(params=["coordinator", "billing", "shipping"])
def agent(request):
    """Create named agent for multi-agent testing."""
    return create_agent(request.param)
```

### Two Tiers of User Simulation

**Tier 1 — Scripted (Default)**

Fixed turn sequences from your YAML dataset. Deterministic, free, fast. Used for the dev inner loop.

```python
import yaml
import pytest

def load_scenarios(path="evals/datasets/support-agent.yaml"):
    with open(path) as f:
        data = yaml.safe_load(f)
    # Flatten: each job has multiple scenarios
    return [s for job in data for s in job["scenarios"]]

@pytest.mark.parametrize("scenario", load_scenarios(), ids=lambda s: s["name"])
def test_scenario(scenario, agent):
    """Run a scripted scenario against the agent."""
    thread_id = f"test-{scenario['name']}"
    for turn in scenario["turns"]:
        if "user" in turn:
            result = agent.invoke(
                {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": turn["user"]}]},
                config={"configurable": {"thread_id": thread_id}},
            )
        elif "expected_tools" in turn:
            actual_tools = [tc["name"] for tc in result.get("tool_calls", [])]
            for expected in turn["expected_tools"]:
                assert expected in actual_tools, f"Expected {expected}, got {actual_tools}"
        elif "approval" in turn:
            # Auto-respond to interrupt_on pause
            result = agent.invoke(
                {"messages": [{"role": "human", "content": turn["approval"]}]},
                config={"configurable": {"thread_id": thread_id}},
            )
```

**Tier 2 — Simulated (Pre-Merge)**

LLM-powered users via `openevals`. Flexible, handles emergent edge cases. Costs tokens.

```python
from openevals.simulators import create_llm_simulated_user
from openevals.simulation import run_multiturn_simulation

user = create_llm_simulated_user(
    system=scenario.get("simulated_user_prompt", "You are a frustrated customer."),
    model="openai:gpt-4.1-mini",
)

result = run_multiturn_simulation(
    app=wrap_agent(agent),
    user=user,
    max_turns=scenario.get("max_turns", 10),
)
```

### Optional: LangSmith Sync

Sync local datasets to LangSmith for experiment tracking and side-by-side comparison:

```python
from langsmith import Client

client = Client()
dataset = client.create_dataset("support-agent-evals")
for scenario in load_scenarios():
    client.create_example(
        inputs={"turns": scenario["turns"]},
        outputs={"success_criteria": scenario["success_criteria"]},
        dataset_id=dataset.id,
    )
```

## Step 3: Evaluate and Score

Three evaluator categories, from cheapest to most flexible.

### Trajectory Match (Deterministic, Free)

Compare actual tool call sequences against expected trajectories.

```python
from agentevals.trajectory import check_trajectory

# Strict: exact tool sequence match
result = check_trajectory(
    expected=["lookup_order", "update_order", "signal_task_complete"],
    actual=actual_tool_calls,
    mode="strict",
)

# Unordered: all tools present, any order
result = check_trajectory(expected=expected, actual=actual, mode="unordered")

# Subsequence: expected tools appear as subsequence in actual
result = check_trajectory(expected=expected, actual=actual, mode="subsequence")
```

| Mode | Compares | Best for |
|------|----------|----------|
| `strict` | Exact sequence | Well-defined workflows |
| `unordered` | Same tools, any order | Parallel tool execution |
| `subsequence` | Expected appears within actual | Agents that add optional tools |

### LLM-as-Judge (Flexible, Costs Tokens)

For nuanced evaluation where deterministic checks aren't enough:

```python
from agentevals.trajectory import create_trajectory_llm_as_judge
from agentevals.trajectory import TRAJECTORY_ACCURACY_PROMPT

evaluator = create_trajectory_llm_as_judge(
    prompt=TRAJECTORY_ACCURACY_PROMPT,
    model="openai:o3-mini",  # Strong model for pre-merge
)

score = evaluator(
    expected=reference_trajectory,
    actual=actual_trajectory,
)
```

Use cheap models (`gpt-4.1-mini`) during development, strong models (`o3-mini`) for pre-merge gates.

### Custom Code Evaluators (Programmatic)

Write evaluators for domain-specific assertions:

```python
def eval_max_turns(result, scenario):
    """Agent must complete within turn budget."""
    max_turns = scenario["success_criteria"].get("max_turns", 10)
    actual_turns = len([m for m in result["messages"] if m["role"] == "assistant"])
    return actual_turns <= max_turns

def eval_signal_task_complete(result):
    """Agent must explicitly signal completion (not just stop talking)."""
    tool_calls = [tc["name"] for tc in result.get("all_tool_calls", [])]
    return "signal_task_complete" in tool_calls

def eval_no_forbidden_tools(result, scenario):
    """Agent must NOT call forbidden tools."""
    forbidden = scenario["success_criteria"].get("no_tools", [])
    actual = [tc["name"] for tc in result.get("all_tool_calls", [])]
    return not any(t in actual for t in forbidden)
```

Cross-ref: [`signal_task_complete` pattern](../patterns/SKILL.md) makes Full Turn assertions unambiguous — assert the tool was called instead of guessing whether the agent is "done."

### Hierarchical Multi-Agent Evaluation

For systems with 3+ subagents, evaluate at two levels:

**Coordinator level**: Did it route to the correct subagent?

```python
def eval_routing(result, scenario):
    """Coordinator delegated to the expected subagent."""
    expected_subagent = scenario.get("expected_subagent")
    delegations = [tc for tc in result["tool_calls"] if tc["name"].startswith("delegate_")]
    if expected_subagent:
        return any(expected_subagent in d["name"] for d in delegations)
    return True
```

**Subagent level**: Did each subagent execute correctly?

Run subagent-specific scenarios against individual subagents (not the coordinator). Each bounded context ([Architecture](../architecture/SKILL.md)) gets its own `evals/` directory for isolation.

See [`references/02-evaluators.md`](references/02-evaluators.md) for the full evaluator catalog, Operation Level evaluators, idempotency testing, and the "which evaluator?" decision tree.

## Step 4: Dev Workflow

### Snapshot Testing (Default Inner Loop)

First run generates trajectory snapshots. Subsequent runs compare against them — no LLM judge needed.

**Snapshot format** (`evals/__snapshots__/{scenario_name}.json`):

```json
{
  "scenario": "track_order_happy_path",
  "recorded_at": "2026-02-19T10:30:00Z",
  "agent_hash": "a1b2c3",
  "compare_mode": "structural",
  "trajectory": [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Where is my order #1234?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"name": "lookup_order", "args": {"order_id": "1234"}}]},
    {"role": "tool", "name": "lookup_order", "content": "{...}"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Your order #1234 has been shipped..."}
  ],
  "metrics": {
    "turns": 2,
    "tool_calls": 1,
    "total_tokens": 1847
  }
}
```

**Snapshot configuration** (`evals/eval-config.yaml`):

```yaml
snapshot:
  compare_mode: structural   # structural | strict | semantic
  ignore_fields:
    - tool_call_id
    - timestamps
    - message_id
```

| Mode | Compares | Use case |
|------|----------|----------|
| `structural` (default) | Tool call names + arg keys + turn count | Most scenarios — catches regressions without over-fitting |
| `strict` | Full tool calls + args + response structure | Well-defined workflows where exact behavior matters |
| `semantic` | Tool call names only + success criteria | Exploratory agents where path varies but outcome is stable |

The `agent_hash` is a hash of the agent's prompt + tool names. When it changes, snapshots are marked stale in `/eval-status`.

### Smoke Testing (Quick Validation)

Run only `@smoke`-tagged scenarios (5-10 critical paths) with a cheap model as judge:

```bash
pytest evals/ -m smoke
```

### Full Eval Review (Pre-Merge Gate)

Manual gate before merging. Run Tier 2 simulated users + strong LLM judge:

```bash
pytest evals/ --full --model openai:o3-mini
```

Cached baselines: skip scenarios unaffected by changes. Compare experiments between versions.

### Progressive Failure UX

Three levels — choose how deep to go:

1. **Always shown**: pass/fail + trace link (local log or LangSmith)
   ```
   ✓ 11 passed | ✗ 1 failed | ~ 2 changed
   FAILED: refund_after_shipping — unexpected tool: escalate_to_human
   ```

2. **On demand** (`/eval --report`): Expected vs actual trajectory diff
   ```
   Expected: [lookup_order, check_refund_policy, process_refund]
   Actual:   [lookup_order, escalate_to_human]
   Diff at turn 2: expected check_refund_policy, got escalate_to_human
   ```

3. **On demand** (`/eval --diagnose`): LLM analyzes WHY it failed + suggests fixes
   ```
   Diagnosis: Agent escalated because refund amount ($150) exceeds the $100
   threshold in the system prompt. Consider updating the threshold or adding
   a check_refund_policy step before escalation.
   ```

See [`references/03-dev-workflow.md`](references/03-dev-workflow.md) for snapshot setup, cost management, production trace mining, and debugging with LangSmith.

See [`references/04-mock-strategies.md`](references/04-mock-strategies.md) for mocking strategies including multi-agent API-client-level mocking.

See [`references/05-security-evals.md`](references/05-security-evals.md) for dual-layer security assertion patterns (prompt injection, data leakage, access control).

## Step 5: Iterate and Expand

### When to Add Scenarios

- **Production failure** → new regression scenario (tag: `regression`)
- **New feature** → new JTBD → new scenarios
- **Edge case discovered** → scenario added (tag: `edge_case`)
- **Bug report** → scenario that reproduces the bug before fixing

Use `/add-scenario` to add scenarios interactively or `/add-scenario --from-trace <path>` to convert a production trace.

### Scaling Your Dataset

| Stage | Scenarios | Focus |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Starting | 5-10 | Core happy paths + critical failures |
| Growing | 10-50 | Edge cases, error handling, multi-turn |
| Mature | 50-500 | Full coverage, regression suite, multi-agent |

### Dataset Organization

Use tags to create splits for selective runs:
- `smoke`: 5-10 critical scenarios, always run
- `e2e`: Full end-to-end flows
- `edge_case`: Boundary conditions and unusual inputs
- `error_handling`: Tool failures, API errors
- `multi_agent`: Cross-subagent coordination

### Snapshot Re-recording

When you intentionally change the agent (new prompt, new tool, refactored logic):

1. Run `/eval` — changed scenarios show as `~ changed`
2. Run `/eval-update` — review each change, accept or reject
3. Accepted changes update the snapshot; rejected changes stay as failures

### Production Trace Mining

Manually curate interesting production conversations into eval scenarios:

1. Review traces in local logs or LangSmith (failures, escalations, edge cases)
2. Run `/add-scenario --from-trace <path-or-id>` to convert
3. Annotate with expected behavior and success criteria
4. Low volume but high quality — each mined scenario catches a real-world issue

## Quick Reference

### Evaluator Decision Table

| Question | Evaluator |
|----------|-----------|
| Does the response convey the right meaning? | `judge_criteria` (semantic, cheap LLM) |
| Does the response contain exact values (IDs, URLs)? | `response_contains` (deterministic) |
| Does the response avoid exact forbidden terms? | `not_contains` (deterministic) |
| Does the response avoid forbidden concepts (paraphrases)? | `security_judge_criteria` (semantic) |
| Did the agent call the right tools in the right order? | Trajectory match (strict) |
| Did it call the right tools in any order? | Trajectory match (unordered) |
| Did it call certain tools among others? | Trajectory match (subsequence) |
| Did it handle the conversation well overall? | LLM-as-judge |
| Did it finish within the turn budget? | Custom: max turns |
| Did it explicitly signal completion? | Custom: `signal_task_complete` |
| Did it route to the correct subagent? | Custom: routing evaluator |
| Did the `pending_confirmation` flow work? | Custom: approval flow check |
| Is the tool idempotent on retry? | Custom: idempotency evaluator |

### EDD Checklist

- [ ] Define 2-3 JTBD for your agent's users
- [ ] Write happy path + edge case + failure scenarios per JTBD
- [ ] Use `judge_criteria` for semantic assertions (not `response_contains` for phrases)
- [ ] Use `response_contains` only for exact values (IDs, URLs, reference numbers)
- [ ] Add `history` for scenarios that depend on prior conversation context
- [ ] Verify each scenario is an agent eval, not a unit test
- [ ] Add `mock_responses` for all expected tool calls
- [ ] Add `approval` steps for `interrupt_on` flows
- [ ] Run `/eval` to generate initial snapshots
- [ ] Tag 5-10 critical scenarios as `@smoke`
- [ ] Set up `eval-config.yaml` with appropriate `compare_mode`
- [ ] Run smoke tests after every change
- [ ] Run full eval review before merging

### Metrics & Targets

| Metric | Description | Target |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Task Success Rate | % scenarios passing | > 80% |
| Token Efficiency | Tokens per successful task | Minimize |
| Latency | Time to complete task | < 60s typical |
| Error Rate | % scenarios with errors | < 10% |
| Tool Selection Accuracy | Correct tool for task | > 90% |
| Context Overflow | % runs exceeding context | < 5% |
| Escalation Rate | Tasks requiring human | < 15% |

Cross-ref: [Evolution](../evolution/SKILL.md) Level 4 defines these same metrics as maturity indicators. Red flags (tool confusion, context overflow) map to specific thresholds above.

### Cost & Time Estimates

| Mode | Cost/scenario | Time/scenario | 50 scenarios |
|------|---------------|---------------|--------------|
| Snapshot (Tier 1) | $0 | ~2-5s | ~2-4 min |
| Smoke (Tier 1 + cheap judge) | ~$0.01 | ~5-10s | ~5-8 min |
| Full (Tier 2 + strong judge) | ~$0.15-0.30 | ~30-60s | ~25-50 min, ~$8-15 |

**Guidance**:
- **Dev inner loop**: Always Tier 1 snapshot. Zero cost, fast feedback.
- **Pre-commit sanity**: Smoke (`@smoke` tag, 5-10 scenarios). ~$0.10, 1 min.
- **Pre-merge review**: Full suite. Budget ~$10-15 for 50 scenarios. Run once per PR.
- **Model choice**: Use `gpt-4.1-mini` for simulated users, `o3-mini` for judge. Don't use the same strong model for both — it doubles cost with marginal benefit.

### Multi-Agent Directory Layout

**Convention A: Single agent (default)**
```
project/
  agent.py
  evals/
    datasets/
    __snapshots__/
    conftest.py
    eval-config.yaml
    .results/
```

**Convention B: Multi-agent project**
```
project/
  agents/
    coordinator/
      agent.py
      evals/           # Routing and delegation tests
        datasets/
        __snapshots__/
    billing/
      agent.py
      evals/           # Billing-specific tests
        datasets/
        __snapshots__/
  evals/               # E2E integration tests (full system)
    datasets/
    __snapshots__/
    conftest.py
```

Each bounded context ([Architecture](../architecture/SKILL.md)) gets its own `evals/` for isolation. The top-level `evals/` tests the system as a whole.
