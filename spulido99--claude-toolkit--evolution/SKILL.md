# DeepAgents Architecture Evolution

Assess, measure, and evolve agent architectures through maturity levels.

## Maturity Model Overview

| Level | Name | Characteristics |
|-------|------|-----------------|
| 1 | Initial | Single agent, 40-60+ tools, frequent errors |
| 2 | Managed | 2-4 subagents, basic grouping, some overlap |
| 3 | Defined | Capability-aligned, bounded contexts, documented |
| 4 | Measured | Full topologies, metrics tracked, automated testing |
| 5 | Optimizing | Self-organizing, auto-optimization, A/B testing |

## Level Descriptions

### Level 1: Initial (Ad-Hoc)

**Symptoms:**
- Single agent with 40-60+ tools
- Agent confused about tool selection
- Context window overflows
- Inconsistent results

```python
# Level 1 example
agent = create_deep_agent(tools=[tool1, tool2, ..., tool60])
```

**Next step:** Identify tool groupings, create platform subagents

### Level 2: Managed (Basic Structure)

**Symptoms:**
- 2-4 subagents based on intuition
- Some capability separation
- Overlapping responsibilities
- Basic planning (todos)

```python
# Level 2 example
agent = create_deep_agent(
    model="anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
    subagents=[
        {"name": "data-agent", "tools": [...]},
        {"name": "api-agent", "tools": [...]}
    ]
)
```

**Next step:** Map business capabilities, define bounded contexts

### Level 3: Defined (Capability-Aligned)

**Symptoms:**
- Subagents map to business capabilities
- Clear bounded contexts
- Documented interaction patterns
- File system for context management

```python
# Level 3 example
agent = create_deep_agent(
    model="anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
    subagents=[
        {
            "name": "customer-support",
            "system_prompt": "In support context: 'ticket' = inquiry...",
            "tools": [support_kb, ticket_system]
        }
    ]
)
```

**Next step:** Apply Team Topologies, establish metrics

> **Tip**: Use `/design-evals` to scaffold your first eval dataset. This is the key step in reaching Level 4 (Measured).

### Level 4: Measured (Optimized)

**Symptoms:**
- Full Team Topologies (platform, enabling, specialist)
- Defined interaction modes
- Performance metrics tracked
- Automated testing

**Metrics to track:**
- Token efficiency (tokens/task)
- Subagent utilization
- Error rate
- Cognitive load (tools/agent)

**Next step:** Implement evolutionary architecture

### Level 5: Optimizing (Evolutionary)

**Symptoms:**
- Self-organizing ecosystem
- Automatic capability detection
- Dynamic subagent creation
- Continuous optimization

## Migration Paths

### Level 1 → 2: Basic Grouping

1. Group tools by theme (data, communication, analysis)
2. Create 2-3 basic subagents
3. Test with sample tasks
4. Measure cognitive load reduction

### Level 2 → 3: Capability Alignment

1. Map business capabilities
2. Define bounded contexts
3. Redesign subagents around capabilities
4. Document vocabularies
5. Establish interaction patterns

### Level 3 → 4: Measurement

1. Apply Team Topologies
2. Identify platform capabilities
3. Create enabling subagents
4. Implement metrics collection
5. Establish testing framework

### Level 4 → 5: Automation

1. Implement telemetry
2. Build optimization engine
3. Create capability discovery
4. Enable automatic refactoring
5. Implement A/B testing

## Assessment Checklist

Score 0-5 for each (total 80 possible):

### Structure (20 points)
- [ ] Clear subagent boundaries
- [ ] Business capability alignment
- [ ] Bounded context definition
- [ ] Topology variety

### Operations (20 points)
- [ ] Planning integration
- [ ] Context management
- [ ] Tool organization
- [ ] Error handling

### Measurement (20 points)
- [ ] Performance metrics
- [ ] Testing coverage
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Monitoring

### Evolution (20 points)
- [ ] Refactoring capability
- [ ] Learning from usage
- [ ] Experimentation
- [ ] Feedback loops

**Score interpretation:**
- 0-20: Level 1 (Initial)
- 21-40: Level 2 (Managed)
- 41-60: Level 3 (Defined)
- 61-80: Level 4+ (Measured/Optimizing)

## Red Flags by Level

### Level 1 Red Flags
- Context constantly overflowing
- Agent can't decide which tool
- Simple tasks take > 5 minutes

### Level 2 Red Flags
- Subagents rarely used
- Unclear routing decisions
- Still context overflow

### Level 3 Red Flags
- Business users don't recognize structure
- Vocabulary conflicts
- Can't add capabilities easily

### Level 4 Red Flags
- Metrics not driving decisions
- Performance not improving
- Manual testing only

## Refactoring Patterns

### Extract Subagent

When main agent is overloaded:

```python
# Before: 15 tools in main
agent = create_deep_agent(tools=[t1, t2, ..., t15])

# After: Extract platform
agent = create_deep_agent(
    tools=[t1, t2, t3],
    subagents=[{"name": "platform", "tools": [t4, ..., t15]}]
)
```

### Inline Subagent

When subagent used only once:

```python
# Before: Subagent for single use
subagents=[{"name": "calculator", "tools": [calc]}]

# After: Tool in main agent
tools=[calc]
```

### Split Subagent

When subagent covers multiple domains:

```python
# Before: Mixed responsibilities
{"name": "data-handler", "tools": [ingest, clean, visualize]}

# After: Separated concerns
{"name": "data-ingestion", "tools": [ingest]},
{"name": "data-visualization", "tools": [visualize]}
```

### Merge Subagents

When subagents are too granular:

```python
# Before: 10 tiny subagents
subagents=[{"name": "a", "tools": [t1]}, ...]

# After: Consolidated platforms
subagents=[
    {"name": "data-platform", "tools": [t1, t2, t3]},
    {"name": "analysis-platform", "tools": [t4, t5, t6]}
]
```
