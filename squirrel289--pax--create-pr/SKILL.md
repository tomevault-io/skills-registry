# Create PR

## Overview

Create a pull request on GitHub from a feature branch, automatically populating PR title and description with work item metadata. Links PR to the associated work item and facilitates smooth transition to review phase.

## When to Use

Create a PR when:

- Implementation is complete and tested locally
- Feature branch is synced with main and ready for review
- Work item status is `testing` (or ready for code review)
- PR does not already exist for the branch
- Ready to solicit code review and feedback

## When NOT to Use

Skip creating PR for:

- Work still in progress (use [[updating-work-item/SKILL]] to track, submit PR later)
- Exploring experiment branches (keep as WIP, don't create PR)
- Pushing emergency hotfixes (create PR directly via GitHub UI or `gh pr create` manually)

## Frontmatter Fields in Work Item

When work item status transitions to `testing`, [[create-pr/SKILL]] is invoked automatically. It reads:

```yaml
title: "Implement FilterAdapter"
id: 60
status: testing
feature_branch: feature/60-filter-adapter  # Set by feature-branch-management
related_commit:
  - 6d8c044  # feat(sdk): initial FilterAdapter interface
  - f00459b  # feat(filters): implement selectattr and map
notes:
  - timestamp: 2024-06-01T12:00:00Z
    user: @john
    note: |
      Implementation complete. All filters implemented with type signatures.
      Awaiting code review and merge.
```

Uses these fields to construct PR title and description.

## Workflow: Creating a Pull Request

### 1. Verify Preconditions

Before creating PR, verify:

- Feature branch exists and is pushed to remote
- Branch is synced with main (no conflicts)
- Work item status is `testing` (or equivalent ready state)
- No PR already exists for this branch (check GitHub)

### 2. Generate PR Title

PR title is auto-generated from work item:

**Format**: `<work-item-id>: <work-item-title>`

**Examples**:

```text
#59: Fix elif parsing edge case
#60: Implement FilterAdapter
#61: Evaluate expression engines
```

**Customization**: User can override title if provided.

### 3. Generate PR Description

PR description is auto-generated from work item and commit history.

**Template**:

```markdown
## Work Item

Closes #<id> - <title>
See: backlog/<id>\_<slug>.md

## Summary

<work_item_notes excerpt (first 200 chars)>

## Implementation Details

<commit messages from related_commit in chronological order>

### Commits

- <commit hash>: <message>
- <commit hash>: <message>
  ...

## Testing

<test_results if recorded>

## Acceptance Criteria

<acceptance criteria from work item body>

## Related Work

<dependencies if any>
```

**Example**:

```markdown
## Work Item

Closes #60 - Implement FilterAdapter
See: backlog/60_implement_filter_adapter.md

## Summary

Implements core filtering operations for FilterAdapter.
Supports filtering sequences by attribute value and projection.

Initial focus: selectattr and map filters.

### Commits

- 6d8c044: feat(sdk): initial FilterAdapter interface
- f00459b: feat(filters): implement selectattr and map
- a1b2c3d: docs: add filter usage examples

## Testing

Local: All 47 tests pass, coverage 89%
CI: Pending review

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] FilterAdapter interface designed and documented
- [x] selectattr and map filters implemented
- [ ] Integration tests pass (pending CI)
- [ ] Code review approved

## Related Work

- Dependency: 54 (complete temple_native)
```

## Customization Options

### 1. Title Override

Allow user to provide custom title:

```yaml
# Input option:
custom_title: "feat: add FilterAdapter with selectattr and map support"

# Result: Uses custom title instead of auto-generated
```

### 2. Template Selection

Support different PR templates for different work item types:

```yaml
# Work item field:
pr_template: feature # or "bugfix", "spike", "refactor"


# Result: Uses matching template from .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/
```

### 3. Draft PR

Create PR in draft mode for early feedback:

```yaml
# Input option:
draft: true

# Result: PR created as Draft, marking work-in-progress
# Can be marked ready-for-review later
```

## Integration with PR Management

### Linking to Work Item

PR description includes work item link:

```markdown
Closes #60
See: backlog/60_implement_filter_adapter.md
```

Enables:

- GitHub auto-linking (PR references issue #60)
- Bidirectional traceability (work item ↔ PR)
- Auto-close on merge (if "Closes" used)

### PR Fields

Created PR populates:

```yaml
repository: squirrel289/pax
base_branch: main
head_branch: feature/60-filter-adapter
title: "60: Implement FilterAdapter"
description: <auto-generated from template>
draft: false # or true if requested
labels: [feature, testing] # Optional: auto-applied based on work item
assignee: <creator> # Optional: auto-assign to work item creator
reviewers: [] # Optional: can be specified in work item or PR template
```

### PR URL

After creation, record in work item:

```yaml
pr_url: "https://github.com/squirrel289/pax/pull/247"
pr_number: 247
```

Related skill [[updating-work-item/SKILL]] can be invoked to record these.

## Workflow: From Work Item to PR

```asciiflow
1. updating-work-item
   ├─ Status: in_progress → testing
   └─ Invokes: create-pr skill

2. create-pr (automatic execution)
   ├─ Read work item metadata
   ├─ Verify branch exists and is synced
   ├─ Generate PR title and description
   ├─ Call pull-request-tool (via PR_MANAGEMENT_INTERFACE)
   └─ Create PR on GitHub

3. PR Created
   ├─ Title: "60: Implement FilterAdapter"
   ├─ Description: Auto-generated from work item + commits
   ├─ Base: main
   ├─ Head: feature/60-filter-adapter
   └─ Status: Open, ready for review

4. Record PR details (optional)
   ├─ updating-work-item again to record pr_number and pr_url
   └─ Or: Work item maintains reference bidirectionally
```

## Interaction Modes (Aspect)

This skill uses the interaction-modes aspect for consistent prompting and decision handling.

- Aspect: [interaction-modes](../../aspects/interaction-modes/ASPECT.md)
- Decision point: `confirm_pr_details`
- Parameter: `interaction-mode` = yolo | collaborative

## Error Handling

### PR Already Exists

```yaml
error: "PR already exists for branch feature/60-filter-adapter"
existing_pr: "https://github.com/squirrel289/pax/pull/247"
action: "Use existing PR or delete branch and create new PR"
```

### Branch Not Found or Not Pushed

```yaml
error: "Branch feature/60-filter-adapter not found on remote origin"
action: "Push branch first: git push origin feature/60-filter-adapter"
hint: "ensure feature-branch-management sync completed successfully"
```

### Work Item Not in Testing Status

```yaml
warning: "Work item #60 status is 'in_progress', not 'testing'"
action: "Run updating-work-item to transition to testing first"
hint: "create-pr triggered automatically on status transition"
```

### Branch Behind Main

```yaml
error: "Branch feature/60-filter-adapter is behind main"
action: "Sync branch first: feature-branch-management sync"
hint: "ensure rebasing completed before PR submission"
```

## Tips & Best Practices

### 1. Commit History Quality

PR description includes commit history. Ensure commits are well-written:

```bash
# Good commit messages
git log --oneline feature/60-filter-adapter ^main
# Output:
# a1b2c3d docs: add filter usage examples
# f00459b feat(filters): implement selectattr and map
# 6d8c044 feat(sdk): initial FilterAdapter interface
```

[[create-pr/SKILL]] will extract these into PR description.

### 2. Work Item Notes

Keep work item `notes` concise and review-ready:

```yaml
notes:
  - timestamp: 2024-06-01T12:00:00Z
    user: @john
    note: |
      Implement FilterAdapter SDK with core filters (selectattr, map, join, default).

      ## Changes
      - temple/sdk/adapter.py: New FilterAdapter class
      - temple/sdk/filters.py: Core filter implementations
      - tests/test_filters.py: Comprehensive test coverage (95%)

      ## Testing
      - All 47 tests pass locally
      - Coverage 89% (target: 85%)
```

This becomes PR description. Keep it clear for reviewers.

### 3. Link Work Items

Ensure PR title includes work item ID:

```text
Good:  "60: Implement FilterAdapter"
Good:  "#60 - Implement FilterAdapter"
Avoid: "Implement FilterAdapter"  # No ID, harder to trace
```

Auto-generation handles this, but verify if customizing.

### 4. Draft PRs for Early Feedback

Use draft mode for work-in-progress or experimental PRs:

```yaml
# Input:
draft: true

# Result: PR marked as Draft
# Reviewers see it's not ready; no review requests sent
# Mark ready-for-review when implementation completes
```

## Debugging

### PR Not Created Despite Invocation

Check:

1. Work item status is `testing` (or ready state)
2. Feature branch exists locally and on remote
3. Branch is synced with main (no conflicts)
4. GitHub authentication works (`gh auth status`)
5. Repository has PR creation permissions

### PR Description Looks Wrong

Check:

1. Work item `notes` field is populated
2. `related_commit` field lists implementation commits
3. Commit messages are clear and follow convention

### Customization Not Applied

Check:

1. Custom options passed correctly (e.g., `custom_title=...`)
2. Interaction mode is set (yolo vs collaborative)
3. Template selection matches available templates in `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/`
