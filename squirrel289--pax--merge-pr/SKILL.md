# Merge PR

A workflow skill that safely merges pull requests after comprehensive verification of readiness.

## Purpose

Automates the PR merge process with proper safety checks, ensuring all requirements are met before merging.

## When to Use

Use this workflow when:

- PR is ready to be merged to main branch
- You want automated verification before merge
- Need to ensure all checks pass
- Want consistent merge process across team

## Skill Composition

This workflow composes:

1. **pull-request-tool**: Check PR status, verify checks, execute merge
2. **sequential-execution**: Step through verification stages
3. **yolo** OR **collaborative**: Execution mode (autonomous vs interactive)

## Parameters

### Required

- **pr-number**: Pull request number to merge
- **repository**: Repository in format `owner/repo`

### Optional

- **interaction-mode**: `yolo` (autonomous) or `collaborative` (ask before merge)
- **merge-method**: `merge` (default), `squash`, or `rebase`
- **delete-branch**: Delete branch after merge (default: true)
- **auto-merge**: Enable auto-merge if checks pending (default: false)
- **require-reviews**: Minimum required approvals (default: 1)
- **require-checks**: Require all status checks pass (default: true)

## Workflow Steps

### Phase 1: Test Parity Gate (Mandatory)

Before any PR verification, enforce the Test Parity Gate:

1. **Run local CI tests** (validating-changes aspect)
   - Execute `pnpm test:affected:ci` on the feature branch
   - If tests fail: Stop and report failure (do not proceed to merge)
   - If tests pass: Continue to Phase 2

2. **Verify no unintended deletions** (guarding-branches aspect)
   - Run `git diff origin/main...HEAD --name-status | grep '^D'`
   - If deletions found: Verify they are intentional (check work item acceptance criteria)
   - If deletions are unintended: Stop and report (do not merge)
   - If deletions are intentional: Continue to Phase 2

**Rationale**: This gate ensures that before any GitHub PR verification, the code has been validated locally and matches the work item scope. Prevents merging code that fails CI locally (which should have been caught in prior phases).

### Phase 2: Pre-Merge Verification

1. **Fetch PR details**
   - Get PR metadata
   - Verify PR is open
   - Check base and head branches

2. **Verify approvals**
   - Check review status
   - Count approvals
   - Verify required approvals met
   - Check for blocking reviews

3. **Check status**
   - Verify mergeable state
   - Check for merge conflicts
   - Verify branch is up to date

4. **Verify CI checks** (guarding-branches aspect)
   - List all status checks
   - Verify required checks pass
   - Check for failing checks
   - Ensure no pending required checks

5. **Check review threads**
   - Verify no unresolved threads (or policy allows)
   - Check for blocking comments

### Phase 3: Merge Decision

1. **Determine merge readiness**

   PR is ready to merge if:
   - ✅ Mergeable state is CLEAN or UNSTABLE (no conflicts)
   - ✅ Required approvals received
   - ✅ All required status checks pass
   - ✅ No blocking review comments
   - ✅ Branch protection rules satisfied

2. **Select merge method**
   - Use specified merge-method parameter
   - Or infer from repo settings/history
   - Default to squash if uncertain

### Phase 4: Execution

1. **Execute merge** (if ready)

   YOLO mode:
   - Merge immediately if all checks pass
   - Report success or failure

   Collaborative mode:
   - Show merge summary
   - Request confirmation
   - Execute after approval

2. **Post-merge cleanup**
   - Invoke `feature-branch-management cleanup` to delete feature branch (local and remote)
   - Verify merge succeeded
   - Check main branch updated
   - Prune remote tracking branches

### Phase 5: Finalization

1. **Verify completion**
   - Confirm PR status is merged
   - Verify commit appears in main
   - Check branch deleted if requested

2. **Report results**
   - Summarize merge operation
   - Report any issues
   - Provide next steps if needed

## Interaction Modes (Aspect)

This skill uses the interaction-modes aspect for decision handling.

- Aspect: [interaction-modes](../../aspects/interaction-modes/ASPECT.md)
- Decision point: `merge_readiness`
- Parameter: `interaction-mode` = yolo | collaborative

## Merge Methods

### Merge Commit (--merge)

- Creates merge commit
- Preserves full history
- Use when: History context important

### Squash and Merge (--squash)

- Combines all commits into one
- Clean linear history
- Use when: Feature commits not important

### Rebase and Merge (--rebase)

- Replays commits on base
- Linear history, preserves commits
- Use when: Clean history with commit granularity

## Auto-Merge Option

When `auto-merge = true`:

- Enables GitHub auto-merge feature
- PR will merge automatically when checks pass
- Useful for:
  - PRs with pending checks
  - Dependabot updates
  - Automated workflows

## Verification Checklist

Before merging, verify:

- [ ] PR is open (not closed/merged already)
- [ ] No merge conflicts
- [ ] Required approvals received
- [ ] All required status checks pass
- [ ] No blocking review comments
- [ ] Branch protection rules satisfied
- [ ] Correct base branch (usually main)
- [ ] Changes reviewed and acceptable

## Error Handling

### Common Issues and Resolutions

1. **Merge conflicts**
   - YOLO: Report blocker, cannot proceed
   - Collaborative: Suggest rebasing or conflict resolution
   - Manual intervention required

2. **Failing status checks**
   - YOLO: Wait or report blocker
   - Collaborative: Show failing checks, ask to wait or investigate
   - Auto-merge option: Enable auto-merge to merge when passes

3. **Missing approvals**
   - YOLO: Report blocker, request reviews
   - Collaborative: Show who can approve, ask to request
   - Cannot proceed without required approvals

4. **Unresolved threads**
   - YOLO: Attempt to resolve if trivial, otherwise report
   - Collaborative: Show threads, ask to resolve
   - Policy-dependent: Some repos allow merging with unresolved

5. **Branch protection violations**
   - Report specific requirement not met
   - Cannot override (requires admin)
   - Must satisfy all rules

## Best Practices

1. **Always verify checks**: Never merge with failing tests
2. **Respect approvals**: Ensure required reviews complete
3. **Clean up branches**: Delete after merge to reduce clutter
4. **Use appropriate method**: Match repo conventions
5. **Verify conflicts**: Check mergeable state first
6. **Update main locally**: Pull after merging
7. **Notify team**: Communication for significant merges
8. **Tag releases**: Create tags for versioned merges

## Safety Guards

Even in YOLO mode, never:

- ❌ Merge with failing required checks
- ❌ Merge without required approvals
- ❌ Merge with conflicts
- ❌ Override branch protection
- ❌ Skip verification steps

Always:

- ✅ Verify PR is ready
- ✅ Check all status checks
- ✅ Confirm approvals present
- ✅ Use safe merge method
- ✅ Report any issues

## Output Format

### YOLO Mode Output

```markdown
TASK: Merge PR #42
STATUS: Success

VERIFICATION:
✅ Approvals: 2/1 required
✅ Status Checks: 8/8 passing
✅ Merge Conflicts: None
✅ Branch Protection: Satisfied

MERGE:
Method: Squash and merge
Commit: abc1234
Branch: feature-xyz (deleted)

RESULT: PR #42 successfully merged to main
```

### Collaborative Mode Output

```markdown
PR Merge Readiness (#42)

Status Checks:
✅ CI Tests (3m 24s)
✅ Linter (45s)
✅ Security Scan (1m 12s)
❌ Integration Tests (failed)

Current Status: NOT READY
Blocker: Integration tests failing

Recommended action: Fix test failures or investigate

Would you like me to:
A) Show test failure details
B) Wait for checks to be fixed and retry
C) Cancel merge operation
```

## Integration Example
