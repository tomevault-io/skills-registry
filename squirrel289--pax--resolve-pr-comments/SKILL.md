# Resolve PR Comments

A workflow skill that systematically addresses and resolves all review comments on a pull request.

## Purpose

Automates the process of reviewing, addressing, and resolving PR review feedback by composing multiple general-purpose skills into a cohesive workflow.

## When to Use

Use this workflow when:

- PR has received review comments that need to be addressed
- You want to systematically work through all feedback
- You need to resolve threads after making changes
- PR is blocked on unresolved review comments

## Skill Composition

This workflow composes:

1. **pull-request-tool**: Fetch review comments, reply to threads, resolve threads
2. **sequential-execution** **OR** **parallel-execution**: Process comments in order (sequential) or concurrently (parallel), handle dependencies as needed
3. **yolo** OR **collaborative**: Execution mode (autonomous vs interactive)

## Parameters

### Required

You must specify the pull request to process using **either** of the following input formats:

- **Separate Parameters:** - **pr-number**: Pull request number (e.g., `42`) - **repository**: Repository in the format `owner/repo` (e.g., `octocat/Hello-World`)

- **Combined URL:** - **pr-url**: Full pull request URL (e.g., `https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/42`)

If both formats are provided, `pr-url` takes precedence.

### Optional

- **interaction-mode**: `yolo` (autonomous) or `collaborative` (interactive)
- **execution-mode**: `sequential` (default) or `parallel`
- **filter**: `unresolved-only` (default), `all`, `by-reviewer`
- **auto-resolve**: Automatically resolve threads after addressing (default: true)
- **reviewer**: Filter comments by specific reviewer

## Workflow Steps

### Phase 1: Discovery

1. **Fetch PR details** (pull-request-tool)
   - Get PR metadata
   - Verify PR is open
   - Check current status

2. **List review comments** (pull-request-tool)
   - Get all review threads
   - Filter based on parameters
   - Group by file and thread

### Phase 2: Analysis

1. **Analyze comments** (sequential-execution OR parallel-execution)
   - Categorize by type (question, change request, suggestion)
   - Identify dependencies between comments
   - Prioritize or group for resolution

2. **Plan approach**
   - Determine which comments need code changes
   - Which need clarification/discussion
   - Which can be resolved with replies

### Phase 3: Resolution

1. **Address each comment** (sequential-execution OR parallel-execution)

   For each comment (in order or concurrently, based on execution-mode):

   a. **Review the feedback** - Read comment and context - Understand the request - Check referenced code

   b. **Determine action** - Code change needed? - Just needs reply/clarification? - Already addressed?

   c. **Take action** - Make code changes if needed - Reply to thread with explanation - Mark as resolved if appropriate

   d. **Verify resolution** - Ensure change addresses feedback - Run tests if code changed - Confirm reviewer intent met

### Phase 4: Finalization

1. **Push changes** (if any code changes made)
   - Commit all changes
   - Push to PR branch
   - Trigger CI checks

2. **Final verification**
   - Verify all targeted comments addressed
   - Check for any new comments
   - Update PR description if needed

## Interaction and Execution Modes

### YOLO Mode (Autonomous)

```markdown
When interaction-mode = yolo:

- Automatically determine best response to each comment
- Make code changes without confirmation
- Auto-resolve threads after addressing
- Report only final summary
```

### Collaborative Mode (Interactive)

```markdown
When interaction-mode = collaborative:

- Show each comment to user
- Propose response/change
- Get approval before proceeding
- Confirm before resolving threads
```

### Sequential vs Parallel Execution

- **sequential**: Comments are processed one after another, respecting dependencies.
- **parallel**: Independent comments are processed concurrently for faster resolution.

## Example Workflows

### Example 1: YOLO + Parallel

```markdown
Task: Resolve all unresolved PR comments on PR #42 in owner/repo using parallel execution

Execution:

1. Fetch unresolved comments (5 found)
2. Process all comments in parallel:
   - Comment 1: "Add error handling" → Add try/catch, reply, resolve
   - Comment 2: "Fix typo" → Fix, reply, resolve
   - ...
3. Push changes
4. Report: "Resolved 5 comments, updated 3 files"
```

### Example 2: Collaborative + Sequential

```markdown
Task: Address review comments collaboratively, one at a time

Execution:

1. Fetch 3 unresolved comments
2. Show comment 1, get user input, apply change, resolve
3. Repeat for each comment in order
4. Show summary, push changes
```

## Output Format

### YOLO Mode Output

```markdown
TASK: Resolve PR Comments (#42)
STATUS: Complete

COMMENTS ADDRESSED: 8/8

- 5 required code changes
- 2 clarifications
- 1 acknowledgment

FILES MODIFIED:

- src/auth.ts (2 changes)
- src/api.ts (1 change)
- src/utils.ts (2 changes)

THREADS RESOLVED: 8
CHANGES PUSHED: Yes
CI STATUS: Passing
```

### Collaborative Mode Output

```plaintext
PR Comment Resolution Progress

✅ Comment 1/8 - "Add error handling" - Resolved
✅ Comment 2/8 - "Fix typo" - Resolved
⏳ Comment 3/8 - "Refactor function" - In progress

Current: Reviewing proposed refactoring approach
Next: 5 comments remaining
```

## Error Handling

### Common Issues

1. **Conflict with recent changes**
   - Pull latest changes
   - Re-evaluate comment applicability
   - Resolve conflicts if needed

2. **Unclear feedback**
   - YOLO: Make best-effort interpretation, document assumption
   - Collaborative: Ask user for clarification

3. **Comment already addressed**
   - Verify fix is present
   - Reply explaining it's addressed
   - Resolve thread

4. **Tests fail after changes**
   - YOLO: Attempt auto-fix, revert if fails
   - Collaborative: Show failure, ask for guidance

## Best Practices

1. **Process in logical order**: Group related comments, handle dependencies first
2. **Verify before resolving**: Ensure feedback truly addressed
3. **Clear communication**: Explain what was done in thread replies
4. **Test after changes**: Run tests before pushing
5. **Commit logically**: Group related changes in commits
6. **Update PR description**: Reflect significant changes made
7. **Track progress**: Use todo list for multi-comment PRs
8. **Request re-review**: Notify reviewers of significant changes

## Integration Example

```markdown
# Full PR processing using composed skills

1. resolve-pr-comments (this workflow)
   - Uses: pull-request-tool + sequential-execution OR parallel-execution + yolo
   - Addresses all review feedback

2. Check CI status
   - Uses: pull-request-tool
   - Verify tests pass

3. Merge PR
   - Uses: merge-pr workflow
   - Complete the process
```
