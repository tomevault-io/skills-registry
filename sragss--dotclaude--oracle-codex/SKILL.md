# Codex Oracle

Use OpenAI Codex CLI as a **planning oracle** and **code reviewer**. Codex provides analysis and recommendations; Claude synthesizes and presents to the user.

**Critical**: This skill is for planning and review ONLY. Never use Codex to implement changes.

## Prerequisites

Before invoking Codex, validate availability:

```bash
~/.claude/skills/oracle-codex/scripts/check-codex.sh
```

If the script exits non-zero, display the error message and stop. Do not proceed without Codex CLI.

## Configuration Defaults

| Setting   | Default                       | User Override                                   |
| --------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Model     | `gpt-5.2-codex`               | "use model X" or "with gpt-5.2-codex"           |
| Reasoning | Dynamic (based on complexity) | "use medium reasoning" or "with xhigh effort"   |
| Sandbox   | `read-only`                   | Not overridable (safety constraint)             |
| Timeout   | 5 minutes minimum             | Estimate based on task complexity               |
| Profile   | `quiet` (notify=[])           | User opts into another profile or notifications |

### Timeout Guidelines

When invoking `codex exec` via the Bash tool, always set an appropriate timeout:

- **Minimum**: 5 minutes (300000ms) for any Codex operation
- **Simple queries** (single file review, focused question): 5 minutes (300000ms)
- **Moderate complexity** (multi-file review, feature planning): 10 minutes (600000ms)
- **High complexity** (architecture analysis, large codebase planning): 15 minutes (900000ms)

### Reasoning Effort Guidelines

Select reasoning effort based on task complexity:

| Complexity | Effort   | Examples                                                      |
| ---------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Simple     | `low`    | Single file review, syntax check, quick question              |
| Moderate   | `medium` | Multi-file review, focused feature planning, bug analysis     |
| Complex    | `high`   | Architecture analysis, cross-cutting concerns, security audit |
| Maximum    | `xhigh`  | Large codebase planning, comprehensive design, deep reasoning |

**Selection heuristics:**

- **`low`**: Task involves \<3 files, simple question, or quick validation
- **`medium`**: Task involves 3-10 files or requires moderate analysis
- **`high`**: Task spans multiple modules or requires architectural thinking
- **`xhigh`**: Task requires comprehensive codebase understanding or critical decisions

For available models and reasoning levels, consult `references/codex-flags.md`.

## Workflow

### 1. Validate Prerequisites

Run the check script. On failure, report the installation instructions and abort.

### 2. Determine Mode

- **Planning mode**: User wants architecture, implementation approach, or design decisions
- **Review mode**: User wants code analysis, bug detection, or improvement suggestions

### 3. Construct Prompt

Build a focused prompt for Codex based on mode:

**Planning prompt template:**

```
Analyze this codebase and provide a detailed implementation plan for: [user request]

Focus on:
- Architecture decisions and trade-offs
- Files to create or modify
- Implementation sequence
- Potential risks or blockers

Do NOT implement anything. Provide analysis and recommendations only.
```

**Review prompt template:**

```
Review the following code for:
- Bugs and logic errors
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance issues
- Code quality and maintainability
- Adherence to best practices

[code or file paths]

Provide specific, actionable feedback with file locations and line references.
```

### 4. Assess Complexity and Execute Codex

Before executing, assess task complexity to select appropriate reasoning effort:

1. **Count files involved** in the query
1. **Evaluate scope** (single module vs cross-cutting)
1. **Consider depth** (surface review vs architectural analysis)

Use HEREDOC syntax for safe prompt handling. **Always use the Bash tool's timeout parameter** (minimum 300000ms / 5 minutes).

Redirect output to a temp file to avoid context bloat and race conditions.

**Step 1**: Generate a unique temp file path using `$RANDOM` for randomness:

```bash
CODEX_OUTPUT="/tmp/codex-${RANDOM}${RANDOM}.txt"
```

**Step 2**: Execute Codex and redirect output to the temp file:

```bash
# Select EFFORT based on complexity assessment (low/medium/high/xhigh)
# Bash tool timeout: 300000-900000ms based on complexity
codex exec \
  -m "${MODEL:-gpt-5.2-codex}" \
  -c "model_reasoning_effort=${EFFORT}" \
  --profile "${CODEX_PROFILE:-quiet}" \
  -s read-only \
  --skip-git-repo-check \
  2>/dev/null <<'EOF' > "$CODEX_OUTPUT"
[constructed prompt]
EOF
```

**Important flags:**

- `-m`: Model selection
- `-c model_reasoning_effort=`: Reasoning depth (low/medium/high/xhigh) — select based on Reasoning Effort Guidelines
- `--profile quiet`: Default for this skill (suppresses notify hooks); change only if the user explicitly wants another profile/notifications
- `-s read-only`: Prevents any file modifications (non-negotiable)
- `--skip-git-repo-check`: Works outside git repositories
- `2>/dev/null`: Suppresses thinking tokens from output

**Bash tool timeout**: Estimate based on task complexity (see Timeout Guidelines above). Never use the default 2-minute timeout for Codex operations.

### 5. Present Codex Output

**Step 3**: Read the analysis from the temp file and display to the user:

```bash
cat "$CODEX_OUTPUT"
```

Format the output with clear attribution:

```
## Codex Analysis

[Codex output from the temp file]

---
Model: gpt-5.2-codex | Reasoning: [selected effort level]
```

For very large outputs (>5000 lines), summarize key sections rather than displaying everything.

### 6. Synthesize and Plan

After presenting Codex output:

1. Synthesize key insights from Codex analysis
1. Identify actionable items and critical decisions
1. **If Codex's analysis presents multiple viable approaches or significant trade-offs**, consider using `AskUserQuestion` to clarify user preferences before finalizing the plan
1. Write a structured plan to `~/.claude/plans/[plan-name].md`
1. Call `ExitPlanMode` to present the plan for user approval

**When to use AskUserQuestion:**

- Codex proposes multiple architectures with different trade-offs
- Technology or library choices need user input
- Scope decisions (minimal vs comprehensive) are ambiguous

**Skip clarification when:**

- Codex's recommendations are clear and unambiguous
- User's original request already specified preferences
- Only one viable approach exists

## Error Handling

| Error               | Response                                              |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Codex not installed | Show installation instructions from check script      |
| Codex timeout       | Inform user, suggest simpler query or lower reasoning |
| API rate limit      | Wait and retry, or inform user of limit               |
| Empty response      | Retry once, then report failure                       |

## Usage Examples

### Planning Request

User: "Ask Codex to plan how to add authentication to this app"

1. Validate Codex CLI available
1. Gather relevant codebase context
1. Assess complexity → auth spans multiple modules → `high` reasoning
1. Construct planning prompt with auth requirements
1. Execute Codex with `gpt-5.2-codex` and `high`
1. Present Codex's architecture recommendations
1. Synthesize into Claude plan format
1. Write to `~/.claude/plans/` and call `ExitPlanMode`

### Code Review Request

User: "Have Codex review the changes in src/auth/"

1. Validate Codex CLI available
1. Read files in `src/auth/` directory
1. Assess complexity → single directory, focused review → `medium` reasoning
1. Construct review prompt with file contents
1. Execute Codex review with `medium`
1. Present findings with file/line references
1. Summarize critical issues and recommendations
