# Structured Git Commits

## Purpose

Git commits are the only artifact that is always present, always versioned, and
always co-located with the code. This skill turns them into a lightweight agent
memory layer by enforcing structured trailers with a controlled vocabulary,
making every commit both human-scannable and machine-queryable.

## When to Use

- Every `git commit` during agentic coding sessions
- When committing on behalf of a user in Claude Code or similar tools
- When generating commit messages from diffs or change descriptions
- When reconstructing session context from commit history

## Commit Format

Read the full specification: `references/commit-format.md`

### Quick Reference

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>          ← 72 chars max, imperative mood

<body>                               ← What and why, wrapped at 72 chars

Intent: <intent-type>                ← REQUIRED — from controlled vocabulary
Scope: <domain/module>[, ...]        ← REQUIRED — affected areas
Decided-Against: <alternative>       ← Optional — rejected approaches
Session: <session-id>                ← Optional — groups related commits
Refs: <commit|issue|doc>[, ...]      ← Optional — related artifacts
Context: <compact-json>             ← Optional — rich structured metadata
```

### Intent Taxonomy (Controlled Vocabulary)

These are the ONLY valid values for the `Intent:` trailer. Read the full
definitions and usage guidance: `references/intent-taxonomy.md`

| Intent | When to use |
|--------|-------------|
| `enable-capability` | Adding new user-facing or system capability |
| `fix-defect` | Correcting incorrect behavior |
| `improve-quality` | Non-functional improvement (perf, readability, resilience) |
| `restructure` | Architectural change, module extraction, code movement |
| `configure-infra` | Tooling, CI/CD, dependencies, build system |
| `document` | Documentation, ADRs, comments, API docs |
| `explore` | Spike, prototype, hypothesis validation |
| `resolve-blocker` | Unblocking a dependent task or workflow |

### Trailer Rules

1. **Intent** — REQUIRED. Exactly one value from the taxonomy.
2. **Scope** — REQUIRED. Comma-separated `domain/module` paths. Use the same
   vocabulary as your project's directory structure or domain model. The Scope
   trailer provides richer domain-level filtering than the header's parenthetical
   scope, which is optimized for log readability.
3. **Decided-Against** — Include whenever a non-trivial alternative was
   considered and rejected. This is the highest-value trailer for agent memory.
   Format: `<approach> (<reason>)` or multiple on separate trailers.
4. **Session** — ISO date + slug: `2025-02-08/passkey-lib`. Groups commits
   from the same logical working session.
5. **Refs** — Commit SHAs (short), issue numbers, doc paths. Comma-separated.
6. **Context** — Compact single-line JSON for structured metadata that doesn't
   fit in other trailers. Use sparingly. Example:
   `Context: {"migration":"v2-to-v3","tables":["users","sessions"],"rollback":true}`

## Generating Commit Messages

### From a Diff

When given a diff (or after making changes), follow this process:

1. **Classify the change type** — Map to Conventional Commits type:
   `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `perf`, `docs`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`
2. **Identify the narrowest scope** — What module or domain boundary does this
   touch? Use the parenthetical scope in the subject line.
3. **Write the subject in imperative mood** — "add", "fix", "extract", not
   "added", "fixes", "extracted". Max 72 characters including type and scope.
4. **Write the body** — Explain *what* changed and *why*. Not *how* — the diff
   shows how. Wrap at 72 characters.
5. **Select the Intent** — From the controlled vocabulary. If uncertain between
   two, choose the one that describes the *motivation*, not the *mechanism*.
6. **List the Scope** — Domain paths affected. Be specific enough for filtering
   but not so granular that every file is listed.
7. **Record decisions** — If you considered alternatives, add `Decided-Against`
   trailers. This is the most valuable information for future agents. If you
   evaluated alternatives during implementation, record them immediately in a
   scratch note. Do not rely on memory at commit time. Format each entry as
   `<approach> (<reason>)` - the approach as a noun phrase, the reason as a
   concise clause in parentheses.

### From a Description

When the user describes what they want committed (e.g., "commit this with a
message about adding the auth flow"):

1. Review the staged changes (`git diff --cached`) to ground the message in
   actual code changes, not just the user's description.
2. Follow the same process as above.
3. Present the commit message for user review before committing.

### Multi-file Changes

If a commit touches multiple domains, consider whether it should be split. A
good heuristic: if the `Scope` trailer would have more than 3 entries, the
commit likely conflates multiple logical changes.

## Querying Commit History (Agent Memory Reconstruction)

### For Agents Loading Context

Agents reconstructing session context should query in this order:

```bash
# 1. Recent session commits (most common)
git log --format='%H %s' --grep='Session: 2025-02-08' -- .

# 2. Intent-filtered history
git log --format='%H %s' --grep='Intent: enable-capability' --since='1 week ago'

# 3. Decision archaeology (highest value for avoiding repeated work)
git log --format='%B' --grep='Decided-Against' -- path/to/module

# 4. Full structured parse of recent commits
git log -20 --format='---commit---%nHash: %H%nDate: %aI%nSubject: %s%n%b'
```

### Parsing Trailers Programmatically

```bash
# Extract all trailers from a specific commit
git log -1 --format='%(trailers)' <commit-hash>

# Extract a specific trailer value
git log -1 --format='%(trailers:key=Intent)' <commit-hash>

# All intents in the last 50 commits
git log -50 --format='%(trailers:key=Intent,valueonly)' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
```

A Deno parsing utility is available at `scripts/parse-commits.ts` for
richer queries and structured output:

```bash
# What was last done in module X?
deno task parse --scope=auth --limit=1

# Did anyone try approach Y before?
deno task parse --decided-against=redis

# What blockers have we hit?
deno task parse --intent=resolve-blocker

# What's being explored? (with full body for findings)
deno task parse --intent=explore --with-body

# All decisions in a specific session
deno task parse --session=2025-02-08/passkey-lib --decisions-only
```

## Examples

### Simple Feature

```
feat(auth): add passkey registration for AI agent identities

Implement WebAuthn registration flow supporting non-human identity types.
Agent identities use deterministic key derivation instead of user gestures,
enabling automated credential provisioning during agent onboarding.

Intent: enable-capability
Scope: auth/registration, identity/agent
Decided-Against: OAuth2 client credentials (no hardware binding guarantee)
Session: 2025-02-08/passkey-lib
```

### Bug Fix with Decision Context

```
fix(api): prevent duplicate webhook delivery on retry timeout

Race condition between retry scheduler and delivery confirmation caused
duplicate POST requests when upstream responded between 28-30 seconds
(inside the timeout window but after retry was already queued).

Intent: fix-defect
Scope: api/webhooks, infra/scheduler
Decided-Against: idempotency key at receiver (shifts burden to consumers)
Decided-Against: longer timeout window (masks upstream latency issues)
Refs: #1847, abc123f
```

### Architectural Refactor

```
refactor(orders): extract pricing engine from order aggregate

Pricing logic was embedded in the Order aggregate root, making it
impossible to test pricing rules independently or reuse them in the
quote flow. Extract to a standalone PricingEngine module with pure
function interface.

Intent: restructure
Scope: orders/pricing, orders/aggregate, quotes/pricing
Decided-Against: shared library approach (coupling between bounded contexts)
Context: {"pattern":"extract-module","loc_moved":340,"tests_added":12}
Session: 2025-02-08/order-decomposition
```

### Exploratory Spike

```
feat(search): prototype vector similarity search with pgvector

Spike to validate whether pgvector can handle our embedding dimensions
(1536) at current document scale (~2M rows) with acceptable p99 latency.
Results: p99 = 45ms with HNSW index, acceptable for async enrichment
but not for synchronous search path.

Intent: explore
Scope: search/vector, infra/postgres
Decided-Against: Pinecone (operational complexity, vendor lock-in)
Decided-Against: in-memory FAISS (no persistence, scaling concerns)
Context: {"benchmark":{"p50_ms":12,"p99_ms":45,"rows":"2M","index":"hnsw"}}
Session: 2025-02-07/vector-search-spike
```

### Infrastructure Configuration

```
build(ci): add parallel test execution with Deno workspaces

Configure CI pipeline to run workspace tests in parallel using Deno's
built-in workspace support. Reduces CI time from ~8min to ~3min by
running independent workspace tests concurrently.

Intent: configure-infra
Scope: ci/pipeline, build/workspaces
Decided-Against: custom test orchestrator script (unnecessary given native support)
```

## Anti-Patterns

- **Scope as file paths** — Use domain concepts (`auth/registration`), not
  file paths (`src/modules/auth/handlers/register.ts`).
- **Multiple intents per commit** — If you need two intents, split the commit.
- **Empty body** — The subject line is not enough. Agents need the *why*.
- **`Context` as a dumping ground** — Only use for genuinely structured data
  that other trailers can't express. If you're putting prose in `Context`,
  it belongs in the body.
- **Generic scopes** — `Scope: backend` tells agents nothing useful.
  `Scope: auth/session, api/middleware` enables filtering.
- **Omitting `Decided-Against`** — When you consider alternatives and don't
  record them, the next agent will waste time re-evaluating the same options.
