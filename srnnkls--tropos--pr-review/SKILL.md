# PR Review Skill

Interactive GitHub PR review workflow: fetch PR, iterate findings with clarification, manage draft comments, submit when ready.

**Delegates to:** `code-review` for methodology, `code-implement` for language guidelines.

**Requires:** `gh-review` extension (`gh extension install srnnkls/gh-review`)

---

## When to Use

- Reviewing PRs on GitHub repositories
- When asked to review `owner/repo#N` or just `#N`
- Posting structured feedback with inline code comments

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Configure Review

Use **AskUserQuestion** to gather configuration (see `code-review` for details):
- Focus areas: correctness, style, performance, security
- Severity threshold: blocking, high, all
- Scope: full, quick

### Step 2: Fetch PR Context

```bash
gh pr view {pr} --repo {owner}/{repo} --json title,body,files,commits,additions,deletions
gh pr diff {pr} --repo {owner}/{repo}
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr} --jq '.head.sha'  # Get commit SHA
```

### Step 3: Check Existing Drafts

Fetch any pending review from previous session:

```bash
gh review comments {pr} -R {owner}/{repo} --mine --states=pending
```

If drafts exist, display them and offer to continue or discard.

### Step 4: Check Related Issues

```bash
gh issue view {issue} --repo {owner}/{repo} --json title,body
```

### Step 5: Delegate to Review Skills

**Detect language** from file extensions:
```bash
gh pr view {pr} --repo {owner}/{repo} --json files --jq '.files[].path' | \
  sed 's/.*\.//' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
```

**Load review methodology:**
- `code-review` - Generic review process and checklist

**Load language guidelines:**
- `~/.claude/skills/code-implement/resources/loqui/languages/{language}/*` - Load language-specific resources based on file extensions

### Step 6: Reference Style Guides

Compare against:
- Project style guides (STYLE.md, CLAUDE.md)
- Established patterns from related issues

### Step 7: Iterate Findings with Clarification

For each potential issue identified:

1. **Present finding** - Show code context and concern
2. **Ask context-aware questions** via `AskUserQuestion` with `multiSelect`:
   - Type changes → "Is type widening intentional?"
   - Error handling removed → "Was this error path obsolete?"
   - Performance-sensitive code → "Acceptable trade-off?"
   - General → "Flag this?", "Severity level?"
3. **Batch decisions** - Allow selecting multiple findings to flag/dismiss

### Step 8: Create/Update Draft Comments

For each confirmed finding, add to pending review:

```bash
gh review add {pr} -R {owner}/{repo} -p {file_path} -l {line} -b "{comment_body}"
```

For multi-line comments:
```bash
gh review add {pr} -R {owner}/{repo} -p {file_path} -l {end_line} --start-line {start_line} -b "{comment_body}"
```

To update an existing draft:
```bash
gh review edit {pr} -R {owner}/{repo} -c {comment_id} -b "{updated_body}"
```

To remove a draft:
```bash
gh review delete {pr} -R {owner}/{repo} -c {comment_id}
```

### Step 9: Submit or Keep Draft

Use **AskUserQuestion** to determine action:

**Options:**
- **Submit now** → Choose verdict (approve, request_changes, comment)
- **Keep as draft** → Leave pending for later continuation

To submit:
```bash
gh review submit {pr} -R {owner}/{repo} -v {approve|request_changes|comment} -b "{summary}"
```

To discard and start fresh:
```bash
gh review discard {pr} -R {owner}/{repo}
```

## Key Gotchas

- **Line numbers**: Use actual file line numbers (not diff positions) with `gh review`
- **Comment IDs**: GraphQL node IDs (e.g., `PRRC_kwDOABC123`) - get with `--ids` flag
- **Comment format**: Supports markdown, suggestion blocks with triple backticks
