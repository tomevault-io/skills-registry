# Splunk Analyzer

Automate Splunk searches via browser and analyze exported results.

## Configuration

```
SPLUNK_URL: https://your-splunk-instance.com
```

## Workflow

### 1. Navigate to Splunk

```
Navigate to: {SPLUNK_URL}/en-US/app/search/search
```

If login page appears, inform user: "Please authenticate in the browser. Let me know when you're logged in."

### 2. Build SPL Query

Convert natural language to SPL. See [references/spl-patterns.md](references/spl-patterns.md) for patterns.

**Query structure:**
```spl
index=<index> sourcetype=<sourcetype> <filters> | <transformations>
```

If user provides raw SPL, use it directly.

### 3. Execute Search

See [references/splunk-ui.md](references/splunk-ui.md) for UI selectors.

1. Find search bar (textarea with `data-test="search-bar"` or class `ace_text-input`)
2. Clear existing text, enter SPL query
3. Click search button (button with `data-test="search-button"` or "Search" text)
4. Wait for results (watch for "X events" or results table)

### 4. Export Results

1. Click "Export" button above results
2. Select "Raw" format
3. Set filename, click "Export"
4. Wait for download to complete

### 5. Analyze Results

Run analysis script on exported file:

```bash
python3 scripts/analyze_splunk.py <exported_file> [--charts]
```

**Analysis includes:**
- Event count and time range
- Top error patterns / log levels
- Field value distributions
- Anomaly detection (spikes, unusual values)
- Trend visualization (with `--charts`)

## Quick Reference

| User Request | Action |
|--------------|--------|
| "Check errors in service X" | `index=* "error" source="*X*" \| stats count by message` |
| "Show me logs from last hour" | `index=* earliest=-1h` |
| "Find slow requests" | `index=* duration>1000 \| stats avg(duration) by endpoint` |
| "Summarize today's exceptions" | Run query + full analysis with charts |
