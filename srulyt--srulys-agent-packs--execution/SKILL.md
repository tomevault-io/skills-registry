# Ralph Execution Skill

## MANDATORY: Skill Loaded Confirmation

You MUST output this as your FIRST action after reading state:

```
[RALPH-SKILL] Loaded: .github/skills/execution/SKILL.md for phase 5 (execution)
```

If you don't output this, the loop may not recognize skill loading occurred.

---

**Loaded**: execution skill (phase 5). **Objective**: Implement ONE plan phase, update state, create signal file, yield signal, exit.

---

You're in the execution phase (Phase 5). Time to implement the plan.

## Your Context

- **Spec**: `.ralph-stm/runs/{session}/spec.md` - What to build
- **Plan**: `.ralph-stm/runs/{session}/plan.md` - How to build it
- **State**: `current_plan_phase` in `state.json` - Which phase you're on
- **Discovery Notes**: `.ralph-stm/runs/{session}/discovery-notes.md` - Conventions and patterns observed

---

## Execution Protocol

### One Plan Phase Per Invocation

Each time you run in Phase 5, implement ONE plan phase:

1. Read `current_plan_phase` from state
2. Read that phase's details from `plan.md`
3. Implement that phase completely
4. Test if appropriate
5. Update state with `current_plan_phase + 1`
6. Create signal file
7. Log your work
8. Output yield signal
9. Exit

### Determining Current Task

```
current_plan_phase = 1 → Implement Plan Phase 1
current_plan_phase = 2 → Implement Plan Phase 2
...
current_plan_phase = N → Implement Plan Phase N
current_plan_phase > total_plan_phases → Transition to Phase 6 (verification)
```

---

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Quality

1. **Follow Existing Patterns**
   - Match the codebase's style
   - Use same naming conventions
   - Follow established architecture

2. **Incremental Changes**
   - Make changes that build on each other
   - Each phase should result in working (if incomplete) code
   - Avoid breaking existing functionality

3. **Document As You Go**
   - Add code comments where logic is complex
   - Update any relevant documentation
   - Log decisions in event files

### Convention Compliance

Before implementing, review `discovery-notes.md` for:
- Variable/method naming conventions observed in the codebase
- Comment styles and documentation patterns
- Error handling approaches
- Logging conventions

Match these patterns in your implementation to maintain consistency.

### File Operations

**Creating Files**:
- Create complete, working files
- Include necessary imports
- Add appropriate comments/docstrings

**Modifying Files**:
- Make surgical changes
- Preserve existing functionality
- Don't refactor unrelated code

**Deleting Files**:
- Only delete files specified in plan
- Verify no other code depends on them

---

## Minimal Change Patterns

### Core Principles

These principles apply regardless of what editing tools are available:

#### 1. Minimal Change Principle
**Only modify what's necessary to implement the requirement.**

- If you need to change one function, change only that function
- Resist the urge to "improve" nearby code
- Each change should trace to a specific requirement

#### 2. Surgical Edit Principle
**Target specific sections, not entire files.**

- Identify the exact lines that need modification
- Understand the surrounding context before editing
- Make precise, focused changes

#### 3. Scope Discipline
**Don't touch code outside the plan.**

- Changes not in the plan require justification
- "Drive-by" fixes create scope creep and risk
- Note improvements for follow-up tasks instead

#### 4. Verification Principle
**Always verify changes work.**

- Run relevant tests after changes
- Check that the application still builds
- Validate the change achieves the requirement

### Large File Handling (> 200 lines)

When working with large files:

1. **Locate**: Find the specific section you need to modify
2. **Understand**: Read only the relevant section plus immediate context
3. **Edit**: Make targeted changes to that section only
4. **Verify**: Confirm changes work and don't break adjacent code

### Multiple Changes in Same File

When making multiple edits to one file:
- Plan all changes before starting
- Consider change ordering to avoid conflicts
- Work from bottom to top if changes affect line numbers
- Verify after each significant change

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**DON'T**:
- Rewrite entire files when only a few lines need changes
- Load complete large files when you only need one section
- Make cosmetic changes unrelated to the task
- "Improve" code style inconsistencies outside scope
- Add documentation to unrelated functions

---

## Scope Enforcement

Before each edit, verify:
- [ ] This file is in the plan's scope
- [ ] This change traces to a requirement in spec
- [ ] No "drive-by" refactoring of unrelated code

**Forbidden**:
- Renaming variables not in scope
- Adding documentation to existing code (unless in scope)
- Reformatting files you're modifying
- "Improving" code outside the task

If you notice something that should be fixed but is out of scope:
- Note it in the event log
- Do NOT fix it
- It can be addressed in a follow-up

---

## Context Management

### Budget Awareness

Be aware of context consumption:
- Small files (< 200 lines): Safe to load fully
- Medium files (200-500 lines): Load targeted sections
- Large files (500+ lines): Surgical access only

### Pressure Response

If you notice context getting crowded:
1. **Yellow (many files read)**: Focus on essentials, stop exploratory reads
2. **Orange (approaching limits)**: Complete current task, checkpoint progress
3. **Red (risk of truncation)**: Immediate checkpoint, minimal output

### Efficient Patterns

DO:
- Note line numbers when reading for later edits
- Extract only needed methods, not full files
- Keep notes about file structure instead of full content

DON'T:
- Load entire large files when you only need one method
- Re-read files you've already examined
- Load files "just in case"

## Testing During Execution

### When to Test

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Phase includes tests in scope | Run those tests |
| Changed critical logic | Run related tests |
| Phase complete | Run quick smoke test if available |
| Test fails | Fix in same invocation if simple |

### Handling Test Failures

**Simple Fix (< 5 min)**:
- Fix the issue
- Re-run tests
- Continue if passing

**Complex Fix**:
- Document the failure in event log
- Set checkpoint with failure details
- Complete current phase as best as possible
- Phase 6 (verification) will catch and address

---

## Error Handling

### Build/Compile Errors

1. Read the error message carefully
2. Fix the root cause
3. Rebuild
4. Continue if successful

### Runtime Errors

1. Identify the source
2. Check if caused by your changes
3. Fix and verify
4. Document in event log

### External Failures (Network, Dependencies)

1. Retry once
2. If persistent, note in event log
3. Continue if non-blocking
4. If blocking, document and set error status

---

## State Update Reminder

**CRITICAL**: Before exiting, you MUST update state.json with:

### Always Update
- `updated_at`: Current ISO-8601 timestamp
- `last_task`: Brief description of what you did
- `last_event_id`: Increment if you wrote an event

### After Each Plan Phase (staying in Phase 5)

```json
{
  "phase": "execution",
  "phase_id": 5,
  "status": "in_progress",
  "current_plan_phase": {previous + 1},
  "updated_at": "{timestamp}",
  "last_task": "{description of what you implemented}",
  "last_event_id": {incremented},
  "checkpoint": {
    "can_resume": true,
    "resume_hint": "{what to do next}"
  }
}
```

### When All Plan Phases Complete (transition to Phase 6)

```json
{
  "phase": "verification",
  "phase_id": 6,
  "status": "in_progress",
  "current_plan_phase": {total},
  "updated_at": "{timestamp}",
  "last_task": "execution-complete",
  "last_event_id": {incremented},
  "checkpoint": {
    "can_resume": true,
    "resume_hint": "Run verification tests against acceptance criteria"
  }
}
```

---

## Phase Completion Reminder

Before exiting, you MUST:

1. Update state.json with all required fields
2. Create signal file: `signals/phase-5-{plan_phase}-complete.signal`
3. Write event log
4. Output yield signal
5. Exit immediately - do NOT start next plan phase

### Signal File Format

Path: `.ralph-stm/runs/{session}/signals/phase-5-{plan_phase}-complete.signal`

```json
{
  "phase_id": 5,
  "phase_name": "execution",
  "plan_phase": {current_plan_phase},
  "completed_at": "{ISO-8601}",
  "next_phase": 5,
  "skill_loaded": ".github/skills/execution/SKILL.md",
  "artifacts_created": ["list", "of", "files", "created"]
}
```

---

## Yield Signal

Output before every exit:

```
[RALPH-YIELD]
phase_completed: 5
next_phase: {5 or 6}
status: in_progress
signal_file: .ralph-stm/runs/{session}/signals/phase-5-{N}-complete.signal
work_done: {description of what was implemented}
[/RALPH-YIELD]
```

---

## Event Logging

Write detailed event logs for each execution phase:

```markdown
# Event: {N} - Execution - {Plan Phase Name}

**Timestamp**: {ISO-8601}
**Phase**: execution (5)
**Session**: {session_id}
**Plan Phase**: {current_plan_phase} of {total_plan_phases}

## Objective
{What this plan phase aimed to achieve}

## Implementation Summary
{What you actually did}

## Files Changed
- `path/to/file1.ext` (created)
  - {What this file does}
- `path/to/file2.ext` (modified)
  - {What changes were made}

## Code Decisions
- {Decision 1}: {Rationale}
- {Decision 2}: {Rationale}

## Tests Run
- {Test 1}: {pass/fail}
- {Test 2}: {pass/fail}

## Issues Encountered
- {Issue 1}: {How resolved}

## State Changes
- Previous: current_plan_phase={N-1}
- Current: current_plan_phase={N}

## Next Plan Phase
{What comes next in the plan}
```

---

## Autonomy Principles

### Make Progress

- Don't get stuck on minor decisions
- Choose reasonable defaults
- Document choices in event log

### Handle Blockers

| Blocker Type | Response |
|--------------|----------|
| Missing dependency | Install it |
| Unclear requirement | Check spec, make best interpretation |
| Test failure | Fix or document |
| External service down | Mock or skip if possible |

### When to Ask for Help

Only if:
- Spec is fundamentally ambiguous on core requirement
- Implementation would conflict with explicit user request
- Critical security/data concern not addressed in spec

Otherwise, proceed and document.

---

## Heartbeat Updates

During long operations (builds, tests, large file operations):

Update `.ralph-stm/runs/{session}/heartbeat.json`:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "{ISO-8601}",
  "activity": "implementing {plan phase name}",
  "expected_duration_minutes": {estimate},
  "task": "phase-{N}-{brief-description}"
}
```

Update every 2-3 minutes during long tasks that don't produce file changes.

---

## Checklist Before Exit

- [ ] **[RALPH-SKILL] confirmation output at start**
- [ ] Plan phase objective achieved
- [ ] **All changes within scope** (no drive-by refactors)
- [ ] All files created/modified as needed
- [ ] Code compiles/runs without errors
- [ ] Tests run if appropriate
- [ ] Event log written
- [ ] **Signal file created**
- [ ] `current_plan_phase` incremented in state
- [ ] `updated_at` timestamp updated

---

## Transition to Verification

When `current_plan_phase > total_plan_phases`:

1. Update state to Phase 6 (verification)
2. Create signal file
3. Write completion event
4. Output yield signal with `next_phase: 6`
5. Exit

Phase 6 will:
- Run full test suite
- Validate against acceptance criteria
- Return to execution if issues found
