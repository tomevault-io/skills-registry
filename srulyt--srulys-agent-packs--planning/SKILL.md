# Ralph Planning Skill

## MANDATORY: Skill Loaded Confirmation

You MUST output this as your FIRST action after reading state:

```
[RALPH-SKILL] Loaded: .github/skills/planning/SKILL.md for phase {N} ({phase_name})
```

If you don't output this, the loop may not recognize skill loading occurred.

---

**Loaded**: planning skill (phases 1-3). **Objective**: Complete ONE phase, update state, create signal file, yield signal, exit.

---

You're in a planning phase. This skill guides you through discovery, specification, and planning.

## Phase Detection

Check `state.json` phase to determine your specific task:

| Phase | Your Focus |
|-------|------------|
| 1 (discovery) | Explore codebase, gather context |
| 2 (spec) | Write detailed specification |
| 3 (planning) | Create implementation plan |

## ADO PR Intent Handling (Cross-Phase Rule)

If the prompt/request includes Azure DevOps PR details, you MUST load and use the ADO skill before finalizing discovery/spec/plan.

ADO PR details include cues such as:
- Explicit org/project/repo/PR ID values
- Mentions like "ADO PR", "Azure DevOps PR", "review threads", "PR comments"
- Requests to address reviewer feedback from a specific PR

When detected:
1. Read `.github/skills/ado-pr-comments/SKILL.md`
2. Retrieve active PR comments per that skill (MCP first, `az` fallback)
3. Rewrite the effective user request to incorporate actionable PR feedback
4. Preserve original user request separately for traceability

If retrieval fails, surface the failure and stop phase progression (do not continue with stale or missing PR context).

---

## Phase 1: Context Discovery

### Goal

Understand the codebase well enough to write a meaningful spec and plan.

### Discovery Checklist

1. **Project Structure**
   - Scan directory tree
   - Identify main entry points
   - Note package manager (npm, pip, cargo, etc.)

2. **Technology Stack**
   - Framework(s) in use
   - Language version
   - Key dependencies

3. **Existing Patterns**
   - Code organization conventions
   - Naming patterns
   - Test structure

4. **Context Packs**
   - Check for `.context-packs/` directory
   - Load relevant context if available

5. **ADO PR Context Detection (Conditional)**
   - Check if prompt contains ADO PR details
   - If yes, load ADO skill and retrieve active PR comments
   - Rewrite effective request using PR comment context

6. **Related Code**
   - Find code related to the user's request
   - Identify files that will need changes
   - Note dependencies between components

### Discovery Output

Document findings in your event log:

```markdown
# Event: {N} - Discovery - Codebase Analysis

**Timestamp**: {ISO-8601}
**Phase**: discovery (1)
**Session**: {session_id}

## Project Overview
- Type: {web app, CLI, library, etc.}
- Language: {language} {version}
- Framework: {framework} {version}

## Relevant Components
- {path/to/component1} - {what it does}
- {path/to/component2} - {what it does}

## Patterns Observed
- {Pattern 1}
- {Pattern 2}

## Integration Points
- {Where new code will connect}

## Risks/Considerations
- {Potential issues to address}

## State Changes
- Previous: phase=intake, status=in_progress
- Current: phase=spec, status=in_progress

## Next Action
Write specification based on discovery findings
```

### Discovery Notes Artifact

**MANDATORY**: Create `.ralph-stm/runs/{session}/discovery-notes.md` during Phase 1.

This captures what context packs and specs may miss - actual code patterns observed.

Template:
```markdown
# Discovery Notes for {session_id}

## Context Pack Gaps
<!-- Things discovered that aren't documented -->
- [Gap 1]: Found in [file path], not documented

## Patterns Discovered
<!-- Implementation patterns from exploration -->
- [Pattern name]: [Description], see [file path]

## Test Locations
<!-- Test files relevant to this feature -->
- [Component]: [test file path]

## Architecture Decisions Not Captured
<!-- Decisions evident from code but not documented -->
- [Decision]: [Evidence from code]

## Convention Snapshot

| Convention | Observed Pattern | Source Files | Notes |
|------------|------------------|--------------|-------|
| Variable naming | | | |
| Method naming | | | |
| Comments style | Yes/No/Partial | | |
| Error handling | | | |
| Logging style | | | |

## Test Infrastructure

| Aspect | Observed | Location |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Framework | | |
| Mocking library | | |
| Base test class | | |
| Test utilities | | |
| Naming convention | | |
```

**Why**: Discovery notes bridge the gap between codebase exploration and implementation. They capture insights that would otherwise be lost between invocations.

### Deep Exploration Protocol

During Phase 1, explore the codebase systematically:

#### A. Pattern Discovery (Required)
- Find 2-3 similar implementations to what you'll create
- Read actual source files, not just directory structure
- Note patterns the codebase uses (error handling, logging, validation)

#### B. Test Discovery (Required)
- Locate ALL test files for components you'll modify
- Understand test patterns (unit, integration, component)
- Find test utilities and helpers
- Note test data setup patterns

#### C. Interface Discovery (If modifying existing code)
- Find all callers/consumers of code you'll modify
- Check for interface contracts (APIs, events, shared types)
- Identify potential breaking change risks

#### D. Convention Discovery (Required - fill Convention Snapshot)
- Open 3-5 similar files to what you'll create
- Document observed conventions in discovery notes
- Note any INCONSISTENCIES within the codebase
- Record the MAJORITY pattern for each convention

### Transition

After discovery, update state to Phase 2 (spec), create signal file, and exit with yield signal.

---

## Phase 2: Specification Writing

### Goal

Create a clear, testable specification that captures what needs to be built.

### Spec Structure

Write to `.ralph-stm/runs/{session}/spec.md`:

```markdown
# Specification: {Feature Name}

## Overview
{Brief description of what this feature does}

## User Request
### Original
{Original user request verbatim}

### Effective (for planning)
{Rewritten request that incorporates active ADO PR comments when applicable; otherwise same as original}

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. {Requirement 1}
2. {Requirement 2}
...

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance: {constraints}
- Security: {considerations}
- Compatibility: {requirements}

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: {Criterion Name}
**Given** {precondition}
**When** {action}
**Then** {expected result}

### AC2: {Criterion Name}
**Given** {precondition}
**When** {action}
**Then** {expected result}

{Continue for all criteria}

## Constraints
- {Constraint 1}
- {Constraint 2}

## Out of Scope
- {What this does NOT include}

## Dependencies
- {External dependency 1}
- {Existing code dependency}

## Open Questions
- {Any remaining ambiguities - should be minimal}
```

### Specification Principles

1. **Testable Criteria**
   - Every acceptance criterion must be verifiable
   - Use Given/When/Then format for clarity

2. **Scope Boundaries**
   - Explicitly state what's out of scope
   - Prevents scope creep during execution

3. **Minimal Assumptions**
   - Document assumptions clearly
   - Make reasonable defaults for minor decisions

4. **Connection to Codebase**
   - Reference actual files/components discovered
   - Ground requirements in reality

### Handling Ambiguity

| Ambiguity Level | Action |
|-----------------|--------|
| Minor (styling, naming) | Make choice, document |
| Medium (approach) | Choose best option, note alternatives |
| Major (core requirement) | Ask user (rare) |

### Transition

After spec complete, update state to Phase 3 (planning), create signal file, and exit with yield signal.

---

## Phase 3: Implementation Planning

### Goal

Create a phase-based plan that guides execution. NOT micro-tasks—logical phases.

### Plan Structure

Write to `.ralph-stm/runs/{session}/plan.md`:

```markdown
# Implementation Plan: {Feature Name}

## Overview
{How this feature will be implemented}

## Prerequisites
- {Any setup needed before starting}

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: {Phase Name}
**Objective**: {What this phase achieves}
**Scope**:
- {Component/file 1}
- {Component/file 2}
**Approach**: {How to implement}
**Verification**: {How to know it's done}

### Phase 2: {Phase Name}
**Objective**: {What this phase achieves}
**Scope**:
- {Component/file 1}
- {Component/file 2}
**Approach**: {How to implement}
**Verification**: {How to know it's done}

{Continue for all phases}

## Testing Strategy
- {Unit tests}
- {Integration tests}
- {Manual verification}

## Risk Analysis

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Detection | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|-----------|------------|
| {What could go wrong} | Low/Med/High | Low/Med/High | {How to detect} | {How to prevent/recover} |

Common risks to consider:
- Breaking existing functionality
- Missing edge cases
- Performance degradation
- Security implications
- Test coverage gaps

## Rollback Plan
{How to undo if needed}

## Total Phases: {N}
```

### Planning Principles

1. **Phase-Based, Not Task-Based**
   - Each phase = logical unit of work
   - One phase per execution invocation
   - NOT "create file X, modify line Y"

2. **Dependency Order**
   - Plan phases in dependency order
   - Earlier phases don't depend on later ones

3. **Verification Built-In**
   - Each phase has clear completion criteria
   - Tests run as part of phases when appropriate

4. **Appropriate Granularity**
   - Small feature: 2-4 phases
   - Medium feature: 4-8 phases
   - Large feature: 8-15 phases
   - Too many phases = too granular

### Example Phase Breakdown

For "Add JWT authentication to API":

| Phase | Name | Scope |
|-------|------|-------|
| 1 | Auth Infrastructure | JWT utilities, types, config |
| 2 | Auth Middleware | Verification middleware, error handling |
| 3 | Auth Endpoints | Login, register, refresh endpoints |
| 4 | Route Protection | Apply middleware to protected routes |
| 5 | Testing | Unit tests, integration tests |

### Transition

After plan complete:
1. Update `state.json` with `total_plan_phases` count
2. Create signal file
3. Transition to Phase 4 (approval)
4. Exit with yield signal

---

## State Update Reminder

**CRITICAL**: Before exiting, you MUST update state.json with:

### Always Update
- `updated_at`: Current ISO-8601 timestamp
- `last_task`: Brief description of what you did
- `last_event_id`: Increment if you wrote an event

### Update on Phase Change
- `phase`: New phase name
- `phase_id`: New phase number
- `status`: Current status
- `checkpoint.resume_hint`: What to do next

### After Discovery (Phase 1 → 2)

```json
{
  "phase": "spec",
  "phase_id": 2,
  "updated_at": "{timestamp}",
  "last_task": "discovery-complete",
  "last_event_id": 1,
  "checkpoint": {
    "can_resume": true,
    "resume_hint": "Write specification based on discovery findings"
  }
}
```

### After Spec (Phase 2 → 3)

```json
{
  "phase": "planning",
  "phase_id": 3,
  "updated_at": "{timestamp}",
  "last_task": "spec-complete",
  "last_event_id": 2,
  "checkpoint": {
    "can_resume": true,
    "resume_hint": "Create implementation plan based on spec"
  }
}
```

### After Planning (Phase 3 → 4)

```json
{
  "phase": "approval",
  "phase_id": 4,
  "status": "waiting_for_user",
  "updated_at": "{timestamp}",
  "last_task": "plan-complete",
  "last_event_id": 3,
  "total_plan_phases": {N},
  "checkpoint": {
    "can_resume": true,
    "resume_hint": "Waiting for user approval of spec and plan"
  }
}
```

---

## Phase Completion Reminder

Before exiting, you MUST:

1. Update state.json with all required fields
2. Create signal file: `signals/phase-{N}-complete.signal`
3. Write event log
4. Output yield signal
5. Exit immediately - do NOT start next phase

### Signal File Format

Path: `.ralph-stm/runs/{session}/signals/phase-{N}-complete.signal`

```json
{
  "phase_id": {N},
  "phase_name": "{name}",
  "completed_at": "{ISO-8601}",
  "next_phase": {N+1},
  "skill_loaded": ".github/skills/planning/SKILL.md",
  "artifacts_created": ["discovery-notes.md", "events/001-discovery-complete.md"]
}
```

---

## Yield Signal

Output before every exit:

```
[RALPH-YIELD]
phase_completed: {N}
next_phase: {N+1}
status: {in_progress|waiting_for_user}
signal_file: .ralph-stm/runs/{session}/signals/phase-{N}-complete.signal
work_done: {brief description}
[/RALPH-YIELD]
```
