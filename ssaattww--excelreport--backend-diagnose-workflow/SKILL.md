# Backend Diagnose Workflow

## Purpose

- Execute `/diagnose`-equivalent flow in a single agent.
- Produce root-cause-oriented recommendations with explicit confidence.

## Execution Contract

This skill follows the non-entry execution contract standard.
Required `contract_extensions`: `confidence`, `hypothesis_count`.
See [`codex-execution-contract.md`](../workflow-entry/references/codex-execution-contract.md) and [`non-entry-execution-contract-template.md`](../workflow-entry/references/non-entry-execution-contract-template.md) for full rules.

```yaml
input:
  objective: "Diagnose backend timeout failure"
  contract_extensions: { confidence: "medium", hypothesis_count: 3 }
output:
  status: "completed"
  quality_gate:
    gate_id: "backend-diagnosis-check"
    gate_type: "diagnosis"
    trigger: "post-diagnosis review"
    criteria:
      - "Primary hypothesis is validated"
      - "Confidence level matches the findings"
    result: "pass"
    evidence:
      - "Primary hypothesis confirmed"
    blockers: []
    branching:
      on_pass: "handoff"
      on_fail: "deepen_diagnosis"
      max_cycles: 2
  contract_extensions: { confidence: "high", hypothesis_count: 3 }
```

## Contract Compliance

- Emit structured output compliant with [`codex-execution-contract.md`](../workflow-entry/references/codex-execution-contract.md).
- Always include baseline output fields: `status`, `summary`, `changed_files`, `tests`, `quality_gate`, `blockers`, `next_actions`.
- Validate required input fields from `../workflow-entry/references/non-entry-execution-contract-template.md` (objective, scope, constraints, acceptance_criteria, allowed_commands, sandbox_mode) before proceeding.
- Echo required skill extensions in `contract_extensions`: `confidence`, `hypothesis_count`.
- Treat missing required fields as contract violations and regenerate output before handoff.
- On contract violation (missing/invalid field, invalid status value, or missing extension keys): do not proceed; emit status: blocked with violation description in blockers.
- Reference: [`non-entry-execution-contract-template.md`](../workflow-entry/references/non-entry-execution-contract-template.md).

## Workflow

1. Structure problem type:
   - change failure
   - new discovery
2. Collect missing context and constraints.
3. Gather evidence: logs, traces, failing tests, reproduction steps.
4. Build hypotheses and causal chains.
5. Validate hypotheses with minimal reproducible checks.
6. Derive solution options with tradeoffs.
7. Choose recommendation and define implementation steps.
8. Record residual risks and post-fix verification items.

## Confidence Policy

- `high`: enough evidence to implement recommended fix safely.
- `medium`: additional investigation likely required but bounded.
- `low`: fundamental evidence gaps remain.

If confidence is below `high`, iterate investigation up to two additional loops.
After two loops, escalate decision to user.

## Required Output Structure

- identified causes
- cause relationships (independent/dependent/exclusive)
- investigated scope
- recommendation with rationale
- alternatives
- residual risks
- post-resolution verification checklist

## Hard Rules

- Do not stop at symptom-level conclusions.
- Do not skip alternative-hypothesis evaluation.
- Do not propose fixes without impact and regression analysis.

## Quality Gate Evidence

- This executor owns `quality_gate` emission and branching using [`quality-gate-evidence-template.md`](../workflow-entry/references/quality-gate-evidence-template.md).
- Emit canonical fields: `gate_id`, `gate_type`, `trigger`, `criteria`, `result`, `evidence`, `blockers`, `branching`.
- Use `gate_type: diagnosis` for backend diagnosis quality checks.
- Normalize local statuses into `result: pass|fail|blocked` before handoff.
- If `result: blocked`, emit `[Stop: quality-gate-failed]` and pause for escalation handling.

## Stop/Approval Protocol

Use canonical markers: `[Stop: <Gate Name>]`.
Classify every stop as `approval_gate` or `escalation_gate`.
At each stop, emit a full gate record: `gate_name`, `gate_type`, `trigger`, `ask_method`, `required_user_action`, `resume_if`, `fallback_if_rejected`.
Default `ask_method` is `AskUserQuestion`.
Resume an `approval_gate` only with explicit user `approved: true`; resume an `escalation_gate` only after user direction or reroute.
Respect batch boundary: investigation loops may continue, but any write fix requires `[Stop: pre-implementation-approval]`.
Enforce `max_revision_cycles: 2`; overflow requires human intervention.
Agent-local confidence improvement never replaces user approvals.

Stop points for this skill:
- `[Stop: pre-implementation-approval]` (`approval_gate`)
- `[Stop: high-risk-change]` (`approval_gate`)
- `[Stop: requirement-change-detected]` (`escalation_gate`)
- `[Stop: quality-gate-failed]` (`escalation_gate`)
- `[Stop: revision-limit-reached]` (`escalation_gate`)
