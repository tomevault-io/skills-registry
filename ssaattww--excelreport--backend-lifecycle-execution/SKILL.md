# Backend Lifecycle Execution

## Purpose

- Run `/implement`-equivalent backend lifecycle directly in Claude.
- Preserve the original lifecycle controls without subagents.

## Execution Contract

This skill follows the non-entry execution contract standard.
Required `contract_extensions`: `lifecycle_scale`, `required_docs`.
See [`codex-execution-contract.md`](../workflow-entry/references/codex-execution-contract.md) and [`non-entry-execution-contract-template.md`](../workflow-entry/references/non-entry-execution-contract-template.md) for full rules.

```yaml
input:
  objective: "Execute medium backend lifecycle"
  contract_extensions: { lifecycle_scale: "medium", required_docs: ["Design Doc", "Work Plan"] }
output:
  status: "completed"
  quality_gate:
    gate_id: "backend-lifecycle-doc-check"
    gate_type: "implementation"
    trigger: "post-phase validation"
    criteria:
      - "Required lifecycle documents are complete"
      - "Lifecycle contract fields remain aligned"
    result: "pass"
    evidence:
      - "Required docs completed"
    blockers: []
    branching:
      on_pass: "handoff"
      on_fail: "revise"
      max_cycles: 2
  contract_extensions: { lifecycle_scale: "medium", required_docs: ["Design Doc", "Work Plan"] }
```

## Contract Compliance

Emit structured output compliant with [`codex-execution-contract.md`](../workflow-entry/references/codex-execution-contract.md).
Always include required fields: `status`, `summary`, `changed_files`, `tests`, `quality_gate`, `blockers`, `next_actions`.
Include required extension echo fields in `contract_extensions`: `lifecycle_scale`, `required_docs`.
Treat missing required fields or invalid status values as contract violations and regenerate before handoff.
Template reference: [`non-entry-execution-contract-template.md`](../workflow-entry/references/non-entry-execution-contract-template.md).
Validate required input fields from [non-entry-execution-contract-template.md](../workflow-entry/references/non-entry-execution-contract-template.md) (objective, scope, constraints, acceptance_criteria, allowed_commands, sandbox_mode) before proceeding.

## Scale Determination

| Scale | Affected files | Required docs |
|---|---|---|
| Small | 1-2 | simplified plan |
| Medium | 3-5 | Design Doc + Work Plan |
| Large | 6+ | PRD + Design Doc + Work Plan (+ ADR when needed) |

ADR is required when architecture, technology, or data flow changes.

## Lifecycle Flow

### Large

1. Requirement clarification and scope confirmation.
2. PRD creation/update.
3. PRD review with `[Stop: pre-design-approval]` + `[Approve: design-approval]`.
4. ADR creation when needed.
5. ADR review with `[Stop: pre-design-approval]` + `[Approve: design-approval]`.
6. Design Doc creation.
7. Cross-document consistency check.
8. Design handoff with `[Stop: pre-design-approval]` + `[Approve: design-approval]`.
9. Test skeleton planning (integration and E2E).
10. Work plan creation.
11. Implementation boundary with `[Stop: pre-implementation-approval]` + `[Approve: implementation-start]`.
12. Implementation loop via `backend-task-quality-loop`.

### Medium

1. Requirement clarification and scale confirmation.
2. Design Doc creation.
3. Review and consistency check.
4. Design handoff with `[Stop: pre-design-approval]` + `[Approve: design-approval]`.
5. Test skeleton planning.
6. Work plan creation.
7. Implementation boundary with `[Stop: pre-implementation-approval]` + `[Approve: implementation-start]`.
8. Implementation loop via `backend-task-quality-loop`.

### Small

1. Simplified plan creation.
2. Implementation boundary with `[Stop: pre-implementation-approval]` + `[Approve: implementation-start]`.
3. Implementation loop via `backend-task-quality-loop`.

## Requirement Change Handling

- If new requirements alter scope or design assumptions, emit `[Stop: requirement-change-detected]` + `[Approve: route-selection]`.
- Re-run scale determination and restart lifecycle from the correct phase.

## Mandatory Checks Before Implementation Loop

- Build and test tooling availability.
- Commit strategy availability.
- Quality gate definition (format/lint/static/build/tests).

## Hard Rules

- Never bypass `[Stop: pre-design-approval]` + `[Approve: design-approval]` on document phases.
- Never skip quality gate before claiming task completion.
- Never continue implementation when requirement changes are unresolved.

## Stop/Approval Protocol

Use canonical markers `[Stop: <Gate Name>]` and classify each stop as `approval_gate` or `escalation_gate`.
Use normalized stop payloads with `status`, full `gate` record fields required by [`stop-approval-section-template.md`](../workflow-entry/references/stop-approval-section-template.md) (including `gate_name`, `gate_type`, `trigger`, `ask_method`, `required_user_action`, `resume_if`, `fallback_if_rejected`), and `quality_gate.result`.
`approval_gate` resumes only with explicit user `approved: true`; `escalation_gate` resumes only after user direction/reroute.
Respect the batch boundary: emit `[Stop: pre-implementation-approval]` before any autonomous implementation loop.
Set `max_revision_cycles: 2`; if exceeded, escalate and require human intervention.
Template reference: [`../workflow-entry/references/stop-approval-section-template.md`](../workflow-entry/references/stop-approval-section-template.md).

Stop points for this skill:
- `[Stop: pre-design-approval]` (`approval_gate`)
- `[Stop: pre-implementation-approval]` (`approval_gate`)
- `[Stop: high-risk-change]` (`approval_gate`)
- `[Stop: requirement-change-detected]` (`escalation_gate`)
- `[Stop: quality-gate-failed]` (`escalation_gate`)
- `[Stop: revision-limit-reached]` (`escalation_gate`)

## Quality Gate Evidence

Orchestrator ownership: this skill emits `quality_gate` evidence and decides pass/fail/blocked branching.
Use canonical gate fields (`gate_id`, `gate_type`, `trigger`, `criteria`, `result`, `evidence`, `blockers`, `branching`) per template.
Normalize local outcomes to `result: pass|fail|blocked` before handoff.
If `result: blocked`, emit `[Stop: quality-gate-failed]` and pause autonomous flow.
Use gate-type `branching.max_cycles` limits from [`quality-gate-evidence-template.md`](../workflow-entry/references/quality-gate-evidence-template.md) (default `2`, stricter limits win).
Map `gate_type` based on the current lifecycle phase:
- Document creation and review phases: `gate_type: document`
- Cross-phase consistency checks: `gate_type: consistency`
- Implementation and post-change validation: `gate_type: implementation`
