# build-agent-team

Designs a long-running agent team for the current project and writes a `/start-<team>-team` skill that boots it. The team runs autonomously for days or weeks, coordinating through a shared task list and direct messages.

A team is not a workflow — it is an organization that runs while you sleep. Every design decision in this skill is about making sure that organization stays pointed at the right thing without supervision.

Throughout this skill, "the operator" means the human admin running and supervising the team — the person who built and started it, the person it escalates to. This is distinct from any other humans the team may interact with as part of its work (customers, end users, external contacts), which we call out as such when relevant.

## What an agent team is (and isn't)

A team is several Claude Code instances coordinating around a shared goal. Each teammate owns a **closing loop** — a recurring cycle from problem to closed solution. Teammates message each other directly; the lead coordinates without relaying every message.

Different from subagents (one-shot, report back to caller) and skills (encode a workflow inside one session). A team encodes parallel loops with their own cadences, memory, and judgment, sharing context but not waiting on each other.

## Design teams around closing loops, not specialties

The biggest design mistake is anthropomorphizing a human org chart. Human orgs split by skill specialization; a single Claude instance is already broadly multi-domain, so splitting along functional lines mostly adds coordination overhead and handoff loss.

Instead, split by **closing loops** — verticals of work where one role takes a problem from input to closed solution. Loop shapes:

- **Metric loop**: a number the role drives.
- **Problem loop**: a system or domain the role monitors and fixes.
- **Leadership loop**: direction, budget, institutional memory, cross-loop arbitration.
- **Platform (derivative) loop**: improves the skills, prompts, context, tooling, or memory that other loops depend on. The output isn't a primary work product — it's the substrate that makes the primary loops better over time. Without one, executor quality is bounded by initial setup.

Two roles never get cut: a **leader** and at least one **auditor**. Everything else is loops, often including at least one platform loop.

State each loop as an **input → closed-output** relationship: what signal enters the role's domain, and what "handled" looks like for that signal. Don't state loops as step sequences — those are workflows, not loops. Workflows go in critical behaviors and can evolve; the loop description is the role's accountability, not its procedure. "Cold inbound contact → cleared inbox per playbook" is a loop. "Scan inbox → triage → draft → send" is a workflow.

## When NOT to build a team

- The work fits in one session — don't split unless loops genuinely run in parallel.
- One-shot task — that's a subagent or a skill.
- Loops block on each other constantly — that's a relay chain, not a team.
- Token budget can't sustain N parallel sessions for the planned duration.

If borderline, suggest starting with a skill or subagent and graduating to a team only when sequential execution becomes the bottleneck.

## The interview

Free-form and conversational. Do not use `AskUserQuestion` — the goal is to draw out judgment, not collect form fields. Gather all of the following before drafting.

**Ask progressively.** Don't dump every question at once. Ask 1–3 of the most load-bearing questions per round, listen to the answers, then follow up grounded in what you heard. One big batch yields shallower answers than three rounds of two or three — and the operator's first answers usually reframe the questions you'd ask next anyway. Lead with the questions whose answers most constrain the rest.

### 0. Init — read what's already here

Before asking anything:

- Read `CLAUDE.md` for project conventions.
- List skills in `.claude/skills/` and installed plugins — these become "key skills" for relevant roles.
- Look for existing memory and team-status patterns. Extend if found; otherwise plan to suggest `memory-<team>/<ROLE>.md` (uppercase) for per-role durable lessons, and a single team-status artifact the leader maintains for operator catch-up. Namespace the folder by team name so multiple teams in the same repo don't collide.
- Note the tool surface — CLIs, scripts, `Makefile` targets, MCP servers, browser/computer-use.

For large codebases, run these scans as parallel `Explore` subagents — one per surface — instead of reading serially. Faster and keeps the main context clean.

Tell the operator what you found before interviewing further. Don't make them describe their own repo.

### 1. Purpose and loops

Open with the problem, not roles:

- What's the team trying to accomplish over the next weeks/months?
- Which goals are recurring metrics vs. open-ended problem domains?
- What inputs does it consume, what outputs does it produce, where does it hand back to humans?

From the answers, **propose** a loop decomposition. State each loop as input → closed-output, not as a step sequence. Confirm with the operator before naming any role. If the operator volunteers role names first, gently redirect: "Before we name roles, what loops are we closing?" Anthropomorphic splits are the default human instinct and you have to push against it.

Then push for **platform/derivative loops the user may not have considered**. For each executor loop in the proposed decomposition, ask: *what's improving over time, and who owns that improvement?* Skills, prompts, memory files, shared codebases, context curation, tools — these go stale or stay flat without a dedicated owner. The pattern: a researcher who improves the executor's prompt; a librarian who curates context; a platform engineer who refactors shared tooling so other loops move faster. Without these roles, the team peaks at week one and degrades.

Add a platform loop when: (1) the team runs long enough that initial setup will go stale, (2) execution quality is sensitive to internal tooling and context the team controls, (3) signal from execution can feed improvements back, (4) there's actual surface area to improve — the existing skills, prompts, and context are not already mature and battle-tested. If the executor's setup is solid and the improvement surface is small, a platform loop just churns; skip it. Short-running teams and teams using externally-maintained tooling also don't need one. One level of derivative is usually enough; "the role that improves the role that improves X" is rarely worth the coordination cost.

Finally, settle the **task list mechanism** — how teammates claim, track, and release units of work. Pick a concrete file or convention (e.g., a shared `TASKS.md` with claim/release rules, or whatever the existing repo pattern suggests). Without a mechanism, every teammate invents one and they collide.

### 2. Philosophy and guardrails

This section is the team's compass for weeks of autonomous operation. Get it right.

- **Strategy** — one paragraph on what the team believes about winning in this domain.
- **Principles** — the opinionated trade-offs every role inherits. Each principle should imply behavior that would differ if it were inverted.
- **Reward-hacking traps** — for every metric the team optimizes, ask both *what does gaming this by overproducing look like?* AND *what does gaming this by silence or inaction look like?* The second is easier to miss because it presents as principled restraint — "default: don't" can hide a broken role behind virtue. Encode both patterns explicitly. Naming the anti-pattern is more protective than naming the metric.
- **Non-negotiables** — guardrails that override every role's judgment. Things the team must not do even when tempted.

### 3. Roles

For each loop, gather:

- **Loop**: one sentence as input → closed-output — what signal enters the role's domain, and what does "handled" look like? Not the steps in between; those are critical behaviors.
- **Decision principles** (3 bullets): how this role makes calls, what trade-offs it prioritizes, what it values over what. Keep these concise — they're the role's compass when the situation is novel.
- **Critical behaviors**: must-do operational rules — mandatory message triggers, pre-checks, artifacts to produce. Each behavior should prevent a specific failure mode. If a behavior applies to every role (e.g., re-checking the time CLI between sub-tasks because `CronCreate` fires only on idle and busy roles drift; cron renewal order; claiming/releasing shared resource locks), it belongs in the team body's operating rules, not duplicated in every role's brief. Per-role critical behaviors are what's specific to that role's loop. Duplicated text bloats every brief and silently diverges when one copy gets updated.
- **Cron cadence**: how often this role self-pings to re-check state. Err toward more frequent — agents can't track time on their own.
- **Effort and model**: match the *per-tick action*, not the role's hardest call. Most roles have a routine steady state — checking state, processing the next item, writing a status update — and rare hard branches that need heavy reasoning. Default lighter on the steady state, escalate explicitly on hard branches. Generally default the leader to Opus + max (bad arbitration usually costs more than the wage saved), but it's a recommendation, not a hard rule. "Degrading is cheaper than a bad call" sounds prudent but turns every tick into max-effort and is a common cost trap.
- **Key skills**: skills already in the repo or the user's setup this role uses heavily. List name + one-line on how it's used. If a needed skill doesn't exist, flag it for the user to consider building separately.
- **Color**: visual identity for the team config (blue/green/orange/purple/cyan/red/yellow).

After roles are sketched, ask explicitly: **where do these roles step on each other?** Look for shared writable state, mutually exclusive work, and racing on shared artifacts. For each overlap, decide upfront — tighter ownership, leader-granted stability windows, or a sequence lock — and bake it into the relevant roles' critical behaviors. Coordination designed upfront beats coordination invented mid-incident.

Then do the **wage math**. Model × effort × cron cadence × per-tick context size = an implied hourly wage that runs continuously. On long-running teams, cost is dominated by cache-write/cache-read on the team's own context (skill, brief, memory, status), not output — every cron fire that re-loads heavy context past the 5-min cache TTL pays cache-write again.

Rough anchor at current list pricing (verify against current rates — these will drift): one **Opus + max** role on hourly cron with ~50–150K tokens of per-tick context runs **~$0.50–$1.50/hr** continuous (~$15–$35/day). **Sonnet ≈ 60% of Opus; Haiku ≈ 20%.** Multiply by team size; sub-hourly cadence multiplies further. A four-role Opus team on hourly cadence: ~$60–$150/day before anything ships.

Ask the operator a daily-spend target up front, sum the implied wage, check it fits, and ask whether the work shipped per day justifies it. All three levers are material — model swap, cron cadence, per-tick context size — and they compound. Tune cadence and per-tick context first when judgment quality is the bottleneck (see "Drafting the skill" for the boot-vs-heartbeat distinction); downgrade model on roles whose per-tick action is genuinely routine.

### 4. The leader (mandatory)

Every team has exactly one leader. Naming is cosmetic — the role is not optional. The leader holds direction, budget, cross-loop arbitration, and institutional memory. The leader is also the only role with authority to escalate to the operator, shut down or respawn teammates, and grant stability windows.

A team without a leader is a relay chain. A team with multiple leaders deadlocks. Insist on exactly one.

The leader should not also be primary executor of another loop — that dilutes both. The leadership loop is a full role.

### 5. The auditor (mandatory)

Every team gets at least one auditor. The auditor produces no primary work — they review.

The auditor catches what the leader is structurally biased against catching: **reward-hacking and constraint drift** (the leader's incentives align with the team shipping, not stopping it) and **structural hygiene** — memory and status file bloat, calibration entries that should have been promoted or pruned, re-orientation drift, capability assumptions that have quietly stopped holding. The hygiene side decays slowly and presents as "housekeeping" the leader defers indefinitely; without a fixed-cadence auditor watching, day-14 cost is multiples of day-1 for no good reason. Cadence is **fixed**, not ad-hoc — leaders rationalize away their own doubts and skip ad-hoc audits when uncomfortable.

Decide with the user:

- What is each auditor specifically watching for? Tie reward-hacking watches to the gaming patterns identified in step 2; tie hygiene watches to the artifacts and lifecycles identified in step 10. Build-time review agents enforce these at draft; the auditor enforces them at runtime.
- Cadence: how often does the leader summon the auditor, and what artifacts does the auditor receive?
- Effort: always max + Opus.

Multiple auditors are fine when failure modes are distinct. Don't merge audit duties into the leader.

### 6. Communication protocol

The #1 failure mode for agent teams is **insufficient communication**. This phrase is hardcoded into the generated skill. Then, with the user, draft the message-trigger table.

For each ordered pair of roles, ask:
- What events MUST trigger a message?
- What does the message contain? (Lead with the action or decision needed; context after.)
- What's the response timeline? What's "silent" mean for this pair?

Also gather general principles: how to message (concise, action-first, full paths to artifacts, never structured JSON unless using protocol responses), and when to over-communicate (when in doubt, send). Apply the same to **feedback signals** — when one role observes something another loop could improve from (audit findings, operator overrides, corner cases hit during execution), route it to that loop. Feedback that stays where it lands is feedback the system loses.

Then ask: **what state should live in shared artifacts instead of messages?** Heavy content (reports, plans, dashboards), long-lived state (current strategy, open task list), and cumulative knowledge (memory) belong in files at known paths, with lightweight "I updated `<path>`" notifications instead of full content in messages. Map out the artifact-and-notification pairs upfront — who writes, who reads, where the file lives, when notifications fire.

Then nail down **operator-facing comms**, which is its own protocol distinct from internal team comms (and distinct from any operational comms the team has with other humans like customers or end users):

- **Who talks to the operator?** Default: only the leader. Non-leader roles route everything operator-facing through the leader. Multiple roles pinging the operator directly creates noise and contradictory asks.
- **When?** Tie to the autonomy boundary in step 8: decisions outside the boundary, periodic status digests, critical incidents that need awareness even without a decision.
- **What channel?** Terminal chat is the default. If the team needs to reach the operator out-of-band, the skill must name a specific channel and the exact CLI/API call. Agents can't invent a channel that isn't already wired up.
- **What format?** Operator messages must be self-contained **on the channel's actual surface**. Text-only channels (WhatsApp, SMS) can't render linked files — the operator only sees the message body, so paste excerpts inline rather than referencing paths they can't open. For decisions, the message must include enough context for the operator to decide without leaving the channel. Use the channel's affordances (images, reactions, read receipts, voice) where they help; don't assume affordances the channel doesn't have.

If no out-of-terminal channel is set up, say so explicitly in the skill: "Operator comms are terminal-only; the team waits for the operator's next session for non-urgent items."

### 7. Constraints

Hard guardrails that override role judgment:

- **Resource ownership**: classify each shared resource (git, deployments, secrets, external accounts, financial state, customer-visible state, third-party APIs) as agent-managed or operator-managed. For agent-managed resources, further classify mutations as permitted / operator-approval / forbidden. Default toward operator-managed for high-blast-radius resources unless the operator opts in — git is the most common case, where teams typically keep commit/push/branch operator-managed and let agents make working-tree changes only. Default, not hard rule.
- **File system writes**: keep writes inside the repo or `/tmp/`. Writes elsewhere (home directory, system paths, sibling repos) trigger operator permission prompts that block the team — long-running autonomous operation depends on every write landing in a pre-approved location.
- **Budget allocations**: for every consumable the team draws from — tokens, real-money spend, paid API quotas, third-party rate limits, compute — set a cap, a tracker, and a throttle. Don't reduce this to just tokens; long-running teams usually have several bounded resources.
- **Time-based access**: for resources that can't be accessed concurrently (shared file system regions, exclusive external state, infra in transitional states, prioritized budget windows), specify who grants access and how. Synchronization needs a named holder, a recorded location for lock state, and a stale-reclamation rule — "be careful" is not a protocol, and a lock without reclamation is a deadlock waiting to happen. Platform-change "stability windows" are one instance — treat the general pattern explicitly.
- **Time and reality checks**: name the authoritative CLIs for time and state — agents cannot self-track time or external state. External observations also stale between cron fires (buffers clear, daemons cycle, sessions expire, files change underneath), so roles cite the freshness of any snapshot they act on. **Capability claims** (harness flags, daemon liveness, auth state, API behavior the team depends on) get probed at boot — VERIFY or engage a documented FALLBACK before spawning. Silent capability gaps surface days later as confused failures.
- **Privacy and security**: two axes plus surfaces. Classify sensitive **data** (secrets, PII, customer data, proprietary code, regulated content). Classify sensitive **operations** the agent shouldn't necessarily perform — some files shouldn't be read at all, some commands shouldn't run, some external accesses shouldn't happen. Then think about the **surfaces** the team writes to (working context, internal team messages, scan reports, memory files, status artifacts, operator channels, logs) and which data classes are permitted on which surface. Sensitive content quietly migrating between surfaces is the dominant leak shape. For code-writing teams, name the security review bar.

### 8. Autonomy boundary

Ask explicitly: **is anything operator-only, or can the leader make every call within the constraints?**

The common failure mode: an agent stops mid-stride asking "I'm not sure, what do you think?" when the operator wanted full autonomy. If autonomy is the goal, the leader must be empowered to decide everything within the constraints. Carve operator-only narrowly:

- Budget escalations above the cap.
- Strategic pivots that change the team's purpose.
- Irreversible actions at meaningful scale.

Everything else: the leader decides. Encode this both in the leader's principles ("when in doubt, decide and document") and in the constraints table.

Also ask: **what does done look like?** Stop conditions go in the leader's critical behaviors so the team proposes shutdown when they're met, instead of running indefinitely.

### 9. Failure mode handling

Walk through with the user, but encode only **principles** in the generated skill, not specific thresholds or recipes:

- Silent teammate — leader detects, retries, then resets. Distinguish silent-because-busy from silent-because-crashed via a process-level liveness check, not just message-responsiveness.
- Output drift from philosophy — auditor catches, leader corrects.
- Stuck loop — detection and break-out responsibility.
- Context exhaustion — long-running teammates accumulate context until they degrade. Leader watches for symptoms (lost recent state, repeated questions) and force-rotates: teammate writes a handoff to its memory file, leader respawns from that file.
- Unclaimable task — reassignment path.
- Budget cap hit — what throttles, what continues.

Concrete thresholds belong to the user; the skill records the principle.

### 10. Memory and shared artifacts

Durable team learning takes several forms — settle which fit this team:

- **Per-role memory files** (default). `memory-<team>/<ROLE>.md` (uppercase), one per role, in a team-namespaced folder so multiple teams in the same repo don't collide.
- **Cross-cutting memory** — organized by platform, domain, task type, or repo when lessons fall along those lines better than by role.
- **Skills as memory** — when a role's primary work is running a specific skill, lessons accumulate via edits to that skill rather than a separate file. Platform/derivative loops typically work this way.
- **The team skill itself (the constitution)** — the leader owns mutations; other roles propose. This is how the team evolves its philosophy, roles, comms, or constraints when situations require it.

**Where each update goes**: current state → status (replaced each iteration); durable lessons → memory (accumulates with curation); rule changes → constitution (replaces). Audit findings, operator overrides, and observed failures must produce memory or constitution updates — not one-off fixes. Recurring patterns get promoted out of calibration logs into constitution or playbook entries; **entries that haven't promoted within a stated window get archived, not kept as growing scrollback**. Without a sunset, calibration logs are write-only and grow unbounded.

**Artifact bloat is the dominant cost trap on long-running teams.** Every memory file, status file, and shared artifact is re-read on every iteration by at least one role — by many roles for the central status, by all roles for the auditor. Without explicit design, these artifacts drift toward append-only ledgers because agents write "what just happened" the way human ops logs do. A status file specced as "current state" routinely degenerates into a week-long activity log; a role memory file mixes durable rules with rolling calibration with per-iteration scan history in one place with no signal for what to prune. The cost compounds: cache-write past the 5-min TTL × cron cadence × team size × number of readers.

For every persistent artifact the team produces, settle upfront:

- **Lifecycle of each section** — which content is replaced each iteration, which rolls over a window, which is durable. Sections without a stated lifecycle default to append-only. The form is the team's choice; the existence of a stated lifecycle is not.
- **Owner of curation** — typically the leader for shared artifacts, the role itself for its own memory. Curation is part of the role's loop, not a chore to defer. Without a named owner, no role's incentive aligns with pruning.
- **Re-readability over historical completeness** — shared artifacts are re-read by agents on every fire, not browsed by humans. Design for the next reader's needs. If forensic history matters (lock or fire history for debugging), it lives in a separate role-owned log file, not the central artifact every role pays to load.

Also settle the **team-status artifact** — a single file the leader maintains so the operator (and any respawned teammate) catches up at a glance. **Status is state, not log**: closed items archive out, resolved anomalies become memory entries, lock and fire histories go in a separate file. Extend the repo's existing dashboard pattern if one exists; otherwise default to `memory-<team>/STATUS.md` alongside the per-role memory files.

### 11. Save location

Default: `<repo>/.claude/skills/start-<team>-team/SKILL.md` — project-local, committed alongside the working repo. Ask before saving elsewhere.

## Drafting the skill

After the interview, draft `/start-<team>-team`. Use `references/skill_template.md` as a section checklist. The generated skill must be self-contained — every teammate reads it as their full brief.

**Push heavy content into `<generated-skill>/references/`:**

- **Per-role briefs** at `references/role_<name>.md` — decision principles, critical behaviors, autonomy carve-outs, role-specific responsibilities. The body's Roles section keeps a short summary per role (owns / loop / cadence / key skills) and points at the brief. Only the role itself re-reads its full brief on orientation; other roles only need the summary.
- **Memory templates** at `references/memory_<role>_template.md`, seeded by the role on first boot.
- **Status artifact template** at `references/status_template.md`.

The body = team-wide operating logic (philosophy, comms, constraints, failure modes, team table, team-wide operating rules every role follows). References = per-role detail and format scaffolding, progressively disclosed. Every teammate re-reads the body on each orientation — leanness is what makes long-running teams affordable, and duplicating cross-role rules in every brief defeats that.

Required sections, in order:

1. **Philosophy** — strategy, principles, anti-reward-hacking guardrails.
2. **Team table** — role · model · color · effort · ownership · purpose · loop · cron · key skills.
3. **Init protocol** — what every teammate reads on startup (this skill, CLAUDE.md, latest artifact, their memory file).
4. **Roles** — for each: loop, 3 decision principles, critical behaviors, key skills used.
5. **Communication protocol** — hardcoded "#1 failure mode is insufficient communication" line, message-trigger table, how-to-message principles.
6. **Constraints** — table of hard guardrails (resource ownership, budget allocations, time-based access, autonomy, time-source, privacy/security).
7. **Failure mode handling** — high-level principles for silent / drifting / stuck teammates.
8. **Memory** — pointer to the repo's memory pattern; per-role file paths.

The skill, when invoked, should:

- Verify `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` is set.
- Spawn each teammate with their full role brief (extracted from the skill body) **and the max-turns ceiling set as high as the harness allows**. Long-running teams hit turn limits silently otherwise — a teammate that's run for days can quietly stop accepting work because it crossed the default cap.
- Have the leader run the init protocol and orient the team with current state.
- Have each teammate (including the leader) call `CronCreate` for their self-heartbeat. Prefer `durable: true` so crons survive restarts; if `durable: true` isn't supported in the harness, fall back to in-memory crons and warn the operator not to close their Claude session — the team dies with the session otherwise.
- **Heartbeat ticks ≠ orientations.** Full orientation (SKILL.md, CLAUDE.md, brief, memory) runs on boot, respawn, or detected divergence — not every cron fire. The literal cron prompt re-triggers the *loop*, not orientation: `"<role> heartbeat — run your loop"`, never "re-orient and run." Check the actual prompt string passed to `CronCreate` in the draft before shipping — surrounding sections may correctly say "heartbeats ≠ orientations" while the prompt itself contradicts that and silently costs many-x. A tick reads the status delta and pending work, then exits. Re-orienting per tick — paired with artifact bloat from section 10 — is how a team that ships cheaply at day 1 costs an order of magnitude more by day 14.

## Subagent review passes

After drafting, run review passes. **Spawn one subagent per reference file in parallel** (single message, multiple `Agent` tool calls) — the reviews are independent and there's no reason to serialize them. Each subagent gets the prompt:

> Read `<reference path>` and the draft skill at `<draft path>`. Apply the review criteria from the reference. Return only **critical issues** — gaps, contradictions, places where the team would fail under the failure modes named in the reference. Be specific and quote sections you're flagging. If the draft is clean, return "no critical issues".

Use `general-purpose` subagents with Opus.

| Reference | Reviews for |
|---|---|
| `references/philosophy_review.md` | Reward-hacking hardening: are gaming patterns named, are non-negotiables hard? |
| `references/roles_review.md` | Roles, loops, auditor presence, team size, anthropomorphic traps, autonomy clarity |
| `references/communication_review.md` | Clarity, edge cases, cadence vs operation, silent-teammate handling, "ask the operator" anti-pattern |
| `references/constraints_review.md` | Coverage of resource ownership, budget allocations, time-based access, operator-only, time source, privacy/security |

**Run each review until clean.** Multiple rounds are expected. Apply fixes, then re-spawn the failing reviews in parallel again. Don't move on while critical issues remain.

## Saving and invoking

When all reviews are clean:

1. Show the final skill to the operator for review (this is non-optional — it's their team).
2. Save to the chosen location.
3. Offer to invoke `/start-<team>-team` immediately.

After save, the user owns it — they'll iterate as the team runs.

## Tips

- **Push back on team size > 6.** Coordination overhead grows non-linearly. If the user wants 8 roles, ask which loops actually run in parallel — most can usually merge.
- **Don't let the user pre-name roles.** Get the loops first, then name. Pre-named roles drag in human-org-chart assumptions.
- **Treat the philosophy section as load-bearing.** It's the only thing the team has to fall back on when situations diverge from what the skill anticipated. A vague philosophy produces a team that stalls or drifts.
- **The auditor is not optional.** If the user resists, ask what catches reward-hacking. The honest answer is usually nothing, which is the whole point.
- **Crons are cheap.** Default to more frequent. An agent that gets pinged unnecessarily ignores the ping; an agent that doesn't get pinged forgets the world.
- **Cron lifecycle is the leader's job.** On role spec changes, `CronDelete` the old cron and `CronCreate` the new — stale crons fire stale prompts.
- **Sub-agents inside teammates: only leader and platform roles.** Executors work in-session — `Task` calls inside an executor loop double-bill and blur ownership.
