# Vercel AI Elements Skill

## Overview

This skill provides complete documentation for Vercel AI Elements - a comprehensive UI component library for building conversational AI interfaces with the Vercel AI SDK. It covers 23 production-ready React components organized into 6 functional categories, from basic message display to advanced features like web previews and tool execution.

Use this skill when users need:
- Documentation on specific AI Elements components
- Installation and usage instructions
- Props and API references
- Integration examples with AI SDK
- Help choosing the right component for their use case
- Guidance on combining components for common patterns

## Core Capabilities

The Vercel AI Elements library provides components across 6 functional categories:

### 1. Message Components
Display chat messages with variants (contained/flat), automatic alignment, avatars, and markdown support. Perfect for rendering user and assistant messages in conversational interfaces.

**Components:** Message, MessageContent, MessageAvatar

**Reference:** `references/vercel-ai-elements-message-components.md`

### 2. Conversation Management
Wrap and manage message lists with automatic scrolling, scroll-to-bottom buttons, and empty states. Handles the container and layout for multi-message conversations.

**Components:** Conversation, ConversationContent, ConversationEmptyState, ConversationScrollButton

**Reference:** `references/vercel-ai-elements-conversation-management.md`

### 3. Input & Interaction
Enable user input with file attachments, model selection, suggestions, and task lists. Covers all user interaction patterns for sending messages and managing workflows.

**Components:** Actions, Prompt Input (with subcomponents), Suggestion, Task

**Reference:** `references/vercel-ai-elements-input-interaction.md`

### 4. Content Display
Render generated content including code, images, markdown responses, and structured artifacts. Handles all types of content output from AI models.

**Components:** Artifact, CodeBlock, Image, Response

**Reference:** `references/vercel-ai-elements-content-display.md`

### 5. AI Processing UI
Visualize AI processing steps including branching conversations, reasoning chains, loading states, execution plans, and shimmer effects. Shows the "thinking" process.

**Components:** Branch, Chain of Thought, Loader, Plan, Reasoning, Shimmer

**Reference:** `references/vercel-ai-elements-ai-processing.md`

### 6. Advanced Features
Specialized components for context tracking, citations, tool execution, source attribution, web previews, and cross-platform sharing.

**Components:** Context, Inline Citation, Open In Chat, Queue, Sources, Tool, Web Preview

**Reference:** `references/vercel-ai-elements-advanced-features.md`

## How to Use This Skill

### Finding Component Documentation

When a user asks about a specific component:

1. **Identify the component name** - e.g., "How do I use the Message component?"
2. **Locate the category** - determine which of the 6 categories the component belongs to
3. **Reference the appropriate file** - load the category reference file from `references/`
4. **Provide component details** - installation, basic usage, features, and props

### Common Usage Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Simple Chat Interface
Combine Message + Conversation + PromptInput + Response to build a basic chatbot UI.

#### Pattern 2: Enhanced Chat with Actions
Add Actions component to Message components for retry, copy, and regenerate functionality.

#### Pattern 3: AI Process Visualization
Use Reasoning, ChainOfThought, or Plan to show AI's thinking process during streaming.

#### Pattern 4: Advanced Document Generation
Combine Artifact, CodeBlock, Image, and Response for generating complex multi-media content.

#### Pattern 5: Multi-Platform Chat Share
Add OpenInChat to allow users to copy conversations to ChatGPT, Claude, etc.

### Integration with AI SDK

All components are designed to work with `@ai-sdk/react` hooks like:
- `useChat()` - for message management
- `useCompletion()` - for streaming text
- `experimental_useObject()` - for structured outputs

Reference files include complete AI SDK integration examples for each component category.

## Component Quick Reference

### Installation Pattern

All components use the same installation pattern:
```
npx ai-elements@latest add [component-name]
```

Where component names are lowercase with hyphens, e.g., `prompt-input`, `code-block`, `chain-of-thought`.

### Props Documentation

Each component reference file includes comprehensive props tables with:
- Prop name and type
- Description of functionality
- Whether prop is optional
- Default values where applicable

### Streaming Support

Many components have built-in streaming support:
- **Response**: parseIncompleteMarkdown handles streaming markdown
- **Plan**: isStreaming prop enables shimmer animations
- **Reasoning**: isStreaming auto-opens/closes the panel
- **Shimmer**: animation shows loading state

## Key Features Across Components

### TypeScript Support
All components have full type definitions for TypeScript projects.

### Accessibility
Components include proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and semantic HTML.

### Responsive Design
All components adapt to different screen sizes with mobile-friendly interactions.

### Theme Integration
Components use CSS custom properties and currentColor for automatic theme support.

### Compound Components
Most components use compound component patterns (parent + child components) for flexible composition.

## Search Strategies

Use the reference files to search for:
- **By component name**: Search files for exact component name (e.g., "Message")
- **By feature**: Search for capability (e.g., "streaming", "copy button", "citations")
- **By use case**: Search for patterns (e.g., "loading", "error", "completed")
- **By props**: Search for specific prop names when users ask about customization

## Important Notes

### CSS Configuration
The Response component requires this CSS addition:
```css
@source "../node_modules/streamdown/dist/index.js";
```

### AI SDK Setup
Most components assume use of the AI SDK with proper backend routes. Reference files include backend example code.

### Component Dependencies
Many components depend on shadcn/ui primitives and icons from lucide-react. Users need these dependencies installed.

### Branching Implementation
The Branch component manages UI for multiple message branches but doesn't implement branching in the AI SDK - that requires custom backend logic.

## Resource Organization

### Reference Files (organized by category)
- `vercel-ai-elements-message-components.md` - Message display
- `vercel-ai-elements-conversation-management.md` - Conversation containers
- `vercel-ai-elements-input-interaction.md` - User input and actions
- `vercel-ai-elements-content-display.md` - Content rendering
- `vercel-ai-elements-ai-processing.md` - Processing UI and visualization
- `vercel-ai-elements-advanced-features.md` - Specialized components

Each reference file contains:
- Component descriptions and installation instructions
- Basic usage examples
- Complete props references
- Key features and capabilities
- Integration patterns with AI SDK

All reference files are organized by category for quick lookup when users ask about specific components or features.
