# Stac Screen Builder

## Overview

Use this skill to convert feature requirements into maintainable Stac DSL screens and theme definitions.

## Workflow

1. Translate user requirements into route names, states, and actions.
2. Select widgets using `references/widget-selector.md`.
3. Select actions using `references/action-recipes.md`.
4. Apply style patterns from `references/style-recipes.md`.
5. Apply route semantics from `references/navigation-patterns.md`.
6. Scaffold files using scripts when requested.

## Required Inputs

- Target screen name (`snake_case` recommended).
- Desired interactions (navigation, network, forms, state changes).
- Whether a theme reference is needed.

## Output Contract

- Return valid Stac DSL snippets with `@StacScreen` or `@StacThemeRef`.
- Keep generated screen names stable and explicit.
- Use built-in Stac widgets/actions first, then custom extensions if needed.

## References

- Read `references/widget-selector.md` to choose layout and interactive widgets.
- Read `references/action-recipes.md` for navigation/form/network/state actions.
- Read `references/style-recipes.md` for color, spacing, and text style patterns.
- Read `references/navigation-patterns.md` for stack-safe navigation actions.

## Scripts

- `scripts/new_screen.py --screen-name <name> --out-dir <path> [--with-navigation]`
- `scripts/new_theme_ref.py --theme-name <name> --out-file <path>`

## Templates

- `assets/templates/screen.dart.tmpl`
- `assets/templates/theme_ref.dart.tmpl`
