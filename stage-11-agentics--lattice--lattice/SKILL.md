# Lattice — Agent-Native Task Tracker

Lattice is a file-based, event-sourced task tracker. Everything lives in `.lattice/` in the project root. Every change is an immutable event. No accounts, no API keys, no network required.

## The Lifecycle — Opening and Closing Rituals

Every unit of work follows this arc: **claim → understand → work → complete**. The opening and closing rituals are non-negotiable.

### Opening Ritual

```bash
# 1. Claim the next task (or create one)
lattice next --actor agent:claude-cli --claim --json

# 2. If the task needs planning (empty plan file), plan first
lattice status <task_id> in_planning --actor agent:claude-cli
# ... write the plan to .lattice/plans/<task_id>.md ...
lattice status <task_id> planned --actor agent:claude-cli
lattice status <task_id> in_progress --actor agent:claude-cli
```

`lattice next --claim` atomically assigns the highest-priority ready task to you and moves it to `in_progress`. If you already have a task in progress, it returns that one (resume-first logic).

If there's no existing task, create one:

```bash
lattice create "Fix the login bug" --actor agent:claude-cli --priority high
```

### Closing Ritual

**`lattice complete` is THE way to finish work.** It performs the full completion ceremony in one command: posts a review comment, attaches a review artifact, transitions through review to done.

```bash
lattice complete <task_id> --review "What was done. Key decisions. Test results. What remains." --actor agent:claude-cli
```

The `--review` text is your breadcrumb for every future agent and human who reads this task. Be specific: files changed, approach taken, edge cases considered, anything left undone.

**Do not use raw `lattice status ... done` to finish work.** The `complete` command exists because completion requires evidence — a review comment and artifact. Skipping this ceremony leaves the task without an audit trail.

| Outcome | Action |
|---------|--------|
| **Done** | `lattice complete <task_id> --review "..." --actor agent:claude-cli` |
| **Need human input** | `lattice needs-human <task_id> "<what you need>" --actor agent:claude-cli` (the task keeps its status — the flag is orthogonal) |
| **Blocked on dependency** | `lattice status <task_id> blocked --actor agent:claude-cli` + comment explaining the blocker |

## The Work In Between

Between opening and closing:

1. **Read before writing.** `lattice show <task_id> --json`. Check `.lattice/plans/<task_id>.md` and `.lattice/notes/<task_id>.md` for context from previous minds.
2. **Check previous work.** If the task has prior events, investigate what happened. `git log --oneline --grep="<short_id>"` for prior commits.
3. **Baseline tests.** Run the test suite before changing anything. You own new failures, not pre-existing ones.
4. **Commit as you go.** Each meaningful unit of progress gets a commit.
5. **Push when done.** Each task is durable on the remote immediately.

## Core Commands

```bash
# Create
lattice create "Title" --actor agent:claude-cli --priority high --type bug

# List
lattice list                           # All active tasks
lattice list --status in_progress      # Filter by status
lattice list --assigned agent:claude-cli

# Show
lattice show PROJ-1                    # Summary
lattice show PROJ-1 --events           # Full event history

# Status transitions
lattice status PROJ-1 in_progress --actor agent:claude-cli

# Complete (the closing ritual)
lattice complete PROJ-1 --review "Review text" --actor agent:claude-cli

# Assign
lattice assign PROJ-1 agent:claude-cli --actor agent:claude-cli

# Comment
lattice comment PROJ-1 "Found root cause" --actor agent:claude-cli

# Link
lattice link PROJ-1 blocks PROJ-2 --actor agent:claude-cli

# Flag for human attention (orthogonal to status — task keeps its current status)
lattice needs-human PROJ-1 "Which OAuth provider?" --actor agent:claude-cli
lattice needs-human PROJ-1 --clear --note "Decided: use Google" --actor agent:claude-cli
lattice list --needs-human          # scannable queue of flagged tasks, any status

# Next task
lattice next --actor agent:claude-cli --claim --json

# File-decision links
lattice file-link PROJ-1 src/auth/jwt.ts --reason "JWT validation" --actor agent:claude-cli
lattice file-unlink PROJ-1 src/auth/jwt.ts --actor agent:claude-cli
lattice explain src/auth/jwt.ts              # what decisions shaped this file?
lattice explain src/auth/                    # directory prefix
lattice explain "src/auth/*.ts"              # glob

# Health
lattice weather    # Daily digest
lattice stats      # Statistics
lattice doctor     # Data integrity check

# Archive
lattice archive PROJ-1 --actor agent:claude-cli
```

Options for `create`: `--priority` (critical/high/medium/low/none), `--type` (task/bug/chore), `--description "..."`, `--assign agent:claude-cli`

**No `epic` or `spike` types — just items of work with a dependency graph.** Lattice intentionally rejects umbrella/exploratory ticket types. Express multi-phase or umbrella work as a plain `task` with `subtask_of` links from its children. Express exploratory/investigation work as a plain `task` whose deliverable is a concrete artifact (plan doc, prototype, decision). The subtask + dependency graph (`subtask_of`, `blocks`, `depends_on`) gives you epic-shape and spike-shape without dedicated types. Every ticket is a chunk of work with a real output, not a bucket or a question.

**Task description depth:** Match description detail to task ambiguity. Bug fixes and chores can be one-liners ("Add regex validation to frequency names"). Features and integration tasks should include: (1) what it does, (2) acceptance criteria, (3) architectural context, (4) what the user/operator experiences when done.

Relationship types for `link`: `blocks`, `blocked_by`, `subtask_of`, `parent_of`, `depends_on`, `depended_on_by`, `related_to`

## Status Workflow

```
backlog → in_planning → planned → in_progress → review → in_validation → pr_open → done
                                       ↕
                                    blocked
```

Transitions are enforced. Use `--force --reason "..."` to override when genuinely needed.

**`needs-human` is a flag, not a status.** It rides orthogonally on top of whatever status a task is in — a task can be `in_progress` and flagged, `blocked` and flagged, even `done` and flagged. Set it with `lattice needs-human <task> "<reason>"` (reason required) and clear it with `lattice needs-human <task> --clear`. The flag never moves the task. `blocked` stays a status for generic external dependencies; `needs-human` means "waiting on a human specifically," and the two can coexist.

**`in_validation` is the e2e gate.** After local review passes, prove the change works against a running system — browser automation for web, simulator MCP for mobile, curl flows for APIs. Exercise the actual flow the ticket touched, then record evidence with `lattice attach <task> --role validation` (or `lattice comment <task> --role validation`). Transitioning to `pr_open` is blocked until validation evidence is recorded; if e2e genuinely doesn't apply, record a one-line N/A justification instead — explicit, never silent. Validation failure routes back to `in_progress` (impl-level) or `in_planning` (plan-level), and counts toward the 3-cycle rework valve. The bar: **"I saw it work," not "I think it should work."**

## Actor IDs

Every command requires `--actor`. Format: `prefix:identifier`

- `agent:claude-cli` — default for your own actions
- `agent:worker-1`, `agent:worker-2` — multi-agent setups
- `human:username` — when acting on behalf of a human

## Task IDs

- **Short ID:** `PROJ-1`, `PROJ-42` (use these in conversation)
- **Full ULID:** `task_01HQ...` (internal, always accepted)

All commands support `--json` for structured output: `{"ok": true, "data": ...}` or `{"ok": false, "error": {"code": "...", "message": "..."}}`.

## Heartbeat Mode

Check if enabled: look for `"heartbeat": {"enabled": true}` in `.lattice/config.json`.

When enabled, keep advancing after each task: complete the current task → `lattice next --claim` → work the next one → repeat. Stop after `max_advances` (default 10), when the backlog is empty, or when a task is flagged `needs-human` or hits `blocked`.

## Rules

1. **Open before you work.** Every unit of work starts with a Lattice task. Not after. Not during. Before.
2. **Close with `lattice complete`.** Never raw `lattice status ... done`.
3. **One task at a time.** Finish or transition before claiming the next.
4. **Don't force transitions.** If a transition fails, investigate why.
5. **Don't cancel human tasks.** Flag them with `lattice needs-human` instead — let the human decide.
6. **Comment liberally.** The next agent has no hallway to find you in.
