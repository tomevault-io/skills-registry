# Lattice — Agent-Native Task Tracker

Lattice is a file-based, event-sourced task tracker. It stores everything in a `.lattice/` directory in the project root (like `.git/` for version control). Every change is an immutable event. No accounts, no API keys, no network required.

## When to Use Lattice

Use Lattice when the user or the conversation involves:

- Creating, tracking, or managing tasks
- Coordinating work across multiple agents
- Maintaining an audit trail of decisions and changes
- Planning sprints, releases, or project milestones
- Checking what work is in progress, blocked, or done

## Setup

Check if Lattice is available and initialized:

```bash
bash {baseDir}/scripts/lattice-check.sh
```

Or simply run `lattice list`. If `lattice` is not found, it needs to be installed (see the install methods in the frontmatter above). If `.lattice/` is not found, initialize it:

```bash
lattice init --project-code PROJ
```

Replace `PROJ` with a short project code (e.g., `APP`, `API`, `WEB`). This creates the `.lattice/` directory.

## Core Commands

### Create a task

```bash
lattice create "Fix the login bug" --actor agent:openclaw --priority high
```

Options: `--priority` (critical/high/medium/low/none), `--type` (task/epic/bug/spike/chore), `--description "details"`, `--assign agent:openclaw`

### List tasks

```bash
lattice list                           # All active tasks
lattice list --status in_progress      # Filter by status
lattice list --assigned agent:openclaw # Filter by assignee
lattice list --priority high           # Filter by priority
lattice list --json                    # Structured output
```

### Update task status

```bash
lattice status PROJ-1 in_progress --actor agent:openclaw
lattice status PROJ-1 done --actor agent:openclaw
```

### Assign a task

```bash
lattice assign PROJ-1 agent:openclaw --actor agent:openclaw
```

### Add a comment

```bash
lattice comment PROJ-1 "Found the root cause: race condition in auth middleware" --actor agent:openclaw
```

### Show task details

```bash
lattice show PROJ-1              # Summary view
lattice show PROJ-1 --events     # With full event history
```

### Link related tasks

```bash
lattice link PROJ-1 blocks PROJ-2 --actor agent:openclaw
lattice link PROJ-3 subtask_of PROJ-1 --actor agent:openclaw
```

Relationship types: `blocks`, `blocked_by`, `subtask_of`, `parent_of`, `depends_on`, `depended_on_by`, `related_to`

### File-decision links

Record which files embody a task's architectural decisions:

```bash
lattice file-link PROJ-1 src/auth/jwt.ts --reason "JWT validation logic" --actor agent:openclaw
lattice file-unlink PROJ-1 src/auth/jwt.ts --actor agent:openclaw
```

Reverse lookup — show what decisions shaped a file:

```bash
lattice explain src/auth/jwt.ts              # exact file
lattice explain src/auth/                    # directory prefix
lattice explain "src/auth/*.ts"              # glob
```

Link files that embody **decisions**, not every file touched. Use `--reason` to annotate why.

### Archive completed work

```bash
lattice archive PROJ-1 --actor agent:openclaw
```

### Get next task to work on

```bash
lattice next --actor agent:openclaw          # Suggest next task
lattice next --actor agent:openclaw --claim  # Suggest and auto-assign
```

### Project health

```bash
lattice weather    # Daily digest / weather report
lattice stats      # Project statistics
lattice doctor     # Check data integrity
```

## Status Workflow

```
backlog → in_planning → planned → in_progress → review → done
                                       ↕            ↕
                                    blocked      needs_human
```

- `backlog` — work identified but not started
- `in_planning` — actively being planned or specced
- `planned` — plan is ready, waiting to start
- `in_progress` — actively being worked on
- `review` — implementation done, under review
- `done` — complete
- `blocked` — waiting on an external dependency
- `needs_human` — requires human decision or input
- `cancelled` — abandoned

Transitions are enforced. Use `--force --reason "..."` to override when needed.

## Actor IDs

Every command requires `--actor` to identify who made the change. Format: `prefix:identifier`

- `agent:openclaw` — for your own actions
- `agent:openclaw-worker-1` — for multi-agent setups
- `human:username` — when acting on behalf of a human

Always use `agent:openclaw` as your actor ID unless the user specifies otherwise.

## Task IDs

Tasks have two forms:
- **Short ID:** `PROJ-1`, `PROJ-42` (use these in conversation)
- **Full ULID:** `task_01HQ...` (internal, always accepted)

Short IDs require a project code (set during `lattice init`).

## Structured Output

All commands support `--json` for machine-readable output:

```bash
lattice list --json
```

Returns `{"ok": true, "data": [...]}` on success or `{"ok": false, "error": {"code": "...", "message": "..."}}` on failure.

## Notes Files

Every task has a notes file at `.lattice/notes/<task_id>.md`. Write plans, decisions, and context there for future reference:

```bash
cat .lattice/notes/task_01HQ*.md  # Read a task's notes
```

These are free-form markdown — edit directly.

## Multi-Agent Coordination

Lattice handles concurrent writes safely with file locks. Multiple agents can work simultaneously:

1. Each agent uses a unique actor ID (`agent:openclaw-1`, `agent:openclaw-2`)
2. Create tasks from the orchestrator, assign to workers
3. Workers update status and add comments as they progress
4. Lock-based concurrency prevents file corruption
5. Event log provides full audit trail of who did what

For detailed multi-agent patterns, read `{baseDir}/references/multi-agent-guide.md`.

## Tips

- **Update status before starting work**, not after. If you're about to implement something, move it to `in_progress` first.
- **Leave comments** explaining what you tried, what you chose, and what you left undone. The next agent has no hallway to find you in.
- **Use `lattice next`** to find the highest-priority unblocked task.
- **Use `needs_human`** when you need a human decision — it creates a clear queue.
