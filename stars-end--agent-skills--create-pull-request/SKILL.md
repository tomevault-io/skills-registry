## Canonical bd prefix cutover (2026-04-02)

- `agent-skills` new-work Feature-Key / branch / PR metadata should use `bd-*`.
- Canonical Beads now defaults to `bd-*` for new issues, so the repo workflow and Beads default are aligned again.
- Legacy `af-*` or other historical prefixes may still resolve in Beads, but they are not the default contract for new `agent-skills` work.

## Workflow

### 1. Extract and Validate Feature Key

```bash
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)

# Validate branch naming convention
# Allow dots for hierarchical IDs (e.g., feature-bd-xyz.1.2)
if [[ ! "$CURRENT_BRANCH" =~ ^feature-bd-[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+$ ]]; then
  echo "❌ Branch name doesn't follow convention"
  echo ""
  echo "Current branch: $CURRENT_BRANCH"
  echo "Expected format: feature-bd-<ID> (e.g., feature-bd-xyz or feature-bd-xyz.1.2)"
  echo ""
  echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
  echo "Recovery options:"
  echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
  echo ""
  echo "Option 1: Rename branch to match Beads issue"
  echo "  1. Find your Beads issue:"
  echo "     bdx list --status open"
  echo ""
  echo "  2. Rename branch:"
  echo "     git branch -m feature-bd-<ID>"
  echo ""
  echo "  3. If pushed to remote:"
  echo "     git push origin :$CURRENT_BRANCH  # Delete old"
  echo "     git push -u origin feature-bd-<ID>  # Push new"
  echo ""
  echo "Option 2: Create Beads issue for current work"
  echo "  1. Extract descriptive name:"
  DESCRIPTIVE_NAME=$(echo "$CURRENT_BRANCH" | sed 's/^feature-//')
  echo "     Title: $DESCRIPTIVE_NAME"
  echo ""
  echo "  2. Create issue:"
  echo "     bdx create '$DESCRIPTIVE_NAME' --type feature --priority 2"
  echo "     # Returns: bd-xyz"
  echo ""
  echo "  3. Rename branch to match:"
  echo "     git branch -m feature-bd-xyz"
  echo ""
  echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
  echo "Why this matters:"
  echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
  echo "- Enables automatic PR-to-Beads linking"
  echo "- Provides commit history tracking via Feature-Key"
  echo "- Supports multi-developer coordination"
  echo "- Enforces Issue-First workflow"
  echo ""
  exit 1
fi

# Extract FEATURE_KEY from feature-bd-<ID> pattern
FEATURE_KEY=$(echo "$CURRENT_BRANCH" | sed 's/^feature-//')
```

**Why validate:**
- Enforces convention (feature-bd-xyz)
- Prevents silent failures downstream
- Provides clear recovery steps
- Educates on Issue-First workflow
- In `agent-skills`, this also guards against carrying `af-*` or any other non-`bd-*` Beads context into PR creation. Treat that mismatch as an early blocker and correct it before retrying.
- If you need a fresh tracking issue in `agent-skills`, create it explicitly as `bd-*` with `bdx create --id bd-<issue> --force` instead of relying on a generic default prefix.

### 2. Get Beads Context
Use the Beads context helper:
```bash
bd-context

# Get issue details
issue=$(bdx show <FEATURE_KEY> --json)
```

If not found, create proactively:
```bash
bdx create --title <FEATURE_KEY> --type feature --priority 2 --id <FEATURE_KEY>
```

**Detect epic vs feature:**
- If issue is epic → PR closes all child tasks, not epic itself
- If issue is feature → PR closes the feature directly
- Check: `issue.dependents` to find child tasks

### 2.3. Structural Verification (If Needed)
If `layout.tsx`, `middleware.ts`, or global config changed:
```bash
echo "ℹ️  Structural changes detected. Running build check..."
make build
if fails: exit 1
```

### 2.4. Verify Base Branch + Canonical Beads Health

**Before creating PR, ensure branch freshness and Beads availability:**

```bash
echo ""
echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
echo "🔄 PRE-PR CHECKS"
echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
echo ""

# Fetch latest master/main to reduce merge conflict risk
git fetch origin master

# Optional: merge latest master now if behind
if ! git merge-base --is-ancestor origin/master HEAD; then
  echo "⚠️  Branch is behind origin/master. Merge/rebase before PR for cleaner review."
fi

# Canonical Beads health check
(beads-dolt dolt test --json && beads-dolt status --json)
```

**Why this is critical:**
- **Prevents avoidable PR conflicts:** catches branch drift early
- **Prevents false-ready PRs:** confirms tracker connectivity before closure/linking
- **Matches fleet contract:** uses Dolt backend checks with `BEADS_DIR=~/.beads-runtime/.beads`

### 2.5. Ask if Work is Complete (CRITICAL)

**Decision point:** Is work complete and ready to merge?

```bash
echo ""
echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
echo "🔍 WORK COMPLETION CHECK"
echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
echo ""
echo "Is this work complete and ready to merge?"
echo ""
echo "✅ YES → Close Beads issue, create PR for merge"
echo "⏸️  NO  → Leave open, create draft PR for feedback"
echo ""
read -p "Complete? (y/n): " COMPLETE
echo ""
```

**If YES (work complete):**
```bash
# Close Beads issue BEFORE creating PR
echo "Closing Beads issue ${FEATURE_KEY}..."
bdx close ${FEATURE_KEY} --reason "Work complete, ready for review in PR"

# Verify canonical Beads health and push branch updates
(beads-dolt dolt test --json && beads-dolt status --json)
echo "Pushing feature branch updates..."
git push

echo ""
echo "✅ Issue closed in canonical Beads backend"
echo "✅ Feature branch pushed for review"
echo ""
```

**If NO (work in progress):**
```bash
# Leave issue as in_progress
echo "ℹ️  Keeping ${FEATURE_KEY} as in_progress"
echo "   → PR will be marked as draft"
echo ""

DRAFT_FLAG="--draft"
```

**Why this is critical:**
- **Deterministic state:** issue is explicitly marked done before review
- **No post-merge tracker work:** avoids merge-time bookkeeping drift
- **Clear workflow:** Close issue = "ready to ship", open issue = "work in progress"

### 2.6. Pre-PR Derived Artifact Freshness Check (Mandatory)

**Before creating any PR, agents MUST verify that derived artifacts are in sync.**

This check applies to ALL PRs — not just agent-skills, but any repo that consumes
generated outputs from agent-skills (AGENTS.md, universal-baseline.md, etc.).

```bash
echo ""
echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
echo "📦 DERIVED ARTIFACT FRESHNESS CHECK"
echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
echo ""
```

**Step 1: Check if agent-skills sources changed.**

If the PR modifies any of the following, derived artifacts MUST be regenerated:
- Any `SKILL.md` file under `core/`, `extended/`, `health/`, `infra/`, `railway/`, `dispatch/`
- `@NAKOMI.md`
- `scripts/publish-baseline.zsh`
- `Makefile` targets that affect baseline generation

```bash
CHANGED_SOURCES=$(git diff origin/master --name-only | \
  grep -E '(SKILL\.md$|@NAKOMI\.md$|publish-baseline\.zsh$)' || true)

if [ -n "$CHANGED_SOURCES" ]; then
  echo "⚠️  Source files changed that affect derived artifacts:"
  echo "$CHANGED_SOURCES" | sed 's/^/   /'
  echo ""
  echo "Running: make publish-baseline"
  make publish-baseline
  echo ""
fi
```

**Step 2: Check if docs or repo guidance changed.**

```bash
DOCS_CHANGED=$(git diff origin/master --name-only | \
  grep -E '^docs/' || true)

if [ -n "$DOCS_CHANGED" ]; then
  echo "ℹ️  Documentation files changed:"
  echo "$DOCS_CHANGED" | sed 's/^/   /'
  echo ""
fi
```

**Step 3: Verify freshness deterministically (agent-skills repo only).**

When working IN the agent-skills repo, run the freshness guard:

```bash
if [ -f "scripts/check-derived-freshness.sh" ]; then
  echo "Running derived artifact freshness check..."
  if ! bash scripts/check-derived-freshness.sh; then
    echo ""
    echo "❌ BLOCKED: Derived artifacts are stale."
    echo "   Run 'make publish-baseline' and commit the updated files before creating this PR."
    echo ""
    exit 1
  fi
fi
```

**Step 4: Self-check checklist (ALL repos).**

Before proceeding to PR creation, confirm:

| Check | Action if YES |
|-------|---------------|
| SKILL.md files changed? | Run `make publish-baseline` (agent-skills) or regenerate consuming outputs |
| docs/ changed? | Verify docs are complete and linked |
| @NAKOMI.md changed? | Run `make publish-baseline` |
| AGENTS.md appears stale? | Run `make publish-baseline` |
| No source changes? | Proceed (no regeneration needed) |

**Why this is critical:**
- **Prevents silent drift:** agents changing sources without updating derived outputs
- **Catches it at the chokepoint:** PR creation is the natural enforcement surface
- **Deterministic CI backing:** the `derived-freshness` CI job will fail on stale artifacts

### 2.7. Validate Docs (Epics/Features Only)

**Check if docs exist and are linked:**

```bash
DOC_DIR="docs/${FEATURE_KEY}"

if [ "$issue.type" = "epic" ] || [ "$issue.type" = "feature" ]; then
  # Check if docs directory exists
  if [ -d "$DOC_DIR" ]; then
    # Check if linked to Beads
    CURRENT_REF=$(bdx show ${FEATURE_KEY} --json | jq -r '.external_ref // ""')

    if [ -z "$CURRENT_REF" ] || [ "$CURRENT_REF" = "null" ]; then
      echo "ℹ️  Docs exist but not linked to Beads"
      echo "   Auto-linking: ${FEATURE_KEY} ↔ ${DOC_DIR}/"
      bdx update ${FEATURE_KEY} --external-ref "docs:${DOC_DIR}/"
    fi

    # Check if docs updated recently (within last 7 days)
    LAST_COMMIT=$(git log -1 --format=%at -- "$DOC_DIR")
    NOW=$(date +%s)
    DAYS_AGO=$(( ($NOW - $LAST_COMMIT) / 86400 ))

    if [ $DAYS_AGO -gt 7 ]; then
      echo ""
      echo "⚠️  Docs may be stale (last updated ${DAYS_AGO} days ago)"
      echo "   Consider reviewing: $DOC_DIR/"
      echo ""
    else
      echo "✅ Docs updated recently ($DAYS_AGO days ago)"
    fi
  else
    # No docs directory - informational only
    echo "ℹ️  No docs/ directory for ${FEATURE_KEY}"
    echo "   (OK for small features, recommended for epics)"
  fi
fi
```

**Why informational:**
- Non-blocking (doesn't prevent PR creation)
- Epics/features benefit from docs, but not required
- Tasks/bugs don't need separate docs
- User controls doc creation timing

**What this checks:**
- ✅ Docs exist? → Auto-link to Beads if not linked
- ✅ Docs recent? → Warn if stale (>7 days)
- ℹ️ No docs? → Informational (not error)

### 3. Push Branch
```bash
# Check if branch exists on remote
if ! git ls-remote --heads origin <branch>:
  git push -u origin <branch>
```

### 4. Create PR with gh CLI

**Prepare trailers:**
```bash
# Get agent identity
AGENT_ID="$(~/.agent/skills/scripts/get_agent_identity.sh)"
```

**Prepare doc link:**
```bash
DOC_DIR="docs/${FEATURE_KEY}"
if [ -d "$DOC_DIR" ]; then
  DOC_LINK="📄 Design docs: [`$DOC_DIR/`]($DOC_DIR/)"
else
  DOC_LINK="📄 No docs/ directory (tracked in Beads only)"
fi
```

**For Features:**
```bash
gh pr create 
  ${DRAFT_FLAG} 
  --title "{FEATURE_KEY}: Feature implementation" 
  --body "
## Feature

{FEATURE_KEY}

## Beads Issue

$(if [ -z "$DRAFT_FLAG" ]; then echo "Closes: bd-{ID}"; else echo "Related: bd-{ID} (in progress)"; fi)

Beads record: `bdx show bd-{ID}`

## Documentation

${DOC_LINK}

## Next Steps

- Dev environment: Auto-deploying
- CI checks: Running in background
- Review: $(if [ -z "$DRAFT_FLAG" ]; then echo "Ready once CI passes"; else echo "Ready when work complete"; fi)

### 5. Link PR to Beads
```bash
PR_NUMBER=$(gh pr view --json number -q .number)

# Use helper script if available
bd-link-pr $PR_NUMBER

# Or update via CLI
bdx update <FEATURE_KEY> status=in_progress --external-ref "PR#${PR_NUMBER}"
```

```
✅ PR#{PR_NUMBER} created
✅ CI running in background
✅ Dev environment deploying

Check status: gh pr view {PR_NUMBER}
Test in dev: dev.yourapp.com/pr-{PR_NUMBER}
 ```

### 2.8. Frontend Evidence Contract (If Frontend Files Changed)

**When frontend files are modified in prime-radiant-ai, enforce evidence contract:**

```bash
# Check if frontend files changed
FRONTEND_CHANGES=$(git diff origin/master --name-only | grep -E "^frontend/" | head -1)

if [ -n "$FRONTEND_CHANGES" ]; then
  echo ""
  echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
  echo "🎨 FRONTEND EVIDENCE CONTRACT"
  echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
  echo ""
  echo "Frontend changes detected. Before PR-ready:"
  echo ""
  echo "1. Run visual regression:"
  echo "   pnpm --filter frontend build"
  echo "   pnpm --filter frontend preview --port 5173 &"
  echo "   VISUAL_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5173 pnpm --filter frontend test:visual"
  echo ""
  echo "2. If baselines change, update and justify:"
  echo "   VISUAL_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5173 pnpm --filter frontend test:visual:update"
  echo ""
  echo "3. Add '## Frontend Evidence' section to PR body"
  echo ""
  echo "Template: ~/agent-skills/templates/frontend-evidence-contract.md"
  echo ""
fi
```

**Required PR body section for frontend changes:**

```markdown
## Frontend Evidence

### Route Matrix
| Route | Desktop | Mobile | Status |
|-------|---------|--------|--------|
| / | ✅ | ✅ | Pass |
| /sign-in | ✅ | ✅ | Pass |

### Runtime Health
- Console errors: 0
- Unexpected Application Error: No

### Evidence
- Commit SHA: [hash]
- Visual tests: [X] passed
- CI workflows: [links]
```

**CI will auto-run:**
- `visual-quality.yml` (Stylelint + Visual Regression)
- `lighthouse.yml` (Performance budgets)

**Why this matters:**
- Prevents false-positive "looks good" approvals
- Catches visual regressions before merge
- CI validates automatically - trust the pipeline

### 2.9. Prime V2 Product Contract (If V2 Routes/Stories Changed)

> ⚠️ **CRITICAL EXCEPTION**: For Prime `/v2` and `/brokerage`, visual evidence is **evidence only**.

**When PR touches V2 routes or contract docs, enforce product signoff:**

```bash
# Check if V2 routes/stories changed
V2_CHANGES=$(git diff origin/master --name-only | grep -E "(^frontend/src/(pages|routes|components)/(v2|brokerage)|^docs/TESTING/STORIES/production_v2/|^docs/v2/)" | head -1)

if [ -n "$V2_CHANGES" ]; then
  echo ""
  echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
  echo "⚠️  V2 PRODUCT CONTRACT DETECTED"
  echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
  echo ""
  echo "V2 product changes detected. Visual evidence is NOT sufficient."
  echo ""
  echo "REQUIRED before merge:"
  echo "1. Contract gate MUST pass:"
  echo "   make verify-v2-contract"
  echo ""
  echo "2. Founder live validation REQUIRED:"
  echo "   See: docs/v2/FOUNDER_SIGNOFF_FLOW.md"
  echo ""
  echo "3. Add V2 Product Signoff section to PR body (see below)"
  echo ""
  echo "Contract docs:"
  echo "  • docs/v2/PRODUCT_CONTRACT.md — Hard invariants"
  echo "  • docs/v2/RELEASE_GATE.md — Binary YES/NO checks"
  echo "  • docs/v2/FAKE_METRIC_GUARDRAILS.md — No demo/fake metrics"
  echo ""
fi
```

**Required V2 Product Signoff section for PR body:**

```markdown
## V2 Product Signoff Status

### Contract Gate
- [ ] `make verify-v2-contract` passed
- [ ] Contract artifacts: `artifacts/verification/contract/`

### Founder Live Validation
- [ ] Validation completed per `docs/v2/FOUNDER_SIGNOFF_FLOW.md`
- [ ] Routes validated: `/v2`, `/brokerage`

### Evidence vs Certification
| Evidence Type | Included | Can Certify V2? |
|---------------|----------|-----------------|
| Screenshots | ✅/❌ | ❌ NO |
| Style/lint | ✅/❌ | ❌ NO |
| Route health | ✅/❌ | ❌ NO |
| Contract gate | ✅/❌ | ✅ YES |
| Founder validation | ✅/❌ | ✅ YES |

### Contract Docs
- `docs/v2/PRODUCT_CONTRACT.md` — Hard invariants
- `docs/v2/RELEASE_GATE.md` — Binary YES/NO checks

⚠️ Visual evidence alone cannot certify V2 product correctness.
```

**Why V2 requires extra steps:**
- V2 has hard product invariants beyond visual correctness
- Real data vs demo data is a binary state that screenshots cannot verify
- Founder validation ensures business logic works with real holdings
- `verify-release` output "RELEASE NOT APPROVED YET" is intentional

 ## Best Practices

- **Create Beads issue if missing** - Never block on missing metadata
- **Use gh CLI** - More reliable than API calls
- **Link PR bidirectionally** - Beads → PR and PR → Beads
- **Trust async validation** - CI runs in background

## What Happens Next (Automatic)

- ✅ CI runs full test suite
- ✅ Dev environment auto-deploys PR
- ✅ GitHub posts check results
- ✅ Danger bot comments with guidance

**User can test immediately** in dev environment while CI runs.

## What This DOESN'T Do

- ❌ Wait for CI (runs async)
- ❌ Run tests locally (CI handles it)
- ❌ Validate deployment (environments handle it)

**Philosophy:** Fast PR creation + Trust the pipeline
