# Fix PR Feedback

Address PR feedback with automated discovery tracking and iterative fixes.

## Purpose

Handles the iterative refinement loop after PR creation:
- Read PR comments (human reviews, bot comments)
- Check CI status (failing tests, linting errors)
- Detect merge conflicts
- Create child Beads issues for each discovery
- Fix issues or ask user for guidance
- Commit fixes with proper Feature-Key trailers
- Push updates to same branch

**Philosophy:** Fast feedback → Track discoveries → Iterative fixes → Trust environments

## When to Use This Skill

**Trigger phrases:**
- "fix the PR"
- "address the feedback"
- "fix CI failures"
- "resolve code review comments"
- "handle PR issues"
- "update the PR"
- "respond to review"
- "i noticed bugs" (manual triage mode)
- "codex review found issues" (manual triage mode)

**Automatically invoked when:**
- User mentions PR number and "fix" or "address"
- User asks about failing checks
- User wants to respond to code review
- User provides numbered bug list (e.g., "1. X, 2. Y, 3. Z")

## Modes

This skill operates in two modes:

### Mode 1: Auto-Detection (Existing)

**Triggers:** "fix the PR", "fix CI failures", "address the feedback"

**Workflow:**
1. Automatically read CI logs via `gh pr view --json statusCheckRollup`
2. Automatically read PR comments via `gh pr view --json comments`
3. Automatically detect merge conflicts
4. Parse and categorize all discoveries
5. Create Beads issues for each
6. Present summary to user
7. Fix based on user approval

**Use when:** PR exists and you want AI to discover all issues automatically

### Mode 2: Manual Triage (NEW)

**Triggers:** "i noticed bugs: 1. X, 2. Y", "ci failures: 1. A, 2. B", "codex review found issues: 1. P, 2. Q"

**Workflow:**
1. Parse user's numbered bug list
2. Create Beads issue for each bug
3. **MANDATORY DISCUSSION:** Present all bugs with Beads IDs to user
4. Get user approval (fix all, fix specific ones, skip some)
5. Fix approved bugs systematically (one at a time)
6. **Auto-commit per bug** with Feature-Key trailer
7. Push all commits at end
8. Confirm completion to user

**Use when:** User already knows what bugs exist (from CI logs, code review, manual testing)

**Example user input formats:**
```
"i noticed bugs: 1. MCP type error, 2. permission denied, 3. obsolete test"
"ci failures: 1. labeler format, 2. PR metadata missing"
"codex review: 1. Update tests, 2. Add docs"
```

**Key difference:** Manual mode CREATES issues from user's list, then discusses. Auto mode DISCOVERS issues from PR/CI, then discusses.

## Workflow

### 1. Get PR Context

```bash
# Get current branch
git branch --show-current
# Extract FEATURE_KEY from feature-<KEY>

# Get PR number
gh pr view --json number,url,title -q '.number'
# Or user provides PR number explicitly
```

### 2. Set Beads Context

```bash
# Get parent feature issue
bdx show <FEATURE_KEY>
```

### 3. Gather PR Feedback

**Mode 1 (Auto-Detection): Read CI/PR automatically**

**A. Check CI Status**
```bash
gh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --json statusCheckRollup -q '.statusCheckRollup'
```

Parse results:
- Failing checks (conclusion: failure, error)
- Pending checks (conclusion: pending)
- Passing checks (conclusion: success)

**B. Read PR Comments**
```bash
gh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --json comments -q '.comments[] | {author:.author.login, body:.body, createdAt:.createdAt}'
```

Filter for:
- Code review comments (human reviewers)
- Bot comments (Codex, Danger, etc.)
- Recent comments (last 24 hours)

**C. Check Merge Conflicts**
```bash
gh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --json mergeable -q '.mergeable'
```

**Mode 2 (Manual Triage): Parse user's bug list**

```
User: "i noticed bugs: 1. MCP type error, 2. permission denied, 3. CI labeler format"

Parse numbered list:
bugs = [
  {num: 1, description: "MCP type error"},
  {num: 2, description: "permission denied"},
  {num: 3, description: "CI labeler format"}
]
```

### 4. Categorize Discoveries

**Group feedback by type:**

**Type: CI Failure**
- Pattern: statusCheckRollup shows failures
- Priority: 1 (blocks merge)
- Example: "Tests failing: test_github_projects_lookup"

**Type: Code Review Comment**
- Pattern: Human review with requested changes
- Priority: 1-2 (depends on severity)
- Example: "Codex: Tests reference deleted file"

**Type: Merge Conflict**
- Pattern: mergeable = false
- Priority: 0 (critical, blocks everything)
- Example: "Beads backend unavailable on dispatch host"

**Type: Bot Suggestion**
- Pattern: Bot comment with improvement suggestion
- Priority: 2-3 (non-blocking)
- Example: "Danger: Add tests for new feature"

### 5. Create Child Beads Issues

For each discovery, create child issue:

```bash
# Create child issue linked to parent
bdx create "Bug: <short-description>" \
  --type bug \
  --priority 1 \
  --description "<full-context>" \
  --design "<how-to-fix>" \
  --parent <parent-id>
```

**Issue type rules:**
- CI failure → bug
- Code review comment → bug or task
- Merge conflict → bug (P0)
- Bot suggestion → chore or task
- Manual user report → bug (trust user classification)

**Priority rules:**
- Merge conflict → P0 (critical)
- Failing checks → P1 (high)
- Review comments → P1-P2
- Bot suggestions → P2-P3
- Manual reports → P1 (default, user can adjust)

### 6. Present Discoveries to User (MANDATORY)

**This phase is REQUIRED for both modes. Never skip discussion.**

```
📋 Created 3 Beads issues for PR #155:

1. ❌ bd-abc (Bug, P1): Test suite failing
   - tests reference deleted github_projects.py
   - Auto-fixable: YES (simple import update)

2. 🤖 bd-def (Bug, P1): Update tests for removed helper
   - FileNotFoundError in test_github_projects_lookup
   - Auto-fixable: YES (delete obsolete test)

3. ⚠️ bd-ghi (Task, P2): Add documentation for new skill
   - New skill needs usage examples
   - Auto-fixable: MAYBE (need to know what to document)

Which would you like me to fix?
a) Fix all auto-fixable issues (1, 2)
b) Fix specific ones (specify numbers)
c) I'll handle some myself (tell me which to skip)
```

**Options:**
- User: "fix all" → AI attempts all fixes
- User: "fix #1 and #2" → AI fixes specific issues
- User: "I'll fix #2" → AI skips that issue
- User: "just fix the auto-fixable ones" → AI fixes only bd-abc, bd-def

**Why mandatory discussion:**
- User may want to fix some issues themselves
- User may have context AI doesn't (architectural decisions)
- User may want to prioritize differently
- Transparency: user sees all issues before code changes

### 7. Fix Issues (if AI-fixable)

**Determine fixability:**

```javascript
function canAutoFix(discovery) {
  // AI can fix:
  if (discovery.type === "deleted_file_reference") return true;
  if (discovery.type === "import_error") return true;
  if (discovery.type === "lint_error") return true;
  if (discovery.type === "simple_test_fix") return true;

  // AI should ask:
  if (discovery.type === "architectural_change") return false;
  if (discovery.type === "breaking_api_change") return false;
  if (discovery.type === "security_issue") return false;

  // Default: ask
  return false;
}
```

**Fix workflow:**

For each fixable issue (iterate systematically):

```bash
# 1. Read relevant files with Serena
mcp__serena__find_symbol(name_path=<symbol>)
mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview(relative_path=<file>)

# 2. Make fixes with Serena
mcp__serena__replace_symbol_body(...)
mcp__serena__insert_after_symbol(...)

# 3. Verify fix (optional, <5s)
make lint-fast

# 4. Close child issue BEFORE commit
bdx close ${childIssue.id} --reason "Fixed"

# 5. Verify canonical Beads health
beads-dolt dolt test --json
beads-dolt status --json

# 6. AUTO-COMMIT with child Feature-Key (inline, not "commit my work")
git add -A
git commit -m "fix: <issue-description>

Closes ${childIssue.id}

Feature-Key: ${childIssue.id}
Parent-Feature: ${parentIssue.id}
Discovery-Type: pr-review
PR-Number: ${prNumber}"

# 6. Move to next issue
# Repeat steps 1-5 for each approved bug
```

**Key: One commit per bug, close issue immediately after commit**

### 8. Push Updates (After All Fixes)

```bash
# Push all commits at once
git push

# PR auto-updates, CI re-runs automatically
```

**Note:** Push ONCE at the end, not after each commit. This allows:
- Batched CI runs (faster feedback)
- Atomic PR update (all fixes together)
- Easy rollback if needed (revert all commits, force-push)

### 9. Confirm to User

```
✅ Fixed 2 of 3 issues in 2 commits:
   ✅ bd-abc (CI Failure): Closed
   ✅ bd-def (Codex Review): Closed
   ⏭️ bd-ghi (Danger Bot): Skipped (needs human input)

📤 Pushed to feature-GUARD_SKILL_ACTIVATION
🔄 PR #156 updated, CI re-running

Next steps:
- Wait for CI results (~2min)
- If CI passes → Ready to merge
- If CI fails → Say "fix the PR" again to iterate
```

### 10. Iteration Loop (Manual)

**User triggers next iteration if needed:**

```
CI re-runs → New failures appear
User: "fix the PR"
AI: [Reads new CI output, creates new child issues, repeats workflow]
```

**OR user checks manually:**

```
User: "check CI status"
AI: [Shows current check results]
User: "fix the PR" (if failures exist)
```

**No automatic polling** - user controls when to iterate. This follows V3 philosophy: trust environments, manual triggers.

## Integration Points

### With Beads
- **Creates child issues** for each discovery
- **Links via discovered-from** (deps=[parent.id])
- **Tracks in hierarchy** (bd-pso → bd-pso.1, bd-pso.2, ...)
- **Closes on fix** with commit reference

### With sync-feature-branch
- **Reuses commit logic** for Feature-Key trailers
- **Same branch** (iterative refinement)
- **Auto-close child** after successful commit

### With create-pull-request
- **Same PR** (updates, not new PR)
- **PR body unchanged** (GitHub shows commit history)
- **CI re-runs** automatically on push

### With Serena
- **Smart code search** to find issues
- **Symbol-aware edits** for fixes
- **Token-efficient** (doesn't read entire files)

## Discovery Patterns

### Pattern: Deleted File Reference

**Detect:**
```
CI output: "FileNotFoundError: scripts/lib/github_projects.py"
```

**Fix:**
```
1. Find references: mcp__serena__search_for_pattern("github_projects.py")
2. For each reference:
   - Read context: mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview
   - Replace call: mcp__serena__replace_symbol_body
   - Update imports: mcp__serena__insert_after_symbol
```

### Pattern: Test Failure

**Detect:**
```
CI output: "FAILED tests/test_foo.py::test_bar - AssertionError"
```

**Fix:**
```
1. Read test: mcp__serena__find_symbol("test_bar", relative_path="tests/test_foo.py")
2. Analyze failure reason
3. If simple assertion mismatch → fix expected value
4. If logic error → ask user for guidance
```

### Pattern: Lint Error

**Detect:**
```
CI output: "E501 line too long (92 > 88 characters)"
```

**Fix:**
```
1. Read file at line number
2. Reformat with black/prettier (or manually)
3. Commit lint fix
```

### Pattern: Merge Conflict

**Detect:**
```
gh pr view: mergeable = false
```

**Fix:**
```
1. Fetch latest: git fetch origin master
2. Attempt rebase: git rebase origin/master
3. If conflicts:
   - Ask user to resolve manually
   - Provide guidance on conflict resolution
4. If clean: git push --force-with-lease
```

## Best Practices

1. **Create issues first** - Track before fixing
2. **Fix one at a time** - Easier to verify
3. **Auto-fix simple issues** - Lint, imports, obvious bugs
4. **Ask for complex issues** - Architecture, security, breaking changes
5. **Close child on success** - Keep Beads clean
6. **Push after each fix** - CI validates incrementally
7. **Check CI between fixes** - Don't stack failures

## What This Skill Does

✅ Read PR feedback (comments, CI, conflicts)
✅ Create child Beads issues for discoveries
✅ Fix simple/obvious issues automatically
✅ Ask user for complex issues
✅ Commit with proper Feature-Key trailers
✅ Push updates to same branch
✅ Close child issues on success

## What This Skill DOESN'T Do

❌ Create new PRs (fixes go to existing PR)
❌ Force merge (respects required checks)
❌ Fix architectural issues without asking
❌ Run full test suite locally (CI does this)
❌ Wait for CI to pass (pushes immediately)
❌ Delete child issues (closes, preserves history)

## Anti-Patterns

❌ Fixing without creating child issues
❌ Creating new branch for fixes
❌ Closing parent issue before PR merges
❌ Auto-fixing security issues without review
❌ Batching multiple fixes in one commit
❌ Not linking child issues to parent

## Contradiction Triage (Frontend/UI PRs)

**For PRs with frontend changes, check for evidence contradictions:**

### Step 1: Gather Evidence

```bash
# Check for runtime crashes
gh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --json comments -q '.comments[].body' | grep -i "error\|crash\|fail"

# Check CI logs for frontend failures
gh run list --branch $(git branch --show-current) --limit 1 --json conclusion,status

# Look for visual regression failures
gh run view --log 2>/dev/null | grep -i "visual\|screenshot\|diff" || true
```

### Step 2: Detect Contradictions

**Contradiction patterns:**

| Claim | Evidence | Verdict |
|-------|----------|---------|
| "UI works" | Screenshot shows crash | 🔴 BLOCKED |
| "No errors" | Console shows TypeError | 🔴 BLOCKED |
| "Routes pass" | CI shows route failures | 🔴 BLOCKED |
| "Tests pass" | CI shows test failures | 🔴 BLOCKED |
| "Clean render" | Screenshot shows broken layout | 🟡 WARNING |

### Step 3: Escalate Contradictions

If contradiction detected:

```bash
# Force PR back to blocked state
echo "🚨 CONTRADICTION DETECTED"
echo ""
echo "Claim: [what PR claims]"
echo "Evidence: [what evidence shows]"
echo ""
echo "Required action:"
echo "1. Fix the runtime issue"
echo "2. Update evidence to match reality"
echo "3. Re-run verification"

# Create blocking child issue
bdx create "Blocker: Evidence contradicts claims in PR #${PR_NUMBER}" \
  --type bug \
  --priority 0 \
  --description "PR claims [X] but evidence shows [Y]"
```

**Template for contradiction report:**

```markdown
## 🚨 Contradiction Detected

**PR Claim:** [What the PR description claims]
**Evidence Found:** [What the logs/screenshots actually show]

**Impact:** Cannot proceed with merge until contradiction resolved.

**Required Actions:**
1. Fix the underlying issue
2. Update evidence to reflect reality
3. Re-run verification with both Playwright MCP + Chrome DevTools MCP
```

### Why Contradiction Triage Matters

- Prevents "looks good" rubber-stamp approvals
- Catches claims that don't match reality
- Enforces evidence-first approach
- Reduces post-merge rollbacks

### Prime V2 Contract Review (EXCEPTION)

> ⚠️ **CRITICAL**: For Prime `/v2` and `/brokerage`, visual contradiction triage is **necessary but NOT sufficient**.

**When PR touches V2 routes/stories, also check:**

```bash
# Check if V2 routes/stories changed
V2_CHANGES=$(git diff origin/master --name-only | grep -E "(^frontend/src/(pages|routes|components)/(v2|brokerage)|^docs/TESTING/STORIES/production_v2/|^docs/v2/" | head -1)

if [ -n "$V2_CHANGES" ]; then
  echo ""
  echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
  echo "📋 V2 PRODUCT CONTRACT REVIEW"
  echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
  echo ""
  echo "V2 changes detected. Visual evidence is NOT sufficient."
  echo ""
  echo "Required checks:"
  echo "1. Contract gate: make verify-v2-contract"
  echo "2. Contract docs: docs/v2/PRODUCT_CONTRACT.md"
  echo "3. Release gate: docs/v2/RELEASE_GATE.md"
  echo "4. Founder flow: docs/v2/FOUNDER_SIGNOFF_FLOW.md"
  echo ""
  echo "Key invariants:"
  echo "  - No demo data badge for auth users"
  echo "  - Real holdings only (no fake metrics)"
  echo "  - Left pane = artifacts, right pane = chat"
  echo "  - Reload restores server-backed state"
  echo ""
  echo "⚠️ Even if visual tests pass, V2 correctness requires contract gate + founder validation."
  echo ""
fi
```

**V2 Contract Document Review:**

When fixing V2-related issues, review against:

| Document | What It Defines | Fix Must Satisfy |
|----------|-----------------|------------------|
| `PRODUCT_CONTRACT.md` | Hard product invariants | No demo data, real holdings, left-pane artifacts |
| `RELEASE_GATE.md` | Binary YES/NO checks | All gates must be YES |
| `FOUNDER_SIGNOFF_FLOW.md` | Signoff process | Live validation required |
| `FAKE_METRIC_GUARDRAILS.md` | No fake/demo metrics | Provenance on all financial metrics |

**V2 Fix Validation:**

After fixing V2 issues:

1. Run contract gate:
   ```bash
   make verify-v2-contract
   ```

2. Verify against contract docs:
   - Check: no demo badge appears for auth users
   - Check: portfolio value shows real data
   - Check: quantitative artifacts in left pane

3. Note that `verify-release` is pre-release only:
   - Output: "RELEASE NOT APPROVED YET"
   - Final approval requires founder live validation

 ## Safety Guardrails

**Before auto-fixing:**
- Check issue complexity (simple vs architectural)
- Check affected files (tests vs core logic)
- Check change size (lines modified)

**Auto-fix allowed:**
- <50 lines changed
- Non-protected paths
- Tests, docs, lint fixes
- Import/reference updates

**Require user approval:**
- >50 lines changed
- Protected paths (.claude/hooks, migrations, workflows)
- Core business logic
- API contract changes
- Security-related code

**Never auto-fix:**
- Merge conflicts (too risky)
- Breaking API changes
- Database migrations
- Authentication/authorization logic

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Simple Test Fix

```
User: "fix the PR"

AI reads PR #155:
- CI failure: test_github_projects_lookup references deleted file
- Fixable: Yes (simple import update)

AI:
1. Creates bd-pso.1 (Bug: Update tests for removed helper)
2. Uses Serena to update test imports
3. Commits: "fix: Update tests to use Beads commands"
4. Pushes to branch
5. Closes bd-pso.1
6. Confirms: "✅ Fixed CI failure, PR updated"
```

### Scenario 2: Complex Architectural Change

```
User: "fix the PR"

AI reads PR #155:
- Codex: "This approach doesn't scale for large datasets"
- Not fixable: Requires architectural decision

AI:
1. Creates bd-pso.2 (Task: Optimize for large datasets)
2. Asks user: "This requires architectural changes. Options:
   a) Add pagination
   b) Use streaming
   c) Keep current approach with docs
   Which approach?"
3. User chooses option
4. AI implements or creates plan
```

### Scenario 3: Multiple Issues

```
User: "fix the PR"

AI reads PR #155:
- CI failure: Lint errors (15 lines)
- Codex: Test coverage suggestion
- Danger: Missing docs

AI:
1. Creates 3 child issues: bd-abc, bd-def, bd-ghi
2. Shows summary with auto-fixability analysis
3. Asks: "Fix all, or one at a time?"
4. User: "fix all"
5. AI fixes lint (auto-commit), adds tests (asks first, commits), adds docs (auto-commit)
6. 3 commits created with different Feature-Keys
7. All 3 child issues closed
8. Pushes all commits
9. Confirms: "✅ All issues resolved, CI re-running"
```

### Scenario 4: Manual Triage (NEW)

```
User: "i noticed bugs: 1. MCP type error, 2. permission denied, 3. obsolete test, 4. CI labeler, 5. CI metadata"

AI:
1. Parses 5 bugs from numbered list
2. Creates 5 Beads issues: bd-l76, bd-m89, bd-njn, bd-2qv.1, bd-2qv.2
3. Links all to parent (discovered-from)
4. **MANDATORY DISCUSSION:**
   📋 Created 5 Beads issues for PR #156:
   1. bd-l76 (Bug, P1): MCP type error → Auto-fixable: YES (doc update)
   2. bd-m89 (Bug, P1): permission denied → Auto-fixable: YES (chmod +x)
   3. bd-njn (Bug, P1): obsolete test → Auto-fixable: YES (delete file)
   4. bd-2qv.1 (Bug, P1): CI labeler → Auto-fixable: YES (YAML format)
   5. bd-2qv.2 (Bug, P1): CI metadata → Auto-fixable: YES (PR body)

   Which should I fix?
5. User: "fix all"
6. AI fixes systematically:
   - bd-l76: Update AGENTS.md (commit, close)
   - bd-m89: chmod +x script (commit, close)
   - bd-njn: Delete test file (commit, close)
   - bd-2qv.1: Fix labeler.yml (commit, close)
   - bd-2qv.2: Update PR body (commit, close)
7. Pushes 5 commits
8. Confirms: "✅ Fixed all 5 bugs, PR updated, CI re-running"
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Auto-invoke after PR creation** - PostPRCreate hook
2. **CI status monitoring** - Periodic checks for failures
3. **Smart retry logic** - Re-run failed checks if transient
4. **Conflict resolution hints** - AI-suggested merge strategies
5. **Bulk operations** - Fix all simple issues at once
6. **Learning mode** - Track which auto-fixes succeed/fail
