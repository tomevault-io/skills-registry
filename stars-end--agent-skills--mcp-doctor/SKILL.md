# mcp-doctor

Runs a fast, safe verification of canonical MCP + DX expectations.

## Usage

```bash
~/agent-skills/health/mcp-doctor/check.sh
MCP_DOCTOR_STRICT=1 ~/agent-skills/health/mcp-doctor/check.sh
```

## Design

- Warn-only by default (never blocks automation unless strict mode is enabled).
- Never prints secrets.
- Checks canonical IDE config locations (see `docs/CANONICAL_TARGETS.md`).
- Operates as the living operational MCP skill backed by the researched client contract.
- Authoritative reference: `docs/runbook/fleet-sync/client-mcp-contract.md`
- Merge gate matrix: `docs/runbook/fleet-sync/merge-acceptance-matrix.md`

## Client Contracts

The doctor distinguishes between host runtime health, config/render health, and client-visible MCP activation.

Current verified per-client sources of truth:
- **Claude Code**: `~/.claude.json` (uses `mcpServers` object)
- **Gemini CLI**: `~/.gemini/settings.json` (uses `mcpServers` object)
- **Codex CLI**: `~/.codex/config.toml` (uses `[mcp_servers]` table, required on `macmini`, optional on Linux hosts)
- **OpenCode**: `~/.config/opencode/opencode.jsonc` (uses `mcp` object)
- **Antigravity**: `~/.gemini/antigravity/mcp_config.json` (uses `mcpServers` object)

`context-plus` has been removed from the canonical MCP contract and should not
be validated as an active doctor surface. Historical references may remain in
archived investigation docs only.

## Status Semantics
- `VERIFIED`: Proven via client CLI output.
- `INFERRED`: Verified by config presence but lacks a native client list command (e.g. `antigravity`).
- `BLOCKED`: Client currently ignores known config paths or formats.
