# op-secrets-quickref

## Goal

Keep secrets out of repos and dotfiles. Use 1Password `op://...` references and runtime resolution with **agent-safe cache/service-account auth by default**. GUI-backed `op` on macOS is a human bootstrap/recovery path, not a dependency for agents or cron.

## Critical Rule

- Tool calls do **not** share shell exports reliably. If auth needs to survive across tool calls, prefer cache/service-account mode from `scripts/lib/dx-auth.sh` and keep OP/Railway auth inside the same shell invocation.
- If you need Railway in automation, load `RAILWAY_API_TOKEN` from the synced cache or service-account refresh in the **same command invocation**.
- Do not treat macOS 1Password GUI unlock as agent readiness. It proves only `human_interactive_only`.
- For agent sessions (especially macOS), raw `op read`, `op item get`, `op item list`, and `op whoami` are forbidden for routine secret access.
- Agent-safe secret reads must use cache/service-account helpers, preferably `DX_AUTH_CACHE_ONLY=1 dx_auth_read_secret_cached ...`.
- If cache/service-account auth is unavailable, fail closed with a blocker. Do not fall back to GUI-backed `op` in agent workflows.
- Do not run OP retry loops unless the task is explicitly auth-repair.
- Prefer the canonical status helper before diagnosing:

```bash
~/agent-skills/scripts/dx-op-auth-status.sh --json
```

- Prefer the canonical repair helper on fresh devices:

```bash
~/agent-skills/scripts/dx-bootstrap-auth.sh --json
```

- Prefer the canonical helper for Railway-linked shells:

```bash
~/agent-skills/scripts/dx-load-railway-auth.sh -- railway whoami
```

## Auth Mode Matrix

| Context | Canonical mode | Allowed live `op` source |
|---------|----------------|--------------------------|
| Human in a macOS terminal | GUI-backed `op` | Yes, after 1Password app sign-in, CLI integration, and `op signin` for the current unlock/session |
| Agent on macOS | synced cache first; service-account artifact if explicitly configured | No GUI dependency |
| macOS cron/LaunchAgent | synced cache only | No |
| Linux VM agent | synced cache or service-account artifact | No GUI |
| `epyc12` maintenance | service-account refresh hub | Yes, via service account |

`dx-op-auth-status.sh --json` reports one of:

- `agent_ready_cache`: preferred on consumer hosts; synced cache can satisfy agent secrets.
- `agent_ready_service_account`: acceptable on refresh-capable hosts.
- `human_interactive_only`: GUI-backed `op` works, but agents/cron must still be fixed.
- `blocked`: no usable agent-safe auth path is available.

## Canonical Fleet Rule

For canonical VM unattended automation:

- `epyc12` is the only canonical VM that should refresh OP-derived caches
  directly.
- Other canonical VMs should sync cache artifacts from `epyc12` and run with
  `DX_AUTH_CACHE_ONLY=1`.
- If a macOS cron/system job is touching live `op`, treat that as topology
  drift and fix the job instead of approving repeated privacy prompts.

## What Lives Where

- **DX/dev workflow secrets** (agent keys, GitHub tokens, Slack tokens): 1Password (`op://...`), resolved at runtime.
- **Deploy/runtime config**: Railway **environment variables** in the Railway project.
- **App runtime secrets** (for example `EODHD_CRON_SHARED_SECRET`, `DATABASE_URL`, service URLs): Railway service env, not guessed 1Password items.
- **Railway CLI automation token**: `RAILWAY_API_TOKEN` exported from 1Password (`Agent-Secrets-Production`).

### Slack token policy for deterministic transport

- Use `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` as default for Agent Coordination transport.
- Fallback to `SLACK_APP_TOKEN` if needed.
- Both are resolved from `op://dev/Agent-Secrets-Production/...`.
- A valid token does not guarantee channel history access; missing channel membership or `channels:join` scope is a Slack scope issue, not an OP auth failure.

```bash
# Use cached resolution for automation / cron
source scripts/lib/dx-auth.sh
export SLACK_BOT_TOKEN="$(dx_auth_read_secret_cached "op://dev/Agent-Secrets-Production/SLACK_BOT_TOKEN")"
export SLACK_APP_TOKEN="$(dx_auth_read_secret_cached "op://dev/Agent-Secrets-Production/SLACK_APP_TOKEN")"
```

Implementation uses these tokens via:
[`scripts/lib/dx-slack-alerts.sh`](/private/tmp/agents/bd-3o07/agent-skills/scripts/lib/dx-slack-alerts.sh)

## 1Password Item Reference

| Item | Fields | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| `Agent-Secrets-Production` | `ZAI_API_KEY`, `RAILWAY_API_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`, `SLACK_APP_TOKEN`, `WINDMILL_API_TOKEN` | DX/dev workflow secrets (default source) |

**Note:** ZAI_API_KEY is used as ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN (Z.ai routes to Anthropic-compatible API).

## Agent-Safe Auth (Default)

### Step 1: Check Agent Readiness

```bash
~/agent-skills/scripts/dx-bootstrap-auth.sh --json
```

Accept `agent_ready_cache` or `agent_ready_service_account` for agent work.
On macOS, `human_interactive_only` means the GUI path works for the human but
the agent-safe cache still needs to be synced or created.

### Step 2: Verify/Create Service Account Token When Needed

Check if credential exists:
```bash
ls -la ~/.config/systemd/user/op-{macmini,homedesktop-wsl,epyc6,epyc12}-token*
```

Create protected service-account token file (requires human to paste token):
```bash
~/agent-skills/scripts/create-op-credential.sh
```

### Step 3: Export Token for Current Shell

Fallback order for service-account credentials:

1. `OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN_FILE` if explicitly set
2. `~/.config/systemd/user/op-<canonical-host-key>-token`
3. `~/.config/systemd/user/op-<canonical-host-key>-token.cred`
4. legacy fallback: `~/.config/systemd/user/op_token`
5. legacy fallback: `~/.config/systemd/user/op_token.cred`

**Same-invocation helper for automation:**
```bash
~/agent-skills/scripts/dx-load-railway-auth.sh -- railway whoami
```

**Linux (systemd-creds encrypted):**
```bash
export OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN="$(systemd-creds decrypt ~/.config/systemd/user/op-epyc6-token.cred)"
```

**macOS service-account fallback (not the GUI path):**
```bash
export OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN="$(cat ~/.config/systemd/user/op-macmini-token)"
```

### Step 4: Verify Agent-Safe Mode

```bash
~/agent-skills/scripts/dx-op-auth-status.sh --json
```

For agent workflows, accept `agent_ready_cache` or `agent_ready_service_account`.
Use `op whoami` only in explicit human bootstrap/recovery sessions.

### macOS GUI Bootstrap

Use this only when a human is actively setting up or repairing a Mac:

1. Open 1Password and sign in/unlock.
2. Enable 1Password CLI integration in the app's Developer settings.
3. Run `op signin` once for the current 1Password unlock/session.
4. Run `op whoami`.
5. Use GUI-backed `op` to create/sync the agent-safe cache or credential.

Do not put GUI-backed `op read` calls in cron, LaunchAgents, shell startup, or
agent bootstrap scripts. Because the GUI-backed session can require re-signing
after device lock or 1Password lock, it is a human convenience path, not an
agent readiness signal.

### Windmill CLI Auth

Canonical source:
`op://dev/Agent-Secrets-Production/WINDMILL_API_TOKEN`

Legacy or ambiguous standalone references like "windmill dev api token" should be treated as migration artifacts unless a specific environment explicitly requires them.

For repeated reads or commands that need the token to survive across tool calls, use cached service-account mode:

```bash
source scripts/lib/dx-auth.sh
export WINDMILL_API_TOKEN="$(dx_auth_read_secret_cached "op://dev/Agent-Secrets-Production/WINDMILL_API_TOKEN")"
```

## Failure Modes: Auth vs Rate Limit

Treat these as different problems:

- `No accounts configured`, `not signed in`, `Unauthorized`
  - for agent-safe auth: service-account/cache auth is missing or the token was
    not loaded in the same invocation
  - for macOS human GUI auth: run `op signin` after unlocking 1Password, then
    retry `op whoami`
- `Too many requests`
  - service-account auth succeeded, but 1Password is rate-limiting the client

For rate limits:
- stop repeated raw OP loops (`op item list`, `op item get`, `op item create`, `op read`)
- batch reads where possible
- wait and retry with backoff instead of assuming auth is broken

Agent-safe check pattern:

```bash
source scripts/lib/dx-auth.sh
DX_AUTH_CACHE_ONLY=1 dx_auth_read_secret_cached "op://dev/Agent-Secrets-Production/RAILWAY_API_TOKEN" >/dev/null \
  || { echo "BLOCKED: cache_unavailable"; exit 1; }
```

### Interactive Auth (Human Fallback Only)

Use only for a human terminal recovery flow, not for agents:
```bash
# HUMAN_RECOVERY_ONLY
eval $(op signin)
```

## Common Commands (Human Recovery Only; Not Agent Routine)

### List Items (Titles Only)

List items in the `dev` vault during manual recovery only:
```bash
# HUMAN_RECOVERY_ONLY
op item list --vault dev
```

### List Field Labels (No Secret Values)

Get field labels for an item using grep/cut (no jq needed) in manual recovery:
```bash
# HUMAN_RECOVERY_ONLY
op item get --vault dev Agent-Secrets-Production --format json | grep -o '"label":"[^"]*"' | cut -d'"' -f4
```

Alternative using op's native field output:
```bash
# HUMAN_RECOVERY_ONLY
op item get --vault dev Agent-Secrets-Production --fields label
```

### Read a Single Secret (interactive / one-shot)

For explicit human bootstrap/recovery only:

```bash
# HUMAN_RECOVERY_ONLY
op read "op://dev/Agent-Secrets-Production/ZAI_API_KEY"
```

### Cached Secret Resolution (standard for agents / automation / repeated reads)

For cron, systemd, scripts, or any path that reads secrets repeatedly, use the
cached helpers from `scripts/lib/dx-auth.sh`.  These avoid hitting 1Password on
every invocation by maintaining a local file cache (`~/.cache/dx/op-secrets/`,
24h TTL) refreshed via the service account token.

**General-purpose cached read:**

```bash
source scripts/lib/dx-auth.sh
token="$(dx_auth_read_secret_cached "op://dev/Agent-Secrets-Production/ZAI_API_KEY")"
```

**Named loaders for common secrets:**

| Helper | Env var set | Source ref |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| `dx_auth_load_zai_api_key` | `ZAI_API_KEY` | `op://dev/Agent-Secrets-Production/ZAI_API_KEY` |
| `dx_auth_load_railway_api_token` | `RAILWAY_API_TOKEN` | `op://dev/Agent-Secrets-Production/RAILWAY_API_TOKEN` |
| `dx_auth_load_github_token` | `GH_TOKEN` | `op://dev/Agent-Secrets-Production/GITHUB_TOKEN` |
| `dx_auth_load_op_service_account_token` | `OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN` | host credential files |

**Example — cron / automation:**

```bash
# Nightly enrichment (uses cached ZAI_API_KEY)
0 3 * * * /path/to/agent-skills/scripts/enrichment/enrichment-cron-wrapper.sh >> /tmp/enrichment.log 2>&1
```

**Canonical VM fleet pattern:**

```bash
# Refresh hub (epyc12 only)
*/15 * * * * /home/fengning/agent-skills/scripts/dx-job-wrapper.sh refresh-op-cache -- /home/fengning/agent-skills/scripts/dx-refresh-op-caches.sh

# Consumer host (for example macmini)
DX_AUTH_CACHE_ONLY=1
2,17,32,47 * * * * ~/agent-skills/scripts/dx-job-wrapper.sh sync-op-cache -- ~/agent-skills/scripts/dx-sync-op-caches.sh
```

**Fresh-device repair:**

```bash
~/agent-skills/scripts/dx-bootstrap-auth.sh --json
```

This checks local agent auth first, syncs OP cache artifacts from `epyc12` on
cache miss, then checks again. It does not use macOS GUI `op signin` as an
agent readiness signal.

**Example — script preamble:**

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
source scripts/lib/dx-auth.sh
dx_auth_load_zai_api_key || { echo "BLOCKED: ZAI_API_KEY" >&2; exit 1; }
# $ZAI_API_KEY is now exported and ready
```

**How the cache works:**

1. If the target env var is already set (and not an `op://` reference), return immediately.
2. Check the local cache file (`~/.cache/dx/op-secrets/`). If fresh (within TTL), read from it.
3. On cache miss, load the OP service account token and refresh the cache via `op item get`.
4. Export the resolved value.

### Export for CLI Usage (cron/CI)

```bash
# GitHub CLI — use cached loader
source scripts/lib/dx-auth.sh && dx_auth_load_github_token
gh auth status  # Should show: ✓ Logged in to github.com (GH_TOKEN)

# Railway CLI auth (same invocation recommended)
~/agent-skills/scripts/dx-load-railway-auth.sh -- railway status
```

### Read Multiple Fields at Once (Human Recovery Only)

```bash
# HUMAN_RECOVERY_ONLY
op item get --vault dev Agent-Secrets-Production --fields ZAI_API_KEY,RAILWAY_API_TOKEN,GITHUB_TOKEN
```

## Railway Variables

### Railway CLI Token (Non-Interactive)

```bash
~/agent-skills/scripts/dx-load-railway-auth.sh -- railway whoami
```

If cache/service-account auth is unavailable in agent mode, fail closed and return a blocker. Human recovery can use:

```bash
~/agent-skills/scripts/dx-load-railway-auth.sh -- railway whoami
```

### App Runtime Secrets: Use Railway Context, Not `op read`

If a secret belongs to the deployed app or service runtime, do **not** invent a 1Password path for it.

Wrong:
Raw `op read` against an invented app-runtime secret path (human recovery examples stay in the appendix only).

Right:

```bash
# Verify the secret exists in the service runtime without printing it
~/agent-skills/scripts/dx-load-railway-auth.sh -- \
  ~/agent-skills/scripts/dx-railway-run.sh -- sh -lc 'test -n "$EODHD_CRON_SHARED_SECRET" && echo configured'

# Use the secret inside Railway context so it never needs to be echoed locally
~/agent-skills/scripts/dx-load-railway-auth.sh -- \
  ~/agent-skills/scripts/dx-railway-run.sh -- sh -lc '
    curl -sS -X POST \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -H "X-PR-CRON-SECRET: $EODHD_CRON_SHARED_SECRET" \
      "$BACKEND_INTERNAL_URL/api/v2/internal/eodhd/cron/eod"
  '
```

For Prime Radiant dev investigations, the active orchestrator is Railway-hosted Windmill on the canonical unsuffixed Railway stack. Check the Windmill workspace assets under `f/eodhd/*` before assuming the deprecated `eodhd-cron` service is the primary runtime surface.

### Railway Service URL Variables

Railway automatically injects these URL variables into services:

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `RAILWAY_SERVICE_FRONTEND_URL` | Public URL for frontend service | `https://myapp.up.railway.app` |
| `RAILWAY_SERVICE_BACKEND_URL` | Public URL for backend service | `https://api.myapp.up.railway.app` |
| `RAILWAY_STATIC_URL` | Static URL (legacy) | `https://myapp.up.railway.app` |

**Usage in services:**
```bash
# In Railway service, these are auto-injected
curl "$RAILWAY_SERVICE_BACKEND_URL/health"
```

**Local development fallback:**
```bash
# Use localhost when not in Railway
BACKEND_URL="${RAILWAY_SERVICE_BACKEND_URL:-http://localhost:3000}"
```

## Rules

- Never hardcode secrets in repos.
- Prefer synced cache or service-account auth over interactive biometric auth
  for agents, cron, systemd, and LaunchAgents.
- **Use cached secret helpers** (`dx_auth_read_secret_cached`, `dx_auth_load_zai_api_key`, etc.) for cron, systemd, automation, and repeated secret reads.
- In agent sessions, raw `op read`, `op item get`, `op item list`, and `op whoami` are forbidden for routine secret access.
- Human GUI-backed OP is bootstrap/recovery only and must be labeled as such.
- On cache/service-account miss, fail closed with a blocker; never silently fall back to GUI OP.
- Do not run OP retry loops unless the task is explicitly auth-repair.
- Prefer `op://...` references in env templates and resolve at runtime via `op run --env-file=... -- <command>`.
- Avoid printing secrets in logs. If you must verify, do it once and then stop output.
- Use grep/cut instead of jq for field extraction (more portable).
- Do not put `OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN` or `RAILWAY_API_TOKEN` in `~/.zshrc` or `~/.zshenv`.
- Do not guess 1Password item names for app runtime secrets. If the value belongs to a deployed service, fetch it from Railway context.
- Do not diagnose OP rate limits as sign-in failures without checking `dx-op-auth-status.sh --json` first.
