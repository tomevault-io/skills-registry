# Session End

End session cleanly with Beads health checks, stats, and next work suggestion.

## Workflow

### 1. Set Beads Context
```
mcp__plugin_beads_beads__set_context(workspace_root="/path/to/project")
```

### 2. Verify Canonical Beads Health
**CRITICAL:** confirm Beads is reachable before ending session context.

```bash
bdx dolt test --json
bdx show <known-beads-id> --json
```

**What this does:**
- Confirms `bdx` coordination path is healthy
- Confirms issue reads are queryable
- Prevents silent session-end on broken tracker state

Use raw `bd` only for local diagnostics/bootstrap/path-sensitive operations.

### 3. Get Session Stats
```
stats = mcp__plugin_beads_beads__stats()
```

Show relevant metrics:
- Issues closed this session
- Issues created this session
- Current epic progress
- Total ready work available

### 4. Suggest Next Work
```
readyTasks = mcp__plugin_beads_beads__ready(priority=1)
```

Show top 3-5 ready tasks by priority:
- Unblocked P1 issues
- Next phase tasks in current epic
- High-value backlog items

### 5. Verify Canonicals Are Clean (V7.6)

Run the invariant check before claiming you're “done”:

```bash
~/agent-skills/scripts/dx-verify-clean.sh
```

### 6. Context Summary

Show what to resume in next session:
```
📊 Session Summary

Issues Closed: 3
  • bd-xpi.4 (Testing)
  • bd-xpi.4.1 (Bug: SessionStart permission)
  • bd-xpi.4.2 (Bug: UserPromptSubmit JSON)

Issues Created: 2
  • bd-xpi.4.1 (discovered-from bd-xpi.4)
  • bd-xpi.4.2 (discovered-from bd-xpi.4)

Current Work:
  bd-xpi.5 (in_progress): Implementation Part 2
  Epic: bd-xpi (DX_V3_BEADS_INTEGRATION)

✅ Beads connectivity verified
✅ Canonicals verified clean

📍 Next Session:
  Top ready tasks:
  1. bd-xpi.5 (P1) - Continue implementation
  2. bd-abc.3 (P1) - API integration testing
  3. bd-def.2 (P2) - Documentation updates

Say "bdx ready" to see full ready work queue
```

## Best Practices

- **Always call at session end** - Catches tracker outages before context loss
- **Don't skip health checks** - Prevents silent drift on broken Beads service
- **Review stats** - Understand what was accomplished
- **Note next work** - Reduces context switching overhead in next session
- **Git status clean** - Commit all work before session-end

## Common Usage

**User signals:**
- "I'm done for today"
- "Ending session"
- "Log off"
- "Save and exit"
- "That's all for now"

> Note: Skill activation relies on semantic description matching, not legacy pattern files.

## What This DOESN'T Do

- ❌ Create new issues (use beads-workflow for that)
- ❌ Commit code (use sync-feature-branch first)
- ❌ Close ongoing work (only validates state + summarizes)

**Philosophy:** Clean exits + Context preservation + Ready for next session
