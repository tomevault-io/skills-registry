## Canonical bd prefix cutover (2026-04-02)

- `agent-skills` new-work Feature-Key / branch / PR metadata should use `bd-*`.
- Canonical Beads now defaults to `bd-*` for new issues, so the repo workflow and Beads default are aligned again.
- Legacy `af-*` or other historical prefixes may still resolve in Beads, but they are not the default contract for new `agent-skills` work.

# Sync Feature Branch

Commit current work with Beads tracking + smart discovery handling + auto phase transitions.

## Workflow

### 1. Set Beads Context
```bash
bd-context
```

If `bd-context` reports an incompatible issue prefix in `agent-skills`, stop there. Create or choose the correct `bd-*` issue for this repo, rename the branch to `feature-bd-<issue>`, and only then continue with commit flow. If the active Beads default prefix is incompatible but the current branch is already `bd-*`, keep the branch and create any new tracking issues with explicit `bdx create --id bd-<issue> --force`.

### 2. Get Current Issue
```bash
git branch --show-current
# Extract FEATURE_KEY from feature-<KEY> pattern
```

Use `bdx show`:
```bash
currentIssue=$(bdx show <FEATURE_KEY> --json)
```

If not found, auto-create as safety net:
```bash
bdx create --title <FEATURE_KEY> --type feature --priority 2 --description "Auto-created during commit"
```

**Note:** Issue should ideally exist BEFORE coding (Issue-First Development), but this prevents orphaned commits.

### 3. Analyze Diff for Discoveries
```bash
git diff HEAD
```

Detect discovery patterns:
- **Bug fixes:** Lines with "fix:", "bug:", error handling additions
- **New tasks:** TODO comments, "should add", validation additions
- **Protected paths:** .claude/hooks/**, migrations/**, workflows/**

Score risk level:
- **Auto (silent):** <50 lines, P3-P4, non-protected
- **Auto (notify):** <100 lines, P2, non-protected
- **Prompt:** >100 lines OR P0-P1 OR protected paths

### 4. Handle Discoveries (if detected)

If discovery found and risk <= "auto (notify)":
```bash
childIssueId=$(bdx create --title "Bug: <detected-issue>" --type bug --priority 1 --parent ${currentIssueId} --json | jq -r .id)
```

Close child issue BEFORE commit:
```bash
bdx close $childIssueId --reason "Fixed"
```

Verify canonical Beads health:
```bash
beads-dolt dolt test --json
beads-dolt status --json
```

Commit with child Feature-Key:
```bash
# Get agent identity
AGENT_ID="$(~/.agent/skills/scripts/get_agent_identity.sh)"

git add -A
git commit -m "fix: <issue-description>

Closes ${childIssue.id}

Feature-Key: ${childIssue.id}
Agent: $AGENT_ID
Parent-Feature: ${currentIssue.id}
Discovery-Type: bug"
```

If risk = "prompt", ask user before creating issue.

### 5. Every Commit Check (make ci-lite)
```bash
if make ci-lite exists:
  make ci-lite
  if fails: 
    echo "❌ make ci-lite failed (Linting or Backend Tests)"
    ask user: "Fix errors or force commit? (fix/force)"
    if fix: exit 1
```

### 5.5. Doc Auto-Link and Impact Analysis

**Auto-link docs to Beads (if not already linked):**

```bash
# Check if docs directory exists
DOC_DIR="docs/${currentIssue.id}"
if [ -d "$DOC_DIR" ]; then
  # Check if already linked
  CURRENT_REF=$(bdx show ${currentIssue.id} --json | jq -r '.external_ref // ""')

  if [ -z "$CURRENT_REF" ] || [ "$CURRENT_REF" = "null" ]; then
    # Auto-link
    bdx update ${currentIssue.id} --external-ref "docs:${DOC_DIR}/"
    echo "📎 Auto-linked: ${currentIssue.id} ↔ ${DOC_DIR}/"
  fi
fi
```

**Doc impact analysis:**

```bash
# Run doc router to analyze which docs might need updates
python3 scripts/ci/doc_router.py --base HEAD --head @ --format brief
```

Show informational message if doc updates recommended:
```
ℹ️  Doc Impact Detected:
   - backend/services/auth.py → docs/SECURITY/AUTH.md
   - frontend/components/Login.tsx → docs/FRONTEND/COMPONENTS.md

   Consider updating docs before PR (optional)
```

**Why informational:**
- Non-blocking (doesn't fail commit)
- User controls timing (can update now or later)
- CI will also check (reminder in PR comments)

### 6. Commit Changes

If NO discovery (normal commit):
```bash
# Get agent identity (uses DX_AGENT_ID if set, fallback to auto-detect)
AGENT_ID="$(~/.agent/skills/scripts/get_agent_identity.sh)"

git add -A
git commit -m "feat: Progress on {FEATURE_KEY}

Feature-Key: {currentIssue.id}
Agent: $AGENT_ID
Role: {current-role}"
```

**Note**: `Agent:` trailer uses DX_AGENT_ID standard (bd-n1rv). See `DX_AGENT_ID.md` for details.

If discovery handled, commit was already done in step 4.

### 7. Check for Phase Completion

After commit, check if current issue should close:
```bash
bdx show $currentIssueId
```

**Auto-close criteria:**
- Issue has dependents (tasks waiting)
- Work appears complete (no obvious TODOs in recent commits)
- User didn't say "work in progress" or "checkpoint"

If should close:
```bash
bdx close $currentIssueId --reason "Completed in commit <hash>"
```

### 8. Auto Phase Transition

After closing current issue, use a bounded task selection surface:
```bash
bdx show <known-next-id> --json
# or, for manual browsing only:
bdx ready --priority 1 --limit 5
```

If next task found:
```bash
bdx update $nextTaskId status=in_progress
```

### 9. Confirm to User

If discovery occurred:
```
✅ Auto-committed {childIssue.id} (bug fix, 15 lines)
✅ {childIssue.id} closed

📍 Resuming {currentIssue.id}: {currentIssue.title}
   Ready to continue main task
```

If phase transitioned:
```
✅ Closed {currentIssue.id} (Research complete)
📍 Starting {nextTask.id}: {nextTask.title}
   Next phase in epic workflow
```

If normal commit:
```
✅ Committed to feature-{currentIssue.id}
✅ Beads updated

Next: Say 'create PR' to open pull request
```

## Best Practices

- **Set context first** - Call set_context() at start of skill
- **Analyze diff before commit** - Detect discoveries automatically
- **Use child IDs** - Auto-assigned (bd-xyz.1, bd-xyz.2)
- **Link discoveries** - deps=[parent] creates discovered-from
- **Trust automation** - Auto-close criteria are conservative
- **Phase transitions** - Automatic when dependencies exist
- **Context restoration** - Always show what's next after transitions

## Discovery Detection Patterns

**Bug fixes detected by:**
- Commit message starts with "fix:", "bug:"
- New error handling (try/catch, if err)
- Permission fixes (chmod, access control)
- Schema corrections (JSON format, API contracts)

**Tasks detected by:**
- TODO/FIXME comments added
- "should add", "need to implement"
- Placeholder code with notes

**Auto-close NOT triggered if:**
- User says "checkpoint", "work in progress", "WIP"
- Commit message includes "partial", "incomplete"
- Multiple TODOs remain in diff

## What This DOESN'T Do

- ❌ Run full test suite (CI handles this)
- ❌ Build containers (CI handles this)
- ❌ Wait for approval (environments validate async)
- ❌ Close issues if user indicates incomplete work

**Philosophy:** Fast commits + Smart automation + Context preservation
