# Filing Checklist for Free File Fillable Forms

Generate a complete, step-by-step guide for the user to file their return at freefilefillableforms.com.

## Prerequisites

Read `./returns/return-2025.json` for the calculated return data and `reference/form-1040-field-map.md` for field mapping details.

If no return data exists:
> "No return data found. Run `/ezfile:file-taxes <path-to-w2>` to calculate your return first."

## Part 1: Before You Start

Display this checklist:

BEFORE YOU START — Gather These Items

  [ ] Your date of birth
  [ ] Your current mailing address
  [ ] Last year's AGI (from your 2024 tax return, needed for identity verification)
      → If you didn't file last year, you'll need your prior year Self-Select PIN
      → If this is your first time filing, enter $0
  [ ] Bank account info for direct deposit (routing number + account number)
