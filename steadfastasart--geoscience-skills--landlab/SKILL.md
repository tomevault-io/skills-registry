# Landlab - Surface Process Modelling

## Quick Reference

```python
from landlab import RasterModelGrid
from landlab.components import FlowAccumulator, StreamPowerEroder
import numpy as np

# Create grid
grid = RasterModelGrid((100, 100), xy_spacing=10.0)
z = grid.add_zeros('topographic__elevation', at='node')
z += np.random.rand(grid.number_of_nodes) * 0.1

# Set boundaries (open bottom edge)
grid.set_closed_boundaries_at_grid_edges(True, True, True, False)

# Create and run components
fa = FlowAccumulator(grid, flow_director='D8')
sp = StreamPowerEroder(grid, K_sp=1e-5)

for _ in range(100):
    fa.run_one_step()
    sp.run_one_step(dt=1000)
    z[grid.core_nodes] += 0.001 * 1000  # Uplift

grid.imshow('topographic__elevation', cmap='terrain')
```

## Grid Types

| Grid | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| `RasterModelGrid` | Regular rectangular grids (most common) |
| `HexModelGrid` | Hexagonal grids (isotropic flow) |
| `VoronoiDelaunayGrid` | Irregular point distributions |
| `NetworkModelGrid` | Channel networks only |

## Key Concepts

### Fields and Boundaries
```python
# Fields: data stored at grid elements (nodes, links, cells)
z = grid.add_zeros('topographic__elevation', at='node')
grid.at_node['drainage_area']  # Access existing field

# Boundaries: close all edges except outlet
grid.set_closed_boundaries_at_grid_edges(True, True, True, False)
z[grid.core_nodes] += uplift * dt  # Core nodes exclude boundaries
```

## Essential Operations

### Flow Routing
```python
from landlab.components import FlowAccumulator

fa = FlowAccumulator(grid, flow_director='D8')  # or 'Steepest', 'MFD'
fa.run_one_step()
drainage_area = grid.at_node['drainage_area']
```

### Stream Power Erosion
```python
from landlab.components import StreamPowerEroder

sp = StreamPowerEroder(grid, K_sp=1e-5, m_sp=0.5, n_sp=1.0)
sp.run_one_step(dt=1000)  # dt in years
```

### Hillslope Diffusion
```python
from landlab.components import LinearDiffuser

ld = LinearDiffuser(grid, linear_diffusivity=0.01)  # m^2/yr
ld.run_one_step(dt=100)
```

### Load/Save DEM Data
```python
from landlab.io import read_esri_ascii, write_esri_ascii
from landlab.io.netcdf import read_netcdf, write_netcdf

grid, z = read_esri_ascii('dem.asc', name='topographic__elevation')
write_esri_ascii('output.asc', grid, names='topographic__elevation')
write_netcdf('output.nc', grid)  # Save all fields
```

## Multi-Component Model

```python
from landlab import RasterModelGrid
from landlab.components import FlowAccumulator, StreamPowerEroder, LinearDiffuser

grid = RasterModelGrid((100, 100), xy_spacing=100.0)
z = grid.add_zeros('topographic__elevation', at='node')
z += grid.node_y / 1000 + np.random.rand(grid.number_of_nodes) * 0.1
grid.set_closed_boundaries_at_grid_edges(True, True, True, False)

fa = FlowAccumulator(grid, flow_director='D8')
sp = StreamPowerEroder(grid, K_sp=1e-5)
ld = LinearDiffuser(grid, linear_diffusivity=0.01)

dt, uplift_rate = 1000, 0.001
for _ in range(500):
    fa.run_one_step()
    sp.run_one_step(dt)
    ld.run_one_step(dt)
    z[grid.core_nodes] += uplift_rate * dt
```

## When to Use vs Alternatives

| Use Case | Tool | Why |
|----------|------|-----|
| Landscape evolution modelling | **Landlab** | Modular components, Python-native |
| Basin-scale stratigraphy | **Badlands** | Focus on sediment deposition and basin fill |
| Topographic analysis (MATLAB) | **TopoToolbox** | Mature MATLAB toolkit for DEM analysis |
| Simple diffusion/erosion | **Custom numpy** | Fewer dependencies for basic models |
| Coupled surface-subsurface | **Landlab** | Components for hydrology + geomorphology |
| Channel network extraction | **Landlab** or **pysheds** | Both handle flow routing well |
| Soil production and transport | **Landlab** | Dedicated weathering and soil components |
| Teaching geomorphology | **Landlab** | Clear component API, good tutorials |

**Choose Landlab when**: You need a modular, component-based framework for
landscape evolution modelling that combines multiple surface processes (erosion,
diffusion, flow routing, weathering) in a single simulation.

**Choose Badlands when**: Your focus is on basin-scale landscape evolution with
emphasis on sediment transport and stratigraphic architecture.

**Choose custom numpy when**: You only need a simple 2D diffusion or stream power
model without the overhead of a full component framework.

## Common Workflows

### Landscape Evolution Model with Erosion and Uplift
- [ ] Create `RasterModelGrid` with appropriate dimensions and spacing
- [ ] Initialize `topographic__elevation` field (flat + noise, or load DEM)
- [ ] Set boundary conditions (open one edge as outlet, close others)
- [ ] Create `FlowAccumulator` with chosen flow director (D8 or MFD)
- [ ] Create `StreamPowerEroder` with erosion coefficient K_sp
- [ ] Create `LinearDiffuser` for hillslope processes
- [ ] Define time step `dt` and total runtime; choose uplift rate
- [ ] Run time loop: flow routing, erosion, diffusion, then uplift
- [ ] Save snapshots at intervals with `write_netcdf()` or `write_esri_ascii()`
- [ ] Visualize final topography with `grid.imshow()`
- [ ] Analyze drainage area and channel profiles
- [ ] Extract river long profiles for steepness analysis

## Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Flat areas block flow | Add small random noise to initial topography |
| Boundary effects | Ensure at least one open boundary edge for drainage |
| Unstable erosion | Reduce `dt` or `K_sp`; check Courant condition |
| Wrong field name | Use exact Landlab names: `'topographic__elevation'`, `'drainage_area'` |
| Memory with large grids | Reduce grid resolution or use `NetworkModelGrid` for channels only |

## Tips

1. **Set boundaries first** - before adding components
2. **Use core_nodes** - excludes boundary nodes for operations
3. **Check field names** - components expect specific names (e.g., 'topographic__elevation')
4. **Start simple** - add components incrementally and verify each
