# TwinMe - Soul Signature Platform

## Vercel Cost Rules (CRITICAL — $375 bill incident March 2026)

- **Crons**: NEVER more than */15. Removed token-refresh cron (on-demand only). deliver-insights and prospective-check at */15.
- **maxDuration**: 60s (was 120s — halves GB-hour cost)
- **Deploys**: ONE per push (disabled GitHub Action duplicate). Batch commits before pushing.
- **New crons**: Must justify frequency. Default to hourly or daily, not every-N-minutes.
- **LLM in crons**: Always check cooldowns/conditions BEFORE calling LLM. Early return = free.

## Workflow Orchestration

### 1. Plan Node Default
- Enter plan mode for ANY non-trivial task (3+ steps or architectural decisions)
- If something goes sideways, STOP and re-plan immediately — don't keep pushing
- Use plan mode for verification steps, not just building
- Write detailed specs upfront to reduce ambiguity

### 2. Subagent Strategy
- Use subagents liberally to keep main context window clean
- Offload research, exploration, and parallel analysis to subagents
- For complex problems, throw more compute at it via subagents
- One tack per subagent for focused execution

### 3. Self-Improvement Loop
- After ANY correction from the user: update `tasks/lessons.md` with the pattern
- Write rules for yourself that prevent the same mistake
- Ruthlessly iterate on these lessons until mistake rate drops
- Review lessons at session start for relevant project

### 4. Verification Before Done
- Never mark a task complete without proving it works
- Diff behavior between main and your changes when relevant
- Ask yourself: "Would a staff engineer approve this?"
- Run tests, check logs, demonstrate correctness

### 5. Demand Elegance (Balanced)
- For non-trivial changes: pause and ask "is there a more elegant way?"
- If a fix feels hacky: "Knowing everything I know now, implement the elegant solution"
- Skip this for simple, obvious fixes — don't over-engineer
- Challenge your own work before presenting it

### 6. Bug Fixing: Test-First
- When a bug is reported, do NOT start by trying to fix it
- First, write a test that reproduces the bug (the test must FAIL)
- Then, launch subagents to fix the bug and prove it with a passing test
- Zero context switching required from the user
- Go fix failing CI tests without being told how

## Task Management

1. **Plan First**: Write plan to `tasks/todo.md` with checkable items
2. **Verify Plan**: Check in before starting implementation
3. **Track Progress**: Mark items complete as you go
4. **Explain Changes**: High-level summary at each step
5. **Document Results**: Add review section to `tasks/todo.md`
6. **Capture Lessons**: Update `tasks/lessons.md` after corrections

## Core Principles

- **Simplicity First**: Make every change as simple as possible. Impact minimal code.
- **No Laziness**: Find root causes. No temporary fixes. Senior developer standards.
- **Minimal Impact**: Changes should only touch what's necessary. Avoid introducing bugs.

## Vision
TwinMe creates digital twins that capture your true originality - your **Soul Signature**. We go deeper than public information by discovering what makes you authentically YOU through the digital footprints that reveal your genuine curiosities, passions, and patterns.

**One-liner:** A data-driven personality portrait that reveals patterns about yourself you never noticed, powers an AI twin that actually knows you, and lets you share your authentic self.

## Core Product Loop
```
1. ONBOARDING    -> Cofounder.co-style: email lookup -> instant wow -> interactive Q&A
2. SOUL SIGNATURE -> Cross-platform personality portrait from real data
3. TWIN CHAT     -> AI twin that embodies your personality and knows your life
```

## Twin Architecture (Generative Agents-Inspired)

Based on Park et al., UIST 2023 ("Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior").

### Memory Stream (`user_memories` table)
Single unified store for ALL memory types:
- **Observations** - Raw platform data (Spotify plays, calendar events, YouTube activity)
- **Conversations** - Per-utterance chat exchanges with the twin
- **Facts** - Extracted facts about the user
- **Reflections** - Higher-level synthesized insights (stored back as memories)

Each memory has: content, embedding (1536d vector), importance_score (1-10), created_at, last_accessed_at.

### Retrieval (`search_memory_stream` RPC)
Three-factor scoring with context-dependent weights and min-max normalization:
```
score = w_recency * norm(recency) + w_importance * norm(importance) + w_relevance * norm(relevance)
```
- **Recency**: `0.995^hours_since_last_access` (accessing refreshes the timestamp)
- **Importance**: LLM-rated 1-10 at creation time
- **Relevance**: Cosine similarity of embeddings

Weight presets (inspired by Paper 2):
- `default` [1.0, 1.0, 1.0] - General conversation (original Generative Agents)
- `identity` [0.2, 0.8, 1.0] - Twin summary, personality queries (relevance dominant)
- `recent` [1.0, 0.5, 0.7] - Proactive insights, "what's happening" queries
- `reflection` [0.0, 0.5, 1.0] - Expert reflections (Paper 2 style: no recency bias)

### Expert Reflection Engine (`reflectionEngine.js`)
Inspired by Paper 2 (Park et al., 2024 "Generative Agent Simulations of 1,000 People").
Triggered when accumulated importance > 40 (IMPORTANCE_THRESHOLD in reflectionEngine.js). Uses 5 domain-specific expert personas:

1. **Personality Psychologist** - Emotional patterns, coping, attachment style, Big Five from behavior
2. **Lifestyle Analyst** - Daily rhythms, energy, health-behavior connections, routine vs spontaneity
3. **Cultural Identity Expert** - Aesthetic preferences, media taste, cultural markers
4. **Social Dynamics Analyst** - Communication style, relationship patterns, social energy
5. **Motivation Analyst** - Work patterns, ambitions, decision-making style

Process: Gather 100 recent memories -> Run all 5 experts in parallel (each retrieves domain-specific evidence via vector search with `reflection` weights) -> Each expert generates 2-3 observations -> Store as `reflection` memories (importance 7-9) with expert metadata -> Recursive up to depth 3

### Background Observation Ingestion
Periodic cron job pulls platform data and stores as observations:
```
Platform APIs -> Natural language observations -> Memory Stream
                                                    |
                                              [Importance accumulates]
                                                    |
                                              Reflection Engine triggers
                                                    |
                                              Proactive Insights generated
```

### Dynamic Twin Summary (`twinSummaryService.js`)
Periodically regenerated summary replacing static soul signature:
- Five parallel retrieval queries aligned to expert domains: personality, lifestyle, cultural identity, social dynamics, motivation
- Uses `identity` retrieval weights (relevance dominant, low recency bias)
- Cached in `twin_summaries` table with 4-hour TTL
- Upserts on `user_id` conflict - one summary per user
- Regenerated after significant memory accumulation

### Proactive Insights (`proactiveInsights.js`)
TwinMe's equivalent of the paper's Planning system - the twin notices things and brings them up:
- Triggered after observation ingestion
- LLM analyzes recent memories + reflections to generate 1-3 insights
- Stored in `proactive_insights` table with urgency (high/medium/low) and category
- Injected into twin chat as "THINGS I NOTICED" context section
- Marked `delivered` after being included in a twin response
- High urgency sorted first for delivery priority

### Twin-Driven Goal Tracking (`goalTrackingService.js`)
The twin observes platform data patterns and SUGGESTS achievable goals. Once accepted, progress is auto-tracked from platform data and the twin weaves accountability into conversations naturally.

**Tables**: `twin_goals`, `goal_progress_log` (migration: `20260220_create_twin_goals.sql`)
**API**: `api/routes/goals.js` (7 endpoints under `/api/goals`)
**Frontend**: `src/pages/GoalsPage.tsx` + components in `src/pages/components/goals/`

Flow: Observation ingestion -> `generateGoalSuggestions()` -> user accepts -> `trackGoalProgress()` auto-tracks -> twin references in chat -> celebration on completion

**Metric extraction**: Primary from structured platform data, fallback to regex on memory stream text (reflections dominate recent memories ~90%, so scan 200+ entries to find platform_data).

### Soul Signature Voting Layer (`personalityProfileService.js`)
Neural-inspired personality shaping for twin responses. Based on CL1_LLM_Encoder's biological neuron blending concept (`blended[tok] = (1-alpha) * model_probs + alpha * neural_probs`), adapted for API-level constraints (Claude via OpenRouter does NOT expose logprobs).

**Three-layer intervention:**
1. **Prompt Injection** (0x cost) - OCEAN Big Five personality traits + stylometric fingerprint translated into behavioral instructions injected into system prompt via `personalityPromptBuilder.js`
2. **Sampling Parameters** (0x cost) - OCEAN dimensions mapped to temperature (0.5-0.9), top_p (0.85-0.95), frequency_penalty (0-0.3), presence_penalty (0-0.3)
3. **Best-of-N Reranking** (3x cost, feature-flagged via `ENABLE_PERSONALITY_RERANKER`) - Generate N candidates with temperature spread, embed all, select by cosine similarity to personality embedding centroid

**Personality Profile** (`user_personality_profiles` table):
- OCEAN Big Five scores (0-1) extracted via LLM analysis (TIER_ANALYSIS) of reflections + conversations + facts
- Stylometric fingerprint: sentence length, vocabulary richness (type-token ratio), formality, emotional expressiveness, humor markers, punctuation distribution — all pure computation, no LLM
- Derived sampling parameters from OCEAN mapping
- Personality embedding centroid: weighted average of memory embeddings with 7-day recency half-life and importance weighting
- Profile TTL: 12 hours, auto-rebuild when stale. Min 20 memories required.

**OCEAN-to-Sampling Mapping:**
- High Openness → higher temperature (more creative), wider top_p
- High Conscientiousness → lower temperature (more precise), narrower top_p
- High Extraversion → higher presence_penalty (explores topics), higher frequency_penalty (varied vocabulary)
- High Agreeableness → lower frequency_penalty (comfortable with repetition for emphasis)
- High Neuroticism → slight temperature increase (more emotional variation)

**Drift Detection** (`personalityDriftService.js`):
- Compares recent (7-day) vs baseline (90-day) personality embedding centroids
- Triggers automatic profile rebuild when cosine similarity < 0.85
- Hooked into observation ingestion pipeline (no extra cron job needed)

**Implementation Plan:** `.claude/plans/2026-03-08-soul-signature-voting-layer.md` (10 tasks, 5 phases)

### Synaptic Maturation (CL1-Inspired Neural Memory)
Completes the biological neuron analogy: memories don't just store — they strengthen, decay, and replay like real synapses.

**Three features:**

1. **STDP Exponential Decay** (`cron-memory-forgetting.js` Tier 4) — "Don't fire, connections expire"
   - Co-citation links decay with `new_strength = old * 0.92^max(0, days - 30)`
   - 30-day grace period (recently reinforced links are safe)
   - Links pruned when strength drops below 0.1
   - Runs weekly in the existing memory-forgetting cron
   - `last_reinforced_at` column tracks when links were last co-cited together

2. **Graph-Based Retrieval Traversal** (`memoryLinksService.js` → `memoryStreamService.js`)
   - 1-hop traversal of `memory_links` augments vector search with associatively connected memories
   - Feature-flagged via `graphRetrieval` in `feature_flags` table (default off)
   - Exactly 2 DB queries: batch fetch links from top-5 seed memories, then batch fetch memory rows
   - Injected after MMR reranking, score capped at 80% of top vector result
   - Strength-weighted: stronger links → higher injection scores

3. **Memory Saliency Replay** (`saliencyReplayService.js`) — Neural sleep consolidation
   - Daily cron at 4am UTC replays stale-but-important memories (importance >= 7, not accessed in 14+ days)
   - Refreshes `last_accessed_at = NOW()` to restore recency scores in retrieval
   - Triggers reflection engine for fresh cross-temporal insights connecting old + new memories
   - Cost controls: max 3 users/run, 20 memories/user, respects reflection cooldown
   - Eligible types: `fact`, `platform_data`, `observation` (not reflections — they're already high-level)

**STDP + Graph Retrieval feedback loop:**
```
Memory co-cited in reflection → strengthenCoCitedLinks() → strength ↑ + last_reinforced_at = NOW
                                                              ↓
                                          Graph retrieval picks up strong links
                                                              ↓
                                          Connected memories surface in twin chat
                                                              ↓
                                          More co-citations → strength ↑↑ (Hebbian learning)

No co-citations for 30+ days → STDP decay kicks in → strength ↓↓ → pruned at 0.1
```

### Neurotransmitter Modes (`neurotransmitterService.js`)
Context-dependent dynamic modulation of sampling parameters. Inspired by how neurotransmitters globally shift brain processing. All functions are PURE (no DB, no LLM, microseconds).

**Three modes** (additive deltas on top of OCEAN-derived personality params):
- **Serotonergic** (emotional/supportive): temp +0.05, freq_pen -0.08, pres_pen +0.05 — warmer, allows comforting repetition
- **Dopaminergic** (analytical/goal-focused): temp -0.08, top_p -0.03, freq_pen +0.08, pres_pen -0.05 — precise, varied vocabulary
- **Noradrenergic** (creative/exploratory): temp +0.10, top_p +0.05, freq_pen +0.03, pres_pen +0.03 — widest sampling

**Detection**: Keyword-based classification, requires >= 2 keyword matches to activate. Returns `{ mode, confidence, matchedKeywords }`.
**Feature flag**: `neurotransmitter_modes` (default: enabled)

### Connectome Neuropils (`neuropilRouter.js`)
Domain-specific memory retrieval routing. Maps 5 brain regions to the 5 reflection expert domains with custom retrieval weights and type budgets.

**Five neuropils**:
- `personality`: identity-like weights [0.3, 0.8, 1.0], more reflections+conversations
- `lifestyle`: recent-biased [1.0, 0.5, 0.8], more platform_data (10)
- `cultural`: balanced [0.5, 0.7, 1.0], standard mix
- `social`: balanced-recent [0.7, 0.6, 1.0], more conversations (8)
- `motivation`: recent+importance [0.8, 0.7, 1.0], more facts (8)

**Routing**: `classifyNeuropil(message)` → `{ neuropilId, weights, budgets, confidence }`. Budgets passed to `retrieveDiverseMemories()`.
**Feature flag**: `connectome_neuropils` (default: enabled)

### Embodied Feedback Loop (Nudges)
Closes the sensorimotor loop: twin suggests micro-action → user acts → twin observes result → learns what works.

**Pipeline**: `generateProactiveInsights()` → 'nudge' category with `nudge_action` → delivered in chat → `evaluateNudgeOutcomes()` (12-48h later, keyword overlap with platform_data) → outcome stored → injected as "PAST NUDGES" context in future chats.

**Functions** (in `proactiveInsights.js`):
- `evaluateNudgeOutcomes(userId)` — keyword overlap scan of platform_data vs nudge_action, ≥40% match = followed
- `getNudgeHistory(userId, limit)` — recent evaluated nudges for chat context
- `getNudgeEffectivenessScore(userId)` — followed/total ratio (last 30d)

**Feature flag**: `embodied_feedback_loop` (default: enabled)
**Migration**: `20260309_add_nudge_feedback_columns` — adds nudge_action, nudge_followed, nudge_outcome, nudge_checked_at to proactive_insights

## Philosophy
- **From Resume to Soul**: Moving beyond professional achievements to authentic personality
- **Instant Wow**: Users should be surprised by what we know in the first 60 seconds
- **Privacy as Feature**: The privacy spectrum dashboard IS the trust builder
- **Quality over Quantity**: 5 great integrations > 56 half-built ones
- **The Twin Must Have Soul**: Not ChatGPT with facts - it must EMBODY the user's personality
- **Memory Is Everything**: The twin's quality is directly proportional to how well its memory stream works

## Critical Gotchas

### User IDs: public.users NOT auth.users
The app uses `public.users.id` everywhere (user_memories, twin_goals, etc.), NOT `auth.users.id`. These are DIFFERENT UUIDs. All FK constraints reference `public.users(id)`. The test user is `167c27b5-a40b-49fb-8d00-deb1b1c57f4d` (stefanogebara@gmail.com).

### JWT Token Format
Auth middleware reads `payload.id || payload.userId`. The verify endpoint uses `decoded.id`. ALWAYS use `id` field when generating test tokens.

### Frontend API Base URL
`VITE_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3004/api` already includes `/api`. Frontend API clients use paths like `/goals` not `/api/goals` to avoid double prefix.

### Memory Stream Composition
Recent memories are dominated by reflections (~90 of last 100). Platform data observations are sparse (~4 in 200). When scanning for platform data, fetch 200+ memories and filter by `memory_type === 'platform_data'`.

### Windows Process Management on Git Bash
`taskkill /PID 12345 /F` fails in Git Bash due to path expansion (`/PID` -> `C:/Program Files/Git/PID`). Use `cmd.exe //c "taskkill /PID 12345 /F"` instead.

## NODE PROCESS MANAGEMENT
**NEVER kill ALL node processes (crashes the CLI):**
- `taskkill /F /IM node.exe` - NEVER
- `pkill node` - NEVER

**OK to kill specific processes by PID:**
- `cmd.exe //c "taskkill /PID 12345 /F"` - OK when you know the specific PID

## Custom Slash Commands
- `/verify-app` - TypeScript check + Vite build + server health
- `/test-api <endpoint>` - Test API endpoints with auth
- `/test-twin <message>` - Test twin chat context pipeline
- `/code-review` - Full code review of current branch
- `/design-review` - Design review with browser testing

The page bg uses FOUR overlapping radial gradients with positions/sizes driven by `SunContext` (time-of-day animation). Default values in `:root`:

```css
body {
  background-color: var(--background);  /* #13121a */
  background-image:
    radial-gradient(ellipse var(--bg-size-1) at var(--bg-pos-1), var(--body-gradient-1) 0%, transparent var(--bg-spread-1)),
    radial-gradient(ellipse var(--bg-size-2) at var(--bg-pos-2), var(--body-gradient-2) 0%, transparent var(--bg-spread-2)),
    radial-gradient(ellipse var(--bg-size-3) at var(--bg-pos-3), var(--body-gradient-3) 0%, transparent var(--bg-spread-3)),
    radial-gradient(ellipse var(--bg-size-4) at var(--bg-pos-4), var(--body-gradient-4) 0%, transparent var(--bg-spread-4));
  background-attachment: fixed;
}
```

**Default gradient colors (amber/copper on charcoal):**
- Orb 1: `rgba(210,145,55,0.38)` — warm amber, top-left
- Orb 2: `rgba(180,110,65,0.30)` — copper, top-right
- Orb 3: `rgba(160,95,55,0.34)` — deep amber, bottom-center
- Orb 4: `rgba(55,45,140,0.28)` — purple accent, center-right

### Glass Surface (REQUIRED for all cards/panels)
```css
background: var(--glass-surface-bg);           /* rgba(255,255,255,0.06) */
backdrop-filter: blur(42px);
-webkit-backdrop-filter: blur(42px);
border: 1px solid var(--glass-surface-border); /* rgba(255,255,255,0.10) */
border-radius: 20px;
box-shadow: 0 4px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.12), inset 0 1px 0 rgba(255,255,255,0.06);
```

### 12 Rules for AI Code Generation

1. Every card/panel → glass surface (`backdrop-blur(42px)`, `rgba(255,255,255,0.06)` bg, `rgba(255,255,255,0.10)` border)
2. Never flat white or solid colors on app surfaces — always dark glass with white-alpha values
3. Page wrapper → `--background` (#13121a) + 4-orb sun-driven ambient gradient (see SunContext)
4. Primary CTA → `rounded-[100px]` pill, light-on-dark (`#F5F5F4` bg, `#110f0f` text)
5. Suggestion chips → `rounded-[46px]`, NOT `rounded-full`
6. Floating navbar → `rounded-[32px]` pill with `blur(19.65px)`, NOT full-width bar
7. Font → Geist/Inter for ALL UI; Instrument Serif for hero/display/auth titles and narrative voice only
8. Headings → always negative letter-spacing (`tracking-tight` or explicit negative value)
9. Active sidebar nav → full pill fill (`accent-vibrant-glow`), icon in `accent-vibrant`, NEVER underline or left border
10. Gradients → amber/copper orbs on #13121a charcoal, purple accent orb — never neon, never flat
11. Input fields → `rgba(255,255,255,0.08)` bg (NOT glass-surface-bg) — subtler fill
12. ThemeContext is hard-locked to dark. No `.dark` class toggling — all tokens are dark-only in `:root`
