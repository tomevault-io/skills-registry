# Conference Scheduler Skill (SolverForge)

Generate optimized conference schedules using [SolverForge](https://github.com/solverforge) (Timefold compatible). Supports single-day and multi-day conferences.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies (requires Python 3.10-3.12)
pip install solverforge_legacy --break-system-packages

# Run scheduler
python assets/scheduler.py schedule.csv talks.csv output.csv --time-limit 30
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.10, 3.11, or 3.12 (3.13+ not yet supported)
- JDK 17+ (for solver runtime)
- [solverforge_legacy](https://github.com/solverforge/solverforge-legacy) package

## Input Formats

### Single-Day Schedule CSV

```csv
"from hour";"to hour";"session type";"room name"
"10:35";"11:20";Conference;Room 2
"10:35";"11:20";Conference;Room 8
"11:30";"12:15";Conference;Room 3
```

### Multi-Day Schedule CSV

Add a "day" column as the first column:

```csv
"day";"from hour";"to hour";"session type";"room name"
"Wednesday";"09:30";"10:15";Conference;Room 1
"Wednesday";"10:35";"11:20";Conference;Room 2
"Thursday";"09:30";"10:15";Conference;Room 1
```

Day values can be: day names (Monday, Tuesday), dates (2024-03-15), or labels (Day 1, Day 2).

### Talks CSV

```csv
"Talk ID";"Talk Title";"Audience Level";"Talk Summary";"Track Name";"Speaker Availability days";"Available from";"Available to";"Speaker names"
1411;Unit Test Your Architecture;BEGINNER;ArchUnit is...;Development Practices;Wednesday,Thursday;;;Roland Weisleder
3872;Full-stack development;INTERMEDIATE;Java developers...;UI & UX;;;;Simon Martinelli
```

**Speaker Availability** formats (column 6):
- Day names: `Wednesday,Thursday`
- Day numbers: `1,2,3`
- Empty = available all days

## Constraints

### Hard Constraints (Must satisfy)

| Constraint | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Speaker conflict | Same speaker can't be in two rooms at same time |
| Room conflict | Two talks can't be in same room at same time |
| Track conflict | Same track can't have talks in different rooms simultaneously |
| Speaker availability | Speaker must be available on scheduled day |

### Soft Constraints (Optimization)

| Constraint | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Educational flow (level) | Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced within track per day |
| Educational flow (order) | Respect AI-computed optimal talk sequence |
| Track room consistency | Keep same track in same room on same day |

## Output

### CSV Output

Single-day:
```csv
"Talk ID";"From";"To";"Room";"Title";"Speakers";"Level";"Track"
```

Multi-day:
```csv
"Day";"Talk ID";"From";"To";"Room";"Title";"Speakers";"Level";"Track"
```

### Markdown Output

Generated alongside CSV with `.md` extension, includes tables grouped by timeslot (and day for multi-day).

## Time Limits

- Small conferences (< 30 talks): 10-30 seconds
- Medium conferences (30-100 talks): 30-120 seconds
- Large conferences (100+ talks): 2-10 minutes

## Troubleshooting

### Hard score < 0

The schedule has constraint violations. Check for:
- More talks than available slots
- Speaker assigned to multiple talks in same slot
- Speaker not available on scheduled day
- Too many talks in same track for available parallel slots

Increase time limit or review input data.

### Talks not scheduled

Verify CSV parsing - check semicolon separators and quote handling.

### Speaker availability not working

Ensure the "Speaker Availability days" column values match the day names in your schedule CSV (e.g., if schedule uses "Wednesday", availability should use "Wednesday" not "Wed").

### JVM/Java errors

Ensure JDK 17+ is installed and JAVA_HOME is set correctly.
