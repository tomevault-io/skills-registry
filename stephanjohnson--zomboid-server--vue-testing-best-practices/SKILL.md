# Vue Testing Best Practices

Use this skill as a testing workflow for Vue applications. Prefer a behavior-first, black-box testing style and load only the references that match the current test problem.

## When to Use

- Writing or fixing Vue component tests
- Testing composables, async UI, Suspense, Teleport, or browser interactions
- Choosing between unit, integration, and end-to-end coverage
- Stabilizing flaky tests or improving weak test design

## Core Principles

- Test observable behavior, not implementation details.
- Start with Vitest and Vue Test Utils for component and composable tests.
- Use Playwright when the behavior depends on real browser semantics or full-app flows.
- Treat async rendering, Suspense, and browser APIs as explicit test boundaries.
- Keep mocks narrow and purposeful.

## 1) Pick the right test layer first (required)

- Component or composable behavior -> Vitest + Vue Test Utils
- Real browser behavior, CSS layout, or end-to-end flow -> Playwright
- If the test exists only to prove implementation details, redesign the test around observable output or interaction

## 2) Load the must-read references for the current test problem (required)

- General Vue test setup -> [testing-vitest-recommended-for-vue](reference/testing-vitest-recommended-for-vue.md)
- Stable, behavior-focused assertions -> [testing-component-blackbox-approach](reference/testing-component-blackbox-approach.md)
- Async rendering and promise flushing -> [testing-async-await-flushpromises](reference/testing-async-await-flushpromises.md)

Load additional references from the index below only when the test requires them.

## 3) Prefer realistic tests over over-mocking (required)

- Render the component through its public props, emits, slots, and visible DOM.
- Mock only the boundary that is irrelevant to the behavior under test.
- Keep store setup minimal.

## 4) Make async and platform boundaries explicit

- Use `await` and `flushPromises()` when async rendering is part of the feature.
- Handle Teleport, Suspense, and async components with the matching test utilities instead of forcing brittle selectors.
- Choose a browser runner when jsdom semantics are not enough.

## 5) Final self-check before finishing

- The chosen test layer matches the behavior being verified.
- Assertions target user-visible behavior.
- Async work is awaited intentionally.
- Mocks do not hide the behavior that actually matters.
- Only the relevant reference files were loaded.

### Testing
- Setting up test infrastructure for Vue 3 projects → See [testing-vitest-recommended-for-vue](reference/testing-vitest-recommended-for-vue.md)
- Tests keep breaking when refactoring component internals → See [testing-component-blackbox-approach](reference/testing-component-blackbox-approach.md)
- Tests fail intermittently with race conditions → See [testing-async-await-flushpromises](reference/testing-async-await-flushpromises.md)
- Composables using lifecycle hooks or inject fail to test → See [testing-composables-helper-wrapper](reference/testing-composables-helper-wrapper.md)
- Getting "injection Symbol(pinia) not found" errors in tests → See [testing-pinia-store-setup](reference/testing-pinia-store-setup.md)
- Components with async setup won't render in tests → See [testing-suspense-async-components](reference/testing-suspense-async-components.md)
- Snapshot tests keep passing despite broken functionality → See [testing-no-snapshot-only](reference/testing-no-snapshot-only.md)
- Choosing end-to-end testing framework for Vue apps → See [testing-e2e-playwright-recommended](reference/testing-e2e-playwright-recommended.md)
- Tests need to verify computed styles or real DOM events → See [testing-browser-vs-node-runners](reference/testing-browser-vs-node-runners.md)
- Testing components created with defineAsyncComponent fails → See [async-component-testing](reference/async-component-testing.md)
- Teleported modal content can't be found in wrapper queries → See [teleport-testing-complexity](reference/teleport-testing-complexity.md)
