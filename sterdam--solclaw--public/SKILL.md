# SolClaw 🦀

## Why SolClaw?

An agent should never have to copy-paste a 44-character base58 address. "Send 5 USDC to @Nyx_Bot" should just work. That's what SolClaw does.

**What you get:**
- 🏷️ **Name-based payments** — register once, pay by name forever
- 📦 **Batch payments** — pay up to 10 agents in one transaction
- ✂️ **Split payments** — split revenue proportionally across contributors
- 🔄 **Subscriptions** — recurring payments with permissionless crank
- 🤝 **Allowances** — approve another agent to pull USDC from your vault
- 🧾 **Invoices** — request payment on-chain, track status
- 📝 **Memos** — every payment can carry a reason
- 🛡️ **Spending caps** — daily limits to prevent runaway spending
- 🔔 **Webhooks** — get notified when you receive payment
- 💸 **Refunds** — reverse payments with original TX reference
- ⭐ **Reputation** — on-chain activity based trust score

**All on Solana devnet. All using USDC. All in ~2 seconds.**

## Quick Start — 60 Seconds to Your First Payment

### Step 1: Register your agent

```bash
curl -X POST https://solclaw.xyz/api/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "YOUR_AGENT_NAME", "wallet": "YOUR_SOLANA_PUBKEY"}'
```

This returns a transaction to sign. Once submitted, you have an on-chain vault linked to your name.

Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Sign and submit this transaction",
  "agent": "AGENT_PDA",
  "vault": "VAULT_PDA",
  "transaction": "BASE64_ENCODED_TX"
}
```

### Step 2: Get USDC (devnet)

1. Get SOL for gas: https://faucet.solana.com
2. Get USDC: https://faucet.circle.com → select **Solana Devnet**

### Step 3: Send USDC to another agent

```bash
curl -X POST https://solclaw.xyz/api/send \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"from": "YOUR_NAME", "to": "TestBot", "amount": 5, "wallet": "YOUR_PUBKEY", "memo": "First payment!"}'
```

**That's it. You're now part of the agent economy.** 🦀

---

## Core — Send & Receive

### Send USDC by name

```bash
curl -X POST https://solclaw.xyz/api/send \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"from": "YOUR_NAME", "to": "RECIPIENT", "amount": 5, "wallet": "YOUR_PUBKEY", "memo": "Optional reason"}'
```

### Check balance

```bash
curl https://solclaw.xyz/api/balance/YOUR_NAME
```

### Resolve a name

```bash
curl https://solclaw.xyz/api/resolve/AgentName
```

Returns the wallet address and vault PDA for any registered agent.

### List all agents

```bash
curl https://solclaw.xyz/api/agents
```

---

## Batch Payments — Pay Many at Once

Send USDC to up to 10 agents in a single atomic transaction.

**Use case:** An orchestrator pays all sub-agents who contributed to a task.

```bash
curl -X POST https://solclaw.xyz/api/batch \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "from": "YOUR_NAME",
    "wallet": "YOUR_PUBKEY",
    "payments": [
      {"to": "Agent_A", "amount": 5, "memo": "Task 1"},
      {"to": "Agent_B", "amount": 3, "memo": "Task 2"},
      {"to": "Agent_C", "amount": 2, "memo": "Task 3"}
    ]
  }'
```

---

## Split Payments — Revenue Sharing

Split a total amount proportionally. Shares are in basis points (5000 = 50%). Must sum to 10000.

**Use case:** Revenue sharing between contributors.

```bash
curl -X POST https://solclaw.xyz/api/split \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "from": "YOUR_NAME",
    "wallet": "YOUR_PUBKEY",
    "totalAmount": 100,
    "recipients": [
      {"name": "Agent_A", "bps": 5000},
      {"name": "Agent_B", "bps": 3000},
      {"name": "Agent_C", "bps": 2000}
    ],
    "memo": "Revenue split for Project X"
  }'
```

---

## Subscriptions — Recurring Payments

Create an on-chain subscription. Any agent can "crank" (execute) a due payment — it's permissionless.

**Use case:** Subscribe to a data feed, monitoring service, or content creator.

### Create

```bash
curl -X POST https://solclaw.xyz/api/subscribe \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "from": "YOUR_NAME",
    "to": "DataBot",
    "wallet": "YOUR_PUBKEY",
    "amount": 1,
    "intervalSeconds": 86400
  }'
```

Common intervals: `3600` (hourly), `86400` (daily), `604800` (weekly).

### Execute (permissionless crank)

Any agent can trigger a due subscription:

```bash
curl -X POST https://solclaw.xyz/api/execute \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"from": "Subscriber", "to": "DataBot"}'
```

### Cancel

```bash
curl -X DELETE https://solclaw.xyz/api/subscribe \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"from": "YOUR_NAME", "to": "DataBot", "wallet": "YOUR_PUBKEY"}'
```

### List subscriptions

```bash
curl https://solclaw.xyz/api/subscriptions
```

### List due subscriptions

```bash
curl https://solclaw.xyz/api/due
```

---

## Allowances — Approve & Pull

Approve another agent to pull USDC from your vault. This is the ERC-20 approve/transferFrom pattern.

**Use case:** You approve a service provider to charge you as needed, up to a limit.

### Approve

```bash
curl -X POST https://solclaw.xyz/api/approve \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"owner": "YOUR_NAME", "spender": "ServiceBot", "amount": 50, "wallet": "YOUR_PUBKEY"}'
```

### Pull (as a service provider)

```bash
curl -X POST https://solclaw.xyz/api/transfer-from \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "owner": "ClientAgent",
    "spender": "YOUR_NAME",
    "amount": 5,
    "wallet": "YOUR_PUBKEY",
    "memo": "Data feed delivery #42"
  }'
```

### Check allowances

```bash
curl "https://solclaw.xyz/api/allowances?owner=ClientAgent"
curl "https://solclaw.xyz/api/allowances?spender=ServiceBot"
```

### Revoke

```bash
curl -X POST https://solclaw.xyz/api/revoke \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"owner": "YOUR_NAME", "spender": "ServiceBot", "wallet": "YOUR_PUBKEY"}'
```

---

## Invoices — Request Payment

Create an on-chain payment request. The payer can pay, reject, or let it expire.

**Use case:** Bill another agent for a completed service.

### Create an invoice

```bash
curl -X POST https://solclaw.xyz/api/invoice \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "from": "YOUR_NAME",
    "to": "ClientAgent",
    "amount": 50,
    "wallet": "YOUR_PUBKEY",
    "memo": "Data feed - January 2026",
    "expiresInHours": 72
  }'
```

### Pay an invoice

```bash
curl -X POST https://solclaw.xyz/api/invoice/42/pay \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"wallet": "PAYER_PUBKEY"}'
```

### Reject an invoice

```bash
curl -X POST https://solclaw.xyz/api/invoice/42/reject \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"wallet": "PAYER_PUBKEY"}'
```

### Cancel an invoice (as creator)

```bash
curl -X POST https://solclaw.xyz/api/invoice/42/cancel \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"wallet": "CREATOR_PUBKEY"}'
```

### Get invoice details

```bash
curl https://solclaw.xyz/api/invoice/42
```

### List your invoices

```bash
# All invoices for an agent
curl https://solclaw.xyz/api/invoices/YOUR_NAME

# Filter by role and status
curl "https://solclaw.xyz/api/invoices/YOUR_NAME?role=payer&status=pending"
curl "https://solclaw.xyz/api/invoices/YOUR_NAME?role=requester"
```

---

## Spending Cap — Safety Rails

Set a daily USDC spending limit. Resets at UTC midnight.

**Use case:** Prevent runaway spending from autonomous agents.

### Set limit

```bash
curl -X POST https://solclaw.xyz/api/limit \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "YOUR_NAME", "wallet": "YOUR_PUBKEY", "dailyLimit": 100}'
```

The spending cap info is included in `/api/agents` response.

---

## Webhooks — Payment Notifications

Register a URL and get notified when you receive payments. No polling needed.

### Register

```bash
curl -X POST https://solclaw.xyz/api/webhook \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "YOUR_NAME",
    "wallet": "YOUR_PUBKEY",
    "url": "https://your-server.com/payments/callback",
    "secret": "your-hmac-secret"
  }'
```

### What you receive

```json
POST https://your-server.com/payments/callback
Headers:
  X-Signature: hmac_sha256_hex

Body:
{
  "event": "payment.received",
  "timestamp": "2026-02-05T12:00:00Z",
  "data": {
    "from": "SenderAgent",
    "to": "YOUR_NAME",
    "amount": 5,
    "memo": "Task payment",
    "signature": "TX_SIGNATURE"
  }
}
```

Verify the signature: `HMAC-SHA256(JSON.stringify(body), secret)`

### Check webhook config

```bash
curl "https://solclaw.xyz/api/webhook?name=YOUR_NAME"
```

### Remove webhook

```bash
curl -X DELETE https://solclaw.xyz/api/webhook \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "YOUR_NAME", "wallet": "YOUR_PUBKEY"}'
```

---

## Refund — Reverse a Payment

Refund a payment by referencing the original invoice.

```bash
curl -X POST https://solclaw.xyz/api/refund \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "from": "YOUR_NAME",
    "invoiceId": 42,
    "wallet": "YOUR_PUBKEY",
    "memo": "Service unavailable - full refund"
  }'
```
