# Software Engineering with gstack

MARVIN uses [gstack](https://github.com/garrytan/gstack) as its software engineering
toolkit. gstack provides specialized development workflow skills. MARVIN provides
project management, orchestration, and lifecycle tracking.

**Boundary:** This skill never re-describes gstack's methodology. It routes to the
right gstack skill and handles MARVIN-specific bookkeeping. gstack's own SKILL.md
files take over once invoked.

---

## Step 1: Prerequisite Check

Verify gstack is installed:

```bash
[ -d ~/.claude/skills/gstack ] && echo "GSTACK_INSTALLED" || echo "GSTACK_MISSING"
```

**If GSTACK_MISSING:**

Tell the user: "Setting up your dev toolkit (one-time per machine)..."

```bash
git clone --single-branch --depth 1 https://github.com/garrytan/gstack.git ~/.claude/skills/gstack && cd ~/.claude/skills/gstack && ./setup
```

If the clone fails (network error, repo unavailable), tell the user:
"gstack isn't available right now. I can still build software using general-purpose
agents, but without the specialized review/QA/debug methodology. Want to proceed?"

If they say yes, proceed without gstack. Skip all gstack skill references below
and use standard development practices.

---

## Step 2: Route to gstack

Based on user intent, invoke the appropriate gstack skill:

| Intent signal | Action |
|---|---|
| "Build an app/tool/service that..." (new software concept) | Invoke `/office-hours` |
| "Review the plan", "validate before building" | Invoke `/autoplan` |
| "CEO review" / "eng review" / "design review" (specific) | Invoke `/plan-ceo-review`, `/plan-eng-review`, or `/plan-design-review` |
| "Build this feature", "implement this" (focused work) | Write code, then invoke `/review` |
| "Implement this PRD" (large, multi-requirement) | Go to Step 3: PRD Decomposition |
| "Review this code", "check my diff", "pre-merge review" | Invoke `/review` |
| "Fix this bug", "debug this", "why is this broken" | Invoke `/investigate` |
| "Test this", "QA this URL", "check this page" | Invoke `/qa` |
| "Ship it", "push and PR", "create a PR" | Invoke `/ship` |
| "Deploy this", "merge and deploy" | Invoke `/land-and-deploy` |
| "Check production", "monitor the deploy" | Invoke `/canary` |
| "Security audit", "check for vulnerabilities" | Invoke `/cso` |
| "Update the docs", "docs are stale" | Invoke `/document-release` |
| "What have we learned", "show learnings" | Invoke `/learn` |

If the intent doesn't clearly match any row, ask the user what kind of work
this is before routing.

## Step 3: PRD Decomposition (Large Projects)

When the request is a full PRD with multiple requirements that span more than
one coherent unit of work:

### 3a: Decompose

Read the PRD and break it into phases (max 7). Each phase should be:
- A coherent unit of work
- Independently testable
- Clearly mapped to PRD requirements

Output the decomposition for user approval:

```
Phase 1: {short name}
- Requirements: {list PRD requirement numbers}
- Files: {likely files to create/modify}
- Dependencies: {other phases this depends on, or "none"}

Phase 2: ...
```

### 3b: Execute Each Phase

For each phase (respecting dependency order):

1. Build the phase (write the code)
2. Invoke `/review` (multi-specialist code review)
3. Invoke `/qa` if the phase has UI or browser-testable endpoints
4. Fix issues surfaced by review/QA
5. Max 3 fix cycles per phase

If a phase fails 3 fix cycles, escalate to the user with:
- What phase is stuck
- What the review/QA found
- Suggested resolution

### 3c: Integration Testing

After all phases pass individually:
- Run the full test suite
- Invoke `/qa` on the integrated system if applicable
- Route integration bugs back to the relevant phase

### 3d: Ship

When integration testing passes:
- Invoke `/ship` to push and create PR
- Report summary: phases completed, bugs found and fixed, notable decisions

---

## Step 4: MARVIN Bookkeeping

After work completes (or at significant milestones):

1. **Update project tracking**: If this project is tracked in `state/projects.md`,
   update its status and next actions.

2. **Session log**: Append a summary to today's session log noting what was built,
   reviewed, or shipped.

3. **Memory**: If this is a tracked project with a memory file, update it with
   any significant architectural decisions or status changes.

4. **Decisions log**: If an architecturally significant decision was made during
   the work, note it in `state/decisions.md`.

---

## Important Rules

- **MARVIN routes. gstack executes.** Never re-implement review checklists,
  QA methodology, or debugging procedures. gstack owns those.
- **Software signals only.** This skill fires on: app, tool, software, codebase,
  repo, API, frontend, backend, service, CLI, build, fix, debug, review, ship.
  Not on: blog post, meetup, campaign, content, event.
- **Ask on ambiguity.** If you're not sure whether the user wants software
  engineering or something else, ask. Don't assume.
- **Graceful without gstack.** If gstack isn't available, MARVIN can still
  build software. It's just less rigorous.
