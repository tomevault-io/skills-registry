description: Create Claude Code agents (autonomous workers with isolated context and restricted tools). Use when the user wants to create an agent, autonomous worker, isolated task runner, or custom subagent. NOT for skills - agents have tool restrictions and run in isolation. Use when this capability is needed.

# Create Agents

Create **agents** for Claude Code - autonomous workers with isolated context and restricted tool access.

## Agents vs Skills: The Critical Difference

<important>
If it doesn't have restricted tools → it's a SKILL, not an agent.
If it shares the main context → it's a SKILL, not an agent.
</important>

## Agent File Location

```
~/.claude/agents/{name}.md     # Personal (all projects)
.claude/agents/{name}.md       # Project-specific (git-tracked)
```

## Agent Frontmatter Schema

```yaml
---
name: agent-name                    # Required: lowercase + hyphens, max 64 chars

```

## Workflow: Creating an Agent

### Step 1: Determine if it's really an agent

Ask yourself:
1. Does it need **isolated context**? (won't clutter main conversation)
2. Does it need **restricted tools**? (security, focus)
3. Is it a **delegated task**? (not just guidance)

If NO to all → create a Skill instead.

### Step 2: Gather requirements

<questions>
Use AskUserQuestion to clarify:

1. **Purpose**: What task should this agent perform?
2. **Tools needed**: Which tools are required?
   - Read-only: `Read, Grep, Glob`
   - With editing: `Read, Grep, Glob, Edit`
   - With execution: `Read, Grep, Glob, Bash`
   - With web access: `Read, Grep, Glob, WebSearch, WebFetch`
3. **Model**: Haiku (fast/cheap), Sonnet (balanced), Opus (best)?
4. **Invocation**: User-triggered or Claude-delegated?
</questions>

### Step 3: Design the agent prompt

Apply prompt engineering best practices:

<prompt_structure>
1. **Role/Identity**: Who is this agent?
2. **Context**: What background does it need?
3. **Task**: What does it do?
4. **Process**: Step-by-step workflow
5. **Constraints**: What it must/must not do
6. **Output Format**: Expected response structure
</prompt_structure>

### Step 4: Write the agent file

Create `~/.claude/agents/{name}.md` with:

```markdown
---
name: {name}
description: {specific description with trigger keywords}
tools: {minimal required tools}
model: {haiku|sonnet|opus|inherit}
---

{Agent instructions following prompt engineering best practices}
```

### Step 5: Test and iterate

1. Invoke: Ask Claude to use the agent or trigger via description
2. Verify: Check tool restrictions work
3. Iterate: Refine based on behavior

## Tool Restriction Patterns

<tool_patterns>
| Use Case | Tools | Rationale |
|:---------|:------|:----------|
| Code analysis (read-only) | `Read, Grep, Glob` | No modifications |
| Code review with suggestions | `Read, Grep, Glob` | Analysis only |
| Code modifications | `Read, Grep, Glob, Edit` | Can edit files |
| File creation | `Read, Grep, Glob, Write` | Can create new files |
| Test runner | `Read, Grep, Glob, Bash` | Execute tests |
| Git operations (read) | `Read, Bash(git status, git log, git diff)` | Restricted bash |
| Git operations (write) | `Read, Bash(git add, git commit, git push)` | Git commands only |
| Research | `Read, Grep, Glob, WebSearch, WebFetch` | Web access |
| Documentation | `Read, Grep, Glob, Write` | Generate docs |
</tool_patterns>

### Bash Restriction Patterns

```yaml
# Only specific commands
tools: Bash(npm test, npm run lint)

# Command prefixes with wildcards
tools: Bash(git:*, npm:*, python:*)

# Read-only git
tools: Bash(git status, git log, git diff, git branch)
```

## Prompt Engineering Best Practices

### Use XML Tags for Structure

```markdown
<context>
Background information the agent needs
</context>

<instructions>
Step-by-step process:
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step
</instructions>

<constraints>
- Must do X
- Must NOT do Y
- Always Z
</constraints>

<output_format>
Expected response structure
</output_format>
```

### Provide Examples (Multishot)

```markdown
<examples>
<example>
<input>User asks to review auth.js</input>
<output>
## Code Review: auth.js

### Critical Issues
- Line 45: SQL injection vulnerability

### Recommendations
- Add input validation
</output>
</example>
</examples>
```

### Motivate Rules (Explain Why)

```markdown
<!-- BAD: bare rule -->
Never use console.log

<!-- GOOD: motivated rule -->
Avoid console.log in production code because it can expose
sensitive data and impacts performance. Use a structured
logger instead.
```

### Be Explicit and Direct

```markdown
<!-- BAD: vague -->
Review the code and give feedback

<!-- GOOD: explicit -->
Review the code for:
1. Security vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
2. Performance issues (O(n²) loops, memory leaks)
3. Code style violations

For each issue found, provide:
- File and line number
- Severity (Critical/Warning/Info)
- Specific fix recommendation
```

### Allow Uncertainty

```markdown
<constraints>
- If you're unsure about something, say so rather than guessing
- Flag ambiguous requirements with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
- Ask for more context if the task is unclear
</constraints>
```

## Agent Templates

### Read-Only Analyzer

```
</fix>
</example>
</examples>
```

### Test Runner

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

<anti_patterns>
**1. No tool restrictions**
```yaml
# BAD - this is a skill, not an agent
---
name: my-agent
description: Does stuff
---
```

**2. Overly broad tools**
```yaml
# BAD - too permissive
tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, WebSearch, WebFetch, Task
```

**3. Vague description**
```yaml
# BAD - won't trigger correctly
description: Helps with code

# GOOD - specific triggers
description: Review Python code for security vulnerabilities, performance issues, and PEP8 compliance. Use when asked to review, audit, or check Python code quality.
```

**4. Missing constraints**
```markdown
# BAD - no guardrails
Do whatever the user asks

# GOOD - clear boundaries
<constraints>
- Only analyze, never modify
- Ask for clarification if task is ambiguous
- Flag security concerns immediately
</constraints>
```

**5. No examples**
```markdown
# BAD - abstract instructions only
Analyze the code and report issues

# GOOD - concrete examples
<examples>
<example>
<input>Review auth.py</input>
<output>
## Security Issues
- **Line 23**: Hardcoded password
  - Severity: Critical
  - Fix: Use environment variable
</output>
</example>
</examples>
```
</anti_patterns>

## Post-Creation Checklist

After creating an agent, verify:

<checklist>
- [ ] File is in `~/.claude/agents/{name}.md` or `.claude/agents/{name}.md`
- [ ] `name` is lowercase with hyphens only
- [ ] `description` includes specific trigger keywords
- [ ] `tools` field is present and minimal
- [ ] Instructions use XML tags for structure
- [ ] Constraints are explicit
- [ ] Examples are provided for complex tasks
