name: workspace-init
description: Use when the user wants to start working on a task, ticket, or feature. Triggered by: ticket URLs (Jira, GitHub Issues, Linear, etc.), task descriptions, or requests like 'work on this', 'implement X', 'fix X', 'これをすすめて', 'これやって'. IMPORTANT: Before creating a new workspace, ALWAYS run /workspace-list first to check if a workspace already exists for the same ticket/task. If one exists, use /workspace-execute or /workspace-show-status instead. Creates workspace with README, clones repos, and plans TODO items via agents.

# workspace-init

## Overview

This skill initializes a working environment for development tasks. It orchestrates:
1. Workspace directory setup (via `setup-workspace.sh`)
2. Repository addition with worktrees (via `setup-repository.sh`)
3. README creation with task details
4. Task type branching (research tasks skip TODO planning)
5. TODO planning for each repository (via workspace-repo-todo-planner agent, launched in background) — *skipped for research*

**After initialization:** Use `/workspace-execute` to work through TODO items and complete the task.

**Paths:** Use relative paths from project root for all workspace file operations (see CLAUDE.md for details).

## Arguments

This skill receives `$ARGUMENTS` from the caller. Parse them to extract:
- Task type, description, repository paths, ticket ID
- `--interactive` flag (optional): enables interactive mode for TODO planning
- Example: `feature user-auth github.com/org/repo PROJ-123`
- Example: `bugfix login-error github.com/org/api github.com/org/frontend`
- Example: `--interactive feature user-auth github.com/org/repo`
- Arguments may also be natural language (e.g., "implement retry logic in github.com/org/api")

If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty or missing required information, use AskUserQuestion to gather it.

**`--interactive` flag:** When present, TODO planning runs in the foreground with user checkpoints. Planners run sequentially (not in parallel) so the user can review each one. The reviewer step is skipped since the user already approved during planning. When absent, the default autonomous behavior is used.

## Steps

### 1. Understand the Task Requirements

Before running the setup scripts, ensure you have:

- Task type (feature, bugfix, research, etc.)
- Brief description
- Target repository path(s) in org/repo format (e.g., github.com/sters/ai-workspace)
- Ticket ID (optional)

**Note:** Base branch is automatically detected from the remote default (main/master). You don't need to specify it.

**Alias syntax:** If you need to use the same repository multiple times (e.g., separate PRs for dev/prod environments), use the `:alias` suffix:
- `github.com/org/repo:dev` → Creates worktree at `github.com/org/repo___dev/`
- `github.com/org/repo:prod` → Creates worktree at `github.com/org/repo___prod/`

### 2. Run Setup Scripts

#### Step 2a: Create Workspace

Execute the workspace setup script:

```bash
./.claude/skills/workspace-init/scripts/setup-workspace.sh <task-type> <description> [ticket-id]
```

**Examples:**

```bash
# Basic usage
./.claude/skills/workspace-init/scripts/setup-workspace.sh feature user-auth

# With ticket ID
./.claude/skills/workspace-init/scripts/setup-workspace.sh bugfix login-error PROJ-123
```

The script will:
- Create a working directory with proper naming convention
- Initialize git repository with `.gitignore`
- Create `tmp/` directory (gitignored, for temporary files)
- Create `artifacts/` directory (git-tracked, for persistent outputs)
- Generate README.md from template
- Create initial commit

**Capture the workspace name from the last line of output** for use in subsequent steps.

#### Step 2b: Add Repositories

For each repository, execute the repository setup script:

```bash
./.claude/scripts/setup-repository.sh <workspace-name> <org/repo-path>
```

**Examples:**

```bash
# Basic usage
./.claude/scripts/setup-repository.sh feature-user-auth-20260206 github.com/org/repo

# Override base branch (when user explicitly specifies)
BASE_BRANCH=develop ./.claude/scripts/setup-repository.sh feature-user-auth-20260206 github.com/org/repo

# With alias (for multiple worktrees from same repo)
./.claude/scripts/setup-repository.sh feature-user-auth-20260206 github.com/org/repo:dev
```

The script will:
- Clone the repository if not already cloned (to `repositories/` directory)
- Update the repository with `git fetch --all --prune`
- Auto-detect the base branch from remote default
- Create a git worktree in the workspace with a new feature branch

**After running the script**, update the README.md Repositories section:

```markdown
## Repositories

- **repo-name**: `github.com/org/repo` (base: `main`)
```

### 3. Fill in README.md

After setup completes, update the generated `README.md` with:

- Clear objective description
- Context and background
- Requirements and acceptance criteria
- Related resources (issues, docs, etc.)

**IMPORTANT: Write only confirmed facts, never assumptions or guesses.**

- Only include information that is explicitly provided by the user or retrieved from linked resources
- If essential information is missing (objective, requirements, context), use AskUserQuestion to ask the user
- Do NOT fill in placeholder text or make up details
- Leave sections empty with `<!-- TBD -->` if information is not available and user cannot provide it
- Read linked resources (Jira tickets, PRs, documentation) using appropriate tools to get accurate details

**DO NOT explore or analyze the repository codebase at this step.** Repository analysis is done by the TODO planner agents in the next step. This step focuses only on capturing task requirements from the user and linked resources.

This README is the source of truth that the TODO planner agents will read. Accuracy is critical.

### 4. Task Type Branching

After filling in README.md, check the task type to determine the next steps:

- If `**Task Type**` is `research`, `investigation`, `documentation`, or `design-doc` → **Skip Steps 5-7** (TODO planning is not needed). Go directly to **Step 8** (Commit).
- For all other task types (feature, bugfix, etc.) → Continue with **Step 5** below.

**Why skip?** These task types use the `workspace-researcher` agent (invoked via `/workspace-execute`) which reads directly from README.md. The agent explores repositories and produces a document (research report, design doc, etc.) as its output. Creating TODO items would cause duplicate work — the planner would explore the codebase to create TODOs, then the researcher would explore the same codebase again.

**Guideline**: Use this path for tasks whose primary output is a **document** based on cross-repository exploration, not code changes.

### 5. Call workspace-repo-todo-planner for Each Repository

For each repository in the workspace, invoke the `workspace-repo-todo-planner` agent.

#### Auto mode (default — no `--interactive` flag):

```yaml
Task tool:
  subagent_type: workspace-repo-todo-planner
  run_in_background: true
  prompt: |
    Workspace: {workspace-name}
    Repository: {org/repo-path}
```

**Run multiple planners in parallel** if there are multiple repositories.

#### Interactive mode (`--interactive` flag):

```yaml
Task tool:
  subagent_type: workspace-repo-todo-planner
  run_in_background: false
  prompt: |
    Workspace: {workspace-name}
    Repository: {org/repo-path}
    Mode: interactive
```

**Run planners sequentially** (one at a time) so the user can interact with each checkpoint. The agent will pause for approach approval and draft review.

**What the agent does (defined in agent, not by prompt):**
- Reads workspace README.md to understand the task
- Analyzes repository structure and documentation
- Creates detailed TODO items in `TODO-{repo-name}.md`

### 6. Call workspace-todo-coordinator (multi-repo only)

**Skip this step if there is only one repository.** The coordinator optimizes cross-repo dependencies, which is unnecessary for single-repo workspaces.

After all TODO planners complete, invoke the `workspace-todo-coordinator` agent:

#### Auto mode (default):

```yaml
Task tool:
  subagent_type: workspace-todo-coordinator
  run_in_background: true
  prompt: |
    Workspace: {workspace-name}
```

#### Interactive mode:

```yaml
Task tool:
  subagent_type: workspace-todo-coordinator
  run_in_background: false
  prompt: |
    Workspace: {workspace-name}
```

Run in foreground so the workflow stays sequential, but do NOT pass `Mode: interactive` — the coordinator runs autonomously in both modes.

**What the agent does (defined in agent, not by prompt):**
- Read all TODO files
- Analyze dependencies between repositories
- Restructure TODOs to maximize parallel execution
- Add coordination notes to README.md

### 7. Call workspace-repo-todo-reviewer for Each Repository (auto mode only)

**Skip this entire step in interactive mode.** The user already reviewed and approved TODO items during the planner checkpoints in Step 5.

After planners complete (or after coordination for multi-repo), invoke the `workspace-repo-todo-reviewer` agent for each repository:

```yaml
Task tool:
  subagent_type: workspace-repo-todo-reviewer
  run_in_background: true
  prompt: |
    Workspace: {workspace-name}
    Repository: {repository-name}
```

**Run multiple reviewers in parallel** for all repositories.

**What the agent does (defined in agent, not by prompt):**
- Validates each TODO item for specificity, actionability, and alignment
- Marks unclear items with `[NEEDS_CLARIFICATION]` tags
- Returns a summary of issues (BLOCKING and UNCLEAR)

**After all reviewers complete:**

1. Collect results from all reviewers
2. If any BLOCKING issues exist:
   - Use AskUserQuestion to ask the user for clarification
   - Update the TODO files with the answers
   - Re-run reviewers if significant changes were made
3. If only UNCLEAR issues exist:
   - Present them to the user and ask whether to proceed or clarify
4. If no issues (STATUS: CLEAN for all repos):
   - Proceed to commit

### 8. Commit Workspace Files

After review completes (and any clarifications are resolved), or directly after Step 3 for research tasks, commit the workspace files:

```bash
# For research/investigation tasks (no TODO files):
./.claude/scripts/commit-workspace-snapshot.sh {workspace-name} "Initialize research workspace"

# For standard tasks (with TODO files):
./.claude/scripts/commit-workspace-snapshot.sh {workspace-name} "Add TODO items for all repositories"
```

### 9. Display Workspace Files

After committing, display the relative paths of all workspace files for the user:

```
Workspace files created:
- workspace/{workspace-name}/README.md
- workspace/{workspace-name}/TODO-{repo1-name}.md
- workspace/{workspace-name}/TODO-{repo2-name}.md
...
```

List all TODO files that were created (one per repository).

## Example Usage

### Example 1: Single Repository (Feature)

```
User: Initialize a workspace for user authentication feature in github.com/org/repo
Assistant:
  1. [Runs setup-workspace.sh] → Creates workspace/feature-user-auth-20260206
  2. [Runs setup-repository.sh] → Clones repo, creates worktree
  3. [Updates README.md with task details]
  4. [Task Type: feature → Continue to Step 5]
  5. [Calls workspace-repo-todo-planner] → Creates TODO-repo.md
  6. [Calls workspace-todo-coordinator] → Optimizes (single repo, minimal changes)
  7. [Calls workspace-repo-todo-reviewer] → Validates TODO items
  8. [Commits workspace files]
  9. [Displays workspace files]
  Done! Ready to execute with /workspace-execute.
```

### Example 2: Multiple Repositories (Feature)

```
User: Initialize a workspace for adding product IDs to cart, involving:
      - github.com/org/proto, github.com/org/api, github.com/org/frontend
Assistant:
  1. [Runs setup-workspace.sh] → Creates workspace/feature-product-ids-20260206
  2. [Runs setup-repository.sh 3 times] → Adds 3 repos
  3. [Updates README.md with task details]
  4. [Task Type: feature → Continue to Step 5]
  5. [Calls 3 workspace-repo-todo-planner agents in parallel] → Creates TODO files
  6. [Calls workspace-todo-coordinator] → Optimizes for parallel execution
  7. [Calls 3 workspace-repo-todo-reviewer agents in parallel] → Validates TODOs
  8. [Commits workspace files]
  9. [Displays workspace files]
  Done! Ready to execute with /workspace-execute.
```

### Example 3: Research Task (Skips TODO Planning)

```
User: Investigate how authentication works across github.com/org/api and github.com/org/gateway
Assistant:
  1. [Runs setup-workspace.sh] → Creates workspace/research-auth-flow-20260206
  2. [Runs setup-repository.sh 2 times] → Adds 2 repos
  3. [Updates README.md with research objectives]
  4. [Task Type: research → Skip Steps 5-7]
  8. [Commits workspace files]
  9. [Displays workspace files]
  Done! Ready to execute with /workspace-execute.
```

## After Completion

After committing and displaying workspace files, report directly to the user:
- Workspace name and task type
- Number of repositories and TODO items created

Then use `AskUserQuestion` to let the user choose the next action:

```yaml
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "What would you like to do next?"
  header: "Next step"
  options:
    - label: "/workspace-execute (Recommended)"
      description: "Start executing TODO items in the workspace"
    - label: "/workspace-update-todo"
      description: "Modify TODO items before execution"
    - label: "/workspace-show-status"
      description: "Check workspace status"
```

After the user selects an option, invoke the corresponding skill with the workspace name as argument. Do NOT invoke other skills automatically before asking.

## Notes

- Base branch is auto-detected from remote default unless explicitly specified
- `setup-workspace.sh` creates the workspace directory and README.md template
- `setup-repository.sh` handles cloning, updating, and worktree creation
- TODO files are created by planner agents, not by the setup scripts
- Workspace naming convention: `{task-type}-{ticket-id}-{description}-{date}` or `{task-type}-{description}-{date}`
- Alias syntax: Use `repo:alias` to create multiple worktrees from the same repository (e.g., `github.com/org/repo:dev`)
- For single repository workspaces, the coordinator step is still run but makes minimal changes
- This skill runs inline and waits for background agents (planner → coordinator → reviewer) to complete before returning. This allows user interaction (AskUserQuestion) during the review step if clarifications are needed.
- **Interactive mode (`--interactive`)**: Planners run sequentially in the foreground with `Mode: interactive`, enabling two user checkpoints per repository (approach approval + draft review). The reviewer step (Step 7) is skipped since the user already approved during planning. The coordinator still runs autonomously. `run_in_background: false` still provides context isolation (sub-agent context doesn't leak to parent).
