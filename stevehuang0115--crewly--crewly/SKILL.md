# Playwright Chrome Browser

This skill enables browser automation capabilities through the Playwright MCP server for Claude Code.

## Prerequisites

Crewly auto-configures the Playwright MCP server when browser automation is enabled in Settings (`enableBrowserAutomation: true`). The `.mcp.json` file is generated automatically during agent startup.

For manual installation:

```bash
npx @playwright/mcp@latest
```

## Capabilities

When this skill is enabled, agents can:

- Navigate to web pages
- Take screenshots of pages or specific elements
- Fill out forms and input fields
- Click buttons and links
- Extract text content from pages
- Wait for elements to appear
- Handle multiple browser tabs
- Execute in headless mode (no visible browser window)

## Usage

The browser automation tools are available through MCP (Model Context Protocol) when the Playwright MCP server is configured in Claude Code.

### Available Tools

- `mcp__playwright__browser_navigate` - Navigate to a URL
- `mcp__playwright__browser_screenshot` - Take a screenshot
- `mcp__playwright__browser_click` - Click on an element
- `mcp__playwright__browser_fill` - Fill an input field
- `mcp__playwright__browser_select` - Select from dropdown
- `mcp__playwright__browser_hover` - Hover over an element
- `mcp__playwright__browser_evaluate` - Execute JavaScript on the page
- `mcp__playwright__browser_console_messages` - Get console messages
- `mcp__playwright__browser_network_requests` - Monitor network activity
- `mcp__playwright__browser_tab_list` - List open tabs
- `mcp__playwright__browser_tab_new` - Open a new tab
- `mcp__playwright__browser_tab_select` - Switch between tabs
- `mcp__playwright__browser_tab_close` - Close a tab
- `mcp__playwright__browser_close` - Close the browser

## Comparison with Chrome Browser Skill

| Feature | Playwright MCP | Chrome Extension |
|---------|---------------|------------------|
| Installation | MCP server install | Chrome extension |
| Browser visibility | Headless (invisible) | Visible browser |
| Speed | Faster (no rendering) | Real browser speed |
| Reliability | Very stable | Depends on extension |
| Use case | Testing, scraping | Interactive automation |

## Best Practices

1. **Always take screenshots** after navigation to verify page state
2. **Use specific selectors** - prefer IDs and data-testid attributes
3. **Wait for elements** before interacting with them
4. **Handle errors gracefully** - pages may load slowly or fail
5. **Close browser when done** to free resources

## Example Workflow

```
1. Navigate to the target URL
2. Wait for page to load
3. Take a screenshot to verify state
4. Interact with elements (click, fill, select)
5. Take another screenshot to verify result
6. Extract needed data
7. Close the browser
```

## Troubleshooting

### MCP Server Not Found
If you get an error about the MCP server not being available:
1. Verify `enableBrowserAutomation` is `true` in Crewly Settings
2. Check that `.mcp.json` exists in the project root with a `playwright` entry
3. Restart the agent session to regenerate MCP config
4. Manual fallback: `npx @playwright/mcp@latest`

### Element Not Found
- Ensure the page has fully loaded before interacting
- Verify the selector is correct using browser dev tools
- Try alternative selectors (text content, aria labels)

### Screenshot Failures
- Ensure the browser has navigated to a page first
- Check that the element exists if taking element screenshot
- Verify sufficient disk space for screenshot storage
