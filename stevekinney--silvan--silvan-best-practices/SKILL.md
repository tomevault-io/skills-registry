# Silvan Best Practices

## Overview

Use this skill to keep Silvan's UX consistent and operator-grade. It provides a shared checklist and references for CLI output, errors, JSON behavior, onboarding, and UI surfaces.

## Quick workflow

1. Identify the UX surface (CLI output, JSON, errors, onboarding/help, UI).
2. Read `references/best-practices.md` for conventions and guardrails.
3. Reuse or extend shared utilities instead of adding one-off formatting.
4. Ensure success confirmations, next steps, and actionable errors.
5. Update tests and docs when behavior or output changes.

## Definition of done

- Output uses semantic colors and consistent formatting.
- `--json` output is schema-stable and error-safe.
- Errors include recovery steps and docs links when relevant.
- Commands never exit silently on success.
- TTY and non-TTY output are both readable.

## References

- `references/best-practices.md`: canonical UX and output standards.
