description: Index-based file discovery using ABOUTME headers. Use INSTEAD of grep or Explore agent when searching for files by purpose or feature. Faster and more accurate than scanning code.

# ABOUTME Index

Read `.claude/aboutme-index.md` to find files by purpose instead of grep-searching.

## Usage

1. Read the index:
```bash
cat .claude/aboutme-index.md
```

2. Filter by keyword using grep:
```bash
grep -i "auth\|jwt" .claude/aboutme-index.md
```

3. Read the relevant files.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/aboutme-check` | Find files missing ABOUTME headers |
| `/aboutme-rebuild` | Rebuild the entire index |
| `/aboutme-stale` | Check for stale headers |
| `cat .claude/aboutme-index.md` | Read the index directly |

## Index Format

```markdown
- `app/src/auth.py`: JWT authentication module for AWS Cognito access tokens...
- `app/src/config.py`: Centralized configuration using Pydantic settings...
```

The index is auto-rebuilt on session start and updated incrementally on file edits.
