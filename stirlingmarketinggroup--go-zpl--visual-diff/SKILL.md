Compare two images using Gemini 3 Pro's visual understanding.

## Invocation

Parse arguments: `/visual-diff <reference-path> <actual-path>`

## Steps

1. Verify both paths exist (use ls or Read tool)
2. Run gemini comparison:

```bash
gemini --yolo --model gemini-3-pro-preview --output-format text \
  "Compare these two images. First is REFERENCE (expected), second is ACTUAL (rendered).

Report:
1. Overall Match: identical/minor/moderate/major difference?
2. Missing Elements: in reference but not actual?
3. Extra Elements: in actual but not reference?
4. Position Differences: same element, different location?
5. Size/Scale Differences: wrong size?
6. Text Differences: missing, wrong, or different text?
7. Specific Coordinates: approximate pixel locations of issues.

Be specific. Focus on what needs fixing.

Reference: <reference-path>
Actual: <actual-path>"
```
