# Rust Project Technical Review Methodology

## Problem
Reviewing large Rust projects requires a systematic approach to thoroughly assess code quality, architecture, security, and maintainability without missing critical aspects.

## Context / Trigger Conditions
- Need to review an unfamiliar Rust codebase
- Conducting project health assessment
- Evaluating open-source project for adoption
- Preparing technical audit or due diligence
- Onboarding to a new Rust project as technical lead

## Solution

### Phase 1: Project Structure Analysis

1. **Initial exploration**:
   ```bash
   ls -la                    # Check root directory structure
   cat README.md            # Understand project purpose
   cat Cargo.toml          # Review workspace structure and dependencies
   ```

2. **Codebase metrics**:
   ```bash
   find . -name "*.rs" -type f | xargs wc -l | tail -1  # Total lines of code
   find . -name "*.md" -type f | wc -l                  # Documentation count
   ```

3. **Architecture assessment**:
   - Review crate organization in Cargo.toml workspace
   - Examine lib.rs files for module structure
   - Identify separation of concerns between crates

### Phase 2: Code Quality Assessment

1. **Compilation check**:
   ```bash
   cargo check --workspace   # Verify clean compilation
   ```

2. **Linting analysis**:
   ```bash
   cargo clippy --workspace  # Identify code quality issues
   ```

3. **Test execution** (if possible):
   ```bash
   cargo test --workspace    # Run test suite
   ```

4. **Dependency analysis**:
   - Review Cargo.toml dependencies for:
     - Version consistency across workspace
     - Security-sensitive crates
     - Maintenance status of dependencies

### Phase 3: Architecture & Design Review

1. **Domain modeling**: Examine domain module organization
2. **Async patterns**: Check for proper tokio/async usage
3. **Error handling**: Verify consistent error handling patterns
4. **Security practices**: Look for:
   - Input validation
   - Secure credential storage
   - Proper use of cryptographic libraries

### Phase 4: Documentation Assessment

1. **User documentation**: README, CONTRIBUTING, ROADMAP
2. **Code documentation**: Inline docs, examples
3. **Security documentation**: SECURITY.md, vulnerability reporting
4. **Development docs**: Build instructions, architecture diagrams

### Phase 5: Report Generation

Structure findings into comprehensive report:

```markdown
# Project Review

## Overview
- Project purpose and scope
- Key statistics (LOC, documentation, etc.)
- License and governance

## Architecture & Design
- Strengths in design patterns
- Technical implementation details
- Code organization assessment

## Code Quality Assessment
- Compilation status
- Clippy warnings analysis
- Test coverage evaluation
- Dependency review

## Strengths
- Technical achievements
- Best practices followed
- Security considerations

## Areas of Concern
- Potential risks or issues
- Technical debt indicators
- Scalability considerations

## Recommendations
- Immediate actions
- Strategic suggestions
- Long-term improvements

## Conclusion
- Overall assessment
- Viability evaluation
- Final recommendation
```

## Verification

A successful review should produce:
- Compile-time verification of code health
- Quantitative metrics (LOC, warning count, documentation coverage)
- Qualitative assessment of architecture and practices
- Actionable recommendations for improvement
- Clear overall evaluation with supporting evidence

## Example

For the Demiarch project review:

```bash
# Structure analysis
ls -la ~/projects/demiarch/
cat README.md
cat Cargo.toml

# Quality checks
cargo check --workspace    # ✅ Clean compilation
cargo clippy --workspace   # 14 minor warnings identified

# Metrics collection
find crates -name "*.rs" | xargs wc -l    # 52,648 lines core code
find . -name "*.md" | wc -l                # 804 documentation files

# Analysis revealed:
# - Well-structured 4-crate workspace
# - Advanced features (GraphRAG, Russian Doll agents)
# - Strong security practices
# - Comprehensive documentation
# - Minor code quality improvements needed
```

## Notes

### Best Practices
- Always run automated tools (check, clippy, test) first
- Document quantitative metrics for objective assessment
- Balance technical depth with readability for stakeholders
- Include both immediate fixes and strategic recommendations
- Consider project maturity when setting expectations

### Limitations
- Cannot assess runtime behavior without execution
- Limited insight into performance without profiling
- Security assessment is surface-level without specialized tools
- Code quality depends on clippy rule configuration

### Adaptations for Different Project Types
- **Libraries**: Focus more on API design and documentation
- **Applications**: Emphasize security and deployment considerations
- **Early-stage**: Be more forgiving of incomplete features
- **Production**: Stricter standards for testing and documentation
