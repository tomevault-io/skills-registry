# Experiment Analyzer Skill

Analyze completed growth experiments, extract insights, and drive continuous learning.

## When to Activate

This skill should activate when:
- User marks experiment as "completed"
- User asks "what did we learn?"
- User mentions "results", "outcomes", or "analysis"
- User asks "what should we do next?"
- User wants to compare multiple experiments
- User asks about experiment success rates

## Analysis Framework

### 1. Result Classification

**Win (Positive + Significant)**
- Result is better than baseline
- Statistical significance ≥ 95%
- Change is meaningful (usually ≥5%)

**Loss (Negative + Significant)**
- Result is worse than baseline
- Statistical significance ≥ 95%
- Change is meaningful

**Inconclusive**
- Statistical significance < 95%
- Not enough data to make decision
- Sample size may be insufficient

**Neutral**
- Minimal change (< ±2%)
- No meaningful impact either way
- May indicate hypothesis was off

### 2. Hypothesis Validation

Compare original hypothesis to results:

**Hypothesis Components:**
- Proposed change → Was it implemented as planned?
- Target audience → Did we reach the right users?
- Expected outcome → Did we hit the target?
- Rationale → Was our reasoning correct?

**Validation Questions:**
- Did we achieve the expected outcome? (Yes/No/Partially)
- Was the underlying assumption correct?
- What surprised us?
- What would we do differently?

### 3. ICE Score Retrospective

Compare predicted vs actual:

**Impact Score Validation:**
- Predicted Impact: [original score]
- Actual Impact: [calculate based on results]
- Delta: [difference]
- Learning: Was our impact prediction accurate?

**Confidence Score Validation:**
- Predicted Confidence: [original score]
- Outcome: [win/loss/inconclusive]
- Learning: Was our confidence justified?

**Ease Score Validation:**
- Predicted Ease: [original score]
- Actual Time: [if tracked]
- Learning: Was implementation as easy as expected?

### 4. Insight Generation

**Key Questions:**
- **What worked?** Specific elements that drove success
- **What didn't work?** Elements that failed or harmed metrics
- **What was surprising?** Unexpected findings
- **What patterns emerge?** Connections to other experiments
- **What new questions arise?** Areas to investigate further

**Secondary Metrics:**
- Review all secondary metrics tracked
- Look for unintended positive effects
- Watch for negative side effects
- Consider holistic impact

### 5. Follow-up Experiment Suggestions

Based on the outcome, suggest 2-3 follow-up experiments:

**For Wins:**
- **Scale:** Roll out to 100% of users
- **Amplify:** Make the winning element more prominent
- **Extend:** Apply pattern to related areas
- **Optimize:** Test variations to improve further

**For Losses:**
- **Pivot:** Try alternative approach to same problem
- **Investigate:** Run research to understand why
- **Revert:** Document and move on
- **Learn:** Apply learnings to future experiments

**For Inconclusive:**
- **Re-run:** Increase sample size or duration
- **Simplify:** Test smaller version to isolate variable
- **Segment:** Test with specific user segments
- **Refine:** Adjust hypothesis based on early signals

## Analysis Process

### Step 1: Load and Validate

```
1. Read experiment JSON from completed/archived folder
2. Verify results data exists:
   - Primary metric
   - Baseline value
   - Result value
   - Statistical significance
   - Sample size
   - Duration
3. Check if hypothesis is documented
4. Review ICE scores
```

### Step 2: Calculate Key Metrics

```
Change Percentage = ((Result - Baseline) / Baseline) × 100

Result Classification:
- IF change% > 2% AND significance >= 95% → Win
- IF change% < -2% AND significance >= 95% → Loss
- IF significance < 95% → Inconclusive
- IF abs(change%) < 2% → Neutral
```

### Step 3: Generate Insights

```
1. Classify result (Win/Loss/Inconclusive/Neutral)
2. Validate hypothesis against results
3. Review ICE score predictions
4. Extract key learnings
5. Identify surprising findings
6. Check secondary metrics
7. Look for patterns across related experiments
```

### Step 4: Create Follow-up Ideas

```
1. Based on result type, brainstorm 2-3 follow-ups
2. For each follow-up:
   - Draft hypothesis
   - Explain rationale (reference current learnings)
   - Suggest category
   - Provide preliminary ICE estimate
3. Prioritize follow-ups by potential impact
```

### Step 5: Generate Report

```
1. Create markdown analysis report
2. Include:
   - Summary (result classification, key numbers)
   - Hypothesis validation
   - ICE score retrospective
   - Key insights (bulleted list)
   - Secondary metrics review
   - Recommendations
   - Follow-up experiment ideas
3. Save to experiments/archive/[id]_analysis.md
4. Update experiment JSON with learnings
```

- **Category Performance:** Which funnel stages have best win rate?
- **ICE Score Accuracy:** How well do high-ICE experiments perform?
- **Average Impact:** What's the typical metric improvement?
- **Cycle Time:** Average days from backlog → completed

### Pattern Recognition:
- Which types of experiments succeed most?
- Which audience segments respond best?
- Which testing methods are most reliable?
- What confidence levels actually predict success?

### Portfolio View:
```markdown

- Experiments with ICE < 300: [X% win rate]

**Learning:** [Are high ICE scores actually better predictors?]

## Top Performers
1. [Experiment] - [+X%] change
2. [Experiment] - [+X%] change
3. [Experiment] - [+X%] change

[Strategic recommendations based on portfolio analysis]
```

## Integration Points

- Automatically trigger when `/experiment-update` sets status to "completed"
- Work with ICE scorer skill to validate predictions
- Inform hypothesis generator with learnings
- Feed into metrics calculator for portfolio analysis

## Continuous Improvement

After each analysis:
