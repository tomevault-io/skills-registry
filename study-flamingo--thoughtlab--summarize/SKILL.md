## Summary: Authentication System

### Key Points
- Uses JWT tokens with 1-hour expiry
- Auth0 as identity provider
- Refresh tokens stored in httpOnly cookies
- Middleware validates on every API request

### Flow
1. User logs in via Auth0 redirect
2. Callback exchanges code for tokens
3. Access token used for API calls
4. Refresh happens automatically when expired

### Key Files
- `src/auth/middleware.ts:15` - Token validation
- `src/auth/callback.ts:42` - Token exchange
- `src/auth/refresh.ts:8` - Refresh logic
```
