# Git Workflow

## Commit Messages

Use Conventional Commits format:

```text
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

[body]

[footer]
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `ci`, `perf`, `build`

Rules:

- Subject line: imperative mood, lowercase, no period, max 72 chars
- Scope: optional, name the module/area affected
- Body: wrap at 72 chars, explain *what* and *why* (not *how*)
- Footer: `BREAKING CHANGE:` or issue references (`Fixes #123`)

Examples:

```text
feat(skill-router): add fuzzy matching with Fuse.js

Replace hand-rolled token scoring with Fuse.js + Porter stemmer.
Adds ignoreLocation for position-independent matching.

Fixes #42
```

```text
fix(mcp): handle missing index.json gracefully

Return empty skill list instead of crashing when index.json
hasn't been built yet.
```

## Branch Naming

```text
<type>/<ticket-or-short-description>
```

| Type | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `feat/` | New features |
| `fix/` | Bug fixes |
| `chore/` | Maintenance, deps |
| `docs/` | Documentation only |
| `release/` | Release prep |

Examples: `feat/skill-router-fuzzy`, `fix/mcp-ping-handler`, `chore/bump-eslint-10`

## Workflows

### Feature Branch

```text
1. git checkout main && git pull
2. git checkout -b feat/<name>
3. Make changes, commit with conventional format
4. git push -u origin feat/<name>
5. Open PR → review → squash merge → delete branch
```

### Bug Fix (same branch model)

```text
1. git checkout main && git pull
2. git checkout -b fix/<name>
3. Write a failing test that reproduces the bug
4. Fix the bug, verify test passes
5. Commit: fix(<scope>): <description>
6. Push and open PR
```

### Rebase onto main

When a feature branch is behind main:

```text
1. git fetch origin
2. git rebase origin/main
3. Resolve conflicts file-by-file (see Conflict Resolution below)
4. git rebase --continue (after each conflict)
5. git push --force-with-lease
```

Never use `--force` — always `--force-with-lease` to avoid overwriting others' work.

### Interactive Rebase (cleanup before PR)

```text
1. git rebase -i HEAD~<n>    # n = number of commits to squash
2. Mark commits as:
   - pick   — keep as-is
   - squash — combine with previous
   - reword — change commit message
   - drop   — remove entirely
3. Save and edit combined commit message
4. git push --force-with-lease
```

## Conflict Resolution

1. Open the conflicted file
2. Identify the conflict markers: `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`
3. Understand what each side changed and *why*
4. Choose the correct resolution:
   - **Take ours**: keep the current branch's version
   - **Take theirs**: keep the incoming branch's version
   - **Merge both**: combine changes manually (most common)
5. Remove all conflict markers
6. Test that the resolved file works correctly
7. `git add <file>` then continue the rebase/merge

## PR Descriptions

Use this structure:

```markdown
## What

One-sentence summary of the change.

## Why

Context: what problem does this solve? Link to issue if applicable.

## How

Brief description of the approach. Mention any non-obvious decisions.

## Testing

How was this tested? What commands to run?

## Checklist

- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] Lint clean
- [ ] Docs updated (if applicable)
```

## Common Pitfalls

- **Don't commit to main directly** — always use feature branches
- **Don't `git add .` blindly** — review `git diff --staged` before committing
- **Don't rebase shared branches** — only rebase your own feature branches
- **Don't force-push without `--lease`** — `--force-with-lease` is always safer
- **Don't mix unrelated changes** — one logical change per commit
