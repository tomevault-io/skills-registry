description: Persistent structured memory for LLM agents using botmem CLI. Use when storing, retrieving, or managing agent memory — facts, knowledge graph relationships, conversation summaries, and context blocks. Use for memory recall, ingestion of conversation content, knowledge graph queries, and exporting full context for prompt injection. Use when this capability is needed.

# botmem — Persistent LLM Memory

CLI tool providing four memory types: blocks (working memory), archival (long-term facts), knowledge graph (entity relationships), and conversation summaries.

## Prerequisites

- `botmem` binary on PATH (`go install github.com/stukennedy/botmem@latest`)
- Configured via `botmem init` (supports Claude Code CLI, Anthropic API, or Ollama)
- Config at `~/.botmem/config.yaml`, DB at `~/.botmem/botmem.db`

## Commands

### Memory Blocks (working memory — always-on context)
```bash
botmem block set <label> <content>    # Set/update a block (human, persona, context)
botmem block get <label>              # Read a block
botmem block list [type]              # List blocks
botmem block delete <label>           # Delete a block
```

### Archival Memory (long-term facts with FTS5 search)
```bash
botmem archive add <text> --tags tag1,tag2   # Store a fact
botmem archive search <query>                 # Full-text search
botmem archive list [--tag tag]               # List entries
```

### Knowledge Graph (entity-relationship triplets)
```bash
botmem graph add <subject> <predicate> <object>   # Add relationship
botmem graph query <entity>                        # All relations for entity
botmem graph search <predicate>                    # Search by relationship type
botmem graph entities [type]                       # List entities
```

### Conversation Summaries (hierarchical)
```bash
botmem summary add <text> [--level N]   # Add summary (level 0 = most detailed)
botmem summary list [--level N]         # List summaries
```

### Context Export (full memory dump for prompt injection)
```bash
botmem context   # Returns JSON: { core_blocks, key_relations, ... }
```

### Ingest (LLM-powered extraction from conversation text)
```bash
botmem ingest <text>       # Extract facts, triplets, block updates, summary
echo <text> | botmem ingest   # Pipe from stdin
```
Ingest requires a configured LLM provider. It automatically:
- Updates memory blocks (human, persona, context)
- Extracts tagged facts → archival
- Extracts entity-relationship triplets → knowledge graph
- Generates conversation summary

## Integration Patterns

### Session Start — Load Context
Run `botmem context` and include the JSON in system prompt for full memory recall.

### After Important Conversations — Ingest
Summarise the conversation and pipe to `botmem ingest` to automatically extract and store structured memories.

### Ad-hoc Recall — Query
Use `botmem graph query <entity>` or `botmem archive search <term>` for targeted recall.

### Periodic Maintenance
Use `botmem block set context <current situation>` to keep working memory current.

## Custom DB Path
All commands accept `--db <path>` to use a different database file. Useful for per-agent or per-project memory stores.
