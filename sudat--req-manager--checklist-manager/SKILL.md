# Checklist Manager

## Overview

Manage multiple medium-to-large projects (10+ tasks each) with sequential dependencies using structured checklists. Checklists are stored in `docs/checklists/active/` with unique filenames, and completed work is archived to `docs/checklists/archive/`. This skill provides workflows for creating, listing, switching, planning, tracking, updating, and archiving task progress systematically.

**Directory Structure:**
```
docs/checklists/
├── active/
│   ├── 2025-01-07-demo-data-update.md
│   └── 2025-01-08-oauth-migration.md
└── archive/
    └── 2024-12-20-ui-refactoring.md
```

**Naming Convention:** `YYYY-MM-DD-[task-name].md`

## Workflow Decision Tree

Use this decision tree to determine which workflow to follow:

```
User request
├─ "Create a checklist" / Starting new project
│  └─> Go to: Creating a New Checklist
│
├─ "List checklists" / "What am I working on?"
│  └─> Go to: Listing Active Checklists
│
├─ "Switch to [task]" / Change active task
│  └─> Go to: Switching Between Checklists
│
├─ "What's next?" / "Plan my work"
│  └─> Go to: Planning Short-Term Work
│
├─ Task completed / Progress made
│  └─> Go to: Updating Checklist Progress
│
├─ "Is the project done?" / Review status
│  └─> Go to: Reviewing Project Status
│
└─ "Archive [task]" / Work completed
   └─> Go to: Archiving Completed Work
```

## Creating a New Checklist

**When to use:** User explicitly requests checklist creation, or Claude detects a complex project requiring structured tracking.

**Process:**

1. **Understand project scope**
   - Identify all files, components, and systems to be modified
   - Clarify dependencies between tasks
   - Estimate total task count (should be 10+)
   - Determine a concise task name (e.g., "oauth-migration", "demo-data-update")

2. **Generate filename**
   - Format: `YYYY-MM-DD-[task-name].md`
   - Use current date (2025-01-07)
   - Task name: lowercase, hyphen-separated, descriptive
   - Example: `2025-01-07-oauth-migration.md`

3. **Create directory structure if needed**
   ```bash
   # Create directories if they don't exist
   mkdir -p docs/checklists/active
   mkdir -p docs/checklists/archive
   ```

4. **Structure the checklist**
   - Use the template from `assets/checklist-template.md`
   - Organize tasks by file, component, or logical grouping
   - Each section should include:
     - **File/Component name**: Clear identifier
     - **Task items**: Specific, actionable items with `- [ ]` checkboxes
     - **Verification items**: How to confirm task completion

5. **Define dependencies**
   - Order sections by dependency (prerequisites first)
   - Add warnings/notes for critical dependencies
   - Mark optional vs. required tasks clearly

6. **Add completion criteria**
   - Define what "done" means
   - Include integration tests
   - Specify acceptance criteria

7. **Save checklist**
   - Save to `docs/checklists/active/YYYY-MM-DD-[task-name].md`
   - Confirm to user with filename and location

**Example:**
```
✅ Created checklist: docs/checklists/active/2025-01-07-oauth-migration.md

This checklist tracks the OAuth 2.0 migration project with 15 tasks across 5 components.
```

**See also:** `references/checklist-examples.md` for project-specific examples

## Listing Active Checklists

**When to use:** User asks "what am I working on?", "list checklists", or needs to see all active tasks.

**Process:**

1. **List all active checklists**
   ```bash
   # Use Glob to find all active checklists
   Glob docs/checklists/active/*.md
   ```

2. **Read each checklist header**
   - Read first 20 lines of each file to get:
     - Title (# [Project Name])
     - 作業概要 (work summary)
     - Quick progress estimate by counting checkboxes

3. **Display formatted list**
   ```
   📋 Active Checklists (2):

   1. 2025-01-07-demo-data-update.md
      Title: Demo Data Update
      Summary: Update demo data from SD/MM to AP/AR/GL
      Progress: ~80% (48/60 tasks)

   2. 2025-01-08-oauth-migration.md
      Title: OAuth 2.0 Migration
      Summary: Replace basic auth with OAuth
      Progress: ~20% (3/15 tasks)

   Type the filename or number to switch to a checklist.
   ```

## Switching Between Checklists

**When to use:** User wants to work on a different active task.

**Process:**

1. **Confirm which checklist to switch to**
   - If user specifies filename or number from list, use that
   - If unclear, show list and ask user to choose

2. **Read the target checklist**
   ```bash
   Read docs/checklists/active/[selected-file].md
   ```

3. **Display current status**
   - Show progress summary
   - Highlight next incomplete section
   - Ask if user wants to plan next work

**Example:**
```
🔄 Switched to: 2025-01-08-oauth-migration.md

📊 Progress: 3/15 tasks complete (20%)

Next up: Section 2 - Login Component (5 tasks remaining)

Ready to plan next work? (Yes/No)
```

## Planning Short-Term Work

**When to use:** Beginning a work session, or user asks "what's next?"

**Process:**

1. **Determine which checklist to use**
   - If only one active checklist exists, use it
   - If multiple exist, ask user which one to work on
   - If none exist, suggest creating one

2. **Read current checklist**
   ```bash
   # Read the selected active checklist
   Read docs/checklists/active/[filename].md
   ```

3. **Identify next tasks**
   - Find first incomplete section with unchecked `- [ ]` items
   - Check for dependency warnings
   - If previous section incomplete, warn user:
     ```
     ⚠️ Warning: Section [X] is not complete yet.
     Recommended to complete it first due to dependencies.
     Proceed anyway? (Yes/No)
     ```

4. **Create short-term plan**
   - Select 1-3 related tasks from the same section
   - Explain what will be done and why
   - Estimate scope (number of files, complexity)
   - Confirm with user before proceeding

**Example:**
```
📋 Working on: 2025-01-07-demo-data-update.md

Based on checklist, next up:

Section 2: Dashboard Page (app/dashboard/page.tsx)
   - [ ] Update review queue data (AP/AR/GL only)
   - [ ] Update domain distribution chart

This involves:
- Modifying 1 file (app/dashboard/page.tsx)
- Updating 2 data arrays
- Testing chart rendering

Ready to proceed?
```

## Updating Checklist Progress

**When to use:** After completing one or more tasks.

**Process:**

1. **Determine which checklist was being worked on**
   - Use context from recent work
   - If unclear, ask user which checklist to update

2. **Read current checklist**
   ```bash
   Read docs/checklists/active/[filename].md
   ```

3. **Identify completed tasks**
   - Review what was just accomplished
   - Map to specific checklist items
   - Include verification items if tested

4. **Update checkboxes**
   - Change `- [ ]` to `- [x]` for completed items
   - Update ALL completed items in this session
   - Add comments if needed (e.g., `- [x] Task 1 <!-- Updated: 2025-01-07 -->`)

5. **Save and confirm**
   ```bash
   Edit docs/checklists/active/[filename].md
   # Update checkboxes
   ```
   - Confirm update to user with summary:
     ```
     ✅ Checklist updated: 2025-01-07-demo-data-update.md
     - Completed: Task X, Task Y
     - Section progress: 4/7 items done
     - Overall progress: 50/60 tasks (83%)
     ```

6. **Check for completion and auto-archive**
   - After updating checkboxes, check if all items are complete
   - Count remaining incomplete items: `grep "^- \[ \]" [filename].md`
   - If **NO incomplete items remain** (all are `- [x]`):
     ```
     ✅ All tasks complete! Auto-archiving checklist...
     ```
     - Immediately proceed to archive workflow:
       ```bash
       mv docs/checklists/active/[filename].md docs/checklists/archive/[filename].md
       ```
     - Confirm archival:
       ```
       📦 Archived: [filename].md
       Location: docs/checklists/archive/[filename].md
       Final status: [N]/[N] tasks complete (100%)
       ```
     - If other active checklists exist, offer to switch to one
     - If no active checklists remain, congratulate user on completion

**Important:**
- Update immediately after task completion (not batched)
- Be precise - only mark items actually completed
- If task partially done, add note but keep unchecked
- **ALWAYS check for completion after updating** - auto-archive if all done

## Reviewing Project Status

**When to use:** User asks for status, or periodically during long projects.

**Process:**

1. **Determine which checklist to review**
   - If user specifies, use that
   - If unclear and multiple exist, show list and ask
   - If only one exists, use it

2. **Read current checklist**
   ```bash
   Read docs/checklists/active/[filename].md
   ```

3. **Calculate progress**
   - Count total `- [x]` vs `- [ ]` items
   - Report per-section progress
   - Identify remaining work

4. **Report status**
   ```
   📊 Project Status: 2025-01-07-demo-data-update.md

   Overall: 45/60 tasks complete (75%)

   Sections:
   ✅ 1. Business Page: 8/8 (100%)
   ✅ 2. Dashboard Page: 7/7 (100%)
   🔄 3. Tickets Page: 5/8 (63%)
   ⬜ 4. Ideas Page: 0/5 (0%)
   ⬜ 5. Settings Page: 0/3 (0%)

   Next up: Complete Section 3, then start Section 4
   ```

5. **Suggest next actions**
   - Recommend what to work on next
   - Highlight blockers or dependencies
   - Estimate remaining effort if possible

## Archiving Completed Work

**When to use:** All tasks in a checklist are complete, or user requests archiving.

**Process:**

1. **Verify completion**
   - Read the checklist to confirm all `- [ ]` items are `- [x]`
   - Check completion criteria section
   - If not fully complete, warn user:
     ```
     ⚠️ Warning: This checklist has 5 incomplete tasks.
     Archive anyway? (Yes/No)
     ```

2. **Move to archive**
   ```bash
   # Move file from active to archive
   mv docs/checklists/active/[filename].md docs/checklists/archive/[filename].md
   ```

3. **Confirm to user**
   ```
   ✅ Archived: 2025-01-07-demo-data-update.md

   Location: docs/checklists/archive/2025-01-07-demo-data-update.md
   Final status: 60/60 tasks complete (100%)

   Remaining active checklists: 1
   ```

4. **Suggest next steps**
   - If other active checklists exist, offer to switch to one
   - If no active checklists, ask if user wants to create a new one

## Handling Dependencies

**Warnings-only mode** (default):
- Check previous sections for incomplete items
- Issue warning but allow proceeding:
  ```
  ⚠️ Dependency Warning:
  Section 1 has incomplete items:
  - [ ] Task X
  - [ ] Task Y

  Recommended to complete these first.
  Continue with Section 2? (Yes/No)
  ```

**Flexible mode** (parallel work allowed):
- Only warn for critical dependencies
- Allow working on independent sections simultaneously

## File Naming Best Practices

**Good names:**
- `2025-01-07-oauth-migration.md` - Clear, specific
- `2025-01-08-react-hooks-refactor.md` - Descriptive
- `2025-01-10-postgres-migration.md` - Concise

**Avoid:**
- `2025-01-07-fix.md` - Too vague
- `2025-01-07-update-everything.md` - Not specific
- `2025-01-07-oauth_migration_project_v2.md` - Underscores, version numbers
