description: Persistent local memory for AI agents. Use when starting a new session, when the user mentions remembering something, when you need project context, when making architecture decisions, or when working with other agents on the same project. Use when this capability is needed.

\# Nemp Memory — Persistent Local Memory for Claude Code



You have access to a local memory system stored in `.nemp/` in the project root. Use it to persist context across sessions so users never have to repeat themselves.



\## When to Use This Skill



\- \*\*Session start\*\*: Always check for existing memories by reading `.nemp/memories.json`

\- \*\*Architecture decisions\*\*: Save decisions so future sessions know why

\- \*\*Stack detection\*\*: On first use, auto-detect the project stack and save it

\- \*\*User preferences\*\*: Save coding style, conventions, patterns the user prefers

\- \*\*Agent coordination\*\*: When working with other agents, save context they'll need



\## Memory Storage Format



Memories are stored in `.nemp/memories.json` as an array of objects with keys: key, value, tags, timestamp, source, agent\_id.



\## How to Save a Memory



Read `.nemp/memories.json`, add or update the entry, write back. Rules:

\- Compress values: remove filler words, keep under 200 chars

\- Use descriptive keys: auth-provider, database, styling-framework

\- Tag appropriately: stack, architecture, convention, preference, api

\- Track agent\_id: use "main" for single agent or your agent name

\- Upsert: if key exists, update it



\## How to Recall Memories



Search `.nemp/memories.json` with keyword expansion:

\- auth -> authentication, login, session, jwt, token, oauth

\- database -> db, postgres, mysql, sqlite, mongo, prisma, drizzle

\- styling -> css, tailwind, sass, scss, styled-components, shadcn

\- testing -> test, jest, vitest, cypress, playwright, e2e

\- deploy -> deployment, docker, vercel, netlify, aws, ci, cd



\## Auto-Detection (First Session)



Scan package.json, requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, go.mod, Cargo.toml, tsconfig.json, docker-compose.yml, .env to auto-detect stack. Save each with source: "auto-detect" and agent\_id: "nemp-init".



\## Access Logging



Log every operation to `.nemp/access.log` with timestamp, operation, key, and agent.



\## Critical Rules



1\. ALL data stays local. Never make network calls.

2\. Create `.nemp/` directory if it doesn't exist.

3\. Always read before write to avoid overwriting other agents' memories.

4\. Compress aggressively — keep values under 200 chars.

5\. Log every operation to `.nemp/access.log`.

6\. Regenerate `.nemp/MEMORY.md` after every write/delete.
