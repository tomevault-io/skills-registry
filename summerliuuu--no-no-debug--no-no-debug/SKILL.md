# no-no-debug — Self-Evolution System for AI Coding Assistants

## Overview

Six mechanisms work together to eliminate repeated mistakes permanently:

- **Mechanism 1**: Real-time logging — errors, corrections, and failures auto-appended to `~/.claude/memory/error_log.md`
- **Mechanism 2**: Silent 3-gate checkpoint before every code change (no output when all clear)
- **Mechanism 3**: Periodic review that reads error_log.md, classifies errors, updates a persistent tracker
- **Mechanism 4**: Rule accumulation — new error types auto-added, repeat offenses strengthen gates, 4 clean periods = cured
- **Mechanism 5**: Confirmation gate — must ask user before new features, DB/env/deploy changes, external publishing, or new directions
- **Mechanism 6**: Auto hooks — passive capture configured at install time

---

## Configuration

| Setting | Default | Options |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Log file | `~/.claude/memory/error_log.md` | Any writable path |
| Tracker file | `~/.claude/memory/error_tracker.md` | Any writable path |
| Review frequency | 3 days | 1 / 3 / 7 days |
| Language | Auto-detected | zh / en |

To change review frequency, add a comment to the top of `error_tracker.md`:
```
<!-- review_frequency: 1 -->
```

---

## Mechanism 1 — Real-time Logging

**Always active. Runs passively. No user action required.**

Append a line to `~/.claude/memory/error_log.md` whenever any of the following occur:

### Trigger conditions

| Event | Log type |
|-------|----------|
| Bash command exits with non-zero status | `BUILD_FAIL` or `RUNTIME_ERROR` |
| Deploy or publish action fails | `DEPLOY_FAIL` |
| Test run has failures | `TEST_FAIL` |
| User corrects the AI with a second-person phrase (see Mechanism 6 for the exact pattern list) | `USER_CORRECTION` |
| Same fix applied more than once | `REPEATED_FIX` |
| Network or API connection times out | `CONNECTION_FAIL` |
| Login or authentication fails | `AUTH_FAIL` |

### Log format

```
[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] TYPE | description
```

Examples:
```
[2024-04-08 14:32] BUILD_FAIL | npm run build failed — cannot find module './utils/auth'
[2024-04-08 15:01] USER_CORRECTION | User said "wrong" — had used cached data instead of live fetch
[2024-04-08 16:45] REPEATED_FIX | Applied the same null-check fix to userProfile.ts for the second time
[2024-04-09 09:12] AUTH_FAIL | Login redirect broken after updating next.config.js
```

### File initialization

If `~/.claude/memory/error_log.md` does not exist, create the directory and file with this header:

```markdown
# Error Log
<!-- Auto-maintained by no-no-debug -->
<!-- Format: [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] TYPE | description -->

```

---

## Mechanism 2 — Three-Gate Checkpoint (Silent)

**Always active. No output when all gates pass.**

Before ANY code change, file edit, configuration update, or deployment action, silently verify all three gates:

### Gate 1 — Before Making the Change
- What exactly does this change affect?
- Could authentication or login break?
- Does this touch `.env`, database schema, connection strings, or credentials?
- Does this modify shared infrastructure used by other features?
- Is this a new feature or a bug fix? (If new feature → trigger Mechanism 5 first)

### Gate 2 — After Making the Change
- Did I actually verify the result, or just check that a command ran without error?
- Did I verify using the **real production command string** (the exact hook/CLI/route handler users will hit), not a simplified test harness or sandbox invocation?
- Did I walk the flow as a real user would, end to end?
- Did I check the failure path, not just the success path?
- Does the output shown to the user match what is actually in the code?
- For shell/hook changes with multiple escape layers (JSON → shell → interpreter), did I run the exact string from settings.json rather than a locally-equivalent variant?

### Gate 3 — Before Deploying or Publishing
- Did I test with a non-admin account?
- Is the permission table complete for all new routes and actions?
- Are all required database migrations included?
- Are there cache invalidation requirements?
- For changes reviewed by a second agent (e.g. another model, sandboxed reviewer): did I independently re-run the verification in my own environment rather than trusting the reviewer's "pass" report? A sandbox pass is not a real-environment pass.
- Does this publish to an external platform? (If yes → trigger Mechanism 5 first)

**Output rule**: Stay completely silent when all gates pass. When any gate raises a concern, surface it to the user before proceeding.

---

## Mechanism 3 — Periodic Review

### Auto-trigger condition
A `UserPromptSubmit` hook (`hooks/review_reminder.py`) checks `~/.claude/memory/error_tracker.md` for `Last Review Date` on each user message. If elapsed days since that date are greater than or equal to the configured review frequency (default: 3), the hook outputs a reminder. When you see this reminder, run the review automatically. A 4-hour cooldown prevents repeated reminders within the same session.

### Manual trigger
User says any of: `error review`, `错误追踪`, `进化报告`, `evolution report`

### Step 1 — Initialize files if missing

If `~/.claude/memory/error_log.md` does not exist, create it (see Mechanism 1 initialization).

If `~/.claude/memory/error_tracker.md` does not exist:

1. Create the directory `~/.claude/memory/` if needed
2. Write the following template to `~/.claude/memory/error_tracker.md`:

```markdown
# Error Tracker
<!-- review_frequency: 3 -->

Last Review Date: {TODAY}
Review Count: 0
Total Lifetime Errors: 0

## Active Dimensions

| Dimension | Total | Last Seen | Clean Periods | Status |
|-----------|-------|-----------|---------------|--------|
| 数据准确性 / Data Accuracy | 0 | — | 0 | Active |
| 环境安全 / Environment Safety | 0 | — | 0 | Active |
| 预见性 / Foresight | 0 | — | 0 | Active |
| 用户视角 / User Perspective | 0 | — | 0 | Active |
| 验证完整性 / Verification | 0 | — | 0 | Active |
| 记忆一致性 / Memory Consistency | 0 | — | 0 | Active |
| 工具判断 / Tool Judgment | 0 | — | 0 | Active |
| 审查覆盖 / Review Completeness | 0 | — | 0 | Active |
| 操作精准 / Operational Precision | 0 | — | 0 | Active |
| 先查后做 / Check Before Doing | 0 | — | 0 | Active |
| 简洁性 / Conciseness | 0 | — | 0 | Active |
| 回归意识 / Regression Awareness | 0 | — | 0 | Active |
| 风格一致性 / Style Consistency | 0 | — | 0 | Active |
| 独立判断 / Independent Judgment | 0 | — | 0 | Active |
| 真实环境验证 / Real-env Verification | 0 | — | 0 | Active |
| 跨 agent 采信 / Cross-agent Trust | 0 | — | 0 | Active |
| 人类将要犯的蠢 / Dumb things humans will do | 0 | — | 0 | Active |
| AI 将要犯的蠢 / Dumb things AI will do | 0 | — | 0 | Active |

## Cured Dimensions (4+ consecutive clean periods)

_None yet_

## Prevention Rules

_Auto-populated as errors are discovered_

## History

| Period | Date Range | New Errors | Notes |
|--------|------------|------------|-------|
```

3. Output the first-run message (see First-Run Output section below)

### Step 2 — Read error_log.md

Read `~/.claude/memory/error_log.md` and collect all entries from `Last Review Date` to today.

If the file is empty or has no entries in the review window, note that and proceed with zero counts.

If a session search tool (e.g. claude-mem) is also available, supplement with a search for:
```
correction mistake wrong error broken fix failed incorrect fabricated
```

If both the log file has no entries and no search tool is available, ask the user:
> "Can you briefly describe any mistakes or corrections from this review period? (Or say 'none' to skip.)"

### Step 3 — Classify each entry

Map each log entry or incident to one of the active dimensions:

| Dimension | Detection Criteria |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **数据准确性 / Data Accuracy** | Numbers, formulas, or values shown to user that don't match actual code; config values stated without checking the source |
| **环境安全 / Environment Safety** | Any change that broke login, corrupted `.env`, dropped DB connection, or altered environment in an unintended way |
| **预见性 / Foresight** | Problem only discovered after deploy: missing permissions, missing migrations, cache staleness, missing env vars |
| **用户视角 / User Perspective** | Feature works technically but user cannot complete the intended workflow from their account |
| **验证完整性 / Verification** | Claimed "fixed" or "done" without performing an end-to-end test; only checked status codes or build output |
| **记忆一致性 / Memory Consistency** | Asked user for information that was already recorded in memory or a previous session |
| **工具判断 / Tool Judgment** | Continued using a failing or unreliable tool instead of switching to a working alternative |
| **审查覆盖 / Review Completeness** | Items missed in a review or summary; user had to follow up on overlooked things |
| **操作精准 / Operational Precision** | A change produced unintended side effects on unrelated content or functionality |
| **先查后做 / Check Before Doing** | Used an unfamiliar tool, version, or API without checking documentation first |
| **简洁性 / Conciseness** | Wrote significantly more code than the problem required; over-engineered a simple fix |
| **回归意识 / Regression Awareness** | Fixing one bug introduced a new bug or broke existing behavior |
| **风格一致性 / Style Consistency** | New code does not follow the project's existing naming, formatting, or architecture conventions |
| **独立判断 / Independent Judgment** | Blindly executed a user instruction when the underlying premise was incorrect |
| **真实环境验证 / Real-env Verification** | Claimed a fix worked based on a sandbox / simplified test harness, but failed when hit by the exact production command string (extra escape layer, missing PATH, different stdin format) |
| **跨 agent 采信 / Cross-agent Trust** | Trusted another agent's "pass" report without independent re-verification; over-adopted a reviewer's suggestions that were over-engineering; under-challenged a reviewer's flagged issue that was actually wrong |
| **人类将要犯的蠢 / Dumb things humans will do** | Predictable user mistakes not yet made but worth guarding against |
| **AI 将要犯的蠢 / Dumb things AI will do** | Predictable AI failure modes not yet triggered but worth guarding against |

If an entry does not match any existing dimension, treat it as a new dimension (see Mechanism 4).

### Step 4 — Update the tracker

For each dimension:
- **Errors found this period**: increment Total, reset Clean Periods to 0, update Last Seen to today
- **No errors this period**: increment Clean Periods by 1
- **Clean Periods reaches 4**: move dimension row to "Cured Dimensions" section

Update:
- `Last Review Date` to today
- `Review Count` + 1
- `Total Lifetime Errors` + sum of new errors this period
- Add a row to the History table

Write all changes to disk before reporting.

### Step 5 — Output the report

Detect language from conversation context. Use the matching format:

## Mechanism 4 — Rule Accumulation and Self-Evolution

### New error type discovered

When an entry cannot be classified into any existing dimension:

1. Add a new row to the "Active Dimensions" table with:
   - A short descriptive name (bilingual if possible)
   - Total: 1, Last Seen: today, Clean Periods: 0, Status: Active

2. Add a new entry to the "Prevention Rules" section of the tracker:
   ```markdown
   ### {Dimension Name}
   - **What it is**: {one-sentence description}
   - **How to detect**: {observable signal}
   - **Prevention**: {specific check to add to Gate 1, 2, or 3}
   - **Added**: {today}
   - **Occurrences**: 1
   ```

3. Include in the report: `New dimension added: {name}`

### Repeat offense — rule strengthening

When any dimension records 3 or more total errors:

- Review the Prevention Rule for that dimension
- Add one specific, concrete check to the appropriate Gate in Mechanism 2
- Note the strengthening in the tracker's "Prevention Rules" section

### Cured status

When a dimension reaches 4 consecutive clean periods:

- Move the row from "Active Dimensions" to "Cured Dimensions"
- Add a note: `Cured after {N} total errors over {M} periods`
- The dimension's Gate check remains active — cured means the habit is formed, not that the check is removed

---

## Mechanism 5 — Confirmation Gate

Before taking any of the following actions, stop and ask the user to confirm intent. Do not proceed until confirmation is received.

**Requires confirmation:**
- Starting development of a new feature (not a bug fix or improvement to existing functionality)
- Any change to database schema, connection config, environment variables, or deployment pipeline
- Any action that publishes content to an external platform (social media, app stores, APIs, email campaigns)
- When the user raises a new idea or new direction mid-task that would change the current plan

**Confirmation format** (adapt to language):
> "Before I proceed — this looks like [new feature / DB change / external publish / new direction]. Can you confirm you want me to start on this now?"

**Does not require confirmation:**
- Bug fixes within the existing scope
- Refactoring or performance improvements with no behavior change
- Documentation updates
- Continuing work already confirmed in the same session

---

## Mechanism 6 — Auto Hooks

The following hooks should be configured in `~/.claude/settings.json` at install time. They enable passive capture without any user action.

> **Contract (important)**: Claude Code delivers hook context **through stdin as a JSON payload** — NOT through `$CLAUDE_TOOL_NAME`, `$CLAUDE_USER_PROMPT`, or any other environment variable. Earlier versions of this template used those env vars; they do not exist and produced empty log entries. Parse stdin JSON with `jq` (shell) or `json.load(sys.stdin)` (Python).

### Hook definitions

**PostToolUseFailure — log tool call failures**

Trigger: any tool call (Bash, Write, Edit, etc.) that fails.

Action: append to `~/.claude/memory/error_log.md`:
```
[{timestamp}] {CATEGORY} | {tool_name} | {error summary}
```
where `{CATEGORY}` is `BUILD_FAIL` for Bash, `FILE_FAIL` for Write/Edit, `TOOL_FAIL` otherwise.

Additionally, when the same tool fails **2 or more times within 5 minutes**, outputs a warning with a suggested alternative:
```
[no-no-debug] {tool_name} has failed {N} times in 5 minutes. Switch to {alternative}.
```
Alternatives: Grep/Glob → `find`+`grep -r` via Bash; Read → verify path with `ls` first; browser MCP tools → different browser tool or `curl`. History auto-cleans after 5 minutes.

**Gate 2 verification reminder — agent-enforced, not hook-enforced**

After any Edit or Write tool call that modifies a source file (not markdown, not config-only), the AI itself is responsible for running Gate 2 (Mechanism 2) before claiming the change is done. This is not shipped as a `PostToolUse` hook because an accurate implementation requires per-session state (has Gate 2 already been run for this file?) that a stateless shell hook cannot maintain reliably — a hook that fires on every single edit turns into noise that trains the AI to ignore it. Gate 2 lives in the AI's instructions; honour it there.

**UserPromptSubmit — detect corrections**

Trigger: user message contains a **second-person correction phrase** directed at the AI. Avoid generic substrings like bare `不对` / `错了` / `wrong` / `again` — they false-trigger on memory context, code, documentation, and injected system reminders that happen to contain the word.

Pattern list (tight, second-person only):
- Chinese: `你又错了`, `你错了`, `你搞错`, `你说错`, `不对啊`, `不对不对`, `这不对`, `这明显不对`, `不是这样`, `不是这个意思`, `不是这么`
- English (with ASCII-only word boundary lookarounds): `wrong again`, `that's wrong`, `that's not right`, `you already did/said`, `nope`

**Action**: append to `~/.claude/memory/error_log.md`:
```
[{timestamp}] USER_CORRECTION | {first 200 chars, XML blocks stripped}
```

**Implementation note**: the hook `command` string goes through JSON → shell → interpreter escaping. Rather than inlining regex in the shell command (fragile across escape layers), ship a small standalone script at `~/.claude/hooks/user_prompt_filter.py` and invoke it with one line. This skill's companion `hooks/` directory provides a reference implementation.

**UserPromptSubmit — review reminder**

Trigger: every user message (with 4-hour cooldown).

Action: read `~/.claude/memory/error_tracker.md` for `Last Review Date` and `review_frequency`. If the configured number of days (default: 3) has elapsed since the last review, output a one-line reminder:
```
[no-no-debug] Error review overdue ({N} days since last review on {date}). Run: error review
```

The AI sees this reminder in its hook context and automatically starts the Mechanism 3 review cycle. A cooldown file (`/tmp/.nnd_review_reminded`) prevents the reminder from firing on every message — it only re-fires after 4 hours of silence.

Without this hook, the "auto-trigger every 3 days" promise in Mechanism 3 has no enforcement mechanism and never fires.

### Settings.json format

Copy these hook blocks into your `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUseFailure": [
      {
        "matcher": "",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash $HOME/.claude/hooks/post_tool_failure.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "UserPromptSubmit": [
      {
        "matcher": "",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "python3 $HOME/.claude/hooks/user_prompt_filter.py 2>/dev/null"
          },
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "python3 $HOME/.claude/hooks/review_reminder.py 2>/dev/null"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

All three scripts live in this skill's `hooks/` directory — copy them to `~/.claude/hooks/` on install:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/hooks
cp hooks/user_prompt_filter.py ~/.claude/hooks/
cp hooks/post_tool_failure.sh ~/.claude/hooks/
cp hooks/review_reminder.py ~/.claude/hooks/
chmod +x ~/.claude/hooks/post_tool_failure.sh
```

The scripts read the stdin JSON payload directly, extract the real fields, strip XML-style system-reminder blocks from user prompts (so past-work context can't false-trigger), and fail silent on any error so a broken hook never disrupts the user's session.

## Constraints

- Never fabricate log entries or session history — if the log is empty and no search tool is available, ask the user
- Report every active dimension in the review, even those with zero new errors this period
- The review process must not itself commit the errors it tracks
- Applies to all projects and languages, not just the current one
- If a memory/search tool is unavailable, fall back to reading error_log.md directly
- Always write tracker changes to disk before outputting the report
- Never skip Mechanism 5 for new features or deployment actions, even when the user seems to be in a hurry
- Real-time logging (Mechanism 1) must be fast and non-blocking — a single append, never a read-modify-write of the whole file
- Do not log noise: only log genuine failures or genuine corrections, not routine tool calls
