# Codebase exploration

Performs thorough, structured codebase exploration to build deep understanding before coding work begins.

---

## Scope

**Covers:**
- Exploring project structure, architecture, and directory layout
- Tracing execution paths from entry points through core logic
- Mapping import dependencies and identifying central components
- Enumerating public API surfaces and CLI commands
- Discovering configuration mechanisms (pyproject.toml, env vars, config files)
- Mapping test coverage to source modules
- Producing a structured summary of findings

**Does not cover:**
- Modifying code or configuration files
- Applying coding conventions (see `/python-style`)
- Writing commit messages (see `/commit`)
- Creating or modifying skill files (see `/skill-design`)

---

## Workflow

You MUST follow these steps when this skill is invoked.

### Step 1: Determine project size

Quickly assess the project to select the appropriate exploration tier. Run a file count and directory
listing to make this determination before proceeding.

| Tier   | Indicators                                                    | Approach                      |
|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Small  | Single package, < 10 source files, no subpackages             | Single-pass exploration       |
| Medium | Multiple packages or 10-50 source files                       | Structured four-phase         |
| Large  | Monorepo, 50+ source files, multiple entry points, MCP server | Parallel subagent exploration |

### Step 2: Execute exploration

Follow the approach for the determined tier.

**Small projects:** Execute all four exploration phases yourself in a single pass. Combine phases
where appropriate to keep exploration concise.

**Medium projects:** Execute all four exploration phases sequentially, giving each phase focused
attention. Use the Task tool with `subagent_type: Explore` for any phase that requires reading
many files.

**Large projects:** Launch 2-3 Explore subagents in parallel using the Task tool with
`subagent_type: Explore`. Assign each subagent a different focus area:

- **Subagent 1: Structure and entry points** — Phase 1 (feature discovery) and Phase 4
  (configuration and test coverage)
- **Subagent 2: Architecture and dependencies** — Phase 2 (code flow tracing) and Phase 3
  (architecture analysis including import mapping and central component identification)
- **Subagent 3: API surface and quality** — Public API enumeration, error handling patterns,
  technical debt indicators

Synthesize the subagent findings into a unified summary.

### Step 3: Present findings

Present the structured summary following the output format below. Do NOT make code changes during
exploration. Wait for user direction before proceeding.

## Exploration phases

Every exploration follows four phases regardless of project size. For small projects, phases may be
combined. For large projects, phases may be distributed across parallel subagents.

### Phase 1: Feature discovery

Identify the project's entry points, boundaries, and configuration.

1. **Entry points** — CLI commands, API endpoints, main functions, GUI entry points. Check
   `pyproject.toml` for `[project.scripts]` and `[project.entry-points]` sections.
2. **Configuration mechanisms** — `pyproject.toml` settings, environment variables, CLI argument
   defaults, YAML/JSON/TOML config files, `.env` files, and dataclass-based configuration objects.
3. **Public API surface** — Classes, functions, and constants exported from `__init__.py` files.
   Note which modules use `__all__` to restrict exports.
4. **CLI command signatures** — For CLI-based projects, document each command's name, arguments,
   options, and purpose.

### Phase 2: Code flow tracing

Trace execution paths from entry points through the codebase layers.

1. **Call chain tracing** — Starting from each entry point identified in Phase 1, follow the call
   chain through to core logic. Document the path as a sequence of `file:function` references.
2. **Data transformations** — At each step in the call chain, note what data is passed, transformed,
   or returned.
3. **Layer identification** — Identify the abstraction layers the call chain passes through
   (e.g., CLI → validation → business logic → data access → output).
4. **Side effects** — Note where the code interacts with external systems (file I/O, network calls,
   subprocess invocations, environment variable reads).

### Phase 3: Architecture analysis

Analyze the structural relationships between components.

1. **Import/dependency mapping** — For each source module, identify what it imports from other
   project modules. Note the direction of dependencies (which modules depend on which).
2. **Central component identification** — Identify which files or classes are imported by the most
   other modules. These are the architecturally central components that changes will most likely
   ripple through.
3. **Design patterns** — Identify patterns in use (dataclasses, protocols, factories, decorators,
   context managers, abstract base classes, etc.).
4. **Cross-cutting concerns** — Note how logging, error handling, configuration, and validation are
   handled across the codebase.

### Phase 4: Implementation details

Examine specifics that inform future modifications.

1. **Test coverage mapping** — For each source module, identify the corresponding test file(s). Note
   any source modules that lack test coverage.
2. **Key algorithms and data structures** — Document non-trivial algorithms, important data
   structures (dataclasses, TypedDicts, NamedTuples), and their locations.
3. **Error handling patterns** — How errors are raised, caught, and reported to the user. Note
   whether the project uses custom exception classes, logging, or a console utility.
4. **Technical debt and complexity** — Areas with high complexity, TODO/FIXME comments, known
   limitations, type: ignore suppressions, or noqa markers.

### Example output

```markdown
## Project purpose

Provides a reimplemented suite2p library for neural imaging analysis with multi-day cell tracking
capabilities for the Sun Lab at Cornell University.

## Entry points and CLI commands

| Entry Point     | Location                  | Description                              |
|-----------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `sl-suite2p`    | pyproject.toml scripts    | Main CLI entry point                     |
| `run`           | cli.py:run                | Executes single-day processing pipeline  |
| `run-multiday`  | cli.py:run_multiday       | Executes multi-day tracking pipeline     |
| `mcp`           | cli.py:mcp                | Starts the MCP server                    |

## Key components

| Component          | Location                       | Purpose                                           |
|--------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Pipeline           | src/sl_suite2p/pipeline.py     | Main single-day processing pipeline orchestration |
| Multi-day Tracking | src/sl_suite2p/multiday/       | Cross-session cell tracking and alignment         |
| Registration       | src/sl_suite2p/registration/   | Image registration and motion correction          |
| Detection          | src/sl_suite2p/detection/      | Cell detection algorithms                         |
| Configuration      | src/sl_suite2p/configuration/  | Pipeline configuration management                 |
| MCP Server         | src/sl_suite2p/mcp/            | AI agent integration via MCP                      |

## Call chain summary

`sl-suite2p run` → `cli.py:run` → `pipeline.py:run_pipeline` → `registration/register.py:register`
→ `detection/detect.py:detect_cells` → `extraction/extract.py:extract_signals`
→ `classification/classify.py:classify_cells` → writes output to `suite2p/` directory.

## Import dependency map

Central components (imported by 5+ modules):
- `configuration/pipeline_config.py` — imported by pipeline, registration, detection, extraction
- `utils/io.py` — imported by all processing modules
- `types.py` — imported by all modules for shared type definitions

Dependency direction: cli → pipeline → processing modules → utils/io + configuration.

## Public API surface

Exported from `__init__.py` via `__all__`:
- `run_pipeline(config: PipelineConfig) -> PipelineResult`
- `PipelineConfig` (dataclass)
- `PipelineResult` (dataclass)

## Configuration

| Mechanism       | Location                        | Purpose                              |
|-----------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `PipelineConfig`| configuration/pipeline_config.py| Dataclass with all pipeline settings |
| CLI arguments   | cli.py                          | Override config values at runtime    |
| YAML config     | User-provided path              | Full pipeline configuration file     |

## Test coverage

| Source Module                | Test File                          | Coverage |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------|----------|
| pipeline.py                  | tests/test_pipeline.py             | Yes      |
| registration/register.py     | tests/test_registration.py         | Yes      |
| detection/detect.py          | tests/test_detection.py            | Yes      |
| mcp/server.py                | (none)                             | Gap      |

## Notable patterns

- Numba-accelerated computation for image processing
- Configuration dataclasses with validation
- MyPy strict mode with full type annotations
- Processing modules follow a consistent register → detect → extract → classify pipeline

## Areas of concern

- `mcp/server.py` lacks test coverage
- Large refactoring effort from original suite2p codebase still in progress
- Multi-day tracking module has high cyclomatic complexity
- Several `# type: ignore` suppressions in registration module
```

## Proactive behavior

Invoke at session start to ensure full context before making changes. Prevents blind modifications
and ensures understanding of existing patterns. When the project has ataraxis dependencies
(check `pyproject.toml`), also invoke `/explore-dependencies` to build a live API
snapshot of each dependency.

Do NOT make code changes during exploration. Present findings and wait for user direction.
