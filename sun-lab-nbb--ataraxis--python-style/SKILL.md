# Python code style guide

Applies Python coding conventions.

You MUST read this skill and load the relevant reference files before writing or modifying Python
code. You MUST verify your changes against the checklist before submitting.

---

## Scope

**Covers:**
- Python code style (docstrings, type annotations, naming, formatting, error handling)
- Ataraxis library usage preferences (console, timing, data structures)
- File organization, import conventions, and module structure
- Click CLI conventions
- Enum, dataclass, and class design patterns
- Test file conventions

**Does not cover:**
- README file conventions (invoke `/readme-style`)
- Commit message conventions (invoke `/commit`)
- Skill file and CLAUDE.md conventions (invoke `/skill-design`)
- Codebase exploration workflows (invoke `/explore-codebase`)

---

## Workflow

You MUST follow these steps when this skill is invoked.

### Step 1: Read this skill

Read this entire file. The core conventions below apply to ALL Python code.

### Step 2: Load relevant reference files

Based on the task, load the appropriate reference files:

| Task                                     | Reference to load                                             |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Writing or modifying docstrings/types    | [docstrings-and-types.md](references/docstrings-and-types.md) |
| Writing classes, dataclasses, or enums   | [class-patterns.md](references/class-patterns.md)             |
| Using ataraxis libs, Numba, Click, tests | [libraries-and-tools.md](references/libraries-and-tools.md)   |
| Using ataraxis library features          | Invoke `/explore-dependencies` first, then load above         |
| Reviewing code before submission         | [anti-patterns.md](references/anti-patterns.md)               |

Load multiple references when the task spans multiple domains.

### Step 3: Apply conventions

Write or modify Python code following all conventions from this file and the loaded references.

### Step 4: Verify compliance

Complete the verification checklist at the end of this file. Every item must pass before
submitting work. For anti-pattern examples, load
[anti-patterns.md](references/anti-patterns.md).

---

## Cross-language consistency

Projects span Python, C++, and C#. These conventions maximize visual and structural
consistency across languages while respecting each language's idiomatic standards.

**Shared across all languages:**
- 120 character line limit
- 4-space indentation (no tabs)
- Comprehensive documentation on ALL public and private members
- Third-person imperative mood for documentation ("Provides...", "Determines whether...")
- Private members use underscore prefix (`_snake_case` in Python and C++, `_camelCase` in C#)
- Full words in identifiers (no abbreviations)
- Guard clauses preferred over deep nesting
- Prose over bullet lists in documentation
- No example/code blocks in documentation (they go stale)
- I/O operations separated from processing logic

**Python-specific divergences from C++:**
- Functions and methods use snake_case (not PascalCase as in C++)
- Constants use `_UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` (not `kPascalCase` as in C++)
- Enum values use `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` (not `kPascalCase` as in C++)
- Documentation uses Google-style docstrings (not Doxygen `@tags`)
- Error handling uses `console.error()` or `raise` (not status codes)
- Brace style is not applicable (Python uses indentation)

**Python-specific divergences from C#:**
- Functions and methods use snake_case (not PascalCase as in C#)
- Constants use `_UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` (not PascalCase as in C#)
- Enum values use `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` (not PascalCase as in C#)
- Documentation uses Google-style docstrings (not XML `<summary>` tags)
- Private members use `_snake_case` (not `_camelCase` as in C#)
- Public fields use snake_case (not camelCase as in C#)

---

## Naming conventions

### Variables

Use **full words**, not abbreviations:

| Avoid             | Prefer                              |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `t`, `t_sq`       | `interpolation_factor`, `t_squared` |
| `coeff`, `coeffs` | `coefficient`, `coefficients`       |
| `pos`, `idx`      | `position`, `index`                 |
| `img`, `val`      | `image`, `value`                    |

### Functions

- Use descriptive verb phrases: `compute_coefficients`, `extract_features`
- Private functions start with underscore: `_process_batch`, `_validate_input`
- Avoid generic names like `process`, `handle`, `do_something`

### Constants

Module-level constants with type annotations, descriptive names, and inline docstrings:

```python
_MINIMUM_SAMPLE_COUNT: int = 100
"""Minimum number of samples required for statistical validity."""
```

---

## Function calls

**Always use keyword arguments** for clarity:

```python
# Good
np.zeros((4,), dtype=np.float32)
compute_coefficients(interpolation_factor=t, output=result)

# Avoid
np.zeros((4,), np.float32)
compute_coefficients(t, result)
```

Exceptions:
- Single positional arguments for obvious cases like `range(4)`, `len(array)`.
- Numba `jitclass` method calls, which do not support keyword arguments. Use positional
  arguments for these calls and add a brief inline comment if the call is not self-explanatory.
  Note: standard `@njit` / `@jit` functions do support keyword arguments and are not exempt
  from this rule.

---

## Error handling

In projects that depend on `ataraxis-base-utilities`, use `console.error` for error reporting:

```python
from ataraxis_base_utilities import console

def process_data(self, data: NDArray[np.float32], threshold: float) -> None:
    if not (0 < threshold <= 1):
        message = (
            f"Unable to process data with the given threshold. The threshold must be in range "
            f"(0, 1], but got {threshold}."
        )
        console.error(message=message, error=ValueError)
```

In projects that do not depend on `ataraxis-base-utilities`, use standard `raise` with the same
message format.

### Error message format

- Start with context: "Unable to [action] using [input]."
- Explain the constraint: "The [parameter] must be [constraint]"
- Show actual value: "but got {value}."
- Use f-strings for interpolation
- Always assign the message to a `message` variable before passing to `console.error()` or `raise`

---

## Comments

### Inline comments

- Use third person imperative ("Configures..." not "This section configures...")
- Place above the code, not at end of line (unless very short)
- Use comments to explain non-obvious logic or provide context

```python
# The constant 2.046392675 is the theoretical injectivity bound for 2D cubic B-splines.
limit = (1.0 / 2.046392675) * self._grid_sampling * factor
```

### What to avoid

- Don't reiterate the obvious (e.g., `# Set x to 5` before `x = 5`)
- Don't add docstrings/comments to code you didn't write or modify
- Don't add type annotations as comments (use actual type hints)
- Don't use heavy section separator blocks (e.g., `# ======` or `# ------`)

---

## Imports

- All imports must be at the **top of the file**. Deferred or inline imports are not allowed.
- Import sorting and grouping is enforced by **ruff**. Do not manually reorder imports.

### Local import rules

All local (within-library) imports must directly import the required names:

```python
# Good - import specific names
from .spline_grid import SplineGrid
from .deformation import Deformation, zoom, diffuse

# Bad - importing the module itself
from . import spline_grid
```

### Cross-package vs within-package imports

**Cross-package imports** must go through the package's `__init__.py`:

```python
# Good - imports from the package's __init__.py
from ..configuration import RuntimeContext, SingleDayConfiguration

# Bad - imports directly from a submodule in another package
from ..configuration.single_day import RuntimeContext, SingleDayConfiguration
```

**Within-package imports** use direct module imports:

```python
from .spline_grid import SplineGrid
```

---

## \_\_init\_\_.py conventions

There are two types of `__init__.py` files with different docstring requirements.

### Top-level library \_\_init\_\_.py

The top-level `__init__.py` (e.g., `src/library_name/__init__.py`) uses an extended docstring with
documentation links and authors:

```python
"""Provides assets for processing and analyzing neural imaging data.

See the `documentation <https://project-api-docs.netlify.app/>`_ for the description of
available assets. See the `source code repository <https://github.com/Sun-Lab-NBB/project-name>`_
for more details.

Authors: Author Name (Handle)
"""

from .module_one import ClassOne, function_one
from .module_two import ClassTwo, ClassThree

# console.enable() belongs only in top-level application libraries (e.g., sl-experiment).
# Component libraries must NOT enable console — the application entry point handles this.

__all__ = [
    "ClassOne",
    "ClassThree",
    "ClassTwo",
    "function_one",
]
```

### Subpackage \_\_init\_\_.py

Subpackage `__init__.py` files (e.g., `src/library_name/subpackage/__init__.py`) use a single-line
docstring only:

```python
"""Provides configuration and runtime data classes for the processing pipeline."""

from .config import Config, Settings
from .data import DataStore

__all__ = [
    "Config",
    "DataStore",
    "Settings",
]
```

### Rules

- **Top-level docstring**: The first line MUST be the bare project description — the same sentence
  used in all other canonical description locations (`pyproject.toml`, `welcome.rst`, `README.md`)
  with no language or project name prefix. Include documentation link, source repository link,
  and authors. Email addresses in the `Authors:` line are optional and omitted by default
- **Subpackage docstring**: Use a single-line docstring describing what the subpackage provides.
  Do NOT include documentation links, source repository links, or authors — these belong only in
  the top-level library `__init__.py`
- **Console initialization**: `console.enable()` belongs only in top-level application libraries
  that serve as the final entry point (e.g., `sl-experiment`). Component and dependency libraries
  (e.g., `ataraxis-video-system`) must NOT call `console.enable()` — the top-level application
  is responsible for enabling the console before any component library code runs
- **Explicit `__all__`**: Every `__init__.py` must declare `__all__` with all public API members
- **Alphabetical sorting**: Sort `__all__` entries alphabetically
- **One-time configuration logic**: `__init__.py` files may contain logic that benefits from
  being executed exactly once on import (e.g., setting the multiprocessing start method,
  configuring environment variables for platform compatibility). Beyond that, `__init__.py` files
  should contain only imports and `__all__`

---

## File-level ordering

All definitions within a file follow this vertical ordering from top to bottom:

1. **Module docstring**
2. **Imports**
3. **Constants** (module-level `_UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` values)
4. **Enumerations and dataclasses** (type definitions that other code depends on)
5. **Public functions and classes** (no prefix)
6. **Private functions and classes** (`_` prefixed)

### Visibility ordering

Public definitions appear **above** private definitions. This matches the C-family convention
used across all projects (C#, C++), where the public API is presented first and
implementation details follow. Readers see the interface before the helpers that support it.

### Call-hierarchy ordering

Within each visibility group, definitions should **loosely follow the order in which they are
called** during the library's runtime. When there is no clear call hierarchy, group definitions
**by purpose**.

### Enumerations and dataclasses first

Enumerations and dataclasses define the types that worker functions and classes operate on. They
must appear **above** the functions and classes that use them.

**Exception — dataclass-only modules**: In files whose primary product is the dataclasses
themselves, the order is: enumerations first, then public helper functions, then private helper
functions, then dataclasses at the bottom.

---

## Boolean expressions

Use truthiness checks instead of explicit comparisons to `True` or `False`:

```python
# Good - truthiness
if not self._is_enabled:
    return
if items:
    process(items=items)
if not file_list:
    console.error(message="No files found.", error=FileNotFoundError)

# Avoid - explicit boolean comparison
if self._is_enabled == True:   # Wrong
if self._is_enabled is True:   # Wrong
if len(items) > 0:             # Wrong - use truthiness instead
```

**Exception**: Always use `is None` / `is not None` for None checks, never truthiness:

```python
# Good - explicit None check
if self._data is not None:
    process(data=self._data)
```

---

## Guard clauses

Prefer early returns (guard clauses) over deeply nested conditionals:

```python
# Good - guard clauses reduce nesting
def process_session(self, data: NDArray[np.float32], threshold: float) -> NDArray[np.float32]:
    """Processes session data with the given threshold."""
    if not self._is_enabled:
        return data

    if data.size == 0:
        message = "Unable to process session data. The data array is empty."
        console.error(message=message, error=ValueError)

    # Main logic at minimal indentation level.
    filtered = data[data > threshold]
    return filtered
```

---

## Blank lines

- **Two blank lines** between top-level definitions (classes, functions)
- **One blank line** between method definitions within a class
- **No blank line** after a `def` line before the docstring
- **One blank line** after import blocks before code

---

## Line length and formatting

- Maximum line length: **120 characters**
- Break long function calls across multiple lines with trailing commas
- Use parentheses for multi-line strings in error messages

### String formatting

- **F-strings only**: Always use f-strings for string interpolation. No `%` formatting or
  `.format()`.
- **F-string consistency**: When any line requires interpolation, use the `f` prefix on **all**
  lines of the multi-line string.
- **Double quotes**: All strings must use double quotes (enforced by ruff). Single quotes are
  only acceptable inside f-string expressions.

### Trailing commas

- Always use trailing commas when the closing bracket is on a separate line
- Do not use trailing commas when everything is on one line

### Pathlib

Use `pathlib.Path` for all path manipulation instead of string operations:

```python
config_path = Path(base_directory) / "config" / "settings.yaml"
```

## Proactive behavior

When reviewing or modifying code, proactively check for style violations and fix them. When
writing new code, apply all conventions from this skill and its references without being asked.
If you notice existing code near your changes that violates conventions, mention it to the user
but do not fix it unless asked.

## Verification checklist

**You MUST verify your edits against this checklist before submitting any changes to Python
files.**

```text
Python Style Compliance:
- [ ] Google-style docstrings on all public and private members
- [ ] Docstring section order: Summary -> Extended Description -> Notes -> Args -> Returns -> Raises
- [ ] No Examples sections or in-code examples in docstrings
- [ ] Imperative mood in summaries ("Processes..." not "This method processes...")
- [ ] Prose used instead of bullet lists in docstrings
- [ ] No Sphinx specifiers (:class:, :func:, :meth:, :data:) outside MCP tool docstrings
- [ ] All parameters and returns have type annotations
- [ ] NumPy arrays specify dtype explicitly (NDArray[np.float32])
- [ ] Type aliases use PEP 695 `type` statement syntax
- [ ] Full words used (no abbreviations like `pos`, `idx`, `val`)
- [ ] Private members use `_underscore` prefix
- [ ] Keyword arguments used for function calls (except Numba `jitclass` method calls)

- [ ] Lines under 120 characters
- [ ] All imports at top of file (no deferred or inline imports)
- [ ] Import sorting delegated to ruff (do not manually reorder)
- [ ] Local imports use direct name imports (no module imports)
- [ ] Cross-package imports go through package __init__.py (not submodules)
- [ ] __init__.py files have __all__ (alphabetically sorted)
- [ ] Top-level library __init__.py has extended docstring (description, docs link, repo link, authors)
- [ ] Subpackage __init__.py files have single-line docstrings only (no links or authors)
- [ ] console.enable() only in top-level application libraries, not component libraries
- [ ] Public definitions above private definitions in file
- [ ] Enums and dataclasses above worker functions and classes
- [ ] Definitions ordered by call hierarchy or grouped by purpose
- [ ] Inline comments use third person imperative
- [ ] No heavy section separator blocks (# ====== or # ------)
- [ ] Numba functions use cache=True
- [ ] Decorator stacking order: @staticmethod/@classmethod, @njit, custom, @property
- [ ] Dataclasses use frozen=True for immutable configs (omit for mutable state)
- [ ] Dataclasses use slots=True by default (omit for YamlConfig subclasses or classes needing __dict__)
- [ ] Enum members have inline docstrings; StrEnum for strings, IntEnum for codes
- [ ] __repr__ uses ClassName(key=value) format; no __str__
- [ ] Boolean checks use truthiness (not == True); None checks use `is None`

- [ ] Console output uses console.echo() instead of print(); raw=True for pre-formatted content
- [ ] Error handling uses console.error() instead of raise (when ataraxis-base-utilities available)
- [ ] console.enable() absent in component libraries (only top-level application libraries enable it)
