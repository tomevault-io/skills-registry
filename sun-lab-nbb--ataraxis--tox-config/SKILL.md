# tox.ini style guide

Applies conventions for tox.ini configuration files that drive the development automation
pipeline.

You MUST read this skill before creating or modifying any tox.ini file. You MUST verify your
changes against the checklist before submitting.

---

## Scope

**Covers:**
- `[tox]` section structure and `requires` conventions
- Envlist ordering and patterns for each project archetype
- Environment definitions (lint, stubs, test, coverage, docs, build, upload, install, uninstall,
  create, remove, provision, export, import)
- Mamba + uv + tox toolchain architecture and how the three tools interact
- Dependency installation strategies (`dependency_groups`, `deps`, `skip_install`)
- Environment naming conventions (`{abbr}_dev`)
- Python version parameterization in test environments
- C++ extension and C++ docs-only variations
- The self-hosting exception for ataraxis-automation itself

**Does not cover:**
- pyproject.toml dependency specifications (see `/pyproject-style`)
- Sphinx documentation configuration inside `docs/` (see `/api-docs`)
- Project directory structure (see `/project-layout`)
- Python code style or test code conventions (see `/python-style`)

---

## Workflow

You MUST follow these steps when this skill is invoked.

### Step 1: Identify the project archetype

Determine which pipeline applies:

| Archetype      | Envlist pattern                                                              | Key indicator                       |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Full Python    | uninstall → export → lint → stubs → test → coverage → docs → build → install | `pyproject.toml` + `src/` layout    |
| C++ extension  | Same as full Python, with Doxygen in docs and cibuildwheel in build          | `CMakeLists.txt` + `pyproject.toml` |
| Reduced Python | Full Python minus test and coverage                                          | `sl-*` app with no unit tests       |
| C++ docs-only  | docs only                                                                    | `platformio.ini`, no `pyproject`    |

### Step 2: Load reference templates

Read [environment-templates.md](references/environment-templates.md) for the complete environment
definitions matching the identified archetype.

### Step 3: Determine parameterization

Collect the project-specific values:

| Parameter          | Source                                | Example                   |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| `{package_name}`   | Package directory name under `src/`   | `ataraxis_base_utilities` |
| `{env_abbr}`       | Short project abbreviation            | `axbu`                    |
| `{version}`        | Current ataraxis-automation release   | `7.1.0`                   |
| Python versions    | `requires-python` in `pyproject.toml` | `py312, py313, py314`     |
| `basepython`       | Earliest supported Python version     | `py312`                   |
| `--python-version` | Latest supported Python version       | `3.14`                    |

### Step 4: Apply conventions

Write or modify the tox.ini following all conventions from this file and the loaded templates.

### Step 5: Verify compliance

## Toolchain architecture

Projects use three tools together. Understanding their roles is essential for correct
tox.ini configuration.

### mamba (environment lifecycle)

Mamba creates and manages persistent conda environments that serve as the development workspace.
Each project has one named environment per OS (e.g., `axbu_dev_lin`, `axbu_dev_osx`,
`axbu_dev_win`). Mamba commands are issued through `automation-cli` and handle:
- Creating bare environments with Python + uv + tox + tox-uv
- Removing, exporting, and importing environments
- The `--use-uv` flag is passed to mamba for uv-accelerated operations

### uv (package installation)

uv replaces pip for all package installation operations. It is used in two contexts:
- **Inside mamba environments**: `automation-cli` calls `uv pip install` to install all project
  dependencies (runtime + dev) from `pyproject.toml` into the mamba environment.
- **Inside tox environments**: The `tox-uv` plugin makes tox use uv as its backend for creating
  isolated test environments, replacing pip with uv for speed.

### tox (task orchestration)

Tox orchestrates the development pipeline. Each tox environment is an **isolated virtual
environment** separate from the mamba environment. Running `tox` (no arguments) executes the
full `envlist` pipeline. Running `tox -e <name>` executes a single environment.

**Critical distinction:** Tox environments (lint, test, docs, etc.) are ephemeral and isolated.
The mamba environment is persistent. The `automation-cli` commands bridge the two worlds — tox
environments like `create`, `install`, and `export` call `automation-cli` to manipulate the
persistent mamba environment.

---

## `[tox]` section conventions

Every tox.ini starts with the `[tox]` section:

```ini
[tox]
requires =
    tox>=4,<5
    tox-uv>=1,<2
envlist =
    uninstall
    export
    lint
    stubs
    {py312, py313, py314}-test
    coverage
    docs
    build
    install

isolated_build = True
```

### Rules

- `requires` MUST include `tox>=4,<5` and `tox-uv>=1,<2`.
- `isolated_build = True` MUST always be set.
- `envlist` defines the full pipeline order. Running bare `tox` executes all listed environments
  sequentially. The order matters — `uninstall` runs first to ensure a clean state, `install`
  runs last after all checks pass.
- Environment management environments (`create`, `remove`, `provision`, `import`) are defined
  in the file but NOT included in `envlist` because they are invoked manually.

---

## Dependency installation patterns

### `dependency_groups = dev` (modern convention)

Tox 4.22+ supports PEP 735 dependency groups natively. This is the preferred approach for new
and modernized projects:

```ini
[testenv: lint]
dependency_groups = dev
```

This reads from `[dependency-groups].dev` in `pyproject.toml` and installs those packages before
the project itself. Use this for environments that need the project installed along with its dev
tools (lint, stubs, test).

### `extras = dev` (legacy convention)

Older projects use optional dependencies instead:

```ini
[testenv: lint]
extras = dev
```

This reads from `[project.optional-dependencies].dev` in `pyproject.toml`. This pattern is being
phased out in favor of `dependency_groups` as projects modernize.

### `deps = ataraxis-automation=={version}` (utility environments)

Environments that do NOT need the project installed — only the automation tools — use `deps`
with a pinned ataraxis-automation version:

```ini
[testenv:coverage]
skip_install = true
deps = ataraxis-automation==7.1.0
```

This pattern applies to: `coverage`, `docs`, `build`, `upload`, `install`, `uninstall`, `create`,
`remove`, `provision`, `export`, `import`.

### Self-hosting exception

The ataraxis-automation project itself does NOT use `deps = ataraxis-automation==X.Y.Z` because
it IS ataraxis-automation. Its utility environments omit `skip_install` and `deps`, relying on
the project's own installed tools instead.

---

## Envlist patterns by archetype

### Full Python pipeline

Used by core libraries (`ataraxis-*`) with multi-version testing:

```ini
envlist =
    uninstall
    export
    lint
    stubs
    {py312, py313, py314}-test
    coverage
    docs
    build
    install
```

### Reduced Python pipeline

Used by application projects (`sl-*`) that do not have unit tests:

```ini
envlist =
    uninstall
    export
    lint
    stubs
    docs
    build
    install
```

### C++ docs-only pipeline

Used by PlatformIO projects (both libraries and firmware):

```ini
envlist = docs
```

---

## Environment conventions

### lint

- `basepython` MUST be set to the earliest supported Python version.
- Runs `automation-cli purge-stubs` first to remove stubs that interfere with mypy.
- Command order: `ruff format` → `ruff check --fix ./src` → `mypy ./src`.
- Uses `dependency_groups = dev` (or `extras = dev` in legacy projects).

### stubs

- `depends = lint` — stubs are generated only after linting passes.
- Runs `stubgen` with `--include-private` and `-p {package_name}`.
- After stub generation: `ruff format` → `ruff check --select I --fix ./src` to clean up stubs.

### test

- Uses parameterized names: `{py312, py313, py314}-test`.
- `package = wheel` forces a wheel build before testing.
- `setenv = COVERAGE_FILE = reports{/}.coverage.{envname}` writes per-version coverage data.
- Runs pytest with `--cov`, `--cov-config=pyproject.toml`, `-n logical`, `--dist loadgroup`.

### coverage

- `skip_install = true` — only needs coverage tools, not the project.
- `depends` MUST list the same Python version matrix as the test environment.
- Merges junit XML reports, combines coverage data, generates XML and HTML reports.

### docs

- `depends = uninstall` — ensures a clean state.
- C++ and hybrid projects add `allowlist_externals = doxygen` and run `doxygen Doxyfile` before
  `sphinx-build`.
- Sphinx command MUST use `-j auto -v` flags.

### build

- `skip_install = true` — builds from source, not from installed package.
- Standard projects: `python -m build . --sdist` + `python -m build . --wheel`.
- C++ extension projects: `python -m build . --sdist` + `cibuildwheel --output-dir dist
  --platform auto`.
- `allowlist_externals = docker` for container-based builds.

### upload

- `skip_install = true`.
- `allowlist_externals = distutils`.
- Accepts `{posargs:}` for passing `--replace-token` to `automation-cli acquire-pypi-token`.

### Environment management (install, uninstall, create, remove, provision, export, import)

- All use `skip_install = true` and `deps = ataraxis-automation=={version}`.
- All call `automation-cli` subcommands with `--environment-name {env_abbr}_dev`.
- `create` and `provision` also pass `--python-version` set to the latest supported version.
- `create`, `provision`, and `install` accept `{posargs:}` to allow passing additional flags at
  invocation time (e.g., `--prerelease` to enable prerelease package installation).
- `export` has `depends = uninstall`.
- `install` has `depends` listing the full pipeline (lint, stubs, test, coverage, docs, export).
- These environments are defined in the file but NOT included in `envlist` (except `install`,
  `uninstall`, and `export`).

---

## Environment naming conventions

Each project has a short abbreviation used for its mamba environment name:

| Pattern      | Abbreviation rule            | Example                            |
|--------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `ataraxis-*` | Initials of hyphenated parts | `ataraxis-base-utilities` → `axbu` |
| `sl-*`       | Initials of hyphenated parts | `sl-shared-assets` → `slsa`        |

The full environment name follows the pattern `{abbr}_dev` (e.g., `axbu_dev`). The OS suffix
(`_lin`, `_osx`, `_win`) is appended automatically by `automation-cli` at runtime — it does NOT
appear in tox.ini.

---

## Python version matrix

The test environment Python version matrix MUST match the `requires-python` range in
`pyproject.toml`:

| Project type | `requires-python` | Test matrix                  | `basepython` | `--python-version` |
|--------------|-------------------|------------------------------|--------------|--------------------|
| Core library | `>=3.12,<3.15`    | `{py312, py313, py314}-test` | `py312`      | `3.14`             |
| Application  | `>=3.14,<3.15`    | `{py314}-test`               | `py314`      | `3.14`             |

- `basepython` is set to the **earliest** supported version (controls lint/mypy ruleset).
- `--python-version` in `create`/`provision` is set to the **latest** supported version.

---

## Comment conventions

### Block comments

Use block comments above the `[tox]` section and before environments that need explanation:

```ini
# This file provides configurations for tox-based project development and management automation
# tasks.
```

### Description fields

Every environment MUST have a `description` field. Use multi-line format for descriptions longer
than 120 characters:

```ini
[testenv: lint]
description =
    Runs static code formatting, style, and typing checkers. Follows the configuration defined
    in the pyproject.toml file.
```

### Inline comments

Use inline comments sparingly, only when a setting is non-obvious:

```ini
basepython = py312  # Earliest supported version controls lint/mypy ruleset
```

## Proactive behavior

You should proactively offer to invoke this skill when:
- Creating a new project that needs a tox.ini
- The user asks about running tox, development automation, or the mamba/uv/tox toolchain
- Adding a new tox environment or modifying an existing pipeline
- Upgrading the ataraxis-automation version pin across downstream projects

---
