# Dex Task Tracking

Track async work: coding agent dispatches, multi-step projects, anything needing follow-up.

## Commands
```bash
dex create -d "Description" --context "Background, goal, done-when"
dex list                    # Pending tasks
dex list --all              # Include completed
dex show <id>               # View task
dex show <id> --full        # Full context
dex complete <id> --result "What was done, decisions, follow-ups"
dex edit <id> --context "Updated context"
dex delete <id>
```

## Task Structure
- **Description**: One-line summary
- **Context**: Background, requirements, done criteria
- **Result**: What was built, decisions, follow-ups

## Example
```bash
# Before dispatching agent
dex create -d "Add caching to API" --context "Workspace: feat1 (100.x.x.x)
Branch: feat/cache
Done when: PR merged, CI green"

# After work complete
dex complete abc123 --result "Merged PR #50. Redis caching with 5min TTL."
```

## Storage
`.dex/tasks/{id}.json` — one file per task, git-friendly.
