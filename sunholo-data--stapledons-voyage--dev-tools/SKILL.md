# Dev Tools

CLI development tools for Stapledons Voyage game. Provides performance benchmarks, world inspection, asset validation, and simulation stress testing.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Build CLI first
make cli

# Run commands
./bin/voyage world -summary      # Quick world state
./bin/voyage bench -n 1000       # Performance benchmarks
./bin/voyage assets              # Validate game assets
./bin/voyage sim -steps 1000     # Stress test simulation
```

## When to Use This Skill

Invoke this skill when user asks to:
- "check performance" or "run benchmarks"
- "inspect world" or "show world state"
- "validate assets" or "check assets"
- "stress test" or "test simulation"
- "what CLI tools do we have?"
- Debug simulation issues or performance problems

## Available Commands

### World Inspection
```bash
./bin/voyage world                    # Full world state (truncated)
./bin/voyage world -summary           # Quick stats only
./bin/voyage world -json              # Raw JSON output
./bin/voyage world -seed 123          # Use specific seed
./bin/voyage world -steps 100         # Run N steps first
```

### Performance Benchmarks
```bash
./bin/voyage bench                    # Default 1000 iterations
./bin/voyage bench -n 10000           # More iterations
./bin/voyage bench -warmup 50         # Custom warmup
./bin/voyage bench -profile           # With CPU profiling
```

### Asset Validation
```bash
./bin/voyage assets                   # Check assets/
./bin/voyage assets -dir ./custom     # Custom directory
./bin/voyage assets -v                # Verbose (list files)
./bin/voyage assets -fix              # Create missing dirs
```

### Simulation Stress Test
```bash
./bin/voyage sim                      # 10000 steps default
./bin/voyage sim -steps 100000        # Longer test
./bin/voyage sim -seed 123            # Specific seed
./bin/voyage sim -validate            # Validate state each step
```

### AI Handler Testing
```bash
./bin/voyage ai -list                 # Show available providers
./bin/voyage ai -prompt "Hello"       # Auto-detect provider
./bin/voyage ai -generate-image       # Image generation
./bin/voyage ai -list-voices          # TTS voices
```

## Scripts

### `scripts/quick_bench.sh`
Run benchmarks with filtered output (removes debug noise).

### `scripts/full_report.sh`
Generate comprehensive development report.

### `scripts/suggest_tools.sh`
Analyze codebase for potential new CLI tools.

## Workflow

1. **Build CLI** - `make cli`
2. **Run command** - Execute voyage command
3. **Interpret results** - Check output
4. **Report issues** - Use ailang-feedback for codegen bugs

## Suggesting New CLI Tools

When identifying CLI needs, consider:
- `voyage save` - Inspect/manage save files
- `voyage replay` - Replay recorded inputs
- `voyage export` - Export data for analysis
- `voyage config` - Manage game configuration
- `voyage starmap` - Starmap data tools

To add a new tool:
1. Add command case to `cmd/cli/main.go`
2. Implement `run<Command>Command()` function
3. Update this skill documentation
4. Run `make cli`

## Known Issues

**Debug output noise:** Filter with `| grep -v "^tick"` - tracked as AILANG bug.
