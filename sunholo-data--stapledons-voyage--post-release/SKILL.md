# Game Post-Release Tasks

Run post-release tasks after completing a game milestone or version.

## Quick Start

**Most common usage:**
```bash
# User says: "Run post-release tasks for v0.1.0"
# This skill will:
# 1. Verify all AILANG modules compile
# 2. Summarize AILANG feedback sent during development
# 3. Move design docs from planned/ to implemented/
# 4. Update project documentation
# 5. Create release summary
```

## When to Use This Skill

Invoke this skill when:
- User says "post-release tasks", "finalize release"
- After completing a game milestone
- Before tagging a version
- When wrapping up a sprint with a deliverable

## Post-Release Workflow

### 1. Verify Game State

```bash
# All AILANG modules compile
for f in sim/*.ail; do
  echo "=== $f ===" && ailang check "$f"
done

# Game builds
make game

# Quick test
make run
```

### 2. AILANG Feedback Summary

**Review all feedback sent during development:**

```bash
# Check inbox for any responses
ailang messages list --unread

# List all messages
ailang messages list

# Read a specific message
ailang messages read <msg-id>
```

**Create feedback summary:**
```markdown
## AILANG Feedback Summary (v0.1.0)

### Bugs Reported
- [x] Module imports not working (msg_xxx)
- [x] Recursion depth overflow (msg_xxx)
- [x] Record update syntax failure (msg_xxx)

### Features Requested
- [ ] RNG effect for random numbers
- [ ] Array type for O(1) access
- [ ] Numeric type conversion functions

### Documentation Gaps
- [ ] How to do random number generation
- [ ] Numeric conversion (int <-> float)

### Responses Received
- (List any responses from AILANG team)

### Still Blocking
- (List issues still preventing game features)
```

### 3. Validate & Update Design Docs

**First, validate current state:**
```bash
# Run validation script
./scripts/validate_design_docs.sh

# Check for:
# - Misplaced docs (implemented status but in planned/)
# - Orphan docs (not in version folders)
# - Missing metadata
```

**Move completed docs:**
```bash
# Use the design-doc-creator script
.claude/skills/design-doc-creator/scripts/move_to_implemented.sh feature-name v0_1_0

# Or manually:
mv design_docs/planned/feature.md design_docs/implemented/v0_1_0/

# Update status in doc header
# Status: Planned → Implemented
```

### 4. Update CHANGELOG.md

**Add version entry:**
```markdown
## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD

### Added
- Feature from implemented design doc
  - Design doc: [link to implemented doc]

### Changed
- What was modified

### Fixed
- Bugs resolved
```

### 5. Update CLAUDE.md

**Update Known Limitations:**
- Remove fixed limitations
- Add newly discovered limitations
- Update workarounds

**Example update:**
```markdown
### Known Limitations (as of v0.1.0)

- **Module imports not working** - Use local type definitions
- **NEW: Large grids cause stack overflow** - Keep to 8x8 max for now
```

### 6. Create Release Notes

```markdown
# Stapledons Voyage v0.1.0

## Features
- Basic world rendering with tile grid
- Initial AILANG simulation structure

## AILANG Usage
- sim/protocol.ail - Core types (FrameInput, DrawCmd, etc.)
- sim/world.ail - World state types
- sim/step.ail - Game loop logic
- sim/npc_ai.ail - Placeholder for NPC AI

## Known Issues
- Large grids (>8x8) cause recursion overflow
- Module imports not working (types duplicated)

## AILANG Feedback
Reported 6 issues to AILANG core:
- 3 bugs
- 2 feature requests
- 1 documentation gap

## Next Steps
- Wait for AILANG responses
- Plan v0.2.0 features (NPC movement)
```

### 7. Git Operations

```bash
# Tag the release
git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Initial game structure with AILANG"

# Push tag
git push origin v0.1.0
```

## Post-Release Checklist

```markdown
## vX.Y.Z Post-Release Checklist

### Verification
- [ ] All sim/*.ail files compile with `ailang check`
- [ ] Game builds with `make game`
- [ ] Game runs with `make run`
- [ ] Design docs validated (`./scripts/validate_design_docs.sh`)

### AILANG Feedback
- [ ] Reviewed all feedback sent during development
- [ ] Checked inbox for AILANG team responses
- [ ] Created feedback summary

### Documentation
- [ ] Design docs moved to implemented/
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated with version entry
- [ ] CLAUDE.md updated with new limitations
- [ ] Release notes created (optional)

### Git
- [ ] All changes committed
- [ ] Version tagged
- [ ] Tag pushed to origin

### Next Sprint
- [ ] Identified blocking AILANG issues
- [ ] Planned workarounds for next version
```

## Available Scripts

### `scripts/verify_release.sh [version]`
Verify game is ready for release.

**Usage:**
```bash
.claude/skills/post-release/scripts/verify_release.sh v0.1.0
```

**What it checks:**
1. All AILANG modules compile
2. Entry functions run
3. Game builds
4. AILANG inbox status
5. Design docs organization (no misplaced/orphan docs)
6. CHANGELOG.md has version entry

### `scripts/validate_design_docs.sh [--fix] [--json]`
Validate design document organization.

**Usage:**
```bash
# Check current state
./scripts/validate_design_docs.sh

# Output JSON for other tools
./scripts/validate_design_docs.sh --json
```

**What it checks:**
- Implemented docs are in `implemented/` directory
- Planned docs are in `planned/` directory
- Docs in version folders (e.g., `v0_5_0/`)
- Required metadata (Status, Version, Priority)

## Best Practices

### 1. Always Check Inbox
Before release, check for AILANG team responses that might affect the release.

### 2. Document Workarounds
Future developers (or future Claude sessions) need to know what workarounds are in place.

### 3. Prioritize Feedback
Mark which AILANG issues are blocking next features.

### 4. Keep Feedback Summary
Track all issues reported - it's the project's contribution to AILANG.

## Notes

- This project is primarily an AILANG integration test
- Release notes should emphasize AILANG usage and issues
- Post-release is a good time to review feedback loop effectiveness
- Check if any reported issues have been fixed in newer AILANG versions
