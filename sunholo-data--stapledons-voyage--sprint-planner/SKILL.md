# Game Sprint Planner

Create comprehensive sprint plans for Stapledons Voyage game development.

## Quick Start

**Most common usage:**
```bash
# User says: "Plan a sprint to implement NPC movement"
# This skill will:
# 1. Check current AILANG module status
# 2. Review known limitations from CLAUDE.md
# 3. Estimate effort (AILANG code + Go engine)
# 4. Create day-by-day task breakdown
# 5. Include AILANG feedback checkpoints
```

## When to Use This Skill

Invoke this skill when:
- User says "plan sprint", "estimate feature timeline"
- User wants to prioritize game development work
- Before starting a new game feature
- Assessing scope of AILANG workarounds needed

## Project-Specific Context

### Architecture (from CLAUDE.md)
```
sim/*.ail        → AILANG game logic (manually edit)
sim_gen/*.go     → Generated Go (OK - contains game types)
game_views/*.go  → Game-specific rendering helpers (NEW)
engine/*.go      → Generic Go/Ebiten rendering (reusable)
cmd/game/main.go → Game loop
```

### ⚠️ Engine Genericization Rule

**Before planning engine work, ask:** Could a different game use this unchanged?

| If YES | If NO |
|--------|-------|
| → OK for `engine/` | → Must go in `game_views/` or AILANG |

**sim_gen/ is fine** - Generated from AILANG, game-specific types belong there.

**engine/ must be generic** - No deck names, planet names, crew roles, or game concepts.

**game_views/** - New layer for game-specific rendering (DomeRenderer, DeckStackRenderer).

### Engine Capabilities Reference

**IMPORTANT:** Before estimating effort, review what's already built:

| Reference | Contents |
|-----------|----------|
| [engine-capabilities.md](../../../design_docs/reference/engine-capabilities.md) | Complete engine reference (DrawCmd types, effects, shaders, physics) |
| [gr-effects.md](../../../design_docs/implemented/v0_1_0/gr-effects.md) | GR physics, shader uniforms, danger levels |
| [ai-handler-system.md](../../../design_docs/implemented/v0_1_0/ai-handler-system.md) | AI effect, multimodal APIs |

**Key Available Capabilities:**
- **DrawCmd**: Sprite, Rect, Text, IsoTile, IsoEntity, GalaxyBg, Star, Ui (Panel/Button/Label/Portrait/Slider/ProgressBar), Line, Circle, TextWrapped
- **Effects**: Debug, Rand, Clock, AI (Claude/Gemini/stub)
- **Assets**: Animated sprites, Audio (OGG/WAV), Fonts (TTF with scaling)
- **Shaders**: SR warp, GR warp, bloom, vignette, CRT
- **Physics**: Lorentz factor, time dilation, gravitational redshift

### Current AILANG Limitations
Before planning, check CLAUDE.md for:
- Module imports not working
- Recursion depth limits
- No RNG effect documented
- No Array type (O(1) access)
- Record update syntax issues

## Sprint Planning Workflow

### 1. Assess Current State

```bash
# Check AILANG modules compile
for f in sim/*.ail; do ailang check "$f"; done

# Check for messages from AILANG team
ailang messages list --unread
```

### 2. Identify Work Scope

For each game feature, estimate:
- **AILANG code**: Types, functions needed in `sim/*.ail`
- **game_views code**: Game-specific rendering helpers (if needed)
- **Engine code**: Generic Go/Ebiten changes (should be rare!)
- **Workarounds**: AILANG limitations to navigate
- **Testing**: How to verify it works

**Engine Genericization Check:**
Before adding to `engine/`, verify it's not game-specific:
- ❌ References decks, planets, crew roles → `game_views/`
- ❌ Hardcodes game data → AILANG
- ✅ Generic DrawCmd rendering → `engine/`
- ✅ Asset loading, camera, shaders → `engine/`

### 3. Example Sprint Plan

```markdown
# Sprint: NPC Movement (3 days)

## Goal
Implement basic NPC movement on the world grid.

## Day 1: AILANG Types & Functions
- [ ] Define Direction type in sim/world.ail
- [ ] Add moveNpc function to sim/npc_ai.ail
- [ ] Test with `ailang check`
- [ ] Report any AILANG issues encountered

## Day 2: Step Integration
- [ ] Update step function to process NPC moves
- [ ] Handle movement input from FrameInput
- [ ] Test with `ailang run --entry step`

## Day 3: Engine Rendering
- [ ] Update Go rendering to show NPCs
- [ ] Test with `make run`
- [ ] Document any performance issues

## AILANG Feedback Checkpoint
After sprint, report:
- Bugs encountered
- Features that would have helped
- Documentation gaps
```

### 4. AILANG Complexity Multipliers

When estimating effort, consider these multipliers:

| Factor | Multiplier | Example |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Module imports broken | 1.5x | Must duplicate types |
| Deep recursion needed | 2x | Grid operations |
| No RNG available | +0.5 days | Random behaviors |
| New ADT types | 1.2x | Pattern matching complexity |

### 5. Include Feedback Checkpoints

Every sprint should include:
1. **Start**: Check inbox for AILANG team responses
2. **Mid-sprint**: Report blockers immediately
3. **End**: Send summary of issues encountered

## Handoff to sprint-executor

After sprint plan is approved:

```bash
# Check and acknowledge any pending messages
ailang messages list --unread
ailang messages ack <msg-id>

# Send plan ready notification (optional)
ailang messages send sprint-executor '{
  "type": "plan_ready",
  "sprint_id": "npc-movement",
  "days": 3,
  "milestones": ["types", "step-integration", "rendering"]
}'
```

## Available Scripts

### `scripts/analyze_velocity.sh`
Analyze recent development velocity from git commits.

### `scripts/create_sprint_json.sh <sprint_id> <plan_md>`
Create JSON progress file for multi-session execution.

## Best Practices

### 1. Start Small
- First sprint should be simple (1-2 days)
- Build confidence with AILANG before complex features

### 2. Test AILANG Early
- Run `ailang check` after every file change
- Don't let compilation errors pile up

### 3. Document Workarounds
- When AILANG lacks a feature, document the workaround
- Report to AILANG team so they know the pain points

### 4. Plan for Feedback Loop
- Budget time for reporting issues
- Check inbox for responses during sprint

## Notes

- This project tests AILANG as much as it builds a game
- Sprint velocity includes AILANG issue reporting time
- Use `ailang prompt` output as reference for planning
- Check CLAUDE.md for known limitations before estimating
