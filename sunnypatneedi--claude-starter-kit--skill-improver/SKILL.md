# Skill Improver

Process user feedback from skill retrospectives and update skill files to improve them over time.

## When to Use

- User asks to "review skill feedback" or "improve skills based on usage"
- You notice feedback files in `.claude/feedback/`
- User mentions a skill didn't work well or missed something
- Periodic review (monthly) to incorporate learnings

## How It Works

### Step 1: Gather Feedback

Read all feedback files in `.claude/feedback/`:

```bash
ls -la .claude/feedback/retro-*.md
```

Look for patterns:
- Multiple users reporting same missing step → add to skill
- Benchmarks don't match user's context → add context-specific ranges
- Workflow confusing → restructure or add clarifications
- Skill incomplete → add missing sections

### Step 2: Identify High-Impact Changes

Prioritize updates based on:

**High Priority (do first):**
- Missing critical steps that users had to figure out themselves
- Incorrect benchmarks or numbers
- Confusing workflow that requires clarification
- Safety issues or errors

**Medium Priority:**
- Additional examples or templates
- Better explanations of existing steps
- Alternative approaches for different contexts

**Low Priority:**
- Nice-to-have additions
- Stylistic improvements
- Minor clarifications

### Step 3: Update Skill Files

For each skill needing updates:

#### 3a. Add a "Learnings" Section

If the skill doesn't have one, add at the end:

```markdown
## Learnings from Use

**[Date]**: [Brief description of what was learned]
- **Feedback**: [What users reported]
- **Update**: [What we changed]
- **Result**: [Expected improvement]
```

#### 3b. Update Main Content

If feedback suggests core changes:
- Add missing steps to checklists
- Update benchmarks with ranges (e.g., "20-30% for B2C, 50-70% for B2B")
- Restructure workflow if confusing
- Add "Common Pitfalls" section if users make same mistakes

#### 3c. Version the Change

At the top of the skill, track versions:

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
version: 1.2.0
last_updated: 2026-01-22
changelog:
  - v1.2.0 (2026-01-22): Added missing step for X based on user feedback
  - v1.1.0 (2026-01-15): Updated benchmarks for Y context
  - v1.0.0 (2026-01-01): Initial release
---
```

### Step 4: Archive Processed Feedback

Move processed feedback to archive:

```bash
mkdir -p .claude/feedback/archive
mv .claude/feedback/retro-2026-01-22-*.md .claude/feedback/archive/
```

Keep a summary of learnings in `.claude/feedback/SUMMARY.md`:

```markdown
# Feedback Summary

## [Skill Name]

**Total feedback sessions**: 12
**Last updated**: 2026-01-22

**Key learnings**:
- Added step for X (reported by 3 users)
- Updated benchmarks for B2B context (reported by 5 users)
- Clarified workflow around Y (reported by 2 users)

**Patterns**:
- Users in enterprise context need higher benchmarks
- Early-stage startups need more examples
- Non-technical users need clearer explanations of jargon
```

## Example Workflow

### Scenario: product-market-fit skill needs improvement

**Step 1: Review Feedback**

Read `.claude/feedback/retro-2026-01-22-143022.md`:

```markdown
## Feedback

**Missed important steps?** yes

**Improvements needed:**
The Sean Ellis test threshold of 40% seems high for B2B enterprise products.
We're at 32% "very disappointed" but our retention is 85% D30 which is excellent.
Should the skill mention that thresholds vary by product type?
```

**Step 2: Identify Pattern**

Check other feedback files → 3 more users report B2B context needs different benchmarks.

**Step 3: Update Skill**

Edit `.claude/skills/product-market-fit/SKILL.md`:

**Before:**
```markdown
## Sean Ellis Test (40% Rule)

"How would you feel if you could no longer use [product]?"
- ≥40% "Very disappointed" = Strong PMF
```

**After:**
```markdown
## Sean Ellis Test (Context-Dependent Thresholds)

"How would you feel if you could no longer use [product]?"

**Thresholds by product type:**
- **Consumer B2C**: ≥40% "Very disappointed" = Strong PMF
- **SMB B2B**: ≥35% "Very disappointed" = Strong PMF
- **Enterprise B2B**: ≥30% "Very disappointed" = Strong PMF (longer sales cycles, different buying psychology)

**Why the difference?**
- Enterprise buyers are more rational than emotional
- Switching costs are higher (contracts, integrations)
- Retention is a better PMF signal for B2B (see Step 2)
```

Add to Learnings section:

```markdown
## Learnings from Use

**2026-01-22**: Refined Sean Ellis thresholds by product type
- **Feedback**: 4 users reported 40% threshold too high for B2B enterprise
- **Update**: Added context-specific thresholds (B2C 40%, SMB 35%, Enterprise 30%)
- **Result**: More accurate PMF diagnosis for different product types
```

**Step 4: Archive & Track**

```bash
mv .claude/feedback/retro-2026-01-22-*.md .claude/feedback/archive/
```

Update `.claude/feedback/SUMMARY.md`:

```markdown
## product-market-fit

**Total feedback sessions**: 4
**Last updated**: 2026-01-22

**Key learnings**:
- Added context-specific Sean Ellis thresholds (reported by 4 users)
- B2B needs different benchmarks than B2C

**Next improvements to consider**:
- Add industry-specific retention benchmarks
- Include examples from different verticals
```

## Quality Checklist

Before updating any skill, ensure:

- [ ] Feedback is from multiple users (pattern, not outlier)
- [ ] Change makes skill more accurate, not just more complex
- [ ] Benchmarks are sourced or validated (not anecdotal)
- [ ] Update is backward compatible (doesn't break existing workflows)
- [ ] Learnings section documents why we made the change
- [ ] Version number incremented appropriately (semver)
- [ ] Processed feedback archived, not deleted

## Feedback Categories

Track feedback by type to identify systemic issues:

### Category 1: Missing Steps
**Example**: "Skill forgot to mention we need to segment cohorts by acquisition channel"
**Action**: Add step to checklist

### Category 2: Incorrect Benchmarks
**Example**: "40% D30 retention is not 'strong' for our B2B SaaS, it's average"
**Action**: Update benchmarks with context (B2C vs B2B vs Enterprise)

### Category 3: Confusing Workflow
**Example**: "I didn't know whether to do cohort analysis before or after Sean Ellis test"
**Action**: Number steps clearly, add workflow diagram

### Category 4: Missing Context
**Example**: "Skill assumes I have 1000+ users, what if I only have 50?"
**Action**: Add "Early Stage Adaptation" section

### Category 5: Tool-Specific Issues
**Example**: "How do I calculate D30 retention in Google Analytics?"
**Action**: Add "Implementation in Common Tools" section

## Best Practices

### Do:
✅ Look for patterns across multiple feedback sessions
✅ Update skills incrementally (small, tested changes)
✅ Document why changes were made (Learnings section)
✅ Preserve feedback history (archive, don't delete)
✅ Version skills so users know what changed

### Don't:
❌ Update based on single piece of feedback (might be outlier)
❌ Make skills overly complex trying to cover every edge case
❌ Remove content without understanding why it was there
❌ Ignore feedback for more than 30 days (patterns emerge)
❌ Update without testing the new version

## Automation Ideas

### Weekly Digest (optional)
Create a script to summarize new feedback:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .claude/hooks/learning/weekly-feedback-digest.sh

echo "📊 Feedback Digest (Last 7 Days)"
echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"

find .claude/feedback -name "retro-*.md" -mtime -7 | while read -r file; do
    echo ""
    echo "File: $(basename $file)"
    grep "Skills Used" -A 5 "$file"
    grep "Improvements needed:" -A 3 "$file"
done
```

### Auto-Tag for Review
When feedback mentions specific issues, auto-tag:

- "missing step" → tag for immediate review
- "wrong number" → tag for fact-check
- "confusing" → tag for clarity rewrite

## Success Metrics

Track improvement over time:

- **Feedback frequency**: Decreasing = skills getting better
- **Repeated issues**: Should approach zero over time
- **User satisfaction**: Track "Did this skill help?" responses
- **Skill usage**: Updated skills should see increased usage
