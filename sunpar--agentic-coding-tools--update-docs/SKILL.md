# Update Documentation

## Context To Load

1. Run `git status` and `git diff`.
2. Run `git log -n 10 --oneline`.
3. Identify touched layers: frontend, backend, pipeline, DB migrations, docs, infra.

## Documents To Update (Only If Relevant)

- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `docs/DATA_MODEL.md`
- `docs/DECISIONS.md`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `README.md`
- `TODO.md`
- `backend/app/pipeline/README.md`

## Guardrails

- Never add raw spend data, merchant strings, amounts, dates, `raw_fields`, CSV bytes, or account numbers.
- Make minimal edits tied directly to code changes.
- Do not invent endpoints/schemas/contracts.
- Leave unrelated docs unchanged.

## Output

List changed documentation files and provide 1-2 bullets per file describing what changed and why.
