SuperDesign helps you (1) find design inspirations/styles and (2) generate/iterate design drafts on an infinite canvas.

# Core scenarios (what this skill handles)

1. **superdesign init** — Analyze the repo and build UI context to `.superdesign/init/`
2. **Help me design X** (feature/page/flow)
3. **Set design system**
4. **Help me improve design of X**

# Init: Repo Analysis

When `.superdesign/init/` directory doesn't exist or is empty, you MUST automatically:

1. Create the `.superdesign/init/` directory
2. Fetch the init prompt from the URL below
3. Follow the prompt instructions to analyze the repo and write context files

```

Do NOT ask the user to do this manually — just do it.

# Mandatory Init Files

If `.superdesign/init/` exists, you MUST read ALL files in this directory FIRST before any design task:

- `components.md` — shared UI primitives with full source code
- `layouts.md` — shared layout components (nav, sidebar, header, footer)
- `routes.md` — page/route mapping
- `theme.md` — design tokens, CSS variables, Tailwind config
- `pages.md` — page component dependency trees (which files each page needs)
- `extractable-components.md` — components that can be extracted as reusable DraftComponents

**When designing for an existing page**: First check `pages.md` for the page's complete dependency tree. Every file in that tree MUST be passed as `--context-file`. Then also add globals.css, tailwind.config, and design-system.md.

# Superdesign CLI (MUST run before any command)

**IMPORTANT: Before running ANY superdesign command, you MUST ensure the CLI is installed and logged in.**

Follow these steps in order — do NOT skip any step:

1. Check if CLI is already installed:

   ```
   superdesign --version
   ```

   - If the command succeeds (prints a version), **skip installation** and go to step 2.
   - If the command fails (not found), install the CLI:
     ```
     npm install -g @superdesign/cli@latest
     ```

2. Check login status by running any command (e.g. `superdesign --help`). If you see an auth/login error, run:
   ```
   superdesign login
   ```
   Wait for login to complete successfully before proceeding.
3. Only after login succeeds, run your intended superdesign commands.

> **Never assume the user is already logged in.** Always verify login first.

# How it works

MUST MANDATORY Fetch fresh guidelines below:

```

Action accordingly based on instruction in the SUPERDESIGN.md
