# SushiSwap REST API Integration

The SushiSwap API provides HTTP access to the SushiSwap Aggregator for
**optimized token swaps**, **price discovery**, and **transaction generation**.
It aggregates liquidity from multiple DEXs to determine the best execution route.

---

## Base URL

```
https://api.sushi.com
```

---

## API Schema

The **active API schema** is defined in:

[references/openapi.yaml](references/openapi.yaml)

Agents must **always rely on the schema contents** rather than hardcoded assumptions.

---

## How To Use

1. Load `references/openapi.yaml`
2. Discover available endpoints, parameters, and response shapes dynamically
3. Select the appropriate endpoint based on user intent and schema tags
    - Quotes → quote endpoints (e.g. `/quote/v7/{chainId}`)
    - Swap execution → swap endpoints (e.g. `/swap/v7/{chainId}`)
    - Prices → price endpoints (e.g. `/price/v1/{chainId}`)
    - Token info → token endpoints (e.g. `/token/v1/{chainId}/{tokenAddress}`)
4. Construct requests that strictly conform to the schema and include a valid `referrer` parameter for all quote and swap endpoints
5. Validate required parameters before execution

---

## Mandatory `referrer` Parameter

- The `referrer` parameter **must be specified** on swap-related endpoints (e.g. `/quote` & `/swap`)
- The agent or integrator **must identify themselves** using this field
- `/quote` or `/swap` requests **must not be sent** without a `referrer` value
- Agents must never attempt to omit, spoof, or auto-generate this value.

---

## Fee Customization

The SushiSwap API supports customized integrator fees on swap-related endpoints (e.g. `/quote` & `/swap`).

### Default fee model

- Swap-related requests follow an **80/20 fee split by default**
    - **80%** to the integrator (referrer)
    - **20%** to SushiSwap
- This split applies unless explicitly overridden by SushiSwap

### Custom fee splits

- Alternative fee splits require a **partnership** with SushiSwap
- Agents and integrators should not assume custom splits are available. If users request alternative fee splits, agents should direct them to the SushiSwap
team rather than attempting to modify request parameters.

---

## Rate Limiting & Responsible Usage

- The SushiSwap Aggregator API does **not currently enforce hard rate limits**. Agents and integrators **must behave responsibly** to avoid abuse and degraded service.

### General Guidelines

- Do not poll or spam quote endpoints
- Avoid repeated requests with identical parameters
- Do not place quote or swap requests inside unbounded or infinite loops
- Treat quote and swap generation as user-intent driven actions, not background tasks
- Do not issue requests autonomously without explicit user intent

Excessive or abusive usage may result in future rate limiting or access restrictions.

### Block-Time–Aware Quoting

Agents should align quote frequency with expected block times, treating block time as a **maximum refresh rate, not a recommendation**.

- Quotes may be refreshed **at most once per block**, and often **less frequently** if inputs have not changed
- Re-requesting quotes multiple times within the same block provides no additional accuracy and must be avoided

### Backoff & Error Handling

Agents and integrators should implement **exponential backoff** on transient failures.

- On recoverable errors (e.g. `429`, `5xx`):
  - Retry with increasing delays (e.g. 1s → 2s → 4s)
  - Cap retries to a small, finite number
- Do not retry immediately in tight loops
- If repeated failures occur:
  - Surface the error to the user
  - Pause further requests for the current session
