# Research Verification Checklist

A systematic approach to verifying assumptions made during research. Prevents costly errors from unverified information.

## When to Use

- **During** research tasks (not just after)
- Before finalizing deployment plans
- When documenting external system configurations
- When inferring patterns from incomplete documentation

## Core Principle

> **Trust but verify**: Every assumption is a potential failure point. Verification takes minutes; debugging takes hours.

---

## The Checklist

### 1. Existence Verification

Before referencing external resources, verify they exist:

| Resource Type | Verification Method |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Container registry | `curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" https://ghcr.io/v2/org/repo/tags/list` |
| npm package | `npm view <package> version` |
| GitHub repo | `gh repo view owner/repo` or WebFetch the URL |
| API endpoint | `curl -I https://api.example.com/health` |
| Documentation page | WebFetch with existence check |

**Pattern:**
```
Before: "The image is available at ghcr.io/org/repo"
After:  "Verified: ghcr.io/org/repo exists (or: not published, build from source)"
```

### 2. Schema Verification

When documenting configuration:

| Confidence Level | Criteria | Action |
|------------------|----------|--------|
| ✅ **High** | Found in official docs with examples | Document directly |
| ⚠️ **Medium** | Inferred from source code or patterns | Mark as "verify during implementation" |
| ❌ **Low** | Guessed based on similar systems | Mark as "unverified - may not work" |

**Pattern:**
```markdown
> [!warning] Confidence: Medium
> This configuration option was inferred from [source]. Verify before use.
```

### 3. Version Verification

External systems change. Verify currency:

- [ ] Documentation date checked (reject if >12 months old without verification)
- [ ] Release/changelog reviewed for breaking changes
- [ ] API version specified explicitly
- [ ] Dependency versions pinned

### 4. Environment Assumptions

Never assume environment details:

| Assumption | Verification |
|------------|--------------|
| Network names | Ask user or check existing configs |
| Domain names | Ask user explicitly |
| File paths | Ask user for conventions |
| Auth methods | Ask user for preferences |

**Pattern:**
```
Wrong: "Add to the traefik network"
Right: "What is your Traefik network name?" → "Add to the `proxy` network"
```

### 5. Integration Verification

When connecting systems:

- [ ] Both systems' APIs documented?
- [ ] Authentication method confirmed?
- [ ] Data format compatibility checked?
- [ ] Error handling documented?

---

## Quick Reference

### Before Documenting External Resources

```
□ Does it exist? (fetch/curl)
□ What version? (pin it)
□ Official docs? (link them)
□ Confidence level? (mark it)
```

### Before Finalizing Plans

```
□ Environment details confirmed with user?
□ Inferred configs marked with confidence?
□ Validation steps included?
□ Fallback options documented?
```

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Better Approach |
|--------------|---------|-----------------|
| "The registry has the image" | May not exist | Verify with HTTP request |
| "Use the default network" | User may have custom setup | Ask for network name |
| "This config option does X" | May be inferred incorrectly | Mark confidence level |
| "Just run this command" | May fail silently | Add validation step |

---

## Integration

Use alongside:
- **ai-dev-research**: Apply checklist during research phase
- **session-retrospective**: Identify verification gaps in retrospectives

---

## Version

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Created:** 2025-01-20
**Origin:** Session retrospective finding - registry assumption failure
