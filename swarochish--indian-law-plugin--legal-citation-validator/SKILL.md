# Legal Citation Validator

This skill provides validation and formatting guidance for Indian legal citations, statutory references, and case law according to established legal citation standards.

## Purpose

Ensures precision and accuracy in legal writing by:
1. Validating statutory section references against actual legislation
2. Formatting case law citations according to AIR/SCR/SCC standards
3. Detecting common citation errors and inconsistencies
4. Providing proper abbreviated forms for courts and authorities

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Writing legal protocols, opinions, or analysis
- Citing statutory provisions (e.g., "Section 14 of the Constitution")
- Referencing case law (e.g., landmark judgments)
- Drafting legal documents requiring precise citations
- Reviewing legal content for citation accuracy
- Creating cross-references between legal provisions

## Citation Standards

### 1. Statutory Citations

**Format**: `[Act Name], [Year], Section [Number]`

**Examples**:
- ✅ CORRECT: "Section 21 of the Constitution of India, 1950"
- ✅ CORRECT: "Section 300 IPC" (when IPC context is clear)
- ✅ CORRECT: "Article 14 of the Constitution"
- ❌ INCORRECT: "Article 14" (without Act reference in first mention)
- ❌ INCORRECT: "Sec. 21" (use "Section" in formal writing)

**Rules**:
1. First mention: Full Act name + year + Section number
2. Subsequent mentions: Abbreviated form acceptable if unambiguous
3. Use "Section" for statutes, "Article" only for Constitution
4. Clause/sub-section format: "Section 14(1)(a)"

### 2. Case Law Citations

**Primary Formats** (in order of preference):
1. **AIR (All India Reporter)**: `[Case Name] v. [Respondent], AIR [Year] [Court] [Page]`
2. **SCR (Supreme Court Reports)**: `([Year]) [Volume] SCR [Page]`
3. **SCC (Supreme Court Cases)**: `([Year]) [Volume] SCC [Page]`

**Examples**:
- ✅ CORRECT: "Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala, AIR 1973 SC 1461"
- ✅ CORRECT: "Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India, (1978) 1 SCC 248"
- ✅ CORRECT: "Vishaka v. State of Rajasthan, AIR 1997 SC 3011"
- ❌ INCORRECT: "Kesavananda case (1973)" (informal, lacks citation)
- ❌ INCORRECT: "AIR 1973 1461" (missing court abbreviation)

**Court Abbreviations**:
- `SC` = Supreme Court of India
- `Del` = Delhi High Court
- `Bom` = Bombay High Court
- `Cal` = Calcutta High Court
- `Mad` = Madras High Court
- (Refer to @.claude/skills/legal-citation-validator/references/court-abbreviations.md for complete list)

### 3. Constitutional Citations

**Format**: `Article [Number], Part [Part Number if relevant], Constitution of India`

**Examples**:
- ✅ CORRECT: "Article 21, Part III, Constitution of India"
- ✅ CORRECT: "Articles 14-18 (Right to Equality)"
- ✅ CORRECT: "Article 32 (Constitutional Remedies)"
- ❌ INCORRECT: "Art. 21" (use "Article" in formal writing)

### 4. Amendment Citations

**Format**: `[Ordinal Number] Amendment, [Year]` OR `Constitution (Amendment) Act, [Year]`

**Examples**:
- ✅ CORRECT: "42nd Amendment, 1976"
- ✅ CORRECT: "Constitution (Forty-Second Amendment) Act, 1976"
- ✅ CORRECT: "44th Amendment (repealed Emergency provisions)"

## Validation Workflow

### Step 1: Identify Citations
Scan document for patterns:
- "Section [number]"
- "Article [number]"
- Case names (capitalized party names with "v." or "vs.")
- "AIR [year]", "SCC", "SCR" patterns
- Act names with years (e.g., "Act, 1872")

### Step 2: Validate Format

Check each citation against standards in @references/citation-formats.md:
- Proper spacing (e.g., "AIR 1973 SC 1461" not "AIR1973SC1461")
- Correct abbreviations (e.g., "SC" not "S.C." for Supreme Court)
- Comma placement (e.g., "v." followed by respondent name)
- Year format consistency (e.g., 1973 not '73)

### Step 3: Verify Statutory References

For statutory citations:
1. Check section number exists in referenced Act
2. Verify subsection/clause notation (e.g., "Section 14(1)" not "Section 14-1")
3. Confirm Act year is correct (e.g., "IPC, 1860" not "IPC, 1860")

**Common Errors**:
- ❌ "Section 301 IPC" (IPC has 511 sections, no Section 301 exists - correct is "Section 300")
- ❌ "Article 370A" (no such Article - correct is "Article 370")
- ❌ "Section 14(a)" (should be "Section 14(1)" if referring to first clause)

### Step 4: Validate Case Citations

For case law:
1. Check party names are capitalized correctly
2. Verify "v." (not "vs" or "vs." in formal citations)
3. Confirm court abbreviation is standard
4. Check year is within realistic range (1950-2025 for independent India)

Refer to @references/landmark-cases-index.md for verification of major cases.

### Step 5: Cross-Reference Check

Ensure citations are consistent:
- Same case cited the same way throughout document
- Same statutory provision formatted consistently
- Abbreviations used consistently (don't mix "IPC" and "Indian Penal Code" randomly)

### Step 6: Generate Validation Report

Output format:
```
✓ VALID CITATIONS: [count]
  - Statutory: [count]
  - Case law: [count]
  - Constitutional: [count]

⚠ WARNINGS: [count]
  - [Description of inconsistency or formatting issue]

✗ ERRORS: [count]
  - Line [X]: [Error description and suggested correction]
```
