# Legal Research Assistant

This skill provides structured workflows for comprehensive legal research using freely available Indian legal resources.

## Purpose

Conduct systematic legal research by:
1. Searching across multiple authoritative sources (India Code, Indian Kanoon, government databases)
2. Following source hierarchy (Constitution → Statutes → Case Law → Secondary Sources)
3. Validating currency of law (checking amendments, repeals, superseding judgments)
4. Organizing research findings with proper citations

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Researching a new legal question from scratch
- Finding relevant statutes and case law on a topic
- Validating current applicability of legal provisions
- Building comprehensive legal analysis
- Preparing legal opinions or protocols

## Research Sources (All Free Access)

### Primary Sources

- All Central Acts from 1836 onwards
- Current versions with amendments
- Search by Act name, year, or keyword
- Download PDFs of bare acts

**2. Indian Kanoon** (indiankanoon.org)
- 1.4M+ cases (SC, 24 HCs, 17 tribunals)
- 20,000+ documents added daily
- Full-text search with Boolean operators
- Case citators (cases citing a judgment)

**3. Supreme Court Website** (sci.gov.in)
- Latest judgments
- Cause lists
- Constitution Bench decisions

**4. e-Courts Portal** (ecourts.gov.in)

### Secondary Sources (Free)

- **Legal Services India** (legalservicesindia.com)
- **Legal Bites** (legalbites.in)
- **SCC Online Blog** (scconline.com/blog)
- **Bar & Bench** (barandbench.com)

## Research Workflow

### Step 1: Define Research Question

Formulate precise question:
- ✅ GOOD: "What is the limitation period for filing suit for specific performance of sale agreement under Limitation Act 1963?"
- ❌ VAGUE: "Tell me about specific performance"

Identify:
- **Legal Issue**: [e.g., Limitation period]
- **Domain**: [e.g., Civil Law - Specific Relief]
- **Jurisdiction**: [e.g., All India / Specific State]
- **Time Period**: [e.g., Current law / Historical]

### Step 2: Statutory Research (India Code)

**Search Strategy**:
1. Identify relevant Act(s)
2. Read bare statutory provisions
3. Check for amendments
4. Note cross-references

**Example Search**:
```
Topic: Limitation for specific performance
→ Search "Limitation Act 1963" on India Code
→ Navigate to Schedule
→ Find Article 54: "For the specific performance of a contract" - 3 years
→ Check for amendments post-1963
```

Refer to: @references/statutory-search-guide.md

### Step 3: Case Law Research (Indian Kanoon)

**Search Techniques**:

**Boolean Operators**:
- `AND`: Both terms must appear
- `OR`: Either term can appear
- `NOT`: Exclude term
- `" "`: Exact phrase

**Examples**:
```
"specific performance" AND "limitation" AND "Article 54"
"Section 3(d)" AND "evergreening" AND "Novartis"
"arbitrability" AND ("Vidya Drolia" OR "BALCO")
```

**Filters**:
- Court: Supreme Court, specific High Court
- Year Range: 2020-2024 for recent law
- Citation: Search by AIR/SCC number

**Citator Function**:
- Find cases citing a landmark judgment
- Track judicial treatment (followed, distinguished, overruled)

Refer to: @references/case-law-search-guide.md

### Step 4: Validate Currency

**Check**:
1. **Amendments**: Has statute been amended since judgment?
2. **Repeals**: Has provision been repealed/replaced (e.g., IPC → BNS)?
3. **Overruling**: Has case been overruled by larger bench?
4. **Legislative Changes**: New Acts superseding old law?

**Example**:
```
Research on IPC Section 377:
- Original provision: Criminalized homosexuality
- Navtej Johar (2018): SC partially struck down Section 377
- Current status: Only bestiality remains criminal
→ Must cite Navtej Johar + current reading of Section 377
```

### Step 5: Organize Findings

**Structure**:
1. **Statutory Provisions** (with citations)
2. **Binding Precedents** (Supreme Court cases)
3. **Persuasive Authorities** (HC cases, Law Commission)
4. **Analysis** (how authorities apply to question)

**Citation Format**:
- Use proper AIR/SCC citations (refer to legal-citation-validator skill)
- Include pinpoint references (specific page/paragraph)
- Note ratio decidendi vs obiter dicta

### Step 6: Synthesize & Document

Create structured research memo:
```markdown
# Research Memorandum

## Question Presented
[Precise legal question]

## Brief Answer
[1-2 sentence conclusion]

## Applicable Law

### Statutory Provisions
- [Act, Year], Section [X]: "[Relevant text]"

### Case Law
- [Case Name], [Citation]: [Holding]

### Analysis
[How law applies to facts]

## Conclusion
[Detailed answer with legal reasoning]
```

## Source Hierarchy

When conflicts arise, follow this hierarchy:

1. **Constitution of India** (supreme law)
2. **Supreme Court Judgments** (binding on all courts)
3. **Central Statutes** (as interpreted by SC)
4. **High Court Judgments** (binding within state)
5. **Tribunal Decisions** (subject to HC writ)
6. **Law Commission Reports** (persuasive, not binding)
7. **Academic Commentary** (persuasive)

**Example Conflict**:
```
If HC judgment contradicts earlier SC judgment:
→ SC judgment prevails (larger bench can overrule smaller bench SC decision)
→ Note HC judgment for persuasive value only
```

## Advanced Search Scripts

### Script 1: Bulk Case Citator
**File**: @scripts/case_citator.py

Search all cases citing a landmark judgment:
```python
# Usage: python case_citator.py "Kesavananda Bharati" "AIR 1973 SC 1461"
# Returns: List of all cases on Indian Kanoon citing this judgment
```

### Script 2: Statutory Amendment Tracker
**File**: @scripts/amendment_tracker.py

Check amendment history of any Act:
```python
# Usage: python amendment_tracker.py "Arbitration and Conciliation Act" 1996
# Returns: Timeline of all amendments with dates
```

Refer to: @scripts/ directory for implementation

## Example Research Workflows

### Example 1: New Legal Question
**Question**: "Can mediated settlement agreement be challenged under Section 34 A&C Act?"

**Workflow**:
1. Search India Code: Arbitration & Conciliation Act 1996 + Mediation Act 2023
2. Find Section 29, Mediation Act 2023: MSA has status of arbitral award
3. Search Indian Kanoon: "mediated settlement" AND "Section 34"
4. Find relevant cases interpreting enforceability
5. Synthesize: MSA under Mediation Act 2023 ≠ arbitral award under A&C Act 1996, different challenge mechanisms

### Example 2: Transitional Law
**Question**: "Is IPC Section 300 or BNS equivalent applicable to offense committed in June 2024?"

**Workflow**:
1. Check India Code: BNS effective date = July 1, 2024
2. Transitional provisions: Offenses before July 1 governed by IPC
3. Answer: IPC Section 300 applies (offense in June 2024)

### Example 3: Recent Development
**Question**: "Latest SC position on cryptocurrency regulation?"

**Workflow**:
1. Indian Kanoon search: "cryptocurrency" (filter: SC, 2020-2024)
2. Find: Internet and Mobile Association of India v. RBI (2020)
3. Check subsequent developments via Law Commission reports
4. Search: "Digital Personal Data Protection Act 2023" cross-references
