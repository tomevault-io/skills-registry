# RTI Application Drafter

## Purpose
Generate legally compliant RTI applications under Right to Information Act 2005 with specific information requests, proper format, correct fee calculation, and statutory timeline invocation.

## Skill Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Application Parameters

When invoked, collect the following from user (or infer from context):

**Required**:
1. **Public Authority**: Which department/ministry/PSU/local body?
   - Examples: "Ministry of Home Affairs", "Delhi Municipal Corporation", "ONGC"

2. **Information Sought**: What specific information does user need?
   - Must be SPECIFIC (not vague "all files")
   - Numbered points preferred
   - Include timeframe if applicable

3. **Applicant Details**:
   - Name
   - Address
   - Phone/Email (for PIO to respond)

**Optional**:
4. **PIO Address**: If user knows specific PIO address (otherwise use generic)

5. **BPL Status**: Is applicant Below Poverty Line? (Fee exemption)

6. **Life/Liberty Matter**: Does information concern life or liberty? (48-hour timeline under Section 7(1) proviso)

7. **Form of Information**: How does user want information?
   - Certified copies (default)
   - Inspection of records
   - Electronic form (email/CD)
   - Photocopies

### Step 2: Validate Information Request Specificity

**Check if information request is SPECIFIC enough**:

**Too Vague** (Will be rejected/delayed):
- ❌ "Give all files on X project"
- ❌ "Provide complete information about scheme"
- ❌ "Send all correspondence related to my case"

**Good Specificity** (Likely to succeed):
- ✅ "Provide copy of project approval note dated [approx date] for X project"
- ✅ "Number of beneficiaries of X scheme in [district] during FY 2023-24, with total amount disbursed"
- ✅ "List of tenders awarded by department in [period] with contractor names and contract values"

**If User's Request Too Vague**: Prompt user to be more specific OR refine on their behalf:
- "Instead of 'all files', can you specify: approval orders, budget documents, contractor list?"
- "Instead of 'scheme information', what specifically: beneficiary count, fund allocation, implementation status?"

### Step 3: Determine Fee

**Central Government**: ₹10 (IPO/DD in favor of "Accounts Officer, [Ministry/Department]")

**State Government**: Varies by state (₹10-50 typically)
- Check state RTI rules (if known)
- If unknown, mention "₹10 or as applicable as per state RTI rules"

**BPL Applicants**: Fee WAIVED (Section 7(5))
- If user is BPL, mention: "Fee exempted as applicant is BPL (certificate enclosed)"

**Below Poverty Line**: If user mentions BPL status, include fee exemption clause

### Step 4: Draft RTI Application

Use the following template structure:

```
To,
The Public Information Officer
[Name of Department/Ministry/PSU/Local Body]
[Address - if known, otherwise generic: "Registered Office" or check authority website]

Subject: Application under Right to Information Act, 2005

[FEE CLAUSE - STANDARD]:
I am enclosing [₹10 / applicable fee] as application fee by way of [Indian Postal Order / Demand Draft / Court Fee Stamp] [if IPO/DD: "in favor of 'Accounts Officer, [Ministry/Department]'"].

[IF BPL - Section 7(5)]:
I am a Below Poverty Line (BPL) applicant. BPL certificate issued by [Issuing Authority] on [date] is enclosed. As per Section 7(5) of the RTI Act, 2005, fee is exempted for BPL applicants.

[TIMELINE CLAUSE - STANDARD]:
Please provide the information within 30 days as mandated under Section 7(1) of the Right to Information Act, 2005.

3. **If PIO Misdirects (Section 6(3))**:
   - PIO should inform you if application transferred
