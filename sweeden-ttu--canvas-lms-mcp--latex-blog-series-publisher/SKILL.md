# LaTeX → Blog Series Publisher (Jekyll + KaTeX + Mermaid)

Turn one LaTeX source into a navigable blog series with consistent structure, cross-links, and rendering that works in Jekyll with KaTeX and Mermaid.

## Inputs to request (if missing)

- LaTeX source (`.tex`) and any assets (figures/bib)
- Target site location (Jekyll root) and desired output folder (`_posts/` vs `notes/`)
- Desired series title/slug, and target number of parts (or “auto by sections”)
- Audience level (intro / advanced / mixed)

## Core workflow

1. **Parse the LaTeX outline**
   - Extract `\section`, `\subsection`, `\paragraph` headings.
   - Identify special blocks: equations, code listings, tables, figures, references.

2. **Design the series plan**
   - Map major sections to posts (“Part 1…N”) and keep each post focused.
   - Add a consistent per-post structure:
     - Context + learning goals
     - Main content
     - Worked example
     - Summary + exercises (optional)

3. **Convert content to Markdown suitable for Jekyll**
   - Preserve math delimiters as `\( \)` and `\[ \]` (KaTeX renders these in the browser).
   - Convert LaTeX lists to Markdown lists.
   - Convert `\texttt{}` / `\verb` to backticks.
   - Convert `\begin{verbatim}` / listings to fenced code blocks.

4. **Handle figures/tables**
   - If images are present, reference them under an assets folder (e.g., `assets/img/series-slug/`).
   - If images are not available, insert placeholders:
     - `> TODO: Add figure “...” (from LaTeX Figure X).`

5. **Mermaid extraction**
   - If the LaTeX uses a convention like `\begin{mermaid}...\end{mermaid}` (or commented markers), convert to fenced Mermaid:
     - ```mermaid
       graph TD
       ...
       ```
   - If no Mermaid exists, propose diagrams where it clarifies architecture or workflows.

6. **Create series navigation**
   - Add front matter fields like `series`, `part`, and optional `prev_url`/`next_url`.
   - Add a “Series contents” block at the top of each post linking to all parts.

## Jekyll post template (default)

Use this front matter:
```yaml
---
layout: post
title: "Series Title — Part X: Specific Topic"
date: 2026-01-30
tags: [trustworthy-ai]
series: series-slug
part: 1
description: "One-sentence summary of this part."
---
```

Then structure:
- `## Why this matters`
- `## Key ideas`
- `## Worked example`
- `## Common pitfalls`
- `## Summary`
- `## Exercises` (optional)

## Quality bar

- [ ] No “wall of text”: break up long sections with headings and examples
- [ ] Each post has a clear learning goal and recap
- [ ] Math renders with KaTeX (keep delimiters consistent)
- [ ] Mermaid diagrams render (use fenced blocks)
- [ ] Internal links work, and series ordering is explicit
- [ ] Technical claims have either a derivation, citation, or an example

## What to return to the user

- A complete list of generated Markdown files and where they should live in the Jekyll repo
- Any required site additions (KaTeX/Mermaid includes if not already present)
- A short “edit map” describing which LaTeX sections landed in which post
