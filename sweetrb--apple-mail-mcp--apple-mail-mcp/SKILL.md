## Usage Patterns

### Checking Email

When the user wants to see their inbox:

```
User: "Check my email"
Action: Use list-messages with mailbox="INBOX"

User: "Do I have any unread emails?"
Action: Use get-unread-count, then list-messages if they want details
```

### Finding Emails

When the user wants to find specific emails:

```
User: "Find emails from Sarah"
Action: Use search-messages with query="Sarah"

User: "Search for emails about the project deadline"
Action: Use search-messages with query="project deadline"
```

### Reading Emails

When the user wants to see email content:

```
User: "Show me that email from John"
Action: First search-messages to find it, then get-message with the ID
```

### Sending Emails

When the user wants to send an email:

```
User: "Send an email to bob@example.com about the meeting"
Action: Use send-email with to=["bob@example.com"], appropriate subject and body

User: "Draft an email to the team" (wants to review first)
Action: Use create-draft, then tell user to review in Mail.app
```

### Replying and Forwarding

When the user wants to respond to emails:

```
User: "Reply to that email"
Action: Use reply-to-message with the message ID and body

User: "Reply all with my thoughts"
Action: Use reply-to-message with replyAll=true

User: "Forward this to my colleague"
Action: Use forward-message with the message ID and recipient
```

### Organizing Email

When the user wants to organize:

```
User: "Mark that as read"
Action: Use mark-as-read with the message ID

User: "Move these newsletters to Archive"
Action: Use move-message with mailbox="Archive"

User: "Delete that spam"
Action: Use delete-message with the message ID
```

## Important Guidelines

1. **Message IDs**: All message operations require an ID. Get IDs from `list-messages` or `search-messages` first.
2. **Recipient Arrays**: The `to`, `cc`, and `bcc` parameters must be arrays, even for single recipients: `["email@example.com"]`
3. **Default Account**: Operations default to the first configured account. Use `account` parameter for others.
4. **Draft vs Send**: Use `create-draft` when the user wants to review before sending. Recommend this for important emails.
5. **Backslash Escaping**: When email content contains backslashes, escape them as `\\` in the JSON.
6. **macOS Only**: This skill only works on macOS systems.

## Error Handling

- **"Message not found"**: The message ID may be invalid or the message was deleted. Use search-messages to find it again.
- **"Permission denied"**: User needs to grant automation permission in System Preferences > Privacy & Security > Automation.
- **"Account not found"**: Account names are case-sensitive. Use list-accounts to see exact names.
- **"Failed to send"**: Check network connection and Mail.app configuration.

## Examples

### Quick inbox check
```
User: "Any important emails today?"
→ list-messages to see recent messages
→ Summarize senders and subjects for user
```

### Email workflow
```
User: "Reply to Sarah's email about the budget"
→ 1. search-messages query="Sarah budget"
→ 2. get-message to read content
→ 3. reply-to-message with user's response
```

### Safe sending pattern
```
User: "Send an email to the client about the delay"
→ 1. create-draft with the composed email
→ 2. Tell user: "I've created a draft. Please review it in Mail.app before sending."
```

### Multi-account usage
```
User: "Check my work email"
→ 1. list-accounts to find work account name
→ 2. list-messages with account="Work Exchange"
```
