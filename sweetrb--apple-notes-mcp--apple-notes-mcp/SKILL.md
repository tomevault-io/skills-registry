## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when the user:
- Wants to create a new note or save information
- Asks to find, search, or look up notes
- Wants to read the contents of a note
- Needs to update or edit an existing note
- Wants to delete or remove a note
- Asks to move or organize notes into folders
- Wants to list their notes or folders
- Mentions Apple Notes, Notes app, or "my notes"

## Available Tools

## Usage Patterns

### Creating Notes

When the user wants to save information:

```
User: "Save this meeting summary as a note"
Action: Use create-note with appropriate title and the content
```

```
User: "Create a shopping list note"
Action: Use create-note with title="Shopping List" and formatted content
```

### Finding Notes

When the user wants to find notes:

```
User: "Find my notes about the project"
Action: Use search-notes with query="project"
```

```
User: "Search for notes containing budget information"
Action: Use search-notes with query="budget" and searchContent=true
```

### Reading Notes

When the user wants to see note contents:

```
User: "Show me my shopping list"
Action: Use get-note-content with title="Shopping List"
```

### Updating Notes

When the user wants to modify a note:

```
User: "Add milk to my shopping list"
Action:
1. Use get-note-content to read current content
2. Use update-note with the updated content including "milk"
```

### Organizing Notes

When the user wants to organize:

```
User: "Move my old notes to Archive"
Action: Use move-note with the note title and folder="Archive"
```

```
User: "Create a Work folder"
Action: Use create-folder with name="Work"
```

## Important Guidelines

1. **Title Matching**: Note operations require exact title matches. If a note isn't found, suggest using `search-notes` first.

2. **Default Account**: Operations default to iCloud. Use the `account` parameter for other accounts (Gmail, Exchange).

3. **Content Format**: Notes store content as HTML. Plain text works fine for creation, but retrieved content may include HTML tags.

4. **Backslash Escaping**: When content contains backslashes, escape them as `\\` in the JSON.

5. **Password-Protected Notes**: Cannot be accessed via this skill. Inform the user if they try.

6. **macOS Only**: This skill only works on macOS systems.

## Error Handling

- **"Note not found"**: Use search-notes to find similar titles
- **"Permission denied"**: User needs to grant automation permission in System Preferences
- **"Folder not empty"**: Cannot delete folders with notes; move notes first

## Examples

### Save conversation to notes
```
User: "Save our conversation about the API design to my notes"
→ create-note with title="API Design Discussion" and summarized content
```

### Daily workflow
```
User: "What's on my todo list?"
→ search-notes with query="todo" or get-note-content with title="Todo"
```

### Multi-step organization
```
User: "Archive all my completed project notes"
→ 1. list-notes to find notes
→ 2. create-folder name="Archive" if needed
→ 3. move-note for each relevant note
```
