description: Guidance for structuring and maintaining repository instruction files across major agent entry points such as Copilot, Gemini, and Claude. Use when: designing the repo's instruction system, choosing a source of truth, or updating .github/copilot-instructions.md, GEMINI.md, and .claude/CLAUDE.md together. Use when this capability is needed.

# Agents Instructions Authoring

## Purpose

Provide portable defaults for designing maintainable repository instruction systems across the major agent entry points without duplicating the same workflow, policy, and routing text in every provider file.

## When to use this skill

- Creating or refactoring repo instruction files.
- Deciding where the source of truth for instructions should live.
- Adding Gemini or Claude support to a repo that already has Copilot instructions, or the reverse.
- Reviewing whether top-level instruction files still match the codebase and the skill catalog.

## Scope Boundaries

- Use this skill for the overall instruction architecture across providers.
- Use `./references/providers/copilot-instructions.md` for what belongs specifically in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.
- Use `./references/providers/gemini-instructions.md` for `GEMINI.md` bridge or provider-specific decisions.
- Use `./references/providers/claude-instructions.md` for `.claude/CLAUDE.md` bridge or provider-specific decisions.
- Use `.agents/skills/ref-agents-persona/SKILL.md` when the instruction system needs to preserve or refresh the repo's agent voice, interaction style, or escalation stance.
- Use `.agents/skills/ref-skills-authoring/SKILL.md` for authoring skills rather than top-level instruction files.
- Use `.agents/skills/tool-maintain-agents-instructions/SKILL.md` when the user wants a guided update workflow instead of just the reference guidance.

## Major Provider References

- GitHub Copilot: `./references/providers/copilot-instructions.md`
- Google Gemini: `./references/providers/gemini-instructions.md`
- Anthropic Claude: `./references/providers/claude-instructions.md`

## Defaults

- Choose one source-of-truth instruction file for the repo.
- Prefer `.github/copilot-instructions.md` as the source of truth when the repo already supports Copilot or needs a broadly readable markdown home.
- Use thin provider bridge files for Gemini and Claude by default rather than duplicating the full instruction set.
- Keep always-on repo rules in the source-of-truth file and move domain-specific detail into skills.
- Add provider-specific exceptions only when a real platform behavior requires them.

## Task Framing

| Command or action | What | Why | When | Expected outcome |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Choose the instruction source of truth | Decide which file owns the actual repo guidance. | Instruction systems drift quickly when several entry files all act authoritative. | When setting up or refactoring multi-provider support. | One file owns the real policy and workflow text. |
| Design the import bridge | Route other provider entry files back to the source-of-truth file with minimal local text. | Thin bridge files reduce duplication while preserving provider compatibility. | When the repo supports more than one AI entry point. | The provider files stay short and the effective guidance still matches. |
| Separate always-on rules from on-demand detail | Keep durable repo workflow and safety rules in the top-level instructions and move domain specifics into skills. | Bloated instruction files become harder to maintain and easier to contradict. | When top-level instructions start absorbing framework or language detail. | Instruction files stay durable and the skills remain discoverable. |

## Core Rules

### Source-of-truth model

- Make one file authoritative.
- If the repo already has a mature `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, keep it as the default source of truth unless there is a concrete reason not to.
- Avoid parallel hand-maintained instruction bodies across several provider files.

### Import bridge pattern

- In multi-provider repos, prefer a bridge pattern where the provider-specific entry files import or route back to the source-of-truth file.
- Keep bridge files minimal and readable.
- Use repo-root imports when the provider supports them so the bridge does not depend on folder depth.

### Provider-specific exceptions

- Add provider-specific text only when the platform has a real bootstrap requirement, limitation, or routing constraint.
- Keep the provider-specific exception narrow and then route back to the shared instructions.
- Do not duplicate the full workflow, command list, or policy text in the provider bridge file when a reference is enough.

### Maintenance

- Review top-level instructions when quick commands, workflow defaults, safety policy, or the skill catalog changes.
- If the repo adds or removes important skills, update both the skill inventory and the routing hints in the source-of-truth file.
- Keep instruction files aligned with generated policy files and provider settings when the repo uses them.

## Validation

- The repo has one clear instruction source of truth.
- Bridge files stay thin unless a provider-specific exception is genuinely required.
- Top-level instructions contain durable repo workflow and routing, not duplicated domain detail.
- The instruction files still match the current skills, commands, and policy model.

## References

- Read `./references/providers/copilot-instructions.md` for Copilot-specific source-of-truth guidance.
- Read `./references/providers/gemini-instructions.md` for `GEMINI.md` bridge guidance.
- Read `./references/providers/claude-instructions.md` for `.claude/CLAUDE.md` bridge guidance.
- Read `./references/checklist.md` for a quick multi-provider instruction review pass.
- Read `./references/import-bridge.md` when choosing between thin stubs, bridge files, and rare split-source patterns.
- Read `./assets/trigger-eval-queries.example.json` when testing trigger quality for instruction-authoring prompts.
- Review `./evals/evals.json` when validating output quality for source-of-truth and bridge recommendations.
