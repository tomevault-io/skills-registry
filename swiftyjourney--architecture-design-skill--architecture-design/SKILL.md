# Architecture & Design Principles Skill

Transform codebases into maintainable, testable, and scalable architectures using Clean Architecture principles, SOLID design patterns, and industry best practices from the Essential Developer methodology.

## Overview

This skill guides you through a structured 5-step process to:

1. **Analyze Requirements** → Identify components, responsibilities, and boundaries
2. **Apply SOLID Principles** → Design with SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP
3. **Define Clean Architecture** → Establish layers, boundaries, and dependency rules
4. **Design Testing Strategy** → Plan unit tests, integration tests, and test boundaries
5. **Document Decisions** → Create Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

## Core Philosophy

> "Good architecture is a byproduct of good team processes and communication"

This skill follows these principles:

- **Framework Independence** - Business logic doesn't depend on frameworks
- **Testability** - Architecture enables easy testing
- **UI Independence** - UI can change without affecting business rules
- **Database Independence** - Business rules don't know about the database
- **External Agency Independence** - Business rules don't depend on external services

## The 5-Step Process

### Step 1: Analyze Requirements

**Objective**: Identify components, responsibilities, and architectural boundaries

**Actions**:

1. Break down feature into distinct responsibilities
2. Identify core business logic vs infrastructure concerns
3. Recognize cross-cutting concerns (logging, analytics, caching)
4. Map data flow through the system
5. Identify potential architectural boundaries

**Key Questions to Ask**:

- What is the core business logic?
- What are the external dependencies (network, database, UI)?
- What needs to be testable in isolation?
- What components might change independently?
- What are the inputs and outputs of each component?

**Output**: Component diagram with clear responsibilities

**Reference**: See `references/modular_design.md` for component identification patterns

---

### Step 2: Apply SOLID Principles

**Objective**: Design components following SOLID principles

#### S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

Each class/module has one reason to change. Separate business logic from infrastructure.

- ❌ A class that loads data AND presents it
- ✅ Separate `UseCase` for business logic; separate `Presenter` for view logic

#### O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

Open for extension via protocols/interfaces, closed for modification:

```swift
// Open for extension via protocol (Swift example — same idea in any language)
protocol ItemLoader {
    func load() async throws -> [Item]
}

// Closed for modification — implementations extend behavior
final class RemoteItemLoader: ItemLoader { ... }
final class CachedItemLoader: ItemLoader { ... }
final class FallbackItemLoader: ItemLoader { ... }
```

#### L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

Subtypes must be substitutable for base types. Contracts must be honored by all implementations.

#### I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

Clients shouldn't depend on interfaces they don't use. Create focused, specific protocols.

- ❌ `protocol DataStore { func save(_:); func load(); func delete(); func migrate(); func backup() }`
- ✅ `protocol ItemReader { func retrieve() throws -> [Item]? }` + separate `ItemCache`

#### D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

High-level modules depend on abstractions, not concretions.

```swift
class ItemListViewController {
    private let loader: ItemLoader  // depends on abstraction, not concrete type
    init(loader: ItemLoader) { self.loader = loader }
}
```

**Output**: SOLID-compliant component design

**Reference**: See `references/solid_principles.md` for detailed patterns and anti-patterns

---

### Step 3: Define Clean Architecture

**Objective**: Establish clear architectural layers with proper dependency flow

**The Clean Architecture Layers**:

```plaintext
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│          Presentation Layer             │
│    (UI, ViewModels, Presenters)        │
└─────────────────┬───────────────────────┘
                  │ depends on
┌─────────────────▼───────────────────────┐
│         Domain/Business Layer           │
│      (Use Cases, Entities, Rules)      │
└─────────────────┬───────────────────────┘
                  │ depends on
┌─────────────────▼───────────────────────┐
│         Infrastructure Layer            │
│   (Network, Database, Framework Code)  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Dependency Rule**: Source code dependencies point **inward only**

**Key Patterns**:

1. **Use Cases** — contain business rules, orchestrate data flow, independent of UI and frameworks
2. **Boundaries (Protocols)** — define contracts between layers, enable testability
3. **Adapters** — convert data between layers, implement boundary protocols
4. **Composition Root** — wire dependencies together, configure the object graph

**Output**: Layered architecture with clear boundaries

**Reference**: See `references/clean_architecture.md` for detailed layer definitions; `examples/generic/layered_architecture.md` for a language-agnostic example; `examples/swift/` for Swift/iOS real implementations

---

### Step 4: Design Testing Strategy

**Objective**: Plan comprehensive testing at all architectural layers

**Testing Pyramid**:

```plaintext
        ┌──────────┐
        │    UI    │ Few - End to End
        ├──────────┤
        │Integration│ Some - Integration
        ├──────────┤
        │   Unit   │ Many - Fast & Isolated
        └──────────┘
```

**Testing Boundaries**:

1. **Domain Layer** (Unit Tests) — test use cases in isolation, mock all dependencies
2. **Infrastructure Layer** (Integration Tests) — test adapters with real dependencies
3. **Presentation Layer** (Unit Tests) — test presenters/view models, mock use cases

**Test Double Vocabulary**:

- **Stubs**: Provide canned answers
- **Spies**: Record calls for verification
- **Mocks**: Verify behavior expectations
- **Fakes**: Working implementations for testing

**Testing Strategies**:

- Test behavior, not implementation details
- Use native async test primitives; avoid manual callback synchronization when the language supports `await`
- Factory helper pattern: create the system under test (SUT) and its dependencies together in a `makeSUT()` helper to keep individual test methods clean
- Arrange, Act, Assert structure; extract helpers for clarity

**Output**: Comprehensive testing strategy document

**Reference**: See `references/testing_strategies.md` for patterns and best practices

---

### Step 5: Document Decisions

**Objective**: Create clear architectural documentation and decision records

**ADR Format**:

```
# ADR-NNN: <Decision Title>
## Status: Accepted | Superseded | Deprecated
## Context: Why this decision was needed
## Decision: What was decided
## Consequences: Positive and negative outcomes
## Alternatives Considered: What was rejected and why
```

See `examples/generic/` for a complete ADR example.

**Documentation Requirements**:

1. **Architecture Overview** — system context diagram, component diagram, layer relationships
2. **Component Documentation** — purpose, dependencies, usage examples
3. **Design Patterns Used** — which patterns and why, trade-offs
4. **Testing Strategy** — what gets tested and how

**Output**: Complete architectural documentation

**Reference**: See `references/` for detailed documentation patterns

---

## Best Practices

### DO ✅

- Separate business logic from infrastructure
- Depend on abstractions, not concretions
- Make dependencies explicit through initializer injection
- Write tests for all business logic
- Use async IO protocols at network/network boundaries; synchronous protocols for in-process storage
- Isolate presentation types to the main/UI thread using the language's concurrency primitives
- Design for testability from the start

### DON'T ❌

- Let business logic depend on frameworks
- Use singletons for dependency management
- Mix presentation and business logic
- Create god classes with multiple responsibilities
- Use manual callback/completion-handler patterns where the language's native async/await is available
- Dispatch to the UI thread manually — use structured concurrency instead

> **Swift/iOS:** Use `async throws` at network boundaries, sync `throws` at cache boundaries, `@MainActor` for presentation types, and `Sendable` for value types crossing actor boundaries. See the Swift Concurrency section below.

---

## Common Architectural Patterns

1. **Clean Architecture** (Recommended) — clear separation of concerns, dependency rule: inward only
2. **Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)** — business logic at the center, ports define boundaries
3. **MVVM** — separation of UI and logic, testable view models
4. **MVC** — traditional separation, controller as composition root

**Reference**: See `examples/generic/layered_architecture.md` for a language-agnostic layered example; `examples/swift/` for MVVM+Coordinator, Composition Root, and Two-Layer View in Swift/iOS

---

## Language-Specific Guidance

### Swift/iOS

- Use `async throws` protocols for network boundaries
- Use sync `throws` for cache/store boundaries; bridge to async via `Scheduler` protocol
- Apply `@MainActor` to presentation types (`ResourceView`, `LoadResourcePresenter`)
- Mark domain value types `Sendable` (e.g. `FeedImage: Hashable, Sendable`)
- Use `LoadResourcePresenter<Resource, View>` generic presenter — one type for all features
- Use `WeakRefVirtualProxy<T>` to break retain cycles without per-type boilerplate
- Apply Composition Root pattern in `SceneDelegate`; extract infrastructure into `@MainActor` service objects (see `examples/swift/composition_root.md`)

**Reference**: See `examples/swift/` for Swift-specific patterns

### Generic/Agnostic

- Apply SOLID principles universally
- Use interfaces/traits/protocols depending on language
- Adapt patterns to language features
- Maintain Clean Architecture layers

**Reference**: See `examples/generic/` for language-agnostic examples

---

## Swift Concurrency *(Swift/iOS only)*

> The concepts in this section — async IO boundaries, main-thread isolation, value-type thread safety, generic presenter, memory-safe proxies — apply universally. The syntax and APIs below are Swift-specific. For the detailed implementations, see `references/concurrency_patterns.md`.

### Async Protocol Boundaries

Network protocols use `async throws`; store protocols use sync `throws`:

```swift
// Network boundary — async because IO is inherently async
public protocol HTTPClient {
    func get(from url: URL) async throws -> (Data, HTTPURLResponse)
}

// Cache/store boundary — sync because the store runs on its own queue (bridged via Scheduler)
// Apply this pattern to any persistent store: CoreData, SQLite, in-memory, Realm, etc.
public protocol ItemStore {
    func delete() throws
    func insert(_ items: [LocalItem], timestamp: Date) throws
    func retrieve() throws -> CachedItems?
}
// Essential Feed uses FeedStore with identical structure for FeedImage caching
```

### @MainActor Isolation

Presentation layer types are `@MainActor` — no manual thread dispatching:

```swift
@MainActor public protocol ResourceView {
    associatedtype ResourceViewModel
    func display(_ viewModel: ResourceViewModel)
}

@MainActor public final class LoadResourcePresenter<Resource, View: ResourceView> {
    public typealias Mapper = (Resource) throws -> View.ResourceViewModel
    public init(resourceView: View, loadingView: ResourceLoadingView,
                errorView: ResourceErrorView, mapper: @escaping Mapper)
    public init(resourceView: View, loadingView: ResourceLoadingView,
                errorView: ResourceErrorView) where Resource == View.ResourceViewModel
    public func didStartLoading()
    public func didFinishLoading(with resource: Resource)
    public func didFinishLoading(with error: Error)
}
```

### Sendable Value Types

Domain entities crossing actor boundaries must be `Sendable`. All stored properties must themselves be `Sendable`; the compiler verifies this:

```swift
// Generic pattern — apply to any domain entity
public struct Item: Hashable, Sendable {
    public let id: UUID
    public let title: String
    // String, UUID, URL are all Sendable — compiler is satisfied
}

// Concrete example from Essential Feed:
// public struct FeedImage: Hashable, Sendable { ... }
```

### WeakRefVirtualProxy

Prevents retain cycles via a single generic type with conditional conformances:

```swift
final class WeakRefVirtualProxy<T: AnyObject> {
    private weak var object: T?
    init(_ object: T) { self.object = object }
}

extension WeakRefVirtualProxy: ResourceErrorView where T: ResourceErrorView {
    func display(_ viewModel: ResourceErrorViewModel) { object?.display(viewModel) }
}

extension WeakRefVirtualProxy: ResourceLoadingView where T: ResourceLoadingView {
    func display(_ viewModel: ResourceLoadingViewModel) { object?.display(viewModel) }
}
```

### Scheduler Protocol

Bridges sync `FeedStore` into async contexts without making the store async:

```swift
protocol Scheduler {
    @MainActor
    func schedule<T>(_ action: @escaping @Sendable () throws -> T) async rethrows -> T
}
```
