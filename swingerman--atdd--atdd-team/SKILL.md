# Team-Based ATDD Workflow

Orchestrate an agent team that follows the Acceptance Test Driven Development
workflow. The team lead coordinates specialist agents through five phases:
spec writing, spec review, pipeline generation, implementation, and
post-implementation review.

## Team Detection

Before creating a team, check for existing teams:

1. Read `~/.claude/teams/` to list active teams
2. If a team exists, present the user with a choice:
   - **Extend** — Add ATDD roles (spec-writer, implementer, reviewer) to the
     existing team. Skip roles that already exist by name.
   - **Replace** — Shut down the existing team and create a fresh ATDD team.
   - **New team** — Create a separate ATDD team alongside the existing one.

If no team exists, proceed directly to team creation.

## Roles

Create three teammates with these roles:

| Name | Agent Type | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| `spec-writer` | `general-purpose` | Writes Given/When/Then acceptance specs in domain language. Follows the atdd skill strictly. |
| `implementer` | `general-purpose` | Implements features using TDD. Unit tests first, then code, until both test streams pass. |
| `reviewer` | `general-purpose` | Reviews specs for implementation leakage. Reviews code for quality. Has the atdd plugin installed. Runs /atdd:spec-check. |

The **team lead** (the orchestrating agent or user) owns the workflow, reviews
specs, approves all work, and enforces discipline. The team lead never delegates
approval — specs are the team lead's contract.

## Workflow Phases

Execute phases strictly in order. Each phase has a gate that must pass before
proceeding to the next phase.

### Phase 1 — Spec Writing

**Assign to:** `spec-writer`

Send the feature description and instruct the spec-writer to:

1. Read the existing codebase to understand domain language
2. Write Given/When/Then specs in `specs/[feature-name].txt`
3. Use ONLY external observables — no implementation language
4. Follow the GWT format from the atdd skill (semicolon comments,
   periods at end of statements)
5. Send specs back for review before proceeding

**Gate:** Team lead reviews and approves specs. Do not proceed until approved.

For the detailed prompt template, see `references/prompts.md` — Phase 1.

### Phase 2 — Spec Review

**Assign to:** `reviewer`

Instruct the reviewer to audit specs for implementation leakage:

- Class names, function names, method names
- Database tables, columns, queries
- API endpoints, HTTP methods, status codes
- Framework terms (controller, service, repository)
- Internal state or data structures

Also verify: one behavior per spec, clarity for non-developers,
language portability.

**Gate:** Reviewer sends findings. Team lead decides whether specs need
revision. If revisions needed, return to Phase 1.

For the detailed prompt template, see `references/prompts.md` — Phase 2.

### Phase 3 — Pipeline Generation

**Assign to:** Team lead (self) or `implementer`

Generate or update the 3-stage test pipeline:

1. Parser — reads `specs/*.txt`, outputs IR
2. Generator — reads IR, produces runnable tests
3. Runner — `run-acceptance-tests.sh`

Run acceptance tests after generation. They **must fail** (red). If they pass,
either the behavior exists or the generator is wrong.

**Gate:** Acceptance tests fail as expected. Pipeline is functional.

For the detailed prompt template, see `references/prompts.md` — Phase 3.

### Phase 4 — Implementation

**Assign to:** `implementer`

Instruct the implementer to:

1. Run acceptance tests — confirm they fail
2. Pick the simplest failing acceptance test
3. Write a unit test, then minimal code to pass it
4. Refactor, repeat until that acceptance test passes
5. Move to next failing acceptance test
6. Continue until ALL acceptance + unit tests pass

**Rules for the implementer:**
- Never modify spec files — they are the contract
- Never modify generated test files — only regenerate
- If a spec seems wrong, stop and ask the team lead
- Report results of both test streams when done

**Gate:** Both test streams green. Implementer reports results.

For the detailed prompt template, see `references/prompts.md` — Phase 4.

### Phase 5 — Post-Implementation Review

**Assign to:** `reviewer`

Two reviews:

1. **Spec review** — Run /atdd:spec-check. Check if implementation details
   leaked into specs during development.
2. **Code review** — Check test quality, code structure, missing edge cases.

**Gate:** Reviews clean or issues addressed. Team lead approves.

For the detailed prompt template, see `references/prompts.md` — Phase 5.

### Phase 6 — Mutation Testing (Optional)

**Assign to:** `reviewer` or `implementer`

After both test streams are green and reviews pass, run mutation testing
to verify test quality:

1. Run `/atdd:mutate` to generate mutants and measure mutation score
2. Analyze surviving mutants — identify real test gaps vs. equivalent mutants
3. Run `/atdd:kill-mutants` to write targeted tests for survivors
4. Re-run mutations to confirm kills

**Gate:** Mutation score meets target (90%+ recommended). Remaining
survivors documented as equivalent mutants.

For the detailed prompt template, see `references/prompts.md` — Phase 6.

## After Completion

When all phases pass:

1. Run both test streams one final time to confirm green
2. Ask the user whether to commit (do not auto-commit)
3. Ask whether to iterate with the next feature (return to Phase 1)
   or shut down the team

## Tips for Team Leads

- **Never delegate spec approval.** Specs are the team lead's contract.
- **Run spec-check twice** — before and after implementation.
- **Test portability.** Verify specs would work for a different implementation language.
- **Scope tightly.** One feature per cycle. Do not spec the whole system.
- **Verify both streams personally** before accepting the implementer's work.
- **Keep the team informed.** When revising specs after review, notify the
  implementer so they don't work against stale specs.
