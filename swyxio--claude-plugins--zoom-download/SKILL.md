# Zoom Cloud Recording Download

## Overview
Download recent Zoom cloud recordings, selecting the correct file type and skipping already-uploaded content. Optionally delete old recordings from Zoom after confirming they've been uploaded.

## Which Recordings to Download
- **"AI in Action Weekly Jam!"** meetings → weekly demos/presentations
- **Paper Club / guest sessions** (e.g., "[Person] and swyx") → paper readings
- **Skip** recordings under ~10 minutes (test calls, false starts)
- **Cross-check** against existing YouTube content to avoid re-downloading

## Choosing the Correct File Type
**CRITICAL**: Zoom offers 6+ file types per recording. Always download:

| File Type | Download? | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Shared screen with gallery view | **YES** | Screen share + all webcams |
| Gallery view | NO | Webcams only, no screen share |
| Shared screen with speaker view | NO | Only shows active speaker |
| Speaker view | NO | Single speaker webcam |
| Audio only | NO | No video |
| Chat file | NO | Text chat log |

### Filename Identification
- **Correct**: `GMT[date]_Recording_gallery_[resolution].mp4` — the `_gallery_` suffix (NOT `_gvo_`)
- **Wrong**: `GMT[date]_Recording_gvo_[resolution].mp4` — `_gvo_` = gallery view only = no screen share

### How to Download
1. Navigate to `zoom.us/recording` (log in via Google SSO if needed)
2. On each recording's detail page, locate the **"Shared screen with gallery view"** row
3. Hover over the row to reveal the download button (appears on the right)
4. Click download — file saves to ~/Downloads
5. Wait for download to complete before moving to the next recording

## Content Analysis via Frame Extraction
After downloading, extract frames to understand what each video contains:

```bash
# Extract 7 frames at ~5 min intervals (covers a ~1hr video)
for t in 60 300 600 1200 1800 2400 3000; do
  ffmpeg -ss $t -i "video_file.mp4" -vframes 1 -q:v 2 "frame_${t}s.jpg" -y 2>/dev/null
done
```

Visually analyze the extracted frames to identify:
- **Slide titles** and presentation content
- **Presenter names** (from Zoom name labels in gallery view)
- **Paper titles**, arxiv links, or references visible on screen
- **Demo names** and tools being shown
- **Participant names** visible in the gallery

Save these notes — they feed into the `youtube-publish` skill for titling and description.

## Deleting Old Recordings from Zoom
After confirming videos are successfully uploaded and published on YouTube:
- Navigate back to `zoom.us/recording`
- Select the recordings that have been uploaded
- User must perform the actual deletion (permanent deletion is a prohibited action)
- Inform the user which recordings are safe to delete

## Troubleshooting
- **Multiple recordings for same meeting**: Zoom sometimes splits long meetings. Download all parts.
- **"Shared screen with gallery view" not available**: The host may not have shared their screen. Download "Gallery view" as a fallback and note this in the YouTube description.
- **Large files (>2GB)**: Downloads may take several minutes. Don't start the next download until the current one finishes.
