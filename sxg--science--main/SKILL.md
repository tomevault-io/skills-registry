# Scientific Manuscript Writer

Orchestrates the creation of scientific manuscript drafts through a structured, note-generating workflow.

## Core Principle: No Silent Assumptions

**This skill NEVER makes assumptions about user data without explicit confirmation.**

When encountering ambiguity in data, code, or figures:
1. **STOP** and ask the user for clarification
2. **DOCUMENT** all clarifications received
3. **VERIFY** interpretations before drafting

It is better to ask too many questions than to misinterpret the user's research. Every clarification is logged in the relevant notes files for transparency.

## Specialist Agents

This skill employs specialist agents for domain expertise:

| Agent | Role | Invoked During |
|-------|------|----------------|
| **Statistical Reviewer** | Statistical accuracy review | Methods, Results |
| **Academic Reviewer** | Publication readiness review | Before Assembly |

### Statistical Reviewer Agent

The statistical reviewer (`agents/statistical-reviewer.md`) ensures:
- Appropriate statistical test selection
- Assumption checking and validation
- Correct statistical reporting format
- Effect sizes with confidence intervals
- Multiple comparison handling

**No statistical claims are published without statistical reviewer sign-off.**

### Academic Reviewer Agent

The academic reviewer (`agents/academic-reviewer.md`) acts as a skeptical peer reviewer:
- Verifies every claim is supported by its cited reference
- Validates the hypothesis is scientifically meaningful and testable
- Confirms methods actually test the stated hypothesis
- **Independently interprets results** before reading Discussion
- Identifies discrepancies between evidence and author conclusions
- Flags overstatements and unsupported claims
- Routes issues to other agents or user for resolution

**No manuscript proceeds to final assembly without academic reviewer approval.**

## Expected Project Structure

User must organize their project folder as follows:

```
project/
├── papers/              # PDF files of relevant literature
│   ├── smith-2023.pdf
│   ├── jones-2022.pdf
│   └── ...
├── data/                # Raw data outputs (CSV, Excel)
│   ├── results.csv
│   ├── demographics.csv
│   └── ...
├── figures/             # Generated figures (PNG, JPG, SVG)
│   ├── figure1.png
│   ├── figure2.png
│   └── ...
├── ethics/              # OPTIONAL - Ethics/governance documents (.pdf, .docx, .md)
│   ├── protocol.pdf     # Approved protocol (IRB, IACUC, ethics committee, etc.)
│   └── amendments/      # Optional protocol amendments
└── config.md            # Project configuration (see template below)
```

### Ethics Documents (Optional)

If provided, ethics/governance documents enable:
- **Auto-populated ethics statement** in final manuscript
- **Scope comparison checkpoint** during scoping (catches discrepancies early)
- **Cross-reference validation** in Methods and Results (ensures consistency)

Supports: IRB protocols, IACUC approvals, ethics committee decisions, data governance agreements.

Supported formats: PDF, Word (.docx), Markdown (.md)

### config.md Template

```markdown
# Project Configuration

## GitHub Repository
url: https://github.com/username/repo-name
branch: main
access: private  # or public

## Constraints
word_limit: 3500

## Additional Notes
[Any other context for the manuscript]
```

## Output Structure

The skill generates intermediate notes and drafts:

```

│   ├── papers/              # Condensed notes per PDF (via subagent)
│   │   ├── smith-2023.md

├── drafts/
│   ├── introduction.md
│   ├── methods.md
│   ├── results.md
│   ├── discussion.md
│   └── abstract.md
├── inventory.md             # What's available in project
├── scope.md                 # Research question, findings, constraints
└── manuscript.md            # Final assembled draft
```

## Entry Points

The workflow supports multiple entry points:

| Command | Starts At | Use When |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| `/writer:draft` | Step 1 | Full workflow from scratch |
| `/writer:literature` | Step 3 | Scope exists, need lit review |
| `/writer:methods` | Step 4 | Need to analyze code only |
| `/writer:results` | Step 5 | Need to interpret data only |
| `/writer:synthesize` | Step 6 | All drafts exist, need Discussion |
| `/writer:assemble` | Step 7 | All sections drafted, need final doc |
