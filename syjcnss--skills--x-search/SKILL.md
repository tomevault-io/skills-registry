# X Search

Search X (Twitter) posts using xAI's Grok API with keyword search, semantic search, user filtering, and date range capabilities.

## Instructions for Agents

When invoking this skill:

1. **Execute the script** using the Bash tool with appropriate parameters based on the user's request
2. **Parse the output** which contains both the analysis and citations sections
3. **CRITICAL**: Always include the citations in your response to the user. The script output contains a "Citations:" section with numbered X post URLs that MUST be presented to the user
4. **Format your response** to include:
   - The analysis/findings from Grok
   - The complete citations list with all referenced post URLs

The script will return formatted output with citations. You MUST include these citations in your response to the user.

## Quick Start

Basic X search:

```bash
scripts/x_search.sh "What are people saying about AI?"
```

## Environment Setup

Required environment variables:
- `XAI_API_KEY`: Your xAI API key (required)
- `XAI_API_HOST`: API host URL (optional, defaults to https://api.x.ai)

## Search Options

### Date Range Filtering

Restrict search to specific time period:

```bash
scripts/x_search.sh "AI developments" --from-date 2025-01-01 --to-date 2025-02-06
```

### User Handle Filtering

Search only specific users (max 10):

```bash
scripts/x_search.sh "latest updates" --allowed-handles elonmusk,gdb
```

Exclude specific users (max 10):

```bash
scripts/x_search.sh "tech news" --excluded-handles spamaccount,bot123
```

Note: Cannot use both `--allowed-handles` and `--excluded-handles` in the same request.

### Media Understanding

Enable image analysis in posts:

```bash
scripts/x_search.sh "AI art trends" --enable-images
```

Enable video analysis in posts:

```bash
scripts/x_search.sh "product demos" --enable-videos
```

### Combined Options

All options can be combined:

```bash
scripts/x_search.sh "climate change discussion" \
  --from-date 2025-01-01 \
  --excluded-handles climateskeptic \
  --enable-images
```

### Enable Reasoning Model

Use `--thinking` flag to switch to the reasoning model for deeper analysis:

```bash
scripts/x_search.sh "complex topic requiring deep analysis" --thinking
```

This uses `grok-4-1-fast-reasoning` instead of the default `grok-4-1-fast-non-reasoning`.

## Output Format

The script automatically parses the JSON response and outputs:
1. **Text content**: Grok's formatted analysis and findings
2. **Citations**: List of X post URLs with reference numbers

Example output:
```
## Response:

[Analysis text with inline citation markers]

## Citations:
[1] https://x.com/i/status/...
[2] https://x.com/i/status/...
```

## Usage Notes

- Default model: `grok-4-1-fast-non-reasoning` for fast search responses
- With `--thinking` flag: `grok-4-1-fast-reasoning` for deeper reasoning
- The script uses curl to query the xAI Responses API endpoint
- Output is automatically parsed with jq for readability
- Date format: ISO8601 (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Handle limits: 10 maximum for allowed/excluded lists
