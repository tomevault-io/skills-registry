**Success criteria:**
- Current capability coverage mapped with evidence
- Gaps identified with clear justification
- Relationships between existing and missing capabilities documented
- Prioritized roadmap for new skill development
- Audit trail of analysis process

**Compatible schemas:**
- `reference/capability_ontology.yaml`
- `reference/workflow_catalog.yaml`

**Evidence pattern:** Ontology comparison, dependency graph analysis, impact-based prioritization.

## Verification

- [ ] **Coverage Analyzed**: All capabilities in scope examined
- [ ] **Gaps Documented**: Each gap has layer classification and priority
- [ ] **Relationships Mapped**: Dependencies and missing connections identified
- [ ] **Comparison Complete**: Alignment score computed against reference
- [ ] **Roadmap Generated**: Phased plan with dependencies
- [ ] **Audit Trail**: Analysis methodology documented

**Verification tools:** Read (for ontology files), Grep (for capability search), Bash (for validation)

## Safety Constraints

- `mutation`: false
- `requires_checkpoint`: false
- `requires_approval`: false
- `risk`: low

**Capability-specific rules:**
- Do not create new skills during analysis (discovery only)
- Validate all capability references against ontology
- Document assumptions about missing capabilities
- Flag potential security implications of gaps
- Preserve existing ontology structure

## Composition Patterns

**Commonly follows:**
- `inspect` - After initial codebase exploration
- `retrieve` - After fetching reference documentation

**Commonly precedes:**
- `generate-plan` - To create detailed skill specifications
- `prioritize` - To refine gap prioritization
- `summarize` - To create executive summary

**Anti-patterns:**
- Never skip relationship mapping before prioritization
- Never propose skills without checking ontology for existing alternatives
- Never prioritize without defined criteria
- Never generate roadmap without dependency analysis

**Workflow references:**
- See `reference/workflow_catalog.yaml#gap-analysis-workflow` for step definitions
- See `reference/capability_ontology.yaml` for reference structure
