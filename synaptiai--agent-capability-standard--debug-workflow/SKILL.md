## Intent

Run the composed workflow **debug-workflow** using atomic capability skills to systematically debug code changes with full safety and audit capabilities.

**Success criteria:**
- Every step output is grounded with evidence anchors
- Safety gates are respected (checkpoint before any mutation)
- All issues are traced to root cause with supporting evidence
- Final result includes complete audit trail
- Rollback pathway documented and verified

**Compatible schemas:**
- `reference/workflow_catalog.yaml`

## Inputs

| Parameter | Required | Type | Description |
|-----------|----------|------|-------------|
| `goal` | Yes | string | The debugging objective (e.g., "identify why tests fail after refactor") |
| `scope` | Yes | string\|array | Files, directories, or components to investigate |
| `constraints` | No | object | Hard limits (e.g., time budget, files to exclude, severity threshold) |
| `prior_context` | No | object | Previous debugging attempts or known information |

## Procedure

0) **Create checkpoint marker** if mutation might occur:
   - Create `.claude/checkpoint.ok` after confirming rollback strategy

1) **Invoke `/inspect`** and store output as `inspect_out`
   - Examine the scope for symptoms, error patterns, recent changes

2) **Invoke `/search`** and store output as `search_out`
   - Find related code, error messages, similar patterns

3) **Invoke `/map-relationships`** and store output as `map-relationships_out`
   - Map dependencies, call graphs, data flows

4) **Invoke `/model-schema`** and store output as `model-schema_out`
   - Model the expected vs actual behavior

5) **Invoke `/critique`** and store output as `critique_out`
   - Critically analyze hypotheses, identify weak points

6) **Invoke `/plan`** and store output as `plan_out`
   - Create remediation plan with verification criteria

7) **Invoke `/act-plan`** and store output as `act-plan_out`
   - Execute the fix with checkpoint protection

8) **Invoke `/verify`** and store output as `verify_out`
   - Confirm fix addresses root cause

9) **Invoke `/audit`** and store output as `audit_out`
   - Record all actions and evidence for audit trail

10) **Invoke `/rollback`** if needed and store output as `rollback_out`
    - Restore previous state if verification fails

```

**Evidence pattern:** Combined code inspection, git blame for change attribution, test execution for verification.

## Verification

- [ ] **Step Completeness**: All 10 workflow steps executed with output
- [ ] **Evidence Grounding**: Every step output includes evidence_anchors
- [ ] **Checkpoint Created**: Mutation steps preceded by checkpoint
- [ ] **Root Cause Identified**: root_cause has specific description and evidence
- [ ] **Verification Passed**: verify_out.result is PASS before completion
- [ ] **Audit Trail**: audit_log_pointer points to valid log file
- [ ] **Rollback Ready**: rollback_command documented if changes made

**Verification tools:** Bash (for test execution), Git (for change verification), Read (for audit log)

## Safety Constraints

- `mutation`: true
- `requires_checkpoint`: true
- `requires_approval`: false
- `risk`: high

**Capability-specific rules:**
- NEVER proceed to `act-plan` without checkpoint and explicit plan
- STOP and request clarification if any step produces confidence < 0.3
- ALWAYS verify fix before marking workflow complete
- Document rollback command before any mutation
- Preserve original error state for comparison

## Composition Patterns

**Commonly follows:**
- `receive` - After receiving bug report or error notification
- `retrieve` - After fetching relevant context or logs

**Commonly precedes:**
- `summarize` - To create debug report for stakeholders
- `send` - To notify team of resolution

**Anti-patterns:**
- Never skip `/inspect` to jump directly to `/plan`
- Never proceed past `/critique` without addressing identified weaknesses
- Never execute `/act-plan` without prior `/checkpoint`
- Never mark complete without `/verify` confirmation

**Workflow references:**
- See `reference/workflow_catalog.yaml#debug-workflow` for step definitions
- See `reference/composition_patterns.md#checkpoint-act-verify-rollback` for CAVR pattern
