## Intent

Delegate a complex task to one or more subagents by defining clear contracts, input/output interfaces, and strategies for merging results. Ensure coordinated execution with conflict resolution.

**Success criteria:**
- Task decomposed into delegatable subtasks
- Each subtask has explicit contract (inputs, outputs, constraints)
- Interface between tasks is well-defined
- Merge strategy handles conflicts and failures
- Dependencies between subtasks are clear

**Compatible schemas:**
- `schemas/output_schema.yaml`

## Inputs

| Parameter | Required | Type | Description |
|-----------|----------|------|-------------|
| `task` | Yes | string or object | The overall task to delegate |
| `agents` | No | array | Available agents/workers for delegation |
| `constraints` | No | object | Global constraints (timeout, resource limits) |
| `merge_strategy` | No | string | How to combine results (first_wins, consensus, aggregate) |
| `failure_policy` | No | string | What to do on subtask failure (abort, continue, retry) |

## Procedure

1) **Analyze task**: Understand the overall objective
   - Identify the goal and success criteria
   - Determine if task is parallelizable
   - Identify shared state or resources
   - Assess complexity and scope

2) **Decompose into subtasks**: Break into delegatable units
   - Each subtask should be independently executable
   - Minimize dependencies between subtasks
   - Identify natural parallelization boundaries
   - Use `decompose` capability patterns

3) **Define contracts**: Specify expectations for each subtask
   - Input: what data/context each subtask receives
   - Output: what each subtask must produce
   - Constraints: limits on time, resources, scope
   - Verification: how to check subtask completion

4) **Design interfaces**: Specify data flow between subtasks
   - Format of inputs and outputs
   - Required fields and optional extensions
   - Error formats and status codes
   - Handoff protocols

5) **Plan merge strategy**: How to combine results
   - Handle successful completions
   - Resolve conflicts between subtask outputs
   - Aggregate partial results
   - Determine final output format

6) **Handle failures**: Define recovery behavior
   - What happens if a subtask fails
   - Retry policies and limits
   - Fallback strategies
   - Partial result handling

7) **Establish coordination**: Define execution order
   - Parallel vs sequential execution
   - Dependency ordering
   - Synchronization points
   - Progress tracking

## Output Contract

Return a structured object:

```yaml
delegation:
  task: string  # Original task description
  delegated_to: array  # List of agents/subtasks
  status: pending | running | completed | failed
subtasks:
  - id: string  # Subtask identifier
    agent: string  # Assigned agent
    contract:
      inputs: object  # What subtask receives
      outputs: object  # What subtask must produce
      constraints: object  # Limits and requirements
      verification: string  # How to verify completion
    dependencies: array[string]  # Subtask IDs this depends on
    status: pending | running | completed | failed
    result: object | null  # Subtask output when complete
interfaces:
  - from: string  # Source subtask
    to: string  # Destination subtask
    format: object  # Data format specification
    required_fields: array[string]
merge_plan:
  strategy: first_wins | consensus | aggregate | custom
  conflict_resolution: string  # How to handle conflicts
  final_output_format: object  # Expected merged result
failure_handling:
  policy: abort | continue | retry
  max_retries: integer
  fallback: string | null
handoff_context:
  - key: string  # Context key
    value: object  # Shared context data
confidence: 0..1
evidence_anchors: ["task:analysis", "agent:capability"]
assumptions: []
```

        files: ["src/**/*.ts"]
        focus: "security"
      outputs:
        issues: "array of {severity, file, line, description}"

```

## Verification

- [ ] All subtasks have complete contracts
- [ ] Dependencies form a valid DAG
- [ ] Interfaces are compatible between connected subtasks
- [ ] Merge strategy handles all expected outputs
- [ ] Failure handling is defined

**Verification tools:** Read (for contract validation)

## Safety Constraints

- `mutation`: false
- `requires_checkpoint`: false
- `requires_approval`: false
- `risk`: low

**Capability-specific rules:**
- Never delegate without explicit contracts
- Ensure all subtasks have verification criteria
- Define failure handling before delegation
- Validate interface compatibility
- Do not delegate tasks requiring approval without noting it

## Composition Patterns

**Commonly follows:**
- `plan` - Delegation is often part of plan execution (REQUIRES plan)
- `decompose` - Break task before delegating
- `prioritize` - Order subtasks by importance

**Commonly precedes:**
- `synchronize` - Merge results from delegated subtasks
- `verify` - Check all subtasks completed correctly
- `audit` - Record delegation and outcomes

**Anti-patterns:**
- Never delegate without failure handling
- Never delegate mutating tasks without noting safety requirements
- Avoid circular dependencies between subtasks

**Workflow references:**
- See `reference/composition_patterns.md#enrichment-pipeline` for parallel delegation
