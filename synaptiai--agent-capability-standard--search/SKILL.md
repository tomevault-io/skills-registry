## Live Context

Available search context:

- Current directory: !`pwd`
- File types available: !`find . -type f -not -path './.git/*' 2>/dev/null | sed 's/.*\.//' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -10`
- Total searchable files: !`find . -type f -not -path './.git/*' 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' '`
- Common directories: !`find . -type d -maxdepth 2 -not -path './.git/*' 2>/dev/null | head -10`
- README files: !`find . -name 'README*' -not -path './.git/*' 2>/dev/null | head -5`

## Intent

Execute **search** to find relevant information when you don't know exactly where to look. Unlike `retrieve` (which fetches known items), search explores under uncertainty and ranks results by relevance.

**Success criteria:**
- Relevant results are found and ranked
- Search strategy is appropriate for the domain
- Coverage is sufficient for the use case
- Results include relevance scores and evidence
- False positives are minimized

**World Modeling Context:**
Search feeds into the **State Layer** by discovering entities and observations to include in `world-state`. It supports the **Identity & Continuity Layer** by finding candidate matches for `identity-resolution`.

**Compatible schemas:**
- `schemas/output_schema.yaml`

## Inputs

| Parameter | Required | Type | Description |
|-----------|----------|------|-------------|
| `query` | Yes | string | What to search for (natural language or structured) |
| `sources` | No | array | Where to search: `repo`, `web`, `docs`, `database` (default: infer) |
| `constraints` | No | object | Time bounds, file types, domains, result limits |
| `ranking_criteria` | No | string | `relevance`, `recency`, `authority` (default: relevance) |

## Procedure

1) **Parse query**: Understand what the user is looking for
   - Extract key terms and concepts
   - Identify entity types being sought
   - Determine search intent (existence, discovery, comparison)
   - Expand with synonyms or related terms if appropriate

2) **Select search strategy**: Based on sources and query type
   - **Code/repo search**: Use Grep patterns, file globs
   - **Web search**: Use web search tools with keywords
   - **Documentation**: Search docs directories, README files
   - **Semantic**: Expand query with related concepts

3) **Construct search queries**: Formulate effective queries
   - For Grep: Build regex patterns that balance precision/recall
   - For web: Use keywords, exclude noise terms
   - Apply filters (file type, date range, domain)

4) **Execute searches**: Run queries across sources
   - Use multiple query variations if first returns poor results
   - Apply pagination for comprehensive coverage
   - Track which queries were tried

5) **Collect and deduplicate results**: Aggregate findings
   - Merge results from multiple sources
   - Remove duplicates (same content, different paths)
   - Note source and search method for each result

6) **Rank results**: Score by relevance and other criteria
   - **Term match**: How well result matches query
   - **Authority**: Source credibility, recency
   - **Context**: Relevance to broader task
   - **Uniqueness**: Information not found elsewhere

7) **Extract key information**: For top results
   - Relevant snippets that match query
   - Metadata (file, date, author)
   - Context around the match

8) **Assess coverage**: Evaluate search completeness
   - What portion of relevant sources were searched?
   - Any known blind spots?
   - Suggest additional searches if coverage is poor

## Verification

- [ ] All returned results have valid evidence anchors
- [ ] Relevance scores are between 0.0 and 1.0
- [ ] Coverage assessment identifies blind spots
- [ ] Search strategy is documented
- [ ] Suggested next searches address coverage gaps

**Verification tools:** Link validators, file existence checks

## Safety Constraints

- `mutation`: false
- `requires_checkpoint`: false
- `requires_approval`: false
- `risk`: low

**Capability-specific rules:**
- Do not search paths marked as sensitive
- Rate-limit web searches appropriately
- Flag when search coverage is < 50%
- Distinguish authoritative from user-generated sources

## Composition Patterns

**Commonly follows:**
- None typically - search is often a starting point
- May follow `inspect` when inspection reveals knowledge gaps

**Commonly precedes:**
- `retrieve` - After finding, retrieve full content
- `world-state` - Search results inform state construction
- `identity-resolution` - Find candidate entities to resolve
- `grounding` - Search for evidence to ground claims

**Anti-patterns:**
- Avoid searching when exact path is known (use `retrieve`)
- Never search without considering coverage limitations

**Workflow references:**
- See `reference/composition_patterns.md#world-model-build` for search in model construction
- See `reference/composition_patterns.md#debug-code-change` for search during debugging
