## Intent

Execute mental simulations of scenarios to explore outcomes without making real changes. This capability enables safe exploration of "what-if" questions and helps identify risks before action.

**Success criteria:**
- Scenario executed through logical steps
- Multiple outcomes considered
- Key decision points identified
- Assumptions made explicit

**Compatible schemas:**
- `schemas/output_schema.yaml`

## Inputs

| Parameter | Required | Type | Description |
|-----------|----------|------|-------------|
| `scenario` | Yes | object | Scenario to simulate (intervention, change, event) |
| `initial_state` | No | object | Starting state for simulation |
| `steps` | No | integer | Number of simulation steps/iterations |
| `explore` | No | string | What to explore: single_path, branches, exhaustive |

## Procedure

1) **Set up scenario**: Define what is being simulated
   - Clarify the intervention or change being tested
   - Establish initial conditions
   - Define simulation boundaries

2) **Initialize state**: Establish starting point
   - Use provided initial_state or current system state
   - Validate state is consistent
   - Note any simplifications

3) **Execute simulation**: Step through scenario
   - Apply changes specified in scenario
   - Propagate effects through state
   - Track state at each step

4) **Explore branches**: Consider alternative paths
   - Identify decision points
   - Explore likely alternative outcomes
   - Note probability of each branch

5) **Evaluate outcomes**: Assess simulation results
   - Compare final states across branches
   - Identify risks and opportunities
   - Note unexpected behaviors

6) **Document simulation**: Record process and results
   - List assumptions made
   - Note limitations of simulation
   - Provide evidence for conclusions

## Verification

- [ ] Scenario clearly defined
- [ ] At least one outcome path explored
- [ ] Probabilities assigned to outcomes
- [ ] Key assumptions documented
- [ ] Insights identify actionable findings

**Verification tools:** Read (to verify model components)

## Safety Constraints

- `mutation`: false
- `requires_checkpoint`: false
- `requires_approval`: false
- `risk`: low

**Capability-specific rules:**
- Simulation does not modify real state
- Note when model may be incomplete
- Flag high-uncertainty outcomes
- Do not present simulation as prediction

## Composition Patterns

**Commonly follows:**
- `state` - State model provides simulation basis
- `transition` - Transition rules drive simulation
- `plan` - Simulate plan outcomes before execution

**Commonly precedes:**
- `compare` - Compare simulation outcomes
- `plan` - Inform planning with simulation insights
- `critique` - Critique designs based on simulation

**Anti-patterns:**
- Never treat simulation as certainty (use `verify` for real testing)
- Avoid simulating without state/transition models

**Workflow references:**
- See `reference/workflow_catalog.yaml#world_model_build` for simulation in modeling
