# Proactive Recall

This skill establishes the practice of checking local-recall memories before making significant decisions.

## Core Principle

**Search memories BEFORE proposing solutions.** Past decisions, preferences, and reasoning patterns provide valuable context that should inform current work.

## When to Search Memories Proactively

### Always Search Before

1. **Architectural decisions** - "Should we use X or Y pattern?"
   - Search: `episodic_search(query: "architecture pattern decision")`
   - Previous decisions may have rationale that still applies

2. **Implementation approaches** - "How should we implement this feature?"
   - Search: `episodic_search(query: "feature implementation approach")`
   - Search: `thinking_search(query: "implementing similar feature")`
   - Past implementations may reveal patterns or pitfalls

3. **Library/tool selection** - "Which library should we use?"
   - Search: `episodic_search(query: "library selection criteria")`
   - Previous selections may have documented reasoning

4. **Debugging complex issues** - "Why is this failing?"
   - Search: `thinking_search(query: "debugging similar error")`
   - Search: `episodic_search(query: "bug fix root cause")`
   - Similar issues may have been solved before

5. **Refactoring decisions** - "How should we restructure this?"
   - Search: `episodic_search(query: "refactoring approach")`
   - Past refactoring decisions provide context

6. **Configuration changes** - "What should this setting be?"
   - Search: `episodic_search(query: "configuration setting")`
   - Settings often have non-obvious rationale

## Search Strategy

### Step 1: Identify the Decision Domain

Before searching, identify:
- What type of decision is being made?
- What terms would describe similar past decisions?
- Are there specific files or areas involved?

### Step 2: Search Both Memory Types

**Episodic memories** for facts and decisions:
```
episodic_search(query: "relevant terms for the decision")
```

**Thinking memories** for reasoning patterns:
```
thinking_search(query: "how to approach similar problem")
```

### Step 3: Apply Scope Filters When Relevant

For file-specific decisions:
```
episodic_search(query: "decision about X", scope: "file:src/path/to/file.ts")
```

For area-specific decisions:
```
episodic_search(query: "authentication approach", scope: "area:auth")
```

### Step 4: Synthesize and Apply

- Consider how past decisions apply to current context
- Note if circumstances have changed since past decisions
- Reference relevant memories when explaining recommendations

## What to Remember After Decisions

After making significant decisions, create memories for future reference:

```
episodic_create(
  subject: "Decision: chose X over Y for Z reason",
  keywords: ["decision", "architecture", "specific-terms"],
  applies_to: "global",
  content: "## Decision\n\nChose X because...\n\n## Alternatives Considered\n\n- Y: rejected because...\n\n## Context\n\nThis decision was made when..."
)
```

Good decisions to memorize:
- Architectural patterns chosen and why
- Libraries selected and alternatives rejected
- Configuration values with non-obvious rationale
- Bug fixes with root cause analysis
- User preferences expressed during the session

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Proposing solutions without checking memory** - Always search first
2. **Ignoring relevant memories** - Past context exists for a reason
3. **Assuming fresh context** - The project has history; use it
4. **Not creating memories** - Important decisions should be recorded

## Integration with Decision-Making

When facing a decision:

1. **Pause** - Before proposing anything
2. **Search** - Query both episodic and thinking memories
3. **Review** - Consider how past context applies
4. **Propose** - Make recommendations informed by history
5. **Record** - Create memories for significant new decisions
