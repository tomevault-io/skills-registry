# alto.index Data

alto.index is a macOS app that syncs data from Apple apps to `~/Documents/alto-index/` as markdown files. This skill teaches you how to work with the synced data.

## Base Path

All data lives in `~/Documents/alto-index/`. Each data source has its own subfolder with a `CLAUDE.md` containing source-specific details. Always read the relevant `CLAUDE.md` first when working with a source you haven't seen yet.

## Native App Links

Most exported files contain deep links back to the original item in the native macOS app. When referencing any item, always include the native link so the user can click through to the source app. The link is typically in the frontmatter `link` or `source` field, or at the bottom of the file body. Supported link schemes: `notes://`, `x-apple-reminder://`, `addressbook://`, `calshow:`.

## Data Sources

### notes/

Apple Notes exported as markdown files.

- path: `notes/{folder}/{title}.md`
- folders match Apple Notes folder names, nested folders supported
- frontmatter: title, id, created, modified, folder, attachments, links, source
- deep link: `notes://showNote?identifier={uuid}` (in `source` field)
- body contains the note content in markdown, with a link back to the original note at the bottom

### reminders/

Apple Reminders (active/non-completed only).

- path: `reminders/{list}/{title}.md`

### safari-bookmarks/

Safari bookmarks as markdown lists.

## Working with the Data

### Reading data
- use Glob to find files: `~/Documents/alto-index/notes/**/*.md`
- use Grep to search across sources: search in `~/Documents/alto-index/`
- read individual files with Read tool
- always check for a CLAUDE.md in the subfolder for source-specific guidance

### Cross-referencing
- contact names in reminders/calendar/messages can be resolved via contacts/
- dates can be cross-referenced across calendar, reminders, notes (by modified date), safari history, and granola meetings
- reminder URLs may link to relevant websites or resources
- safari history can provide context for what you were researching on a given day

### Deep links
- notes: `notes://showNote?identifier={uuid}`
- reminders: `x-apple-reminder://{reminder_id}`
- contacts: `addressbook://{contact_id}`
- calendar: `calshow:{timeIntervalSinceReferenceDate}`
- always include deep links when referencing items so the user can jump to the native app

### Privacy
- this is personal data - handle with care
- don't expose contact details or private notes unnecessarily
- summarize rather than dump raw content when possible
