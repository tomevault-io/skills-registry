# Buddy Tunnels

Expose local services to the internet via secure Buddy tunnels. Ideal for webhook testing, client demos, mobile testing, and temporary service sharing.

## CRITICAL: AI Agent Requirements

> **STOP: Read this section completely before creating any tunnel.**

### 1. Run tunnels in background (MANDATORY)

Tunnel commands run in foreground and WILL BLOCK your execution. You MUST use `run_in_background: true` parameter in Bash tool:

```
Bash tool call:
  command: bdy tunnel http localhost:3000
  run_in_background: true
```

### 2. Ask about HTTP authentication (MANDATORY)

Before creating ANY HTTP tunnel, you MUST use AskUserQuestionTool to ask about authentication.

DO NOT skip this step. DO NOT proceed until user has made a choice.

**Question:** "Do you want to protect this HTTP tunnel with authentication?"

**Options:**
1. "HTTP Basic Auth (username:password)" → use `-a username:password` flag
2. "Buddy Authentication" → use `--buddy` flag
3. "No authentication (public access)" → proceed without auth

### 3. Docker: Verify app binds to 0.0.0.0

If running in Docker, the containerized app MUST bind to `0.0.0.0` so the host can reach it. For regular local development (not Docker), `127.0.0.1` works fine with tunnels.

## Authentication Errors

If any `bdy` command returns `Token not provided` or `Not logged in`, ask the user to run `bdy login` in a separate terminal (interactive browser auth — AI cannot do it).

## Quick Start

### HTTP Tunnel (most common)

```bash
bdy tunnel http localhost:3000                    # basic
bdy tunnel http localhost:3000 -a user:pass       # with HTTP basic auth
bdy tunnel http localhost:3000 --buddy            # with Buddy auth
bdy tunnel http localhost:3000 -n my-tunnel       # named tunnel
```

### TCP Tunnel (databases, SSH)

```bash
bdy tunnel tcp localhost:5432    # PostgreSQL
bdy tunnel tcp localhost:3306    # MySQL
bdy tunnel tcp localhost:22      # SSH
```

### TLS Tunnel (custom certificates)

```bash
bdy tunnel tls localhost:8443 --key key.pem --cert cert.pem
```

## Common Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-n, --name` | Named tunnel for identification |
| `-a, --auth user:pass` | HTTP basic authentication |
| `--buddy` | Buddy account authentication |
| `-r, --region eu\|us\|as` | Regional endpoint |
| `-w, --whitelist` | IP CIDR restrictions |
| `-t, --timeout` | Connection timeout (seconds) |

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Refused
- Verify app is running on specified port
- If using Docker, check app binds to `0.0.0.0` inside the container

### Authentication Failed
- If error contains `Token not provided` or `Not logged in`, user must run `bdy login` in a separate terminal
