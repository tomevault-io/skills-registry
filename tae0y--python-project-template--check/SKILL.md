# Code Quality Check (Read-Only)

Run all quality checks and report results. Do not auto-fix anything.

## Tools

This project uses the following hooks in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:

1. **ruff** — Python lint
2. **ruff-format** — Code formatting
3. **pyright** — Static type checking
4. **bandit** — Security vulnerability scan

## Execution

Run in order:

```bash
# 1. Lint (no fix)
uv run ruff check src/ tests/

# 2. Format check (no fix)
uv run ruff format --check src/ tests/

# 3. Type check
uv run pyright

# 4. Security scan
uv run bandit -c pyproject.toml -r src/
```

## Output Format

```
