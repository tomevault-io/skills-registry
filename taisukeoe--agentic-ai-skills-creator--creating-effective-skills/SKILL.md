# Creating Effective Skills

Guide for creating agent skills that follow Claude's official best practices.

## Core Principles

**Concise is Key**: The context window is shared. Only add what Claude doesn't already know. Default assumption: Claude is already very smart.

**Progressive Disclosure**: Skills load in three levels:
1. Metadata (~100 tokens) - always loaded
2. SKILL.md body (<5k tokens) - when triggered
3. Bundled resources - as needed

**Keep SKILL.md small**: Target ~200 lines, maximum 500 lines. Move detailed content to reference files aggressively.

**Single Responsibility**: Each skill does one thing well.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Understand the Skill Need

Ask the user to clarify (adapt questions to context):

**For clear requests** (e.g., "format markdown tables"):
- "What input formats should be supported?"
- "What output preferences do you have?"
- "What edge cases should be handled?"

**For ambiguous requests** (e.g., "handle data", "help with files"):
- "What KIND of data/files?" (format, source, structure)
- "What OPERATIONS?" (transform, validate, migrate, analyze)
- "What's the specific problem to solve?"
- Ask at least 3 specific questions before proceeding

**Red flags requiring extra clarification:**
- Vague verbs: "handle", "process", "manage", "help with"
- Broad nouns: "data", "files", "documents" without specifics

Get clear sense of: purpose, usage examples, triggers, AND scope boundaries.

### Step 2: Validate Scope

Before proceeding, verify the skill follows **Single Responsibility**:

**Check naming:**
- ❌ `handling-data` - too broad, what data? what handling?
- ❌ `data-helper` - generic, unclear purpose
- ✅ `transforming-csv-data` - specific operation + data type
- ✅ `validating-json-schemas` - clear single purpose

**Check boundaries:**
- Can you clearly state what's IN scope vs OUT of scope?
- If boundaries are unclear, scope is too broad → ask user to narrow

**If scope is too broad:**
1. Propose a focused alternative (e.g., "handling data" → "transforming-csv-data")
2. Explain what's excluded and why
3. Suggest splitting into multiple skills if needed

**Do NOT proceed to file creation until scope is validated.**

### Step 3: Determine Freedom Level

Freedom level controls how much latitude Claude has when following the skill:

- **High**: Multiple valid approaches, context-dependent decisions
- **Medium**: Preferred pattern exists, some variation acceptable
- **Low**: Fragile operations, consistency critical

**Unless clearly LOW freedom**: Read [references/degrees-of-freedom.md](references/degrees-of-freedom.md) and apply the decision framework. Cite the factors (fragility, context-dependency, consistency, error impact) in your justification.

If uncertain after reading the reference, ask the user.

### Step 4: Plan Reusable Contents

Identify what to include:

**Scripts** (`scripts/`): Executable code for deterministic operations
**References** (`references/`): Documentation loaded as needed
**Assets** (`assets/`): Files used in output (templates, images, fonts)

### Step 5: Create Structure

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md (required - AI agent instructions)
├── README.md (optional - human-facing installation and usage guide)
├── references/ (optional)
├── tests/
│   └── scenarios.md (optional - self-evaluation scenarios)
├── scripts/ (optional)
└── assets/ (optional)
```

**README.md vs SKILL.md**:
- **SKILL.md**: Instructions for Claude (workflows, patterns, technical details)
- **README.md**: Instructions for humans (installation, permissions, overview)

**README.md, if present, should include**:
- Overview of what the skill does
- File structure explanation (especially `tests/scenarios.md` purpose)
- Installation instructions and required permissions

**Avoid creating**: INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md, CHANGELOG.md, or other redundant docs. Use README.md for human-facing documentation.

### Step 6: Write SKILL.md

#### Frontmatter

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: What the skill does and when to use it
---
```

**Naming** (use gerund form):
- Good: `processing-pdfs`, `analyzing-spreadsheets`, `managing-databases`
- Avoid: `helper`, `utils`, `tools`, `anthropic-*`, `claude-*`

**Description** (third person, include WHAT and WHEN):
- Good: "Extract text and tables from PDF files, fill forms, merge documents. Use when working with PDF files or when the user mentions PDFs, forms, or document extraction."
- Avoid: "Helps with documents", "Processes data"

Be specific and include key terms. Description is the primary triggering mechanism.

#### Body

Use imperative form. Keep small (target ~200 lines, max 500). Include only:
- Quick start / basic usage
- Core workflows
- References to additional files

For complex multi-step processes, see [references/workflows-and-validation.md](references/workflows-and-validation.md).

Example pattern:
```markdown
## Quick start
[Basic usage]

## Advanced features
**Feature A**: See [references/feature-a.md](references/feature-a.md)
**Feature B**: See [references/feature-b.md](references/feature-b.md)
```

Keep references one level deep. See [references/progressive-disclosure.md](references/progressive-disclosure.md) for patterns.

### Step 7: Create Reference Files

For files >100 lines, include table of contents at top.

Organize by domain when appropriate:
```
skill/
├── SKILL.md
└── references/
    ├── domain_a.md
    └── domain_b.md
```

Avoid: deeply nested references, duplicate information, generic file names.

### Step 8: Create Test Scenarios (Optional)

**Ask the user**: "Would you like to create test scenarios for this skill? Test scenarios enable automated evaluation with `/evaluating-skills-with-models` to measure skill quality across different models (sonnet, opus, haiku)."

If the user agrees, create `tests/scenarios.md` for self-evaluation:

```markdown
## Scenario: [Name]

**Difficulty:** Easy | Medium | Hard | Edge-case

**Query:** User request that triggers this skill

**Expected behaviors:**

1. [Action description]
   - **Minimum:** What counts as "did it"
   - **Quality criteria:** What "did it well" looks like
   - **Haiku pitfall:** Common failure mode for smaller models
   - **Weight:** 1-5 (importance)

**Output validation:** (optional)
- Pattern: `regex`
- Line count: `< N`
```

**Why this format**: Binary pass/fail doesn't differentiate models. Quality-based scoring reveals capability differences.

### Step 9: Define allowed-tools

After completing SKILL.md and references, identify which tools the skill uses:

1. Review SKILL.md and reference files for tool usage
2. List tools that need pre-approval (e.g., `Bash(git status:*)`, `WebSearch`, `Skill(other-skill)`)
3. Add `allowed-tools` field to frontmatter if needed

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: ...
allowed-tools: "Bash(git status:*) Bash(git diff:*) WebSearch"
---
```

This field is experimental but helps agents pre-approve tool access.

**Important considerations**:
- `Read`, `Glob` are already allowed by default - do not include
- `Edit`, `Write` are destructive - do not pre-approve
- Be as specific as possible with Bash subcommands
  - Good: `Bash(git status:*) Bash(git diff:*) Bash(git log:*)`
  - Avoid: `Bash(git:*)` (too broad, includes destructive operations like `git push --force`)

## Anti-Patterns

❌ Windows-style paths (`scripts\file.py`)
❌ Too many options without a default
❌ Time-sensitive information
❌ Inconsistent terminology
❌ Deeply nested references
❌ Vague instructions

## References

**Progressive Disclosure**: [references/progressive-disclosure.md](references/progressive-disclosure.md) - Detailed patterns and examples

**Degrees of Freedom**: [references/degrees-of-freedom.md](references/degrees-of-freedom.md) - Guidance on appropriate freedom levels
