# Improving Skills

Improve existing agent skills through gathering user feedback and technical analysis.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify Target Skill

Ask user for the skill path if not provided (e.g., `.claude/skills/skill-name/`).

Read SKILL.md and understand current structure.

### Step 2: Gather Feedback (Required)

Ask the essential question:

> "What problems or improvements do you want for this skill?"

Based on the response, ask follow-up questions as needed:

| If user mentions... | Follow-up question |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| Vague dissatisfaction | "Can you give a specific example of when it didn't work well?" |
| Trigger issues | "When does it fail to trigger, or trigger unexpectedly?" |
| Missing features | "What should the output look like when this feature works?" |
| Too much/little output | "What level of detail do you prefer?" |
| Unclear scope | "What tasks should this skill handle vs. not handle?" |

Keep follow-ups minimal. One or two is usually enough.

### Step 3: Technical Analysis

Check against best practices (reference reviewing-skills criteria):

- **Naming**: Gerund form, descriptive
- **Description**: Third person, includes what + when
- **Size**: SKILL.md < 500 lines
- **Progressive disclosure**: Details in references
- **Single responsibility**: One clear purpose
- **Tests**: tests/scenarios.md exists (required for `/evaluating-skills-with-models`)

### Step 4: Present Improvement Plan

Organize improvements into:

**User-requested improvements**:
- Based on feedback
- Prioritize what user explicitly mentioned

**Technical improvements**:
- Issues found in analysis
- Only include if impactful

Format:
```
## Improvement Plan

### User-requested
1. [Issue from feedback] → [Proposed fix]

### Technical
1. [Issue from analysis] → [Proposed fix]

Proceed with these changes?
```

### Step 5: Implement

Execute the improvements:
1. Edit SKILL.md
2. Update/create reference files if needed
3. Adjust scripts/assets if applicable

Show diff or summary of changes made.

### Step 6: Verify

Quick check:
- Changes address user's stated problems
- No new issues introduced
- Skill still follows best practices

## Key Difference from reviewing-skills

| reviewing-skills | improving-skills |
|-----------------|------------------|
| Technical analysis only | User feedback + technical analysis |
| Provides feedback | Implements changes |
| Read-only | Read-write |
