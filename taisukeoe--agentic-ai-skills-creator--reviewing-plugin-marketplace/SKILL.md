# Reviewing Plugin Marketplace Configurations

Comprehensive review of Claude Code plugin marketplace and plugin configurations against official best practices and common pitfalls.

## Quick Start

### Automated Review (Recommended)

Run the verification script:

```bash
bash scripts/verify-marketplace.sh [marketplace-directory]
```

This automatically checks:
- marketplace.json structure
- Skills paths validation
- Git remote URL
- README.md repository references
- plugin.json presence (warns if exists)

### Manual Review

1. Ask user for marketplace directory (e.g., `.claude-plugin/`)
2. Read marketplace.json and plugin.json (if exists)
3. Check against official format and common errors
4. Provide detailed feedback with priorities

**Example review output**:
```
## Critical Issues
- ❌ Repository URL mismatch: README.md uses "owner-a/repo" but marketplace.json uses "owner-b/repo"
- ❌ Source path "./.claude-plugin" does not exist

## Important Issues
- ⚠ plugin.json exists but Anthropic's official format uses marketplace.json only
- ⚠ Skills path "./skills/missing-skill" not found

## Compliance Score
- Structure: ✓ Valid JSON
- Required fields: ✓ Present
- Path validation: ✗ 2 invalid paths
```

## Review Process

### Step 1: Read Configuration Files

Read and analyze:
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` (required for marketplaces)
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (optional, check if present)
- `README.md` (for repository URL consistency)
- Git remote URL (if in git repository)

### Step 2: Validate marketplace.json Structure

**Required fields**:
- [ ] `name` - Marketplace identifier
- [ ] `owner.name` - Owner name
- [ ] `plugins` - Array of plugin definitions

**Each plugin must have**:
- [ ] `name` - Plugin identifier
- [ ] `source` - Source path (must start with `./`, e.g., `"./plugins/plugin-name"`)
- [ ] `description` - What the plugin does

**Recommended fields**:
- [ ] `metadata.description` - Marketplace description
- [ ] `metadata.version` - Version number

**Note**: `skills` field specifies skills directory path (root-relative, e.g., `"./plugins/plugin-name/skills/"`)

**Optional fields** (context-dependent):
- [ ] `strict: false` - Only needed if plugins lack plugin.json files (see references/common-errors.md)

### Step 3: Check Common Errors

**Repository URL consistency**:
- Compare URLs in marketplace.json, plugin.json, README.md, git remote
- All should point to the same repository
- Common issue: Using organization name instead of personal username

**Source path validation**:
- Verify `source` path exists
- Must start with `./` (e.g., `"./plugins/plugin-name"`)
- Check that source directory contains `skills/` subdirectory with SKILL.md files

**Skills path validation**:
- Verify `skills` path exists (root-relative, e.g., `"./plugins/plugin-name/skills/"`)
- Directory should contain subdirectories with SKILL.md files

**plugin.json conflicts**:
- Anthropic's official format uses marketplace.json only
- Having both may cause confusion
- If both exist, ensure names match

**README.md consistency checks**:
- **Skills documentation**: Verify all skills in marketplace.json are documented in README.md
  - Check "Skills Included" section lists each skill from the `skills` array
  - Each skill should have description and "Use when" guidance
- **Project Structure accuracy**:
  - If `plugin.json` mentioned in README but doesn't exist, suggest using `marketplace.json`
  - Verify structure diagram matches actual files in `.claude-plugin/`
- **Permissions section completeness**:
  - Check if README.md settings.json examples include all skills from marketplace.json
  - Example: `"Skill(skill-name)"` for each skill should be in permissions array
- **Repository references**: Ensure consistent GitHub URLs across README installation examples

### Step 4: Compare with Anthropic Format

See [references/anthropic-format.md](references/anthropic-format.md) for official structure.

**Key patterns from Anthropic**:
- marketplace.json at `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`
- No plugin.json (marketplace.json only)
- `source: "./plugins/plugin-name"` pointing to plugin directory (must start with `./`)
- `strict: false` (optional - only needed when plugin.json is missing)
- `skills` field specifies skills directory (root-relative path)

### Step 5: Generate Feedback

Organize findings by priority:

**Critical Issues** (breaks functionality):
- enabledPlugins format error (array instead of object)
- Repository URL mismatch with git remote
- Invalid source path (doesn't exist)
- Missing required fields
- Invalid JSON syntax

**Important Issues** (causes confusion):
- Repository URL inconsistency across files
- Invalid skills paths
- Conflicting plugin.json and marketplace.json
- Missing recommended fields

**Suggestions** (best practices):
- Add `metadata` section (improves discoverability)
- Add `strict: false` only if plugins lack plugin.json (otherwise no effect)
- Follow Anthropic's single-file pattern
- Explicit `skills` array

## Common Issues Reference

See [references/common-errors.md](references/common-errors.md) for detailed error patterns and solutions.

**Top 3 issues from real experience** (by actual impact):

1. **enabledPlugins format error** ⚠️ BREAKS FUNCTIONALITY
   - Error: Plugins don't load, no activation
   - Cause: Using array `["plugin@marketplace"]` instead of object `{"plugin@marketplace": true}`
   - Fix: Change to object format in settings.json
   - **This is the #1 cause of "plugin not working" issues**

2. **Repository URL mismatch**
   - Error: `Plugin 'name' not found in marketplace`
   - Cause: README/settings use different owner than actual git remote
   - Fix: Ensure all URLs match `git remote -v`

3. **Wrong source path**
   - Error: `Plugin 'name' not found`
   - Cause: Source points to non-existent directory
   - Fix: Use `"./"` for root, verify path exists

## Output Format

Structure review with these sections:
- **Summary**: Overall assessment
- **Critical Issues**: Must fix (with file:line references)
- **Important Issues**: Should fix (with explanations)
- **Suggestions**: Best practices alignment
- **Compliance Score**: Quick visual assessment

## Tips for Effective Reviews

**Be Specific**: Don't say "URL is wrong" - say "marketplace.json line 7 uses 'owner-a/repo' but git remote shows 'owner-b/repo'"

**Verify Paths**: Actually check if files/directories exist, don't just validate format

**Check Consistency**: Cross-reference all files that mention repository URLs

**Use Official Examples**: Compare against Anthropic's format at https://github.com/anthropics/skills
