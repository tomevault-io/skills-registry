| 70-79 | Fair | Several issues to fix |
| 60-69 | Poor | Major revision needed |
| <60 | Critical | Rewrite required |

## Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: Skill doesn't trigger
**Cause**: Description too vague
**Fix**: Add specific trigger phrases

```yaml
# Before
description: Helps with projects

# After
description: |
  Manages Linear project workflows. Use when user says
  "plan sprint", "create Linear tasks", or "project planning".
```

### Issue: Over-triggering
**Cause**: Description too broad
**Fix**: Add negative triggers

```yaml
description: |
  ...existing description...
  Do NOT use for: simple data exploration (use data-viz instead).
```

### Issue: Instructions not followed
**Cause**: Content too verbose
**Fix**: Move details to references/

### Issue: Large context usage
**Cause**: All content in SKILL.md
**Fix**: Use progressive disclosure
