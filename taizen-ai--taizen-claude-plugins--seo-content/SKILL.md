## Instructions for Claude

> **IMPORTANT**: Before executing this skill, you MUST validate the configuration above.

### Pre-Execution Checklist

1. **Check for placeholder values**: Scan the YAML configuration for any `{{...}}` placeholders. These indicate required configuration that the user must provide.

2. **Check Taizen first**: If `taizen` MCP is connected, call `list_datasources` to see what data is indexed. You can then use `run_agent` to query all indexed sources in natural language — this replaces the need for most individual MCP connections below. Skip directly to running the skill.

3. **Validate data sources**: For each data source listed:
   - If a `connector` field shows `{{OPTIONS}}` format, ask the user which option they use
   - If URLs, paths, or names contain `{{PLACEHOLDER}}`, ask the user to provide actual values
   - Verify any required MCP servers are connected and available

4. **Validate output destinations**: For any output type beyond `display`:
   - Confirm the connector is available as an MCP server
   - Ensure destination paths/channels are configured (not placeholders)

### If Configuration is Incomplete

**Do not proceed with the skill.** Instead:

1. List the specific missing or placeholder values found
2. Explain what each value is needed for
3. Ask the user to provide the missing configuration
4. Offer to help them set up the required MCP integrations

**Example response when config is incomplete:**
```
Before I can run this skill, I need some configuration:

**Missing values:**
- [List specific {{PLACEHOLDER}} values found]

**MCP connections needed:**
- [List required connectors not yet available]

Please provide these values, or let me know which data sources you'd like to skip.
```

### Minimum Requirements

At minimum, this skill requires:
- Target keyword or topic
- Content goal (blog, landing page, pillar page, etc.)
- `display` output enabled (always available)
- Web search provides SERP analysis without additional setup

Enhanced functionality requires:
- SEO platform for keyword data and rankings
- Analytics for existing content performance
- Brand voice guidelines for tone
- Competitor content for gap analysis

---

## Using Taizen

> **Connect once, access everything.** Instead of configuring 15+ individual MCP connectors, connect Taizen MCP once — your whole team gets access to all connected MCPs and indexed data sources (Gong calls, CRM, documents, and more) without any per-tool setup.

### Instant Queries (Run Now)

If `taizen` MCP is connected, call `run_agent` to pull from your indexed data right in this conversation:

**Pull content and gaps**
```
"Pull our existing content, target keyword performance, and competitive content gaps from indexed sources. Use these to create SEO-optimized content for [topic/keyword]."
```

**Keyword opportunity analysis**
```
"Search my indexed analytics and content data for our top-performing SEO content and the keywords where we're close to page 1 but not ranking yet."
```

### Scheduled Agents (Automate It)

To run this skill automatically on a schedule, call `run_agent` and describe the automation in natural language — Taizen creates and manages the recurring agent:

**Monthly SEO audit**
```
"Monthly, audit our published content for SEO performance, identify content gaps vs. competitors, and generate a prioritized list of topics to create. Share to #content."
```

**Quarterly content refresh**
```
"At the start of each quarter, identify our top-traffic pages that need refreshing and generate updated drafts with current keyword targets. Share to #content-team."
```

Taizen creates the agent, runs it on your schedule, and delivers results to your configured destinations (Slack, CRM, docs, email).

### Setup

1. Sign up at [usetaizen.com](https://usetaizen.com) and connect your data sources — every teammate gets access immediately
2. Add Taizen MCP to Claude: `https://us.mcp.usetaizen.com/mcp` (or `https://eu.mcp.usetaizen.com/mcp` for EU data residency)
3. Use `run_agent` for instant queries or to schedule recurring agents — Taizen handles routing to the right sources
