# ASCII Circuit Diagram Creator

Creates clear, unambiguous ASCII circuit diagrams through an iterative generate-validate-fix workflow.

## Quick Start Workflow

**A. Create connection list** - Write explicit text connections (which pin → which pin)
**B. Generate ASCII diagram** - Create circuit that satisfies ALL connections
**C. Preview** - Render in monospace font, capture as image
**D. Confirm** - Check for rule violations

- If violations found: **Return to B** with fixes
- If clean: **Proceed to E**

**E. Complete** - Deliver both connection list AND ASCII diagram

## Core Principles

**Start with connections, not the diagram** - The connection list is the specification. The ASCII diagram must satisfy every connection in the list.

**Connection list is a deliverable** - Always provide both:

1. Connection list (explicit, unambiguous)
2. ASCII diagram (visual representation)

**Preview is mandatory** - Label crossings and alignment issues are invisible in plain text but obvious in monospace rendering.

**Follow the golden rules** - See `references/golden-rules.md` for complete list:

1. Never cross lines without junctions
2. Never cross lines over text labels
3. Use label notation for distant connections - **Use "GND" labels frequently** to avoid cluttered diagrams (many components connect to GND)
4. Show parallel components as vertical drops
5. Maintain consistent column alignment
6. **Use Unicode characters** - `┌ ┐ └ ┘ ├ ┤ ┬ ┴ ─ │` for lines/junctions, `→ ←` for arrows
7. **Use boxes to identify components** - Each component gets its own box with proper padding (at least 1 space on each side)
8. **Separate complicated layouts** - When circuit details get complex, create a separate diagram block
9. **Avoid ambiguous ASCII** - Don't use `+` for junctions (ambiguous direction)
10. **No flying lines** - Vertical lines must maintain exact column alignment throughout
11. **Preview AND analyze carefully** - Looking at screenshots without tracing signal paths is worthless

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step A: Create Connection List

Write explicit text connections showing which pin connects to which:

**Format:**

```
Connections:
- Component1 pin X → Component2 pin Y
- Component2 pin Z → Component3
- Component3 → GND (parallel capacitor)
```

**Example (Buck Converter):**

```
Connections:
- +15V input → U2 (LM2596S) pin 5 (VIN)
- +15V input → C5 (100µF) → GND
- U2 pin 3 (ON) → +15V (always enabled)
- U2 pin 4 (VOUT) → Switching node
- Switching node → L1 (100µH) → +13.5V Output
- Switching node → D1 (SS34 Schottky cathode)
- D1 (SS34 Schottky anode) → GND
- +13.5V Output → R1 (10kΩ) → Tap point
- Tap point → R2 (1kΩ) → GND
- U2 pin 2 (FB) → Tap point
- +13.5V Output → C3 (470µF) → GND
- U2 pin 1 (GND) → GND
```

**Key points:**

- Every component connection must be listed
- Show pin numbers for ICs
- Indicate parallel vs. series connections
- Specify component values
- This list serves as the specification for the diagram

### Step B: Generate ASCII Diagram

Create the ASCII diagram that satisfies ALL connections from Step A:

**Layout strategy:**

- **Separate functional blocks** - Break complex circuits into labeled sections (IC, switching node, input caps, feedback network)
- **Branch right, then down** - Use `└───` to create branches that extend right first, then go vertical
- **Main flow horizontal, branches vertical** - Keep signal flow left-to-right, use vertical lines for branches to GND or parallel components
- Place IC in center of its section
- Input components on left or in separate section
- Output components on right or in separate section
- Route flyback diodes UPWARD to avoid label crossings (or use separate section)
- **Use Unicode characters throughout**: `├ ┤ ┬ ┴ ─ │ ┌ ┐ └ ┘` for lines/junctions, `→ ←` for arrows
- **Avoid ASCII `+` for junctions** - it's ambiguous about connection direction
- Apply label notation for distant connections (`FB ├2─→ Tap`)
- Ensure vertical lines maintain exact column alignment (no flying lines)

**Component representation:**

- ICs: Show pin numbers and names
- Passives: Include values (10µF, 5.1kΩ)
- Voltages: Label at each stage
- Parallel components: Draw as vertical drops to GND

**Best practice: Parallel capacitors (filter pairs):**

```
Power ──┬────────────────┬─── To IC
        │                │
       C1               C2
      100nF            470µF
     ceramic        electrolytic
     (CLOSE!)        (farther)
        │                │
       GND              GND
```

- T-junction (┬) at TOP on power rail
- Capacitor labels in middle of vertical lines
- Clear vertical drops to GND
- **Left-to-right order**: Ceramic (CLOSE to IC) on LEFT, electrolytic (farther) on RIGHT
- Shows physical placement hints

**Separated section example (recommended for complex circuits):**

```
IC Section:
                    ┌──────────────┐
Input ──────────────┤1 VIN     OUT 2├───── Signal Node
                    │              │
                 ┌──┤3 GND      FB 4├──── FB Tap
                 │  └──────────────┘
                GND

Switching Node Section:
                                 ┌─────────────┐
Signal Node ────────┬────────────┤ L1 (100µH)  ├──────────── Output
                    │            └─────────────┘
                    │
                    └─── D1 (Schottky)
                         Cathode
                            │
                         Anode
                            │
                           GND

Input Filter Section:
Input ───┬─── To IC
         │
         ├─ C1 (100µF)
         │    │
         │   GND
         │
         └─ C2 (100nF)
              │
             GND
```

**Key benefits of separated sections:**

- No line crossings between different functional blocks
- Crystal clear component grouping
- Easy to trace signal paths
- Simple to add/modify individual sections
- Branches use `└───` (right first, then down) or `┬` (split, then vertical)

**Critical**: Verify every connection from Step A is represented in the diagram.

### Step C: Preview

Run the preview script to render in monospace font and capture as image:

```bash
bash $HOME/.claude/skills/ascii-circuit-diagram-creator/scripts/preview_diagram.sh <diagram-text-or-file>
```

The preview creates an "almost empty HTML" with monospace font styling and captures the result using headless browser. This reveals issues invisible in plain text:

- Lines crossing labels
- Ambiguous junctions
- Incorrect component leg counts
- Junction topology errors

### Step D: Confirm

**CRITICAL**: Check the preview image for rule violations by **tracing each signal path** and **inspecting vertical line alignment**.

Simply looking at the screenshot is not enough - you must:

1. **Trace each signal** from source to destination
2. **Verify junctions** - does each `├ ┤ ┬ ┴` connect the correct signals?
3. **Check for false junctions** - do any signals appear connected that shouldn't be?
4. **Verify topology** matches the connection list from Step A
5. **Inspect vertical line alignment** - Look for "broken" or "floating" lines where alignment is off by even 1 character

If ANY violations found, **return to Step B** with fixes.

**Preview phase is critical for detecting:**

- Lines crossing labels (invisible in plain text, obvious in preview)
- False junctions where signals appear connected but shouldn't be
- Box padding issues where text touches borders
- Incorrect component leg counts

**Check against golden rules** (see `references/golden-rules.md`):

**Rule 1: Line crossings without junctions**

- Look for `┼` symbols (usually wrong)
- Check if non-connected lines cross

**Rule 2: Lines crossing labels**

- Look for vertical/horizontal lines passing over text
- Most common issue: switching node line crossing "Tap" or "GND" labels

**Rule 3: Disconnected components**

- Verify all components connect to appropriate nodes
- Check input capacitors connect to power rails
- Ensure feedback networks connect to correct pins

**Rule 4: Incorrect polarity**

- Diodes: Cathode to higher potential, anode to lower
- Buck converter: Flyback diode cathode to switching node, anode to GND

**Rule 5: Unclear parallel/series connections**

- Filter capacitors should be vertical drops to GND
- Should NOT appear in series with signal path

**Common fixes:**

**Fix: Line crossing label**

- **Solution A**: Route in opposite direction (if going down crosses labels, route up)
- **Solution B**: Remove intermediate label
- **Solution C**: Use wider spacing to route around

Example:

```
Before (crosses labels):    After (routes upward):
VOUT ├4───┬─→ L1            D1 ← Routes UP
          │                    │
          │ (crosses)      VOUT ├4───┴─→ L1
       D1 ↓
```

**Fix: Disconnected component**

- Add connection using appropriate junction (`┬ ├ ┤ ┴`)
- Ensure vertical line from power rail reaches component

**Fix: Inverted polarity**

- Swap component orientation
- For diodes: cathode (top) to higher potential, anode (bottom) to GND

**Fix: Ambiguous parallel/series**

- Redraw parallel components as vertical drops
- Use `├─→` to branch from main signal path

**Iteration**: Repeat B → C → D until all rules satisfied. Usually 2-3 iterations sufficient.

### Step E: Complete

Once all rules satisfied, deliver both:

1. **Connection list** (from Step A)
2. **ASCII diagram** (final validated version)

Optionally explain key connections or design choices if complex.

## Common Patterns

See `references/examples.md` for detailed examples of:

- Buck converter (LM2596S-ADJ)
- Common mistakes and fixes
- Before/after comparisons

## Validation Checklist

Before finalizing, verify:

- [ ] No line crossings without explicit junctions
- [ ] No lines crossing over text labels
- [ ] All components properly connected (no floating components)
- [ ] Parallel components shown as vertical drops to GND
- [ ] Diode polarity correct (cathode/anode orientation)
- [ ] **ASCII-only characters used** (no Unicode box-drawing or arrows)
- [ ] **No flying/disconnected lines** (vertical lines maintain column alignment)
- [ ] Consistent column alignment (no sliding vertical bars)

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:

- User requests ASCII/text-format circuit diagrams
- Creating technical documentation with embedded circuits
- Need to ensure diagram clarity and correctness
- Converting schematic to ASCII representation
- Building circuit diagrams for code comments or markdown docs

**Key indicator**: User mentions "ASCII circuit," "text diagram," "schematic in text," or shows existing ASCII circuit that needs fixing.

## Tool Integration

**Preview tool**: Uses headless-browser skill to render diagrams in monospace font and capture screenshots for validation. This is **critical** for catching issues before finalizing.
