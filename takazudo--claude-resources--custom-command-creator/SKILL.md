# Custom Command Creator

Guide for creating effective custom slash commands in Claude Code.

## What Are Custom Commands?

Custom slash commands are Markdown files that define reusable prompts. They're simpler than skills - single files for quick, frequently-used prompts.

**Use commands when:**

- Same prompt is used repeatedly
- Prompt fits in one file
- Explicit control over when to run

**Use skills instead when:**

- Claude should auto-detect the capability
- Multiple files or scripts needed
- Complex workflows with validation steps

## Command Locations

| Location | Path | Scope |
|----------|------|-------|
| Project | `.claude/commands/<name>.md` | This project only (shows as "project") |
| Personal | `$HOME/.claude/commands/<name>.md` | All your projects (shows as "user") |

**Priority**: Project commands override personal commands with same name.

## Command Anatomy

Every command is a single Markdown file with optional frontmatter:

```markdown
---
description: Brief description of what the command does
allowed-tools: Bash(git:*), Read
argument-hint: [filename] [options]
---

# Command Instructions

Your prompt content here with $ARGUMENTS placeholder.
```

See [frontmatter.md](references/frontmatter.md) for all available fields.

## Core Features

### Arguments

Pass dynamic values to commands using placeholders:

**All arguments** - `$ARGUMENTS`:

```markdown
Fix issue #$ARGUMENTS following our coding standards
```

Usage: `/fix-issue 123 high-priority` → `$ARGUMENTS` = "123 high-priority"

**Positional arguments** - `$1`, `$2`, etc.:

```markdown
Review PR #$1 with priority $2 and assign to $3
```

Usage: `/review-pr 456 high alice` → `$1`="456", `$2`="high", `$3`="alice"

### Bash Execution

Run shell commands before the prompt is sent using `!`command`` syntax:

```markdown
---
allowed-tools: Bash(git:*)
---

## Context
- Git status: !`git status`
- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Recent commits: !`git log --oneline -5`

## Task
Create a commit based on the above changes.
```

**Important**: Must include `Bash` in `allowed-tools` for this to work.

### File References

Include file contents using `@` prefix:

```markdown
Review the implementation in @src/utils/helpers.js

Compare @src/old.js with @src/new.js
```

### Extended Thinking

Include [thinking keywords](/ja/common-workflows#use-extended-thinking) to trigger extended thinking mode:

```markdown
Think deeply about the architecture of this codebase.
```

## Namespacing

Use subdirectories to organize related commands:

```
.claude/commands/
├── frontend/
│   └── component.md  → /component (project:frontend)
├── backend/
│   └── api.md        → /api (project:backend)
└── deploy.md         → /deploy (project)
```

Same-named commands in different subdirectories are distinguished by their namespace label.

## Command Creation Workflow

When the user asks to create a command, follow this workflow.

### Step 1: Determine Command Name and Location

If the user provides a name, use it. If they describe what they want, derive an appropriate kebab-case name.

**Choose location based on context:**

- **Global command** (`$HOME/.claude/commands/<name>.md`): User says "global", or wants it available across all projects
- **Local/project command** (`.claude/commands/<name>.md`): User says "local" or "project", or wants it scoped to current repo
- **If unclear**: Ask the user which they prefer

For local commands, find the project root first:

```bash
git rev-parse --show-toplevel  # Use repo root, or cwd if not a git repo
```

Ensure the target directory exists before writing.

### Step 2: Gather Details

Ask the user if needed:

- What should the command do?
- Does it need arguments? If so, what arguments?
- Should it use bash execution (`!`command``) for dynamic context?
- Should it restrict allowed tools?

### Step 3: Write the Command File

Create the command file with proper structure:

**Required best practices:**

- Always include frontmatter with `description` field
- Use `argument-hint` if the command accepts arguments (e.g., `[filename]`, `[pr-number]`)
- Use `$ARGUMENTS` for all args or `$1`, `$2` for positional args
- If using bash execution, include `allowed-tools` in frontmatter
- If manual-only invocation needed, add `disable-model-invocation: true`

**Template:**

```markdown
---
description: Brief description of what the command does
argument-hint: [expected-args]
allowed-tools: Bash(git:*), Read
---

# Command Title

Clear instructions for what Claude should do.

## Context (if using bash execution)
- Dynamic info: !`git status --short`

## Task
What to accomplish with $ARGUMENTS.
```

### Step 4: Format the command file

Format the created command file using the mdx-formatter to ensure consistent markdown formatting:

```bash
pnpm dlx @takazudo/mdx-formatter --write <path-to-command-file.md>
```

### Step 5: Verify and Report

After creating the file:

1. Confirm the file exists at the target path
2. Show the user the full content of the created file
3. Tell them they can use it with `/<command-name>`
4. **For global commands**: Remind that project-level commands take priority over global commands with the same name
5. **For local commands**: Suggest committing to git so the team can share it

### Key Rules for Creation

- Command filename must be kebab-case (lowercase, hyphens): `my-command.md`
- Always include `description` in frontmatter - commands without it are harder to discover
- Keep the command focused on a single task
- Use `$ARGUMENTS` / `$1` / `$2` for dynamic values, not hardcoded values
- Don't overcomplicate - a command is a single Markdown file for a reusable prompt
- Local commands are great for project-specific workflows (deploy, test patterns, review checklists)
- **File paths must use `$HOME` instead of `~`**: When command instructions reference home directory paths (e.g., log directories, config files), always write `$HOME/cclogs/...` or `$HOME/.claude/...`, NEVER `$HOME/cclogs/...` or `$HOME/.claude/...`. The `~` character is only expanded by interactive shell login contexts. In Node.js `fs` operations, non-login shells, and many tool contexts, `~` is treated as a literal character, which creates an actual directory named `$HOME/` inside the working directory. This applies to paths in the command body text, bash execution snippets, and any instructions that an agent will follow

## Examples

### Simple Review Command

```markdown
---
description: Quick code review
---

Review this code for:
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance issues
- Code style violations
```

### Git Commit with Context

```markdown
---
description: Create a git commit with context
allowed-tools: Bash(git:*)
---

## Context
- Status: !`git status`
- Diff: !`git diff HEAD`
- Branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Recent commits: !`git log --oneline -5`

## Task
Create a single git commit for the staged changes.
Message should be concise and follow conventional commits.
```

### PR Review with Arguments

```markdown
---
description: Review a pull request
argument-hint: [pr-number]
allowed-tools: Bash(gh:*)
---

## PR Context
- PR info: !`gh pr view $1`
- PR diff: !`gh pr diff $1`
- PR comments: !`gh pr view $1 --comments`

## Task
Review PR #$1 for:
1. Code quality and best practices
2. Potential bugs or edge cases
3. Security concerns
4. Test coverage
```

### Model-Specific Command

```markdown
---
description: Complex analysis with specific model
model: claude-sonnet-4-20250514
---

Perform detailed analysis of $ARGUMENTS.
```

## Preventing Auto-Invocation

To prevent Claude from invoking a command automatically via the Skill tool:

```markdown
---
description: Deploy to production (manual only)
disable-model-invocation: true
---

Deploy the application to production.
```

## Command-Scoped Hooks

Define hooks that run only during command execution:

```markdown
---
description: Deploy with validation
hooks:
  PreToolUse:
    - matcher: "Bash"
      hooks:
        - type: command
          command: "./scripts/validate.sh"
          once: true
---

Deploy to staging environment.
```

The `once: true` option runs the hook only once per session.

## Troubleshooting

### Command not appearing

1. Check file is in correct location (`.claude/commands/` or `$HOME/.claude/commands/`)
2. Verify `.md` extension
3. Run `/help` to see available commands

### Arguments not working

1. Use `$ARGUMENTS` for all args or `$1`, `$2` for positional
2. Check for typos in placeholder names

### Bash execution failing

1. Ensure `allowed-tools: Bash(...)` is in frontmatter
2. Check command syntax is correct
3. Verify the shell command works standalone
