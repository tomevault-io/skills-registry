description: Comprehensive dependency update workflow for resolving Dependabot alerts and PRs. Use when: (1) User wants to update dependencies, (2) User mentions 'dependabot', 'security vulnerabilities', or 'dependency updates', (3) User asks to run security audit, (4) User wants to create a deps-update PR. Analyzes Dependabot issues, runs security audit (pnpm audit), creates update branch, applies updates, runs quality checks (typecheck, lint, test, build), handles Playwright Docker image sync, and creates PR with full changelog. Use when this capability is needed.

# Dependabot Resolution Workflow

Execute a comprehensive dependency update workflow:

## Step 1: Analyze Dependabot Issues

- Use `gh issue list --label "dependencies" --state open --json number,title,url,body` to list all open Dependabot issues
- For each issue, carefully analyze:
  - What dependency is being updated
  - What version change is proposed (patch/minor/major)
  - Any breaking changes mentioned
  - Security vulnerabilities fixed
- Determine which updates should be applied based on:
  - Security fixes (high priority)
  - Patch updates (generally safe)
  - Minor updates (review carefully)
  - Major updates (review very carefully for breaking changes)

## Step 2: Run Security Audit

- Run `pnpm audit` to check for security vulnerabilities
- Identify any critical or high-severity issues
- Note any recommended updates from the audit

## Step 3: Create Update Branch

If there are updates to apply:

- Get current date in MMDD format (e.g., "1220" for December 20th)
- Get the current branch name to use as base
- Create new branch: `deps-update-MMDD` from the current branch
- Switch to the new branch

## Step 4: Apply Updates

- For each dependency to update:
  - Use `pnpm update <package-name>` or `pnpm add <package-name>@<version>` as appropriate
  - If it's a major version update, check for breaking changes in the changelog first
- After all updates, run `pnpm install` to ensure lockfile is updated

## Step 4.5: Handle Related Updates (Package + Infrastructure Sync)

Some packages require coordinated updates across multiple files. Check for these patterns:

### Playwright Package + Docker Image

When updating `@playwright/test` or `playwright` in package.json:

1. **Check current versions**:
   - `package.json`: Look for `@playwright/test` and `playwright` versions
   - `.github/workflows/*.yml`: Search for `mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v` Docker image tags

2. **Update Docker image tag** to match the npm package version:
   ```yaml
   # In workflow files using Playwright Docker container
   container:
     image: mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v<NEW_VERSION>-noble
   ```

3. **Verify image exists** at https://mcr.microsoft.com/v2/playwright/tags/list or check Microsoft's Playwright Docker documentation

4. **Example**: If updating `@playwright/test` from `1.57.0` to `1.58.0`:
   - Update package.json: `"@playwright/test": "^1.58.0"`
   - Update workflow: `image: mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.58.0-noble`

### Other Common Pairs to Watch

- **TypeScript + @types packages**: May need coordinated updates
- **ESLint + plugins**: Plugin versions often need to match ESLint major version
- **Next.js + related packages**: `next`, `eslint-config-next`, etc.

## Step 5: Quality Checks

Run all quality checks in sequence:

1. **Type checking**: `pnpm typecheck`
2. **Linting**: `pnpm lint` (or `pnpm lint:fix` if auto-fixable)
3. **Formatting**: `pnpm format` (or `pnpm format:fix` if needed)
4. **Unit tests**: `pnpm test:unit`
5. **Build**: `pnpm build` (to ensure the project builds successfully)
6. **E2E tests**: `pnpm test:e2e:critical` or `pnpm test:e2e:full-prod` for comprehensive testing

## Step 6: Review Results

- If all checks pass:
  - Proceed to Step 7
- If any checks fail:
  - Investigate the failure
  - Determine if it's a breaking change or test needs updating
  - Fix issues or revert problematic updates
  - Re-run quality checks

## Step 7: Push and Create PR

Once all checks pass:

- Stage all changes: `git add .`
- Commit with descriptive message: `git commit -m "chore: Update dependencies (MMDD)"`
- Push to remote: `git push -u origin deps-update-MMDD`
- Create PR using `gh pr create` with:
  - Title: "chore: Update dependencies (MMDD)"
  - Body including:
    - List of updated packages and versions
    - Summary of security fixes (if any)
    - Links to Dependabot issues being resolved using list format:
      ```
      - 関連Issue
          - https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<issue-1>
          - https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<issue-2>
      ```
    - Note that all quality checks passed
  - **Use full URLs** (not #<number>) so GitHub auto-expands them to show issue titles

## Important Notes

- Never auto-merge - always create PR for manual review
- For major version updates, mention breaking changes in PR description
- If updating critical dependencies (Gatsby, React, etc.), note that extra testing may be needed
- Close related Dependabot issues after PR is merged
- Follow the project's dependency management guidelines from CLAUDE.md

## Safety Checks

- Never use `--force` flags
- Always run full test suite before pushing
- Check for deprecation warnings during build
- Verify the build output works correctly (`pnpm serve` and manual testing if needed)
