# Create B4Push Script

Generate a comprehensive before-push validation script for the current project.

## Workflow

### 1. Analyze the project

Read `package.json` to understand:

- Package manager (pnpm/npm/yarn) - check lockfiles
- Available scripts: `check`, `build`, `test`, `lint`, `format`, `typecheck`
- Whether there's a doc site (look for `doc/`, `docs/`, `website/` directories with their own package.json)
- Whether there are e2e tests (playwright, cypress)
- Whether there are data generation scripts (e.g., `generate-*` scripts in doc)

### 2. Determine steps

Common step patterns (adapt to project):

| Step | Command | When to include |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Code quality | `pnpm check` or `pnpm lint && pnpm format` | Always |
| TypeScript build | `pnpm build` | If `build` script exists |
| Unit tests | `pnpm test` | If `test` script exists |
| Doc data generation | `cd doc && pnpm run generate-*` | If doc site has generate scripts |
| Doc quality checks | `cd doc && pnpm run check` | If doc site has check script |
| Doc site build | `cd doc && pnpm build` | If doc site exists |
| E2E tests | Start server + run playwright | If e2e tests exist |

For projects with e2e tests, add server lifecycle management (start, wait for ready, run tests, kill).

### 3. Create the shell script

Create `scripts/run-b4push.sh` based on the template in `assets/run-b4push-template.sh`.

Key patterns:

- `set -euo pipefail` for strict error handling
- `FAILURES=()` array - continues all steps even if some fail
- `step()`, `pass()`, `fail()` helper functions
- Subshell execution `(cd "$DIR" && command)` to isolate directory changes
- `ROOT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "$0")/.." && pwd)"` for reliable path resolution
- Summary section with elapsed time and failure list
- Exit 0 on success, exit 1 on any failure

Make the script executable: `chmod +x scripts/run-b4push.sh`

### 4. Add package.json script

Add to `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "b4push": "./scripts/run-b4push.sh"
  }
}
```

### 5. Create project-level b4push skill

Create `.claude/skills/b4push/skill.md` based on `assets/b4push-skill-template.md`.

Customize:

- Step list with project-specific descriptions
- Estimated duration
- Fix commands specific to the project (e.g., `pnpm check:fix`, `cd doc && pnpm check:fix`)

The skill should have `user-invocable: true` and `allowed-tools: [Bash]`. The description must include triggers for automatic invocation on big changes, PR completion, etc.

### 6. Test

Run `pnpm b4push` to verify all steps execute correctly. Fix any issues found.

## Reference projects

These projects have working b4push setups:

- **mdx-formatter**: 6 steps (quality, build, test, doc data, doc quality, doc build), ~40s
- **zmod**: 9 steps including e2e with production server, ~3-4 min
- **zpanels**: Dual-track (quick 3 steps ~3-5 min, full 6+ steps with e2e ~10-15 min)
