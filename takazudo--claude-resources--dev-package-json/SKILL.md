# package.json & npm Config Management

## Part 1: package.json Scripts Organization

Two techniques for keeping large `scripts` sections readable and maintainable.

### Technique 1: Comment Separator Keys

Add visual section dividers using unused JSON keys:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "// ── Core ─────────────────────────────────────────": "",
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "// ── Testing ─────────────────────────────────────": "",
    "test": "jest",
    "test:e2e": "playwright test"
  }
}
```

Format: `"// ── Section Name ──────..."` with `─` padding to ~50 chars, value `""`.

### Technique 2: Predev Port Cleanup

Add a `predev` script that kills stale processes on dev server ports before starting. This prevents "port already in use" errors that commonly occur after crashes, orphaned processes, or forgotten terminal sessions.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "predev": "lsof -ti :5173,:8787 | xargs kill 2>/dev/null; true",
    "dev": "next dev"
  }
}
```

How it works:
- `lsof -ti :PORT` — finds PIDs listening on specified ports (`-t` = terse/PID-only, `-i` = internet addresses)
- Comma-separated ports: `:5173,:8787` checks multiple ports at once
- `xargs kill` — sends SIGTERM (graceful) to found processes
- `2>/dev/null; true` — silently succeeds when no processes are found
- npm/pnpm auto-runs `predev` before `dev` (lifecycle hook convention)

Adapt port numbers to match your project's dev servers (e.g., `:3000,:8080` for a typical Node.js + API setup).

### Technique 3: External Shell Scripts for Multi-Process Commands

When a command starts 2+ background processes, extract to `scripts/*.sh`.

Template available at `scripts/multi-process-dev.sh.template`. Key pattern:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e
cleanup() {
  kill $PID_1 $PID_2 2>/dev/null
  wait $PID_1 $PID_2 2>/dev/null
}
trap cleanup EXIT INT TERM

if [ "$MODE" = "local" ]; then
  backend-server &
  PID_1=$!
  sleep 3
fi

pnpm dev &
PID_2=$!
wait
```

Call from package.json: `"dev:full": "MODE=local ./scripts/dev-full.sh"`

Make executable: `chmod +x scripts/*.sh`

### Multi-Environment Pattern

For apps with local/preview/production API targets:

```json
{
  "// ── Dev with API (3 environments) ───────────────": "",
  "dev:full": "API_MODE=local ./scripts/dev-full.sh",
  "dev:full:preview": "API_MODE=preview pnpm dev",
  "dev:full:prod": "API_MODE=production pnpm dev"
}
```

### Detailed Patterns

## Part 2: pnpm Version Management with Corepack

### The `packageManager` Field

Pin the exact pnpm version in `package.json`:

```json
{
  "packageManager": "pnpm@10.30.2+sha512.36cdc707e7b..."
}
```

This ensures every developer and CI uses the identical pnpm version. Corepack reads this field and auto-downloads the specified version.

### Setup (Once Per Machine)

```bash
corepack enable
```

After this, running `pnpm install` / `pnpm dev` / etc. just works — corepack intercepts the `pnpm` command and uses the pinned version automatically. No global pnpm install needed.

### Key Rules

- **Never run `pnpm self-update`** — it errors when pnpm is managed by corepack
- **Never run `corepack use pnpm@latest` routinely** — it bumps the version in `package.json` and often regenerates `pnpm-lock.yaml`, creating noisy diffs
- **Only update intentionally** — when the team decides to upgrade, one person runs `corepack use pnpm@<version>`, commits the `package.json` + lockfile changes, and everyone else gets it via `pnpm install`
- **Different repos can pin different versions** — corepack handles per-project version switching automatically

### Common Mistake

AI tools and automation sometimes add `corepack use pnpm@latest` to setup steps. This causes unnecessary version bumps and lockfile churn. Remove it — `corepack enable` + the existing `packageManager` field is sufficient.

## Part 3: .npmrc Build Script Security Management

Evaluate and manage dependency build scripts for supply chain security.

See [references/npmrc-build-scripts.md](references/npmrc-build-scripts.md) for:
- The full evaluation workflow for "Ignored build scripts" warnings
- Decision criteria for allowBuilds vs ignoredBuilds
- Common package evaluations (reference table)
