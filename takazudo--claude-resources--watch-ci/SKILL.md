description: Watch GitHub PR CI checks in the background and notify on completion. Use when: (1) User wants to monitor CI/CD pipeline status, (2) User says 'watch CI', 'check CI', 'monitor checks', or 'wait for CI', (3) User wants to know when PR checks pass or fail. Launches a background agent that polls CI every 30 seconds, sends macOS system notification on completion. Also handles merged PRs by watching the merge target branch CI instead. Use when this capability is needed.

# Watch CI

Monitor GitHub PR CI checks in the background, notify on completion via macOS system notification.
Also supports watching CI on the merge target branch when a PR is already merged.

## Scripts

- **Notification**: `$HOME/.claude/skills/watch-ci/scripts/notify.sh`

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify the PR

Determine which PR to watch:

```bash
# If user provides a PR number or URL, use it directly
# Otherwise, detect from current branch
gh pr view --json number,title,url,headRefName,baseRefName,state,mergeCommit --jq '{number,title,url,headRefName,baseRefName,state,mergeCommit}'
```

If no PR is found for the current branch, inform the user and stop.

**Check the PR state:**

- If `state` is `"OPEN"` → proceed to Step 2 (normal PR watch)
- If `state` is `"MERGED"` → proceed to Step 2b (merged PR: watch target branch CI)
- If `state` is `"CLOSED"` (not merged) → inform the user the PR was closed without merging and stop

### Step 2: Show Initial Status (Open PR)

Show the current state:

```bash
gh pr checks <PR_NUMBER> --json name,state,bucket,workflow
```

Report to the user: PR number/title, total checks, current status breakdown (passed/pending/failed).

If all checks already passed or failed, skip to Step 4 or Step 5 respectively. Otherwise proceed to **Step 3**.

### Step 2b: Merged PR — Switch to Target Branch CI

When the PR is already merged:

1. Get the base branch and merge commit SHA from Step 1 output
2. Inform the user: "PR #123 is already merged into `main`. Watching CI on `main` for merge commit `abc1234`..."
3. Show initial status:

   ```bash
   gh run list --branch <base-branch> --commit <merge-commit-sha> --json databaseId,name,status,conclusion --limit 20
   ```

   If no runs found with commit SHA, retry without it:

   ```bash
   gh run list --branch <base-branch> --json databaseId,name,status,conclusion --limit 10
   ```

4. Proceed to **Step 3**.

### Step 3: Launch Background Watch

Launch a **background Agent** to poll CI status. The agent should:

- Poll every 30 seconds using `sleep 30` between checks
- For open PRs: run `gh pr checks <PR_NUMBER> --json name,state,bucket` each cycle
- For merged PRs: run `gh run list --branch <base-branch> --commit <sha> --json databaseId,name,status,conclusion --limit 20` each cycle
- Print a brief progress update each cycle (e.g., "5/8 passed, 3 pending")
- Stop when all checks reach a terminal state (all passed, or any failed)
- On **success**: run `bash $HOME/.claude/skills/watch-ci/scripts/notify.sh success "All CI checks passed! PR #<number>"`
- On **failure**: run `bash $HOME/.claude/skills/watch-ci/scripts/notify.sh error "CI check failed: <check-name>. PR #<number>"`
- Maximum watch time: 60 minutes. After that, notify with warning and stop.

**Agent prompt template** (adapt based on PR state):

```
Watch CI for PR #<NUMBER> (<title>).
Poll every 30 seconds until all checks complete.

For each poll cycle:
1. Run: gh pr checks <NUMBER> --json name,state,bucket
2. Count passed/pending/failed from the bucket field
3. Print progress: "Checking... X/Y passed, Z pending"
4. If all terminal (no pending): stop and notify

On completion:
- If all passed: run bash $HOME/.claude/skills/watch-ci/scripts/notify.sh success "All CI checks passed! PR #<NUMBER>"
- If any failed: run bash $HOME/.claude/skills/watch-ci/scripts/notify.sh error "CI check failed: <failed-check-names>. PR #<NUMBER>"
  Then investigate: run gh run list --branch <branch> --status failure --limit 5 --json databaseId,name,conclusion
  Then run gh run view <run-id> --log-failed for each failed run
  Analyze the logs and report the root cause.

Between each check: sleep 30
Max duration: 60 minutes (warn and stop if exceeded)
```

Tell the user: "Watching CI in background. You'll be notified when it completes."

### Step 4: All Checks Passed (Foreground Fast Path)

If checks already passed at Step 2/2b (no polling needed):

1. Send notification:

   ```bash
   bash $HOME/.claude/skills/watch-ci/scripts/notify.sh success "All CI checks passed! PR #<number>"
   ```

2. Report the final status summary.

### Step 5: CI Check Failed (Foreground Fast Path)

If checks already failed at Step 2/2b:

1. Send notification:

   ```bash
   bash $HOME/.claude/skills/watch-ci/scripts/notify.sh error "CI check failed: <check-name>. PR #<number>"
   ```

2. Investigate the failure:

   ```bash
   gh pr checks <PR_NUMBER> --json name,state,bucket,link --jq '[.[] | select(.bucket == "fail" or .bucket == "cancel")]'
   gh run list --branch <branch> --status failure --limit 5 --json databaseId,name,conclusion
   gh run view <run-id> --log-failed
   ```

3. Analyze and report. For open PRs: offer to fix. For merged PRs: report only, do NOT auto-fix on the target branch.

## Notes

- Uses background Agent for polling — the main conversation stays free
- No custom shell scripts for checking — uses `gh` commands directly
- System notifications use macOS `osascript` via notify.sh
- The `gh` CLI must be authenticated and have access to the repository
- 30-second polling interval balances responsiveness with API rate limits
- For merged PRs, watches workflow runs on the target branch filtered by merge commit SHA
