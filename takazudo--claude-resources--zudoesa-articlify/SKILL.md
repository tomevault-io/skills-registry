# Articlify for esa

Convert the current conversation into an esa article by crafting a detailed writing brief and delegating to the `zudoesa-writer` subagent.

## Argument: `--conversation`

When `$ARGUMENTS` contains `--conversation`, the article must preserve the actual
conversation as-is. This means:

- **NEVER summarize the conversation.** Reproduce the actual dialogue flow faithfully.
- **Keep casual utterances.** Words like 「なるほど」「ふーん」「どう思う？」「OK」

  「hum...」are meaningful conversational texture — they make the article sound
  natural and human. Removing them makes it look AI-auto-written.

- **Minimal rewriting only.** Typo fixes and light formatting are OK. Do NOT

  restructure, condense, or rephrase the user's words beyond that.

- **Include the brief in the writing prompt** with explicit instruction:

  "This is a conversation-style article. Preserve the dialogue verbatim.
  Only fix typos and apply vocabulary rules. Do not summarize or restructure."

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather context from conversation

Review the conversation history and identify:

- What topic was discussed
- What was tried (approaches A, B, C...)
- What worked and what didn't
- Key technical details, code snippets, commands
- The conclusion or final approach taken
- Any opinions or insights expressed
- **Images**: Any images attached to the conversation (screenshots, diagrams, etc.)

### Step 1.5: Handle images (if any)

If images were provided in the conversation (attached screenshots, diagrams, etc.):

1. **Determine the article slug** from the topic (e.g., `20260209-package-json-organization`)
2. **Create the image directory** in the esa repo:

   ```
   mkdir -p $HOME/repos/w/esa/doc/public/img/articles/YYYYMMDD-slug/
   ```

3. **Copy each image** to that directory with a descriptive filename:

   ```
   cp /path/to/source/image.png $HOME/repos/w/esa/doc/public/img/articles/YYYYMMDD-slug/descriptive-name.png
   ```

4. **Record the image paths** for the writing brief. The markdown reference format is:

   ```
   ![alt text](/img/articles/YYYYMMDD-slug/descriptive-name.png)
   ```

### Step 2: Craft the writing brief

Create a **detailed, self-contained prompt** that the writer subagent can use without any conversation context. The brief must include:

1. **Article topic**: Clear one-line description
2. **Background**: Why this was done, what motivated it
3. **Story arc**: The journey (tried X, it failed because Y, then tried Z which worked)
4. **Technical details**: Specific code, commands, configurations, error messages
5. **Key points to cover**: Bullet list of must-include content
6. **Images**: If images were copied in Step 1.5, list each with its markdown path and a description of what it shows and where it should be placed in the article
7. **Conclusion**: What was the outcome, what was learned
8. **Tone guidance**: Any specific angle or framing (if applicable)

The brief should be written so that someone with zero context could write the full article from it alone.

### Step 3: Delegate to subagent

Use the Agent tool to spawn the `zudoesa-writer` subagent with `run_in_background: true` so the user is not blocked during writing:

```
Agent tool:
  subagent_type: zudoesa-writer
  run_in_background: true
  prompt: [the detailed writing brief from Step 2]
```

The subagent will:

- Read the repo's writing style guides
- Write the article in Japanese following esa conventions
- Set `sidebar_position` using the formula `999999999999 - YYYYMMDDHHMM` (ensures newest articles appear first)
- Save to the articles directory
- Run formatting checks

### Step 4: Verify sidebar_position

After the subagent completes, read the created article file and verify that:

- `sidebar_position` is present in the frontmatter
- The value follows the formula `999999999999 - YYYYMMDDHHMM`

If `sidebar_position` is missing or incorrect, fix it directly. This is critical — without it, the article appears at the bottom of the sidebar instead of the top.

### Step 5: Report back

After the subagent completes, report:

- The file path of the created article
- A brief summary of what was written

## Important Notes

- The writing brief is the ONLY context the subagent receives - make it thorough
- Include actual code snippets, error messages, and command outputs in the brief
- If the conversation involved multiple topics, ask the user which one to articlify
- **Images must be copied BEFORE delegating** - the subagent cannot see conversation images
- Include the full markdown image reference paths in the brief so the subagent can embed them
- $ARGUMENTS can provide additional guidance on focus or angle
