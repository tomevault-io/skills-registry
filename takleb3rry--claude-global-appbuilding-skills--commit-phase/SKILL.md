# Commit Phase

Complete git workflow for Phase $ARGUMENTS:

## Step 0: Pre-Commit Checks

Run the following checks before committing.

> **If you're thinking...** | **Do this instead**
> ---|---
> "Naming conventions are fine, I followed them during build" | That's what the check verifies. If you followed them, it takes 5 seconds.
> "I'll merge to main, staging is overkill for this" | Ask the user. Merge target is their decision, not yours.
> "The plan file is still useful, I'll keep it" | Used plans are noise. Delete it. The implementation plan and git history are the record.

### 0a: Naming Convention Check

If `naming_conventions.md` exists in project root:

1. Identify the project's primary language/framework from project files
2. Get changed source files relevant to that stack: `git diff --name-only HEAD`
3. For each changed file, verify it follows the conventions documented in naming_conventions.md
   - Focus on naming consistency, test selectors, and patterns defined in the conventions
   - Use judgment about which conventions apply to which file types
4. Report findings:
   - **BLOCKING**: Issues that will likely break tests or cause runtime errors
   - **WARNING**: Inconsistencies that deviate from documented conventions
5. If issues found, ask: "Fix now or proceed anyway?"
6. If proceeding with issues, append to commit message:
   "Note: Convention issues deferred - see harmonize-report.md"

### 0b: DB Integration Check

If staged files touch `src/lib/db/schema/` or `drizzle/migrations/`:

1. Run: `npx vitest run src/lib/db/integration.test.ts`
2. Report findings:
   - **BLOCKING**: Any table missing from the live DB (migration not applied)
   - **BLOCKING**: DATABASE_URL not set or DB unreachable
   - **PASS**: All expected tables found — report the count and proceed
3. If BLOCKING issues found, ask: "Apply pending migrations first, or proceed anyway?"
4. If proceeding with issues, note it in the commit message

## Steps 1-5: Git Workflow

1. Check current branch: If on main or staging, create feature branch:
   `git checkout -b phase-$ARGUMENTS-implementation`
2. Stage all changes: `git add .`
3. Commit with message: "Phase $ARGUMENTS: [brief description of phase deliverables]"
4. Push branch: `git push -u origin phase-$ARGUMENTS-implementation`
5. **Merge target — ask user before merging:**
   - Check if a `staging` branch exists: `git branch -a | grep staging`
   - If staging exists, ask: "Merge to **staging** (preview/test) or **main** (production)?"
   - If no staging branch exists, merge to main (current behavior)
   - Execute:
     - If **staging**: `git checkout staging && git merge phase-$ARGUMENTS-implementation && git push`
     - If **main**: `git checkout main && git merge phase-$ARGUMENTS-implementation && git push`
   - Return to the feature branch after merge: `git checkout phase-$ARGUMENTS-implementation`

Use implementation_plan.md to reference what this phase delivered for the commit message.

## Step 6: Clean Up Plan File

After merge is complete, delete `phase{$ARGUMENTS}_plan.md` if it exists. Just delete it locally - do NOT commit or push this deletion separately. It will be included in the next phase's commit naturally.

## Benefits of This Workflow
- Traceability: Each phase has its own branch in git history
- Rollback capability: Can revert the merge commit if needed
- Clear audit trail: Feature branches document what changed per phase
- Quality gate: Naming conventions checked before merge

## When to Use
- Phase implementation is complete and tested
- User says "commit phase X", "finish phase X", "wrap up phase X"
- User says "phase X is done", "let's commit this phase", "finish up phase X"
- Ready to merge completed work to main

## When NOT to Use
- Work is incomplete or tests are failing
- Still in the middle of implementing (continue with `/execute-phase`)
- Just want a regular commit (use git directly)
