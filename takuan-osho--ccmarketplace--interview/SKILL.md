description: Conduct structured interviews to gather requirements, clarify specifications, or understand context. This skill should be used when starting a new task that requires understanding user intent, requirements, technical specifications, or context. It supports various interview types including requirements definition, debugging investigation, architecture review, and general information gathering. Use when this capability is needed.

# Interview

## Overview

This skill provides a structured interview framework to systematically gather information before starting work. It helps reduce ambiguity, ensure comprehensive understanding, and produce actionable outputs. The interview adapts to different contexts: requirements definition, debugging, architecture decisions, security review, and more.

## When to Use

- Starting a new feature implementation
- Investigating bugs or issues
- Reviewing architecture or security
- Creating documentation or reports
- Any task requiring clarification of scope, constraints, or expectations

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Preparation (Silent)

Before asking questions, gather background context silently.

> **Parallel Fan-Out Pattern**: The following three preparation tasks have no dependencies on each other and SHOULD be executed in parallel. This reduces Phase 1 completion time by approximately 66%.
>
> Reference: [Google ADK Multi-Agent Patterns](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/multi-agents/)

**Codebase Exploration:** *(parallel task 1/3)*
- Project structure - Identify key directories, config files, entry points
- Recent changes - Check git history if applicable
- Related code - Search for relevant patterns or implementations

**Documentation Review:** *(parallel task 2/3)*
- Read any referenced files or URLs provided by user
- Check for existing specifications, ADRs, or design documents
- Review related issues or PRs if applicable

**Web Research (if applicable):** *(parallel task 3/3)*
- Best practices for the domain
- Similar implementations or patterns
- Security considerations

For detailed exploration commands per environment (Claude Code, Codex, API), see `references/exploration-patterns.md`.

### Phase 2: Interview

Conduct the interview in stages, adapting questions based on interview type.

#### Stage 1: Goal Confirmation

Start by confirming the overall objective:

**Environment-specific approach:**
- **Claude Code**: Use AskUserQuestion tool for structured choices
- **Other environments**: Present numbered options and ask user to reply with number or description

**Core Questions:**
- What is the primary goal or outcome expected?
- Who are the stakeholders or users affected?
- What does success look like?

**Interview Type Selection:**

Ask the user to select the interview type to tailor subsequent questions:

| Type | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| Requirements | New feature, specification, API design |
| Investigation | Bug analysis, performance issue, incident |
| Architecture | Design review, technology selection, refactoring |
| Security | Security audit, vulnerability assessment |
| Documentation | Report creation, knowledge transfer |
| General | Open-ended exploration, brainstorming |

#### Stage 2: Deep Dive

Based on the selected interview type, ask targeted questions.

For detailed question frameworks and output templates per interview type, read `references/interview-types.md`.

#### Stage 3: Confirmation and Prioritization

Before concluding:

1. **Summarize Understanding** - Restate key points for confirmation
2. **Identify Gaps** - Note any undecided or unclear items
3. **Prioritize** - Classify requirements as Must/Should/Could
4. **Confirm Scope** - Agree on what is in/out of scope

### Deep Dive Strategies

Use these techniques to reduce ambiguity:

| Technique | When to Use |
|-----------|-------------|
| "Specifically?" | When details are vague |
| "Why?" | When motivation is unclear |
| "What else?" | When list seems incomplete |
| "For example?" | When concept needs illustration |
| "What if...?" | When edge cases need exploration |

### Phase 3: Output

Generate a structured summary document.

#### Output Template

```markdown
# [Interview Type]: [Topic]

## Summary
[1-2 sentence overview]

## Goal
- **Objective**: [Primary goal]
- **Stakeholders**: [Who is affected]
- **Success Criteria**: [How to measure success]

## Requirements / Findings
### Must Have
- [Item 1]
- [Item 2]

### Should Have
- [Item 1]

### Could Have
- [Item 1]

## Constraints
- [Technical constraints]
- [Business constraints]
- [Timeline constraints]

## Undecided / Open Questions
- [ ] [Question 1]
- [ ] [Question 2]

## Next Steps
1. [Action item 1]
2. [Action item 2]

## References
- [Link or file reference 1]
- [Link or file reference 2]

## Affected Files / Components
- `path/to/file1`
- `path/to/file2`
```

## Usage Examples

For detailed usage examples with sample outputs, see `references/usage-examples.md`.

Quick reference:
- `/interview Add user authentication` → Requirements interview
- `/interview Investigate 504 errors` → Investigation interview
- `/interview Review database schema` → Architecture interview

## Guidelines

1. **Adapt to Context** - Adjust question depth based on task complexity
2. **Avoid Overwhelming** - Ask 2-3 questions at a time, not all at once
3. **Be Specific** - Reference actual code, files, or examples when possible
4. **Document Everything** - Capture decisions and their rationale
5. **Identify Gaps Early** - Surface undecided items for follow-up
6. **Output Language** - Follow user's language preference (check conversation history)

## User Input Methods

### Claude Code Environment

Use the AskUserQuestion tool for structured choices:

```
Question: "What type of interview is this?"
Header: "Type"
Options:
  - "Requirements (Recommended)" - New feature or specification
  - "Investigation" - Bug or issue analysis
  - "Architecture" - Design or technology review
  - "Security" - Security assessment
```

This enables efficient selection with clickable options.

### Other Environments (Codex, API, etc.)

Present numbered options in plain text and wait for user response:

```
What type of interview is this?

1. Requirements - New feature or specification (Recommended)
2. Investigation - Bug or issue analysis
3. Architecture - Design or technology review
4. Security - Security assessment
5. Documentation - Report creation, knowledge transfer
6. General - Open-ended exploration

Please reply with a number (1-6) or describe your needs:
```

Wait for the user's response before proceeding. Accept both:
- Number selection (e.g., "1", "2")
- Free-form description (e.g., "I need to investigate a performance issue")
