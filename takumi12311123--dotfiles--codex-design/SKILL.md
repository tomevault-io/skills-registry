# Codex Design Consultation

## Purpose

**Design-phase Codex consultation**: Consult with Codex before making complex design decisions.
Get expert validation, alternative approaches, and risk assessment early in the development process.

## When to Use

### Mandatory Triggers
- Introducing implementation patterns NOT found in existing codebase
- Architecture decision with 3+ viable options
- Performance-critical implementations (high-traffic endpoints, real-time processing, etc.)
- Major refactoring affecting multiple modules
- New technology/framework introduction
- Security-sensitive design (authentication, authorization, cryptography)

### Optional but Recommended
- Database schema design for new features
- API design for public/external consumption
- Distributed system component design
- Complex algorithm implementation

## Consultation Flow

### Step 1: Problem Analysis

Claude Code analyzes the design problem:
```
- Current situation and constraints
- Requirements (functional and non-functional)
- Existing codebase patterns
- Performance/security requirements
- Team expertise and maintenance considerations
```

### Step 2: Generate Design Options

Claude Code proposes 2-3 viable approaches:

```markdown
## Option 1: [Approach Name]
**Pros:**
- [Advantage 1]
- [Advantage 2]

**Cons:**
- [Drawback 1]
- [Drawback 2]

**Implementation Complexity:** Low/Medium/High
**Maintenance Cost:** Low/Medium/High
**Performance Impact:** Low/Medium/High

## Option 2: [Approach Name]
...

## Option 3: [Approach Name]
...
```

### Step 3: Codex Consultation

Execute Codex in read-only sandbox for design review:

```bash
codex exec --model gpt-5.4 --sandbox read-only "$(cat <<'EOF'
# Design Consultation Request

All string fields (reasoning, risks, recommendations, guidance) must be in Japanese.

)"
```

### Step 4: Analysis and Synthesis

Claude Code analyzes Codex's response:
- Evaluate recommendation validity
- Consider project-specific context
- Synthesize with existing codebase patterns
- Identify any conflicting advice

### Step 5: Present to User

**All user-facing output must be in Japanese.**

```

## Specific Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Database Schema Design

```markdown
## Problem
Database design for new multi-tenant feature

## Options
1. Single database with tenant_id column
2. Database per tenant
3. Schema per tenant (PostgreSQL)

[Codex consultation...]

## Codex Recommendation
Option 3 (Schema per tenant) for this scale
- Reasoning: Balance of isolation and management
- Risk: Schema migration complexity
- Mitigation: Use migration tool like Flyway
```

### Use Case 2: API Design Pattern

```markdown
## Problem
API design for new microservice communication

## Options
1. REST with JSON
2. gRPC
3. GraphQL

[Codex consultation...]

## Codex Recommendation
Option 2 (gRPC) for internal services
- Reasoning: Type safety, performance, streaming support
- Risk: Steeper learning curve
- Mitigation: Start with simple unary calls, add streaming later
```

### Use Case 3: State Management

```markdown
## Problem
State management for React application

## Options
1. Redux Toolkit
2. Zustand
3. Jotai

[Codex consultation...]

## Codex Recommendation
Option 2 (Zustand) for this project size
- Reasoning: Simplicity, less boilerplate, sufficient for current needs
- Risk: Might need migration if app grows significantly
- Mitigation: Keep state logic modular for easier migration
```

## Error Handling

### Codex Timeout
- Wait up to 10 minutes (10 polls)
- If timeout: Present options to user without Codex input
- Explain that consultation couldn't complete

### Codex API Failure
- Retry once after 5 seconds
- If retry fails: Proceed with Claude Code's analysis only
- Inform user that external validation unavailable

### Conflicting Recommendations
- If Codex recommendation contradicts project constraints
- Claude Code highlights the conflict
- Provides reasoning for both perspectives
- Lets user make informed decision

## Output Quality Indicators

### High Confidence Output
- Clear recommendation with strong reasoning
- Multiple supporting examples
- Specific implementation guidance
- Risk assessment with mitigations

### Low Confidence Output
- Multiple viable options with trade-offs
- Insufficient context for firm recommendation
- Suggests gathering more information
- Recommends prototyping or spike

## Configuration Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| timeout_minutes | 10 | Codex consultation timeout |
| min_options | 2 | Minimum design options to present |
| max_options | 4 | Maximum design options to present |
| require_risk_assessment | true | Require risk analysis for each option |
| include_examples | true | Include similar project examples |

## Success Criteria

Consultation is successful when:
- Codex provides clear recommendation
- All options have risk assessment
- Implementation guidance provided
- User has sufficient information to decide
- Potential pitfalls identified

## Best Practices

### Before Consultation
1. Clearly define the problem and constraints
2. Research existing patterns in codebase
3. Identify at least 2 viable options
4. Document non-functional requirements

### During Consultation
1. Wait for complete Codex response
2. Validate recommendations against project context
3. Identify any missed considerations
4. Synthesize with project-specific knowledge

### After Consultation
1. Document the decision and rationale
2. Update architecture documentation if needed
3. Share decision with team
4. Reference consultation in implementation

## Important Reminders

1. **Use early** - Consult before writing code, not after
2. **Be specific** - Provide detailed context and constraints
3. **Consider context** - Codex doesn't know your project specifics
4. **Final decision** - Human makes the final call, not AI
5. **Document** - Record the decision for future reference
6. **Output in Japanese** - All user-facing text in Japanese
