# Markdown Syntax Formatter

Format and repair Markdown documents following CommonMark and GitHub Flavored Markdown
specifications. Ensure proper syntax, consistent structure, and correct rendering across
standard parsers.

## Capabilities

- Analyze document structure to identify intended hierarchy and formatting elements
- Convert visual formatting cues (ALL CAPS, bullet characters, emphasis indicators) into
  proper Markdown syntax
- Fix heading hierarchies ensuring logical progression without skipped levels
- Format lists with consistent markers and proper indentation
- Handle code blocks and inline code with appropriate language identifiers
- Apply Swiss German orthography rules to German-language content
- Respect context-specific linter exceptions (e.g., duplicate headings in training
  materials)

## Workflow

1. **Analyze** the input text to identify headings, lists, code sections, emphasis, and
   structural elements
2. **Transform** visual cues into correct Markdown syntax
3. **Ensure** heading hierarchy follows logical progression with proper spacing
4. **Convert** numbered sequences to ordered lists and bullet points to consistent
   unordered lists
5. **Apply** proper code block formatting with language identifiers where recognizable
6. **Use** correct emphasis markers (double asterisks for bold, single for italic)
7. **Apply** language-specific conventions when the document is in German (see
   [Swiss German Conventions](swiss-german-conventions.md))
8. **Verify** that all syntax renders correctly and follows Markdown best practices

## Output Standards

- Clean, well-formatted Markdown that renders correctly in standard parsers
- Proper document structure with preserved logical flow
- Consistent formatting for lists, headings, code blocks, and emphasis
- Correct spacing and line breaks following Markdown conventions
- Quality-checked output without broken formatting or parsing errors
- Context-aware formatting decisions for ambiguous cases based on common conventions

## Heading Rules

- Never skip heading levels (e.g., do not jump from `##` to `####`)
- Ensure a single `#` top-level heading per document
- Add a blank line before and after each heading
- Use ATX-style headings (`#`) consistently, not Setext-style (underlines)

## List Rules

- Use `-` for unordered lists (consistent marker)
- Use `1.` for all ordered list items (let the renderer handle numbering)
- Indent nested lists by 2 or 4 spaces consistently within a document
- Add a blank line before and after list blocks

## Code Block Rules

- Use fenced code blocks (triple backticks) with a language identifier
- Use inline code (single backticks) for short code references in prose
- Never nest code blocks
- Ensure closing fence matches opening fence

## Emphasis Rules

- Use `**bold**` for strong emphasis
- Use `*italic*` for regular emphasis
- Do not use underscores for emphasis in filenames or mixed contexts
- Avoid combining bold and italic unless semantically justified

## Language-Specific Handling

When the document contains German text, apply Swiss German orthography rules
automatically. See [Swiss German Conventions](swiss-german-conventions.md) for the
complete ruleset including:

- Replacing ß with `ss` in all German text
- Preserving proper umlauts (no digraph substitutions)
- Exceptions for code blocks, URLs, and external quotations

## Linter Exceptions

Certain Markdown linting rules have legitimate exceptions depending on document context.
See [Linter Exceptions](linter-exceptions.md) for detailed guidance on:

- MD024 (duplicate headings) in training materials, API docs, and templates
- Respecting project-level `.markdownlint.json` configuration
- When to suggest alternatives vs. when to accept exceptions

## Examples

### Fixing Heading Hierarchy

**Before:**
```markdown
# Title
### Subsection (skipped h2)
##### Detail (skipped h3, h4)
```

**After:**
```markdown
# Title

## Subsection

### Detail
```

### Converting Visual Formatting

**Before:**
```
INTRODUCTION

This is the main text. The IMPORTANT POINTS are:
* first item
* second item
  - sub item a
  - sub item b
* third item

NOTE: Pay attention to this.
```

**After:**
```markdown
## Introduction

This is the main text. The **important points** are:

- First item
- Second item
  - Sub item a
  - Sub item b
- Third item

> **Note:** Pay attention to this.
```

### Code Block Formatting

**Before:**
```
Here is some code:

    function hello() {
        console.log("hello");
    }
```

**After:**
````markdown
Here is some code:

```javascript
function hello() {
    console.log("hello");
}
```
````

## Troubleshooting

### Mixed-Language Documents

Documents containing both German and English text require careful handling:

- Apply Swiss German orthography only to German-language sections
- Leave English sections unchanged
- When language boundaries are unclear, ask the user which sections are German
- Code blocks and technical terms remain unchanged regardless of surrounding language

### Conflicting Linter Configuration

When a project's `.markdownlint.json` conflicts with this skill's formatting rules:

- Project configuration takes precedence over skill defaults
- Read the configuration file before applying formatting changes
- If a rule is disabled in project config, do not "fix" what the linter allows
- Document any deviation from standard formatting in a comment to the user

### Large Documents with Many Issues

When a document has extensive formatting problems:

- Fix structural issues first (heading hierarchy, document outline)
- Then address list formatting and consistency
- Apply code block formatting next
- Handle emphasis and inline formatting last
- Apply language conventions (Swiss German) as a final pass
- Present a summary of changes made to the user
