# Documentation Keeper Skill

## Purpose

Maintain accuracy of documentation, vault entries, and configuration registries.

## Responsibilities

### 1. MCP Registry Verification

Check `knowledge-vault/Claude Family/MCP Registry.md` against:
- `~/.claude.json` global mcpServers
- Per-project mcpServers in projects section
- Individual `.mcp.json` files

### 2. Agent Spec Verification

Check `.claude/agents/` directory for:
- All agent_types have a corresponding `.md` agent file
- Agent files are current and reference valid tools
- Note: `mcp-servers/orchestrator/` has been retired (2026-02-24). Agent definitions are now in `.claude/agents/`.

### 3. Skill Path Verification

Check all skills in `.claude/skills/` exist and have content:
- Each skill folder has skill.md
- References in docs match actual skill locations

### 4. Vault Entry Staleness

Check knowledge-vault entries for:
- Outdated dates (synced_at > 30 days)
- Broken wiki links
- Missing related entries

## Verification Workflow

Use built-in Read/Glob/Grep tools (filesystem MCP retired Jan 2026):

```
1. Read MCP Registry.md
2. Read ~/.claude.json mcpServers section
3. Glob("**/.mcp.json", path="C:/Projects/") to list project MCP configs
4. Compare and flag discrepancies
5. Glob(".claude/agents/*.md") to list current agent definitions
6. Verify skill paths with Glob(".claude/skills/*/skill.md")
7. Output findings
```

## Output Format

```markdown

### MCP Registry
- [x] postgres: matches
- [x] project-tools: matches
