# Design System Governance

Deep guidance for assessing design system maturity, adoption health, and governance effectiveness.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- Evaluating design system adoption and governance health
- Assessing design system maturity level (1-4 scale)
- Analyzing component duplication and consolidation opportunities
- Calculating custom vs system component ratios
- Identifying adoption barriers and governance gaps
- Tracking design debt trends and metrics
- Making strategic governance recommendations

## Design System Maturity Model

### Level 1: Ad-hoc (No System)

**Characteristics:**
- No formal design system exists
- 100% custom components created per project
- No governance process or standards
- High maintenance burden and inconsistency
- Designers/developers work independently

**Metrics:**
- Design system adoption: 0%
- Component reuse rate: <10%
- Unique component count: Very high (100+)
- Custom component ratio: 100%
- Documentation coverage: <20%

**Transition To Level 2:**
- Define core design principles
- Create baseline component library
- Document existing patterns
- Establish governance committee
- Communicate vision to teams

---

### Level 2: Inconsistent (Emerging System)

**Characteristics:**
- Design system exists but adoption is spotty (30-60%)
- Mix of system components and custom variations
- Informal governance process
- Growing maintenance burden
- Teams aware of system but don't consistently use it

**Metrics:**
- Design system adoption: 30-60%
- Component reuse rate: 20-40%
- Unique component count: High (50-80)
- Custom component ratio: 50-70%
- Documentation coverage: 40-60%

**Adoption Barriers (Typical):**
- System doesn't cover all use cases
- Inconvenient process for requesting new components
- Lack of clear governance process
- Poor documentation or discoverability
- Team doesn't see value in consistency

**Transition To Level 3:**
- Expand component coverage (close gaps)
- Establish component request process
- Create clear governance guidelines
- Improve documentation and discoverability
- Enforce token usage in CI/CD
- Provide team training and support

---

### Level 3: Consistent (Mature System)

**Characteristics:**
- Design system widely adopted (60-90%)
- Most new work uses system components
- Formal governance process in place
- Manageable maintenance burden
- Teams understand and value consistency

**Metrics:**
- Design system adoption: 60-90%
- Component reuse rate: 60-75%
- Unique component count: Moderate (20-40)
- Custom component ratio: 20-40%
- Documentation coverage: 80-95%

**Governance Practices:**
- Design review process for new components
- Component request workflow with approval
- Design token enforcement in linters
- Regular audits of consistency
- Clear naming conventions
- Component versioning strategy

**Transition To Level 4:**
- Implement CI/CD enforcement
- Require design review for all deviations

- Strong governance process enforced
- Low maintenance burden
- Clear accountability for system health

**Metrics:**
- Design system adoption: >90%
- Component reuse rate: 80-95%
- Unique component count: Low (<20)
- Custom component ratio: <10%
- Documentation coverage: 95%+

**Governance Practices:**
- CI/CD enforcement of token usage
- Automated design compliance checks
- Required design review for deviations
- Component consolidation process
- Metrics dashboards tracking adoption
- Quarterly design system reviews
- Clear escalation process for exceptions

**Maintenance:**
- Low effort (high reuse, few custom components)
- Clear ownership and accountability
- Proactive improvements
- Regular metrics tracking

---

## Adoption Metrics Calculation

### Overall Adoption Score

```
Adoption Score = (System Components Used / Total Components) × 100

Example:
- System components used: 45
- Total components: 60
- Adoption Score: 45/60 = 75%
```

### Component Reuse Rate

```
Reuse Rate = (Total Component Instances / Unique Components) 

Example:
- Button component used in: homepage, product page, checkout, admin panel = 4 instances
- Modal component used in: help, confirmation, settings = 3 instances
- Total instances: 45
- Unique components: 8
- Reuse Rate: 45/8 = 5.6× average usage per component
```

### Design Debt Ratio

```
Design Debt = (Custom Components / Total Components) × 100

Example:
- Custom components: 15
- Total components: 60
- Design Debt: 15/60 = 25%

Interpretation:
- <10%: Level 4 (Excellent)
- 10-20%: Level 3 (Good)
- 20-40%: Level 2 (Concerning)
- >40%: Level 1 (Critical)
```

### Component Health Score

For each component category (buttons, modals, forms, etc.):

```
Category Health = (Components matching system / Total in category) × 100

Example - Buttons:
- System button variants: 6 (primary, secondary, tertiary, loading, disabled, outlined)
- Found implementations: 8 (system variants + 2 custom)
- Health Score: 6/8 = 75%
- Assessment: 75% of button implementations match system
```

## Design Debt Analysis

### Debt Drivers (Why Custom Components Exist)

**Legitimate Reasons:**
1. **Feature gap**: System doesn't support needed functionality
2. **Performance requirement**: Custom optimization for specific use case
3. **Brand evolution**: System hasn't been updated yet
4. **Experimental feature**: Temporary, pending system integration
5. **Third-party integration**: External component that can't be modified

**Warning Signs:**
1. **Misunderstanding**: Developer didn't know system component existed
2. **Convenience**: Faster to build custom than learn system
3. **Process gap**: No clear way to request new system component
4. **Visibility**: System component exists but hard to discover
5. **Governance gap**: No enforcement preventing custom creation

### Root Cause Analysis Process

For each custom component found:

1. **Categorize the driver**
   - Feature gap, performance, brand, experimental, third-party, or warning sign?

2. **Estimate impact**
   - Used in how many places?
   - How similar is it to system components?
   - How much maintenance burden does it create?

3. **Prioritize remediation**
   - Can system be extended to cover this use case?
   - Should custom component be deprecated and migrated?
   - Is this a pattern that appears elsewhere?

### Remediation Priority

**Critical (Week 1-2):**
- Custom components that duplicate system functionality
- Components used in 5+ places that could be consolidated
- Violations of established governance process

**High (Week 3-4):**
- Components with slight variations that could be system tokens
- Popular custom patterns that should be systemized
- Documentation gaps that lead to custom creation

**Medium (Week 5-6):**
- Single-use custom components that could be system variants
- Performance optimizations that could be built into system
- Experimental components ready for system integration

**Low (Ongoing):**
- Orphaned custom components with no usage
- Outdated custom implementations
- Documentation improvements

## Consolidation Opportunity Analysis

### Duplication Detection

**Exact duplicates:**
- Same component implemented multiple times
- Action: Deprecate all but canonical, migrate usage
- Effort: High (migration work)
- Impact: Highest (reduce maintenance by 80%+)

**Near-duplicates (>80% similar):**
- Same component with minor style variations
- Action: Create system variants (props/tokens) to cover use cases
- Effort: Medium (extend system component)
- Impact: High (reduce variants from 3→1)

**Partial duplicates (50-80% similar):**
- Components that solve similar problems differently
- Action: Consolidate to single approach, possibly with configuration
- Effort: Medium-High (code migration)
- Impact: Medium (reduce complexity, improve consistency)

**Similar patterns (<50% code, >80% visual):**
- Different implementations of visually similar components
- Action: Extract common patterns to system
- Effort: Medium (establish new system component)
- Impact: Medium (improve discoverability, future reuse)

### Consolidation Priority Matrix

```
         High Impact   Medium Impact   Low Impact
High Effort   Phase 3      Phase 4       Defer
Med Effort    Phase 2      Phase 3       Phase 4
Low Effort    Phase 1      Phase 2       Phase 3
```

**Phase 1 (Quick Wins):**
- Exact duplicates with low migration effort
- Estimate: 20-30% reduction in custom components
- Timeline: 1-2 weeks

**Phase 2 (Strategic):**
- Near-duplicates that establish patterns
- System variants that unlock consolidation
- Estimate: 40-60% reduction in custom components
- Timeline: 3-6 weeks

**Phase 3 (Long-term):**
- Partial duplicates requiring significant refactoring
- New system components from successful patterns
- Estimate: 70-80% reduction in custom components
- Timeline: 2-3 months

**Phase 4 (Maintenance):**
- Ongoing consolidation and optimization
- Proactive system improvements
- Continuous adoption monitoring
