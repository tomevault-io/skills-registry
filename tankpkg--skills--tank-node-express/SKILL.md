# @tank/node-express

Purpose: deliver actionable patterns for production Express APIs with predictable middleware, validation, auth, and operations.

## Core Philosophy

1) Fail loud, fail fast: reject invalid input at the edge, do not guess.
2) Middleware is the architecture: cross-cutting behavior lives in ordered middleware, not in handlers.
3) Types at the boundary: validate external data with schemas, then trust internal types.
4) Observable by default: logs, request IDs, and errors are first-class outputs.
5) Production-friendly defaults: graceful shutdown and safe timeouts are non-optional.

## Project Structure

```text
src/
  app.ts
  server.ts
  routes/
    index.ts
    users.routes.ts
  middleware/
    auth.ts
    error.ts
    rateLimit.ts
    requestId.ts
    validate.ts
  controllers/
    users.controller.ts
  services/
    users.service.ts
  db/
    client.ts
  schemas/
    users.schema.ts
  config/
    env.ts
  logging/
    logger.ts
  health/
    health.routes.ts
test/
  api/
    users.test.ts
```

## Operating Workflow

1. Boot `app.ts` with middleware order, then mount routes.
2. Keep handlers thin: parse, call service, return response.
3. Push domain logic into `services/` with explicit inputs/outputs.
4. Centralize errors in `middleware/error.ts`.
5. Export `server.ts` to control listening and shutdown.

## Quick Decision Trees

### Middleware vs Route Handler

| If the concern is... | Use | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| cross-cutting across routes | middleware | request IDs, auth |
| per-resource behavior | handler | create user |
| transform input/output | middleware | validation, response envelopes |
| business logic | handler/service | billing, scheduling |

### Error Handling Strategy

| Situation | Strategy | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| expected client errors | throw typed error + map in error middleware | single mapping point |
| async handler failures | async wrapper + error middleware | avoid try/catch in every route |
| downstream dependency failures | translate to 503/504 with retry metadata | predictable ops |
| unknown exceptions | log with request ID, return 500 | fail safe |

### Authentication Method Selection

| Need | Use | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| stateless API, mobile clients | JWT | rotate keys, short exp |
| server-rendered web app | session cookie | httpOnly + CSRF |
| third-party login | OAuth | exchange for session/JWT |

## Capability Map

- Middleware ordering, error boundaries, and async wrappers.
- Request validation with Zod at the edge.
- Auth strategies: JWT, session, OAuth handoff.
- API design: routes, envelopes, pagination, DTOs.
- Production ops: shutdown, logging, health checks, Docker.

## Input Expectations

- Provide existing routes or controllers if they must be preserved.
- State persistence layer (Prisma, Drizzle, raw SQL) and DB type.
- Identify auth mode and token/session storage.
- Share operational constraints (K8s, PM2, Docker).

## Output Format

- Provide middleware order and placement guidance.
- Provide code snippets in TypeScript by default.
- Return explicit error and response formats.
- Note tradeoffs and safe defaults.

## Activation Triggers

- node
- node.js
- express
- express.js
- api server
- rest api
- backend
- middleware
- route handler
- router
- endpoint
- request validation
- zod
- jwt
- session auth
- oauth
- rate limiting
- error handling
- graceful shutdown
- structured logging

## Non-Goals

- Do not design UI or front-end components.
- Do not prescribe ORM choice unless asked.
- Do not embed secrets or credentials.
- Do not skip validation in favor of speed.

## Common Tasks

- Add request validation middleware with Zod schemas.
- Build error mapping for typed errors and unknowns.
- Add JWT verification and role gating.
- Add rate limiting and request ID logging.
- Set up graceful shutdown with connection draining.
- Define response envelope and pagination.

## Operational Standards

- Enforce request validation with Zod at every entry route.
- Standardize error envelope and problem details.
- Add correlation IDs, log latency, and response status.
- Use graceful shutdown with connection draining.
- Prefer cursor pagination for large collections.

## Anti-Patterns

| Don't | Do Instead |
| --- | --- |
| put auth logic inside handlers | centralized auth middleware |
| swallow errors with empty catch | throw typed errors, map centrally |
| accept unknown request bodies | validate with Zod and strip unknowns |
| build responses ad hoc | use `{ data, error, meta }` envelope |
| use global mutable singletons | inject dependencies per app instance |
| skip shutdown handlers | implement SIGTERM/SIGINT with drain |
| log plain strings | structured JSON with requestId |
