# SFCC WebDAV Workflows

WebDAV is SFCC’s “remote filesystem over HTTP”. It’s central to:
- Moving data in/out via IMPEX
- Reading logs
- Managing catalogs/images in supported folders

This skill focuses on *practical* workflows and the most common permission and path pitfalls.

## Quick Checklist

```text
[ ] Confirm which auth path you are using: BM user (Basic Auth) vs API client (client-id/secret token)
[ ] For IMPEX, ensure the BM role includes File Transfer Manager access
[ ] If using API client auth, generate credentials in Account Manager
[ ] Verify directory permissions are configured in Business Manager for the exact folder(s)
[ ] Avoid overlapping WebDAV client permission paths (SFCC restriction)
[ ] Don’t expect write access to restricted folders (e.g. security logs)
[ ] For automation: scope access to the minimum folders required
```

## Mental Model

- **WebDAV ≈ HTTP interface to instance folders** (not your local repo)
- **Permissions are folder-scoped** and configured in Business Manager
- **Two common authentication modes**:
  - **Business Manager users**: Basic Auth (username/password), governed by Role permissions
  - **API clients**: token-based auth (client credentials from Account Manager), governed by “WebDAV Client Permissions” JSON
- **Wildcard folder permissions** (like `/catalogs/*` or “all other folders”) grant access to future subfolders automatically
- **WebDAV versioning is not enabled** in SFCC
- **Primary instance group vs sandbox**: primary instance group access requires authenticated WebDAV; sandboxes often use WebDAV for manual file moves

## Common SFCC WebDAV Folders (What They’re Typically For)

These vary by project, but the patterns are stable:

| Folder | Typical use | Read/Write? |
|---|---|---|
| `/impex/src/` | Upload import feeds, export results | Usually read/write |
| `/impex/src/logs/` | Some log exports and job artifacts | Often read |
| `/Logs/` | Log files (application logs) | Usually read |
| `/catalogs/` | Catalog assets (shared library content, images) | Often read |
| `/cartridges/` | Code deployment via WebDAV (teams vary) | Usually read/write for deployment users |

## Business Manager Setup (Humans / Desktop Clients)

### Role-based permissions
- Configure in: **Administration → Organization → Roles & Permissions** (select a role) → **WebDAV Permissions** tab
- Use this when a developer uses Cyberduck/Transmit/FileZilla with BM credentials.
- Required functional permissions often include: `WebDAV_Realm_Access`, `WebDAV_Manage_Customization`, `WebDAV_Transfer_Files`.
- If you select a wildcard path (like `/catalogs/*` or “all other folders”), permissions apply to future subfolders automatically unless sub-permissions are set explicitly.

### Debugging “403 Forbidden” quickly
- Confirm you’re editing the correct role
- Confirm the role grants permissions for the *exact* path you’re trying to access

## API Client Setup (Automation / CI / Tools)

### WebDAV Client Permissions (JSON)
- Configure in: **Administration → Organization → WebDAV Client Permissions**
- You assign `client_id` → permissions array of `{ path, operations }`.

**Operations typically include:** `read`, `read_write`.

### Critical constraint: no intersecting permission paths
SFCC does not allow different WebDAV client permission paths to overlap.

Example of what to avoid:
- Client A: `/impex/src`
- Client B: `/impex/src/foo`

Design your permission model so each client owns a non-overlapping subtree.

### Restricted directories
Some directories are effectively **read-only** for security reasons (for example, security log directories). Expect permission errors even if you attempt to grant write.

## Automation Patterns

### Pattern: “single-purpose” clients
Create separate API clients for:
- Log readers (read-only `/Logs/`)
- IMPEX uploaders (read/write `/impex/src/`) 

This keeps credentials and blast radius smaller.

### Pattern: job writes file → WebDAV serves download
When storefront requests can’t write files, a common SFCC pattern is:
1. Storefront creates a token/state record
2. Background job generates file into `/impex/src/` (or another allowed folder)
3. Storefront polls and then links the file

(See also: `sfcc-platform-limits` for storefront file I/O constraints.)
