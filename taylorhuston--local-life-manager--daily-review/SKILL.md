Run the Daily Review Workflow. Keep it conversational - ask one thing at a time.

## Steps

1. **Get current date first**
   - Run `date +%Y-%m-%d` to confirm today's date
   - DO NOT assume the date - always verify

2. **Journal Entry Setup**
   - Check if today's entry exists (`my-vault/02 Calendar/YYYY-MM-DD.md`)
   - Create from template if not (see `references/template.md`)
   - If morning reviewing yesterday: use yesterday's date

3. **What Did I Work On?**
   - Pull GitHub commits: `gh search commits --author=TaylorHuston --committer-date=YYYY-MM-DD`
   - Summarize into meaningful bullets (not raw commit messages)
   - Ask: "Any other technical work? (studying, courses, side projects not on GitHub)"

4. **What Did I Do?**
   - Ask: "How about personal stuff? (errands, social, health, appointments, etc.)"

5. **Daily Highlight Check**
   - Review the day's highlight if set
   - Ask: "Did you accomplish your highlight? Want to carry it to tomorrow?"

6. **Quick Inbox Scan** (offer, don't force)
   - "Want me to check your inbox for anything to quickly process?"

7. **Tomorrow's Highlight** (offer, don't force)
   - "Do you know what tomorrow's focus should be?"

8. **Memory Capture Check**
   - Review the conversation for anything memory-worthy:
     - New preferences expressed
     - Corrections to how you understood something
     - Life/job updates
     - Workflow insights
     - Project decisions
   - If anything qualifies, create a memory file in `.claude/memories/`
   - Check if `about-taylor.md` needs updating (job status, current focus, etc.)
   - Do this silently unless there's something significant to confirm

Use bulleted lists in the journal.
