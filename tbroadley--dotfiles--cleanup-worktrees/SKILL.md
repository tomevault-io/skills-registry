# Clean Up Merged Worktrees and Branches

Remove git worktrees and local branches whose PRs have been merged into the main branch.

## Workflow

### 1. List Worktrees

```bash
git worktree list
```

Identify all worktrees besides the main one. Extract the branch name for each.

### 2. Check PR Status via GitHub

For each worktree branch, check whether it has a **merged** PR on GitHub:

```bash
gh pr list --state merged --head "<branch-name>" --json number,title \
  --jq 'if length > 0 then .[0] | "#\(.number) \(.title)" else empty end'
```

**Do NOT use `git branch --merged main`** — this is unreliable for squash-merged PRs and also matches branches that simply haven't diverged from main yet (e.g., newly created branches with active local work).

Only branches with a confirmed merged PR on GitHub are candidates for removal.

### 3. Present Findings

Show the user a summary:
- Which worktrees have merged PRs (will be removed)
- Which have open PRs (will be kept)
- Which have no PR (will be kept)

Ask for confirmation before proceeding with removal.

### 4. Remove Worktrees and Branches

For each confirmed merged branch:

```bash
git worktree remove --force .worktrees/<worktree-dir>
git branch -D <branch-name>
```

Use `--force` for worktree removal since merged branches may have stale local changes (lock files, build artifacts, etc.) that are no longer relevant.

Use `git branch -D` (force delete) because squash-merged branches won't pass `git branch -d` validation — the local commits differ from the squashed merge commit on main.

### 5. Verify

```bash
git worktree list
```

Confirm only unmerged worktrees remain.

## Notes

- Never remove worktrees for branches with open PRs or no PR — these represent active work
- The `.worktrees/` directory convention uses branch names with `/` replaced by `-`
- Always confirm with the user before deleting if there are any surprises (e.g., significant uncommitted changes in a merged branch's worktree)
