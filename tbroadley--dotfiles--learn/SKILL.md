# Learn from Conversation

Extract learnings from the current conversation and persist them to CLAUDE.md, skills, or repo-specific documentation.

## What This Skill Does

1. Analyzes the conversation to identify:
   - **User feedback**: Code style, process preferences, tool usage, corrections
   - **Surprising discoveries**: Gotchas, undocumented behavior, non-obvious patterns found while working

2. Summarizes these into actionable rules

3. Updates the appropriate files:
   - **Global** (`~/dotfiles/claude/CLAUDE.md`): General coding style and behavior rules
   - **Skills** (`~/dotfiles/claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`): Skill-specific learnings
   - **Current repo** (`AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md`): Repo-specific gotchas and surprising behaviors

4. Commits and pushes the changes

5. If running in a dev container, runs `~/dotfiles/install.sh` to propagate global changes

## Workflow

### 1. Gather Context

If the current repo has an open PR, fetch PR review comments to include in the analysis:

```bash
# Get current repo info
repo=$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q '.nameWithOwner')

# Check for open PR on current branch
pr_number=$(gh pr view --json number -q '.number' 2>/dev/null)

if [ -n "$pr_number" ]; then
  # Fetch PR review comments
  gh api repos/$repo/pulls/$pr_number/comments --paginate

  # Fetch PR review threads for more context
  gh api graphql -f query='
    query {
      repository(owner: "'${repo%/*}'", name: "'${repo#*/}'") {
        pullRequest(number: '$pr_number') {
          reviewThreads(first: 100) {
            nodes {
              comments(first: 10) {
                nodes {
                  body
                  author { login }
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  '
fi
```

### 2. Analyze the Conversation

Review the entire conversation looking for:

**User Feedback:**
- **Explicit corrections**: "Don't do X, do Y instead"
- **Style preferences**: "I prefer X over Y"
- **Code review feedback**: Comments pointing out issues with generated code
- **Process feedback**: "You should have done X before Y"
- **Repeated patterns**: Things the user corrected multiple times

**Surprising Discoveries (from working on tasks):**
- **Gotchas**: Non-obvious behaviors that caused bugs or confusion
- **Undocumented behavior**: Things that weren't in docs but were discovered through trial/error
- **Counterintuitive patterns**: Code patterns that look wrong but are actually correct (or vice versa)
- **Environment quirks**: Unexpected system, library, or framework behaviors
- **Integration issues**: Surprising interactions between components

Focus on learnings that are:
- Actionable (can be turned into a rule or warning)
- Not already documented
- Likely to help future work

### 3. Draft Updates

For each learning, draft a concise rule:

- Use imperative mood ("Use X", not "You should use X")
- Be specific (include examples where helpful)
- Keep it brief (one line if possible, a few bullets if needed)

Group related learnings under existing sections in CLAUDE.md when possible.

### 4. Determine Where to Add

**Add to `~/dotfiles/claude/CLAUDE.md` (global) if:**
- It's a general coding style rule
- It's a general behavior or process rule
- It applies across projects

**Add to a skill file (`~/dotfiles/claude/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md`) if:**
- It's specific to a particular workflow (commit, PR review, etc.)
- It only applies when using that skill

**Add to the current repo's `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` if:**
- It's specific to this codebase (gotchas, quirks, non-obvious patterns)
- It documents surprising behavior discovered while working
- It would help future coding-agent sessions working on this repo
- It's something that "I wish I knew before starting"

Prefer `AGENTS.md` if it exists; otherwise use `CLAUDE.md`. Create the file if neither exists and the learning is valuable enough.

### 5. Read Current Files

Read the target file(s) to understand their structure:

```bash
# Global rules
cat ~/dotfiles/claude/CLAUDE.md

# Skill-specific
cat ~/dotfiles/claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md

# Current repo (check which exists)
cat AGENTS.md 2>/dev/null || cat CLAUDE.md 2>/dev/null || echo "No repo instructions file"
```

### 6. Apply Updates

Edit the file to add the new rules:
- Add to existing sections when there's a good fit
- Create new sections only when necessary
- Maintain consistent formatting with the rest of the file

### 7. Commit and Push

**For global/skill updates (dotfiles repo):**
```bash
cd ~/dotfiles
git add -A
git commit -m "Add learnings from conversation

<brief summary of what was added>

Co-Authored-By: <agent-name> <agent-noreply-email>"
git push
```

**For current repo updates:**
```bash
# In the current repo (not dotfiles)
git add AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md 2>/dev/null
git commit -m "Document learnings from current session

<brief summary of gotchas/discoveries added>

Co-Authored-By: <agent-name> <agent-noreply-email>"
git push
```

If updating both dotfiles and the current repo, make separate commits in each.

### 8. Propagate Changes (Dev Containers)

If running inside a dev container, run install.sh to propagate the updated CLAUDE.md:

```bash
# Check if we're in a dev container (not the dotfiles repo itself)
if [ -f /.dockerenv ] && [ "$PWD" != "$HOME/dotfiles" ] && [ "$PWD" != "/workspaces/dotfiles" ]; then
  ~/dotfiles/install.sh
fi
```

## Example Learnings

### Global CLAUDE.md (user feedback)

From a conversation where the user corrected test mocking practices:

```markdown
## Testing (pytest)
- Mock only at external boundaries (I/O, network, external libraries), not internal implementation details
- Prefer real data structures over MagicMock for return values
```

From PR feedback about error handling:

```markdown
## Python Style
- Fail early: prefer code that fails immediately over code that logs a warning and potentially behaves incorrectly later
```

### Repo AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md (surprising discoveries)

From debugging a test failure:

```markdown
## Gotchas
- The `process_data()` function silently returns `None` if the input list is empty instead of raising an error
- Database migrations must be run with `--fake-initial` on first deploy due to legacy schema
```

From discovering undocumented API behavior:

```markdown
## API Notes
- The `/users` endpoint returns max 100 results even without pagination params (undocumented limit)
- Rate limiting kicks in at 50 req/min per IP, not per API key as docs suggest
```

## Notes

- Only extract learnings that are clearly intentional feedback, not off-hand comments
- When in doubt about whether something is a general rule or project-specific, ask the user
- If a learning contradicts an existing rule in CLAUDE.md, ask the user which should take precedence
- Don't add overly specific or one-off preferences that won't generalize
- For repo-specific learnings, focus on things that would save future sessions time/frustration
- Surprising discoveries should be documented even if the user didn't explicitly ask—these are valuable for future work
