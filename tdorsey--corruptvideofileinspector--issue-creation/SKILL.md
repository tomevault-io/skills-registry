# Issue Creation Skill

This skill provides capabilities for creating, triaging, and formatting issues in the Corrupt Video File Inspector project.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- Creating a new issue for the project
- Triaging an unstructured issue submission
- Reformatting an existing issue to match project templates
- Analyzing issue content to determine appropriate labels and categories

## Available Issue Types

### Bug Report (`[FIX]:` prefix)
For reporting bugs or issues with the application.

**Required sections:**
- Stakeholder Type
- Component/Domain
- I want to (expected behavior)
- But (actual problem)
- This helps by (impact of fix)
- Unlike (contrast with expected)
- Steps to Reproduce
- Environment Information
- Error Logs/Output

### Feature Request (`[FEAT]:` prefix)
For proposing new features or enhancements.

**Required sections:**
- Stakeholder Type
- Component/Domain
- I want to (desired feature)
- But (current limitation)
- This helps by (benefit)
- Unlike (alternatives)
- Additional Context

### Chore/Maintenance (`[CHORE]:` prefix)
For maintenance tasks, dependency updates, or project improvements.

**Required sections:**
- Stakeholder Type
- Component/Domain
- I want to (task description)
- But (current issue)
- This helps by (benefit)
- Unlike (current state)
- Maintenance Task Type
- Specific Tasks

### Documentation (`[DOCS]:` prefix)
For documentation updates or improvements.

**Required sections:**

- Component/Domain (Documentation)
- I want to (documentation change)
- But (current state)
- This helps by (improvement)
- Unlike (current documentation)

### Quick Capture (`[QUICK]:` prefix)
For unstructured input that will be automatically triaged.

**Required sections:**
- Summary
- Additional Details (optional)

## Component/Domain Options

- CLI
- Scanner
- Trakt Integration
- Config
- Reporter
- Output
- Docker
- CI/CD
- GitHub Actions
- Tests
- Documentation
- Other

## Stakeholder Types

- Project Maintainer
- Contributor
- End User

## Classification Keywords

When analyzing issue content, use these keywords to determine the appropriate category:

### Bug Indicators
`bug`, `error`, `crash`, `fail`, `broken`, `issue`, `problem`, `not working`, `exception`, `traceback`

### Feature Indicators
`feature`, `enhancement`, `request`, `add`, `improve`, `want`, `would be nice`, `suggestion`, `propose`

### Documentation Indicators
`documentation`, `docs`, `readme`, `typo`, `clarify`, `explain`

### Performance Indicators
`performance`, `slow`, `fast`, `optimize`, `speed`, `memory`

## Automated Triage Process

1. User submits issue via Quick Capture template
2. Issue receives `triage:agent-pending` label
3. Issue Triage Agent workflow triggers
4. Original content is preserved as a comment
5. Issue is classified based on keywords
6. Component and stakeholder are detected based on content analysis
7. Issue title is cleaned (tags like [QUICK], [FEAT], etc. are removed)
8. Issue body is reformatted to match appropriate template (without Component/Domain and Stakeholder Type sections)
9. Metadata comment is posted with:
   - Classification type
   - Confidence percentage
   - Detected component
   - Detected stakeholder
   - Gap analysis (missing information)
10. Labels are automatically applied:
    - `triage:agent-pending` removed
    - `triage:agent-processed` added
    - Type-specific label added (bug, feature, chore, documentation, performance)
    - Component label added (component:cli, component:scanner, component:github-actions, component:unknown, etc.)
    - Stakeholder label added (stakeholder:maintainer, stakeholder:contributor, stakeholder:user)
11. Issue is automatically assigned to @Copilot

## Component Detection

The agent uses enhanced keyword detection to identify the correct component:

- **GitHub Actions**: agent, agent file, .github/agents, .github/workflows, github actions, action, workflow file, yml workflow, yaml workflow
- **CI/CD**: ci, cd, pipeline, continuous integration, continuous deployment, build pipeline, automation workflow
- **Trakt Integration**: trakt, sync, watchlist, collection
- **Docker**: docker, container, dockerfile, compose
- **CLI**: cli, command line, command-line, terminal, console, argv
- **Scanner**: scanner, scanning, scan, detect, detection, analyze, analysis
- **Config**: config file, configuration file, config settings, config options, config.yaml, config.yml, app config, user config, yaml config
- **Reporter**: reporter, report, summary, results
- **Output**: output, export, csv, json, format
- **Tests**: test, testing, pytest, unittest, coverage, mock
- **Documentation**: documentation, docs, readme, guide, tutorial
- **Unknown**: fallback when no component keywords match

## File Format Selection Guidelines

When working with issue creation, triage, and formatting, choose the appropriate file format based on access patterns and optimization goals:

### JSON Lines (.jsonl)

**Primary Goal**: Speed of access and scalability for massive data

- **Access Frequency**: High (frequent "lookups")
- **Speed**: **Fastest** for large files - use `grep`, `sed`, or `tail` to grab specific lines without loading entire file into memory
- **Token Use**: Moderate
- **Information Density**: Low - structure is repeated on every line, which wastes tokens if reading the whole file
- **Skill Advantage**: When searching through issue processing history (e.g., "Find all issues triaged in last week"), use shell tools to return just the relevant lines. This keeps the context window clean and tool execution instant.

**When to Use**:
- Issue processing logs and history
- Triage operation tracking
- Bulk issue import/export
- When you need to append without parsing entire file

**Example Use Cases**:
- Issue triage agent operation logs
- Historical issue classification records
- Automated label application history

### YAML (.yaml)

**Primary Goal**: Token efficiency and visual hierarchy for the LLM

- **Access Frequency**: Low (usually read once at the start of a task)
- **Speed**: Slower to parse for machines (Python's YAML libraries are slower than JSON)
- **Token Use**: **Most Efficient** - removing brackets, quotes, and commas can reduce token counts by 20-40% compared to JSON
- **Information Density**: High - indentation provides spatial cues that help LLMs understand nested relationships
- **Skill Advantage**: Best for issue template definitions where you need to see the entire structure. Leaves more room in the context window for actual triage logic.

**When to Use**:
- Issue template definitions
- Label configuration
- Workflow automation rules
- When human readability is important

**Example Use Cases**:
- Issue templates (.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/*.yml)
- GitHub Actions workflow files
- Issue labeling rules configuration

### Markdown (.md)

**Primary Goal**: Information density and semantic understanding

- **Access Frequency**: High (issue bodies, comments)
- **Speed**: Fast to parse - plain text with minimal structure
- **Token Use**: Efficient - natural language with semantic structure
- **Information Density**: **Highest** - combines prose with structure, allows LLMs to understand context and relationships naturally
- **Skill Advantage**: Best for issue descriptions, comments, and triage explanations. Headers, lists, and formatting provide semantic cues for understanding issue context and classification reasoning.

**When to Use**:
- Issue descriptions and bodies
- Comments and triage explanations
- Agent instructions and skill documentation
- When context and explanation are critical

**Example Use Cases**:
- Issue bodies (all issue content is Markdown)
- Triage metadata comments
- Classification explanations
- Agent instruction files

### Format Selection Decision Tree

1. **Need to track issue operations over time?** → Use JSONL
2. **Need to define issue template structure?** → Use YAML
3. **Need to write issue content or explanations?** → Use Markdown
4. **Need to search through historical triage data?** → Use JSONL
5. **Need to configure labeling rules?** → Use YAML
6. **Need to provide classification reasoning?** → Use Markdown

### Optimization Trade-offs

| Format   | Parse Speed | Token Efficiency | Information Density | Random Access |
|----------|-------------|------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| JSONL    | ★★★★★       | ★★★              | ★★                  | ★★★★★         |
| YAML     | ★★          | ★★★★★            | ★★★★                | ★★            |
| Markdown | ★★★★        | ★★★★             | ★★★★★               | ★★★           |

## Example Usage

### Creating a Bug Report

```markdown
### Stakeholder Type

End User

### Component/Domain

CLI

### I want to

Scan a directory of video files and get a report of corrupted files.

### But

The application crashes when encountering a specific video codec.

### This helps by

Allowing users to reliably scan all video formats.

### Unlike

The current behavior which causes the scan to fail completely.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Create a directory with MKV files using VP9 codec
2. Run `corrupt-video-inspector scan /path/to/videos`
3. Application crashes with segmentation fault

### Environment Information

- OS: Ubuntu 22.04
- Python version: 3.13.0
- Application version: 2.0.0

### Error Logs/Output

```
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
```
```

### Creating a Feature Request

```markdown
### Stakeholder Type

Contributor

### Component/Domain

Scanner

### I want to

Add support for parallel video scanning to improve performance.

### But

Currently, videos are scanned sequentially which is slow for large libraries.

### This helps by

Reducing scan time by utilizing multiple CPU cores.

### Unlike

The current sequential scanning approach.

### Additional Context

Consider using Python's multiprocessing module with a configurable worker pool.
