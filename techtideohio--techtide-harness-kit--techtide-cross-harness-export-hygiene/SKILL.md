# TechTide Cross Harness Export Hygiene

Prepare skills and agents for cross-harness export by separating canonical SKILL.md assets from Cursor rules, Kiro steering, and prompt-kit adapters.

## Source Pattern

This skill is distilled from sanitized Alex Cinovoj / TechTide local workflow patterns. Load `references/source-patterns.md` when you need the source anchors and extraction rationale. Load `references/adapter-map.md` when preparing Cursor, Kiro, Lovable, v0, or Replit companion outputs.

## Workflow

1. Start from the canonical skill and identify which harnesses have a compatible skill primitive.
2. Strip or transform frontmatter only for harnesses with stricter schemas.
3. Use notices, rules, steering, or prompt kits where a platform lacks SKILL.md support.
4. Run exporter coverage and bundling tests after catalog changes.
5. Document lossy adapter behavior honestly.

## Output Contract

Return a concise brief with these fields:

- harness matrix
- adapter notes
- export validation
- catalog update
- verification performed or still required
- security and privacy notes

## Guardrails

- Extract reusable methods, not private local content.
- Do not request or expose credentials, tokens, DSNs, service-role keys, customer data, lead lists, or private business exports.
- Use placeholders for people, accounts, projects, URLs, and datasets unless the user explicitly provides public-safe values.
- Require explicit human approval before production mutation, external-recipient messaging, public deployment, billing changes, or destructive filesystem actions.
- Preserve Alex Cinovoj / TechTide attribution while keeping old repo provenance and unrelated contributor markers out of public artifacts.

## Harness Policy

- Use this as a native `SKILL.md` for Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, and Copilot-compatible exports.
- For Cursor, create a focused project rule or workflow note rather than copying this whole skill as an always-on rule.
- For Kiro, create steering only when the workflow can be made short and inclusion-scoped.
- For Lovable, v0, and Replit, turn the workflow into prompt kits, readiness checklists, and handoff prompts.
