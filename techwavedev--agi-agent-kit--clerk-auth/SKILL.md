# Clerk Authentication

## Patterns

### Next.js App Router Setup

Complete Clerk setup for Next.js 14/15 App Router.

Includes ClerkProvider, environment variables, and basic
sign-in/sign-up components.

Key components:
- ClerkProvider: Wraps app for auth context
- <SignIn />, <SignUp />: Pre-built auth forms
- <UserButton />: User menu with session management


### Middleware Route Protection

Protect routes using clerkMiddleware and createRouteMatcher.

Best practices:
- Single middleware.ts file at project root
- Use createRouteMatcher for route groups
- auth.protect() for explicit protection
- Centralize all auth logic in middleware


### Server Component Authentication

Access auth state in Server Components using auth() and currentUser().

Key functions:
- auth(): Returns userId, sessionId, orgId, claims
- currentUser(): Returns full User object
- Both require clerkMiddleware to be configured

### Memory-First Protocol

Retrieve prior API design decisions, database schema choices, and error handling patterns. Cache API response templates for consistent error formatting.

```bash
# Check for prior backend/API context before starting
python3 execution/memory_manager.py auto --query "API design patterns and architecture decisions for Clerk Auth"
```

### Storing Results

After completing work, store backend/API decisions for future sessions:

```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py store \
  --content "API architecture: REST with HATEOAS, JWT auth, rate limiting at 100 req/min per tenant" \
  --type decision --project <project> \
  --tags clerk-auth backend
```

### Multi-Agent Collaboration

Share API contract changes with frontend agents so they update their client code, and with QA agents for test coverage.

```bash
python3 execution/cross_agent_context.py store \
  --agent "<your-agent>" \
  --action "Implemented API endpoints — 5 new routes with OpenAPI spec and integration tests" \
  --project <project>
```

### Agent Team: Code Review

After implementation, dispatch `code_review_team` for two-stage review (spec compliance + code quality) before merging.
