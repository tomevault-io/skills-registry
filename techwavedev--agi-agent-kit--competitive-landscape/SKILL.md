### Memory-First Protocol

Retrieve platform-specific patterns (iOS/Android), build configurations, and device compatibility notes from prior sessions.

```bash
# Check for prior mobile development context before starting
python3 execution/memory_manager.py auto --query "mobile architecture and platform-specific patterns for Competitive Landscape"
```

### Storing Results

After completing work, store mobile development decisions for future sessions:

```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py store \
  --content "Mobile: React Native with Expo, offline-first with SQLite sync, push notifications via FCM" \
  --type decision --project <project> \
  --tags competitive-landscape mobile
```

### Multi-Agent Collaboration

Share API contract changes with backend agents and coordinate release timing with QA agents.

```bash
python3 execution/cross_agent_context.py store \
  --agent "<your-agent>" \
  --action "Mobile feature implemented — cross-platform component with native performance optimizations" \
  --project <project>
```
