### Memory-First Protocol

Retrieve prior documentation structure and content to maintain consistency. Cache generated docs to avoid regenerating unchanged sections.

```bash
# Check for prior documentation context before starting
python3 execution/memory_manager.py auto --query "documentation patterns and prior content for Culture Index"
```

### Storing Results

After completing work, store documentation decisions for future sessions:

```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py store \
  --content "Documentation: API reference generated from OpenAPI spec, deployment guide updated with new env vars" \
  --type technical --project <project> \
  --tags culture-index documentation
```

### Multi-Agent Collaboration

Share documentation changes with all agents so they reference the latest guides and APIs.

```bash
python3 execution/cross_agent_context.py store \
  --agent "<your-agent>" \
  --action "Documentation updated — API reference, deployment guide, and CHANGELOG all current" \
  --project <project>
```

### Agent Team: Documentation

This skill pairs with `documentation_team` — dispatched automatically after any code change to keep docs in sync.
