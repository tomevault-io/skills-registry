### Memory-First Protocol

Retrieve prior agent configurations, team compositions, and orchestration patterns. Critical for multi-agent system consistency.

```bash
# Check for prior AI agent orchestration context before starting
python3 execution/memory_manager.py auto --query "agent patterns and orchestration strategies for Fal Image Edit"
```

### Storing Results

After completing work, store AI agent orchestration decisions for future sessions:

```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py store \
  --content "Agent pattern: hierarchical orchestration with Control Tower dispatcher, 3 specialist sub-agents" \
  --type decision --project <project> \
  --tags fal-image-edit ai-agents
```

### Multi-Agent Collaboration

This skill is inherently multi-agent. Use cross-agent context to coordinate task distribution and avoid duplicate work.

```bash
python3 execution/cross_agent_context.py store \
  --agent "<your-agent>" \
  --action "Agent architecture designed — Control Tower + specialist agents with shared Qdrant memory" \
  --project <project>
```

### Control Tower Integration

Register agents and tasks with the Control Tower (`execution/control_tower.py`) for centralized orchestration across machines and LLM providers.

### Blockchain Identity

Each agent has a cryptographic Ed25519 identity. All memory writes are signed — enabling trust verification in multi-agent systems.
