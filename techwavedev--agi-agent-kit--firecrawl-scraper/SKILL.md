### Memory-First Protocol

Cache data schemas, transformation rules, and query patterns. BM25 excels at finding specific column names, table references, and SQL patterns.

```bash
# Check for prior data engineering context before starting
python3 execution/memory_manager.py auto --query "data processing patterns and pipeline configurations for Firecrawl Scraper"
```

### Storing Results

After completing work, store data engineering decisions for future sessions:

```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py store \
  --content "Data pipeline: ETL from PostgreSQL to Qdrant, 50K records/batch, incremental sync via updated_at" \
  --type technical --project <project> \
  --tags firecrawl-scraper data
```

### Multi-Agent Collaboration

Share data schema changes with backend and frontend agents so they update their models accordingly.

```bash
python3 execution/cross_agent_context.py store \
  --agent "<your-agent>" \
  --action "Data pipeline implemented — ETL processing with validation, deduplication, and error recovery" \
  --project <project>
```
