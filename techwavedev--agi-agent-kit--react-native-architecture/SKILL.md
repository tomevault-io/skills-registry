# React Native Architecture

Production-ready patterns for React Native development with Expo, including navigation, state management, native modules, and offline-first architecture.

## Use this skill when

- Starting a new React Native or Expo project
- Implementing complex navigation patterns
- Integrating native modules and platform APIs
- Building offline-first mobile applications
- Optimizing React Native performance
- Setting up CI/CD for mobile releases

## Do not use this skill when

- The task is unrelated to react native architecture
- You need a different domain or tool outside this scope

## Instructions

- Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.
- Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.
- Provide actionable steps and verification.
- If detailed examples are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

## Resources

- `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed patterns and examples.

### Memory-First Protocol

Retrieve platform-specific patterns (iOS/Android), build configurations, and device compatibility notes from prior sessions.

```bash
# Check for prior mobile development context before starting
python3 execution/memory_manager.py auto --query "mobile architecture and platform-specific patterns for React Native Architecture"
```

### Storing Results

After completing work, store mobile development decisions for future sessions:

```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py store \
  --content "Mobile: React Native with Expo, offline-first with SQLite sync, push notifications via FCM" \
  --type decision --project <project> \
  --tags react-native-architecture mobile
```

### Multi-Agent Collaboration

Share API contract changes with backend agents and coordinate release timing with QA agents.

```bash
python3 execution/cross_agent_context.py store \
  --agent "<your-agent>" \
  --action "Mobile feature implemented — cross-platform component with native performance optimizations" \
  --project <project>
```
