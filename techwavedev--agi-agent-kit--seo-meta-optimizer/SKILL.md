### Memory-First Protocol

Retrieve brand voice guidelines, content templates, and prior successful content patterns. Cache editorial decisions for consistency across sessions.

```bash
# Check for prior content creation context before starting
python3 execution/memory_manager.py auto --query "content patterns and brand voice guidelines for Seo Meta Optimizer"
```

### Storing Results

After completing work, store content creation decisions for future sessions:

```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py store \
  --content "Content: brand voice established — professional but approachable, 8th-grade reading level, active voice" \
  --type decision --project <project> \
  --tags seo-meta-optimizer content
```

### Multi-Agent Collaboration

Share content guidelines with design agents (visual alignment) and development agents (copy integration).

```bash
python3 execution/cross_agent_context.py store \
  --agent "<your-agent>" \
  --action "Content created and reviewed — matches brand guidelines, SEO-optimized, A/B test variant prepared" \
  --project <project>
```
