# Green Phase: Simple function
def product_list(request):
    products = Product.objects.all()
    return JsonResponse({'products': list(products.values())})

# Refactor: Class-based view
class ProductListView(View):
    def get(self, request):
        products = Product.objects.all()
        return JsonResponse({'products': list(products.values())})

# Refactor: Generic view
class ProductListView(ListView):
    model = Product
    context_object_name = 'products'
```

### Express Patterns

**Inline → Middleware → Service Layer:**
```javascript
// Green Phase: Inline logic
app.post('/api/users', (req, res) => {
  const user = { id: Date.now(), ...req.body };
  users.push(user);
  res.json(user);
});

// Refactor: Extract middleware
app.post('/api/users', validateUser, (req, res) => {
  const user = userService.create(req.body);
  res.json(user);
});

// Refactor: Full layering
app.post('/api/users',
  validateUser,
  asyncHandler(userController.create)
);
```

## Use this skill when

- Moving from red to green in a TDD cycle
- Implementing minimal behavior to satisfy tests
- You want to keep implementation intentionally simple

## Do not use this skill when

- You are refactoring for design or performance
- Tests are already passing and you need new requirements
- You need a full architectural redesign

## Instructions

1. Review failing tests and identify the smallest fix.
2. Implement the minimal change to pass the next test.
3. Run tests after each change to confirm progress.
4. Record shortcuts or debt for the refactor phase.

## Safety

- Avoid bypassing tests to make them pass.
- Keep changes scoped to the failing behavior only.

## Resources

- `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed patterns and examples.

### Memory-First Protocol

Retrieve prior test strategies, known flaky tests, and coverage gaps. Cache test infrastructure setup to avoid re-configuring test environments.

```bash
# Check for prior testing/QA context before starting
python3 execution/memory_manager.py auto --query "test patterns and coverage strategies for Tdd Workflows Tdd Green"
```

### Storing Results

After completing work, store testing/QA decisions for future sessions:

```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py store \
  --content "Testing strategy: integration tests hit real DB (no mocks), 85% line coverage, mutation testing on critical paths" \
  --type technical --project <project> \
  --tags tdd-workflows-tdd-green testing
```

### Multi-Agent Collaboration

Share test results and coverage reports with code review agents so they can verify adequate coverage on changed code.

```bash
python3 execution/cross_agent_context.py store \
  --agent "<your-agent>" \
  --action "QA complete — test suite expanded with 12 new integration tests, all passing" \
  --project <project>
```

### TDD Enforcement

This skill integrates with the framework's iron-law RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle. No production code without a failing test first.

### Agent Team: QA

Dispatch `qa_team` to generate tests and verify they pass before marking implementation complete.
