# Threat Mitigation Mapping

Connect threats to controls for effective security planning.

## Use this skill when

- Prioritizing security investments
- Creating remediation roadmaps
- Validating control coverage
- Designing defense-in-depth
- Security architecture review
- Risk treatment planning

## Do not use this skill when

- The task is unrelated to threat mitigation mapping
- You need a different domain or tool outside this scope

## Instructions

- Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.
- Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.
- Provide actionable steps and verification.
- If detailed examples are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

## Resources

- `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed patterns and examples.

### Memory-First Protocol

Cache compliance check results to avoid re-running expensive AWS API calls. Retrieve prior audit findings to track remediation progress across sessions.

```bash
# Check for prior security context before starting
python3 execution/memory_manager.py auto --query "prior security audit results for Threat Mitigation Mapping"
```

### Storing Results

After completing work, store security decisions for future sessions:

```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py store \
  --content "Audit findings: 3 critical IAM misconfigurations found and remediated" \
  --type technical --project <project> \
  --tags threat-mitigation-mapping security
```

### Multi-Agent Collaboration

Share security findings with other agents so they avoid introducing vulnerabilities in their code changes.

```bash
python3 execution/cross_agent_context.py store \
  --agent "<your-agent>" \
  --action "Completed security audit — 3 critical findings fixed, compliance score 94%" \
  --project <project>
```

### Signed Audit Trail

All security findings are cryptographically signed with the agent's Ed25519 identity, providing tamper-proof audit logs for compliance reporting.

### Semantic Cache for Compliance

Cache compliance check results (`semantic_cache.py`) to avoid redundant AWS API calls. Cache hit at similarity >0.92 returns prior results instantly.
