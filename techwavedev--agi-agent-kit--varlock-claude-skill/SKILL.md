### Memory-First Protocol

Cache workflow configurations and automation patterns. Retrieve prior pipeline designs to avoid re-building similar flows from scratch.

```bash
# Check for prior workflow/automation context before starting
python3 execution/memory_manager.py auto --query "automation patterns and workflow configurations for Varlock Claude Skill"
```

### Storing Results

After completing work, store workflow/automation decisions for future sessions:

```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py store \
  --content "Workflow: automated data pipeline with retry logic, dead-letter queue, and Slack alerts on failure" \
  --type technical --project <project> \
  --tags varlock-claude-skill workflow
```

### Multi-Agent Collaboration

Share workflow state with other agents so they can trigger, monitor, or extend the automation.

```bash
python3 execution/cross_agent_context.py store \
  --agent "<your-agent>" \
  --action "Workflow automation deployed — pipeline processing 1000+ events/day with 99.9% success rate" \
  --project <project>
```

### Playbook Engine

Combine this skill with others using the Playbook Engine (`execution/workflow_engine.py`) for guided multi-step automation with progress tracking.
