### Memory-First Protocol

Retrieve prior decisions and patterns to avoid re-discovering solutions. Cache results for instant retrieval in future sessions.

```bash
# Check for prior development context before starting
python3 execution/memory_manager.py auto --query "prior work and patterns related to Vexor"
```

### Storing Results

After completing work, store development decisions for future sessions:

```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py store \
  --content "Completed task with key insights documented for future reference" \
  --type decision --project <project> \
  --tags vexor default
```

### Multi-Agent Collaboration

Share outcomes with other agents so the team stays aligned and avoids duplicate work.

```bash
python3 execution/cross_agent_context.py store \
  --agent "<your-agent>" \
  --action "Task completed — results documented and shared with team" \
  --project <project>
```
