# Project Planning Skill

Help developers create comprehensive project planning documents by gathering requirements, asking clarifying questions, and generating structured specifications that AI coding agents can use for implementation.

## Information Gathering Phase

Before creating any documents, you MUST gather all necessary information. Ask questions conversationally, grouping related questions together. Do not overwhelm the user with all questions at once.

### Required Information Checklist

#### Project Vision
- [ ] Project name or working title
- [ ] One-sentence description of what you're building
- [ ] The problem being solved (why does this need to exist?)
- [ ] Target users (who will use this?)
- [ ] Desired outcomes (what does success look like?)

#### Scope & Requirements
- [ ] Core features (must-have functionality)
- [ ] Nice-to-have features (if time permits)
- [ ] Explicit non-goals (what are we NOT building?)
- [ ] Any existing solutions or alternatives considered

#### Technical Context
- [ ] Is this a new project or addition to existing codebase?
- [ ] If existing: repository location, tech stack, key patterns
- [ ] If new: preferred tech stack, languages, frameworks
- [ ] External dependencies or integrations needed
- [ ] Data storage requirements (database, files, etc.)

#### Constraints
- [ ] Hard constraints (security, compliance, performance)
- [ ] Dependencies on other systems or teams
- [ ] Known technical limitations or risks
- [ ] Budget or resource constraints (if applicable)

#### Success Criteria
- [ ] How will you know when this is complete?
- [ ] Specific acceptance criteria or tests
- [ ] Performance requirements (if any)
- [ ] Quality requirements (test coverage, documentation, etc.)

### Question Strategy

Ask questions in phases based on complexity:

**Phase 1: Vision (Always ask first)**
- What are you trying to build?
- What problem does it solve and for whom?

**Phase 2: Scope (After understanding vision)**
- What are the core features needed for an MVP?
- What is explicitly out of scope?

**Phase 3: Technical (After scope is clear)**
- What's the technical context? (new project vs existing, tech stack)
- Any integrations or dependencies?

**Phase 4: Constraints & Success (Final clarifications)**
- Any hard constraints to be aware of?
- How will we verify success?

See [clarifying-questions.md](references/clarifying-questions.md) for comprehensive question bank by project type.

## Document Generation Phase

After gathering requirements, generate the following documents. Present each document and ask for feedback before proceeding to the next.

### Document 1: PROJECT-SPEC.md

## Output Guidelines

### For AI Agent Consumption

The generated documents must be optimized for AI coding agents:

1. **Be Specific About Tech Stack**
   - Include exact versions: "React 18.2 with TypeScript 5.0"
   - List all key dependencies
   - Specify coding conventions

2. **Make Tasks Actionable**
   - Each task should be completable in a single session
   - Include specific file paths when known
   - Provide verification commands

3. **Include Context at Every Level**
   - Why does this task exist?
   - What patterns should be followed?
   - What files are related?

4. **Use Checklists for Progress**
   - AI agents can update checkboxes as they complete work
   - Human reviewers can quickly see status

5. **Specify Non-Goals Clearly**
   - Prevents scope creep
   - AI agents won't add unrequested features

### Document Formatting

- Use Markdown with clear headings
- Include code blocks for commands and examples
- Use tables for structured comparisons
- Keep sections focused and scannable
- Include verification steps that can be run

## Iteration & Updates

After generating initial documents:

1. **Review with User**
   - Present each document section by section
   - Ask for feedback and corrections
   - Clarify any assumptions made

2. **Refine Based on Feedback**
   - Update documents with corrections
   - Add missing details
   - Remove irrelevant sections

3. **Establish Update Cadence**
   - TASKS.md: Update after each completed task
   - IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md: Update after each phase
   - PROJECT-SPEC.md: Update when requirements change

## Wrap Up

After generating all documents, offer:

1. **Review & Refinement**: Go through each document section by section
2. **Priority Adjustment**: Reorder tasks based on dependencies or preferences
3. **Scope Negotiation**: Adjust scope if project seems too large for available time
4. **First Task Kickoff**: Begin implementing the first task immediately
5. **Export Options**: Save documents to specific locations in the codebase
