# LimaCharlie Managed Ruleset Deployer

This skill helps you deploy and manage Sigma rules and other managed rulesets in LimaCharlie. Use this when users need help with:

- Deploying Sigma rules from SigmaHQ
- Converting Sigma rules to LimaCharlie format
- Managing Soteria EDR, AWS, or M365 rulesets
- Configuring SOC Prime rules
- Using Community Rules
- Understanding managed ruleset pricing and subscriptions
- Tuning and managing false positives
- Updating and versioning rulesets

## What are Managed Rulesets?

Managed rulesets are professionally maintained, pre-built detection rules that can be deployed with one click to a LimaCharlie organization. They provide:

- **Expert-curated detections**: Rules written by security professionals
- **Automatic updates**: Rulesets are updated as new threats emerge
- **Broad coverage**: MITRE ATT&CK framework alignment
- **Reduced maintenance**: No need to write rules from scratch
- **Cost efficiency**: Leverage community and commercial detections
- **Quick deployment**: Enable comprehensive detection in minutes

LimaCharlie supports multiple managed ruleset sources:
1. **Sigma Rules** - Open-source detection rules from SigmaHQ
2. **Soteria Rules** - Managed EDR, AWS, and M365 detection rulesets
3. **SOC Prime Rules** - Community and enterprise detection content
4. **Community Rules** - AI-assisted conversion of third-party rules

## Quick Start by Ruleset Type

### Sigma Rules - Quick Start

**What**: Open-source detection rules automatically converted to LimaCharlie format

**Best for**: Free, customizable coverage with community-maintained rules

**Quick Deploy**:
```bash
# Convert a single Sigma rule
curl -X POST https://sigma.limacharlie.io/convert/rule \
  -H 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  --data-urlencode "rule@my-sigma-rule.yaml"

# Convert multiple rules from GitHub directory
curl -X POST https://sigma.limacharlie.io/convert/repo \
  -d "repo=https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma/blob/master/rules/windows/process_creation"
```

**Common targets**: `edr` (default for endpoint detection), `artifact` (for log analysis)

See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md#sigma-conversion-api) for complete API documentation.
See [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md#sigma-deployment-scenarios) for deployment examples.

## Ruleset Comparison

| Ruleset | Cost | Updates | Visibility | Best For |
|---------|------|---------|------------|----------|
| **Sigma** | Free | Manual | Full | Custom rules, open-source coverage |
| **Soteria EDR** | Paid | Auto | None | Comprehensive EDR coverage |
| **Soteria AWS** | Paid | Auto | None | AWS security monitoring |
| **Soteria M365** | Paid | Auto | None | M365/O365 security |
| **SOC Prime** | Paid* | Auto (3h) | Full | Enterprise content management |
| **Community** | Free | Manual | Full | Specific detections, quick starts |

*Requires SOC Prime subscription (separate from LimaCharlie)

For detailed comparison and selection guidance, see [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md#ruleset-selection-guide).

## False Positive Management

False Positive (FP) rules filter detections globally to reduce alert fatigue.

### Quick FP Rule Creation

**From a detection** (fastest method):
1. Navigate to **Detections** page
2. Find a false positive detection
3. Click **Mark False Positive**
4. Review auto-generated rule
5. Save

**From scratch**:
1. Navigate to **Automation > False Positive Rules**
2. Click **New Rule**
3. Define matching logic
4. Optionally set expiry date
5. Save

### Common FP Patterns

```yaml
# Ignore detection by name
op: is
path: cat
value: my-detection-name
```

```yaml
# Ignore specific file
op: ends with
path: detect/event/FILE_PATH
value: legitimate-tool.exe
case sensitive: false
```

```yaml
# Ignore specific host
op: is
path: routing/hostname
value: build-server-01
```

For complete FP rule syntax and advanced examples, see [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md#false-positive-rules).
For FP troubleshooting by ruleset, see [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#false-positive-issues).

## Rule Testing

Always test rules before production deployment.

### Quick Test Commands

```bash
# Validate rule syntax
limacharlie replay --validate --rule-content rule.yaml

# Test against recent data (last 7 days)
limacharlie replay --rule-content rule.yaml \
  --entire-org --last-seconds 604800

# Test with trace mode for debugging
limacharlie replay --rule-content rule.yaml \
  --events event.json --trace
```

For complete testing workflows, see [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md#testing-workflows).
For test troubleshooting, see [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#testing-issues).

## Rule Management

### View Rules

```bash
# List all rules
limacharlie dr list

# Get specific rule
limacharlie dr get --rule-name my-rule
```

### Deploy Rules

```bash
# Add a rule
limacharlie dr add --rule-name my-rule --rule-file rule.yaml

# Remove a rule
limacharlie dr remove --rule-name my-rule

# Export all rules (backup)
limacharlie dr list --format json > rules-backup.json
```

### Organization with Namespaces

Use prefixes to organize rules by source:
- `sigma-windows-process-creation-suspicious-cmd`
- `soteria-edr-windows-lateral-movement`
- `custom-ransomware-indicators`

For version control and IaC approaches, see [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md#rule-versioning).

## Best Practices Summary

### Deployment Strategy

1. **Start with high-fidelity rulesets**
   - Soteria rules for managed coverage
   - SOC Prime for enterprise content

2. **Add broad coverage**
   - Deploy Sigma rules for common threats
   - Use Community Rules for specific techniques

3. **Customize and tune**
   - Create custom rules for org-specific threats
   - Add FP rules to reduce noise

4. **Continuous improvement**
   - Monitor detection quality
   - Refine rules based on feedback
   - Keep rulesets updated

### Performance Tips

- Don't deploy all rules at once
- Focus on high-priority threats first
- Put restrictive conditions first in rules
- Use suppression for noisy rules
- Monitor rule evaluation metrics

### Security Posture

- Update Sigma rules monthly
- Monitor Soteria/SOC Prime updates
- Map rules to MITRE ATT&CK
- Maintain documentation
- Regular effectiveness reviews

For complete best practices, see [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md#best-practices-detailed).

## Common Issues - Quick Reference

### Sigma conversion fails
- Verify Sigma rule syntax
- Try different target (edr/artifact)
- See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#sigma-conversion-issues)

### No detections from Soteria
- Verify required events configured
- Check subscription is active
- Wait 24-48 hours for activation
- See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#soteria-no-detections)

### SOC Prime rules not syncing
- Verify API key is valid
- Check subscription is not free tier
- Wait for 3-hour sync cycle
- See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#soc-prime-sync-issues)

### Community rules fail to convert
- Try again (AI can be inconsistent)
- Use similar rule as template
- See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#community-conversion-failures)

### High false positive rate
- Create FP rules from detections
- Exclude test environments
- Tune thresholds
- See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#false-positive-rate)

### Rules not matching events
- Use replay with trace mode
- Check event structure
- Verify event type
- See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#rule-matching-issues)

## Summary

This skill provides guidance for deploying and managing four types of managed rulesets:

1. **Sigma Rules**: Free, customizable open-source rules requiring manual conversion
2. **Soteria Rules**: Professional managed rulesets with auto-updates (EDR, AWS, M365)
3. **SOC Prime Rules**: Enterprise content platform with continuous sync
4. **Community Rules**: AI-assisted conversion from multiple sources

When helping users:
- Understand their environment and needs
- Recommend appropriate rulesets (see comparison table)
- Guide through testing before production
- Help tune for false positives
- Provide troubleshooting assistance
- Encourage Infrastructure as Code for scale

The best approach combines managed rulesets for baseline coverage with custom rules for organization-specific needs.
