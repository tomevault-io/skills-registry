name: epic-scan
description: Load for brownfield epics to analyze existing code patterns and implementations relevant to this epic's domain before planning. Use when the epic modifies or extends significant existing functionality. Skip for fully greenfield epics. FIRST ACTION after loading: read template at .speck/templates/epic/epic-codebase-scan-template.md before any context loading or artifact generation. Use when this capability is needed.

$ARGUMENTS

## ⚠️ Step 0: Read Template First

**Before any other action** — read this template now using the Read tool:
```
.speck/templates/epic/epic-codebase-scan-template.md
```
The template defines required sections and formatting for `epic-codebase-scan.md`. Reading it first ensures your scan findings land in the structure epic-plan expects.

**Checkpoint**: After reading, note the top-level sections from the template. Then continue to Step 1.

Analyze codebase for existing patterns, similar implementations, and reusable components **specifically relevant to this epic's scope**.

**Time**: 15-20 minutes (focused domain analysis)  
**Confidence**: MEDIUM - validated by presence, not deep code reading  
**Purpose**: Find what's relevant to YOUR epic  
**Output**: Epic-specific scan with reusable patterns

## Subagent Parallelization

This command benefits from parallel speck-scanner execution for domain analysis:

```
├── [Parallel] speck-scanner: "Analyze API patterns relevant to this epic in src/"
├── [Parallel] speck-scanner: "Analyze data models relevant to this epic in src/models/"
├── [Parallel] speck-scanner: "Analyze auth patterns relevant to this epic in src/"
├── [Parallel] speck-scanner: "Analyze integration patterns relevant to this epic in src/"
└── [Wait] → Synthesize into epic-codebase-scan.md

Focus each scanner on domains relevant to THIS epic.
```

**Speedup**: 3-4x compared to sequential scanning.

## When to Use

- **After `/epic-specify` or `/epic-clarify`** - Understand existing patterns before planning
- **After `/project-scan`** - Validate and deepen project-level findings for this epic area
- **Before `/epic-plan`** - Find patterns to incorporate into technical design
- **When unsure about existing implementations** - "Have we built something similar?"

**Not for**: Project-wide analysis (use `/project-scan`) or story-specific deep dives (use `/story-scan`)

---

## Scan Process

1. **Load epic context**:
   - Find and load `epic.md` to understand epic scope
   - **Extract key domains**: What is this epic about? (auth, payments, admin, etc.)
   - Load project-level landscape overview if exists
   - Parse optional `--domain=X` argument for sub-focus

2. **Determine relevance filter**:
   - Based on epic scope, identify what's relevant vs irrelevant
   - Example: If epic is "Authentication & Authorization"
     - **Relevant**: Auth middleware, login flows, session management, JWT patterns
     - **Irrelevant**: Product catalog, payment processing, reporting
   - Create search terms for this epic's domain

3. **Epic-focused scan** (MEDIUM depth - read file names and shallow code):

   **A. Find Similar Features** (relevant to THIS epic):
   ```bash
   # Search for similar functionality in this domain
   find [CODEBASE] -type f -name "*[domain-keyword]*"
   
   # Example for auth epic:
   find [CODEBASE] -type f -name "*auth*" -o -name "*login*" -o -name "*session*"
   
   # Shallow grep for relevant patterns
   grep -r "class.*Auth\|def.*login\|authenticate" [CODEBASE] | head -20
   ```
   
   Extract:
   - Files that handle similar functionality
   - Patterns that could be extended
   - Components that could be reused
   - **Confidence**: MEDIUM - found by pattern matching, not deep reading
   
   **B. Find Integration Points** (that THIS epic touches):
   ```bash
   # APIs this epic will integrate with
   grep -r "import.*[domain]\|from.*[domain]" [CODEBASE]
   
   # Database models related to this domain
   find [CODEBASE] -path "*/models/*" -name "*[domain]*.py"
   ```
   
   Extract (only relevant to this epic):
   - APIs this epic will use (not all APIs)
   - Services to integrate with (only ones this epic touches)
   - Data models to extend (only related models)
   
   **C. Extract Relevant Code Patterns** (shallow examples):
   ```bash
   # Find 2-3 good examples
   # Read just enough to understand the pattern (10-20 lines each)
   ```
   
   Extract (domain-specific only):
   - Error handling in this domain
   - Testing approaches for similar features
   - State management patterns (if applicable)
   - Security patterns (if applicable)

4. **Filter out irrelevant findings**:
   - For each finding, ask: "Does this relate to MY epic's domain?"
   - If NO → Skip it (mention skipped count in report)
   - If MAYBE → Note as "potentially relevant"
   - If YES → Include in report

5. **Generate focused epic scan report**:

   **CRITICAL**: Load and follow the template exactly:
   ```
   .speck/templates/epic/epic-codebase-scan-template.md
   ```

   The template is self-documenting - follow all sections and constraints within it (this command should not re-state the template headings inline).

6. **Save scan results**:
   - Full report: `[EPIC_DIR]/epic-codebase-scan.md`
   - Domain-specific: `[EPIC_DIR]/epic-codebase-scan-[domain].md`

7. **Output summary**:
   ```
   ✅ Epic Codebase Scan Complete!
   
   Epic: [Epic Name]
   Domain: [What this epic focuses on]
   Confidence: MEDIUM (Pattern matching + shallow code reading)
   
   Findings (Relevant to YOUR Epic):
   - Similar features: [X] found
   - Reusable components: [Y] identified
   - Integration points: [Z] relevant
   - Patterns extracted: [N]
   
   Filtering Applied:
   - Analyzed: [X] items in epic's domain
   - Skipped: [Y] items (not relevant to this epic)
   
   Key Insights:
   1. [Most important relevant finding]
   2. [Second relevant finding]
   
   Recommendations for YOUR Epic:
   - Reuse [component] from [location]
   - Follow [pattern] from [location]
   - Avoid [anti-pattern] seen in [location]
   
   Full report: epic-codebase-scan.md
   
   Next: Run /epic-plan to incorporate findings into technical design
   ```

## Key Principles

1. **Relevance filtering**: Only show what matters to THIS epic
2. **Medium confidence**: Patterns found, not deeply analyzed
3. **Actionable**: Clear recommendations for epic planning
4. **Efficient**: 15-20 minutes, not hours
5. **Honest about limitations**: Clear about what wasn't analyzed

---

## Integration with Other Commands

**Requires**:
- `/epic-specify` or `/epic-clarify` - Need epic scope defined

**Optional context**:
- `/project-scan` - Can use landscape overview to guide search

**Feeds into**:
- `/epic-plan` - Incorporates patterns and recommendations
- `/epic-architecture` - Uses integration points and patterns

**Related**:
- `/story-scan` - Deeper analysis for specific stories (HIGH confidence)

---

This helps ensure epics build on existing relevant code rather than reinventing wheels or copying irrelevant patterns.
