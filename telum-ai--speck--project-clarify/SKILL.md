description: Load after project.md exists to fill gaps through targeted Q&A. Use when project goals, target users, or scope feel underspecified. Run before project-context or project-architecture to prevent rework downstream. Use when this capability is needed.

The user input to you can be provided directly by the agent or as a command argument - you **MUST** consider it before proceeding with the prompt (if not empty).

User input:

$ARGUMENTS

Goal: Detect and reduce ambiguity through targeted Q&A, identify areas requiring deeper research, and prepare the project for comprehensive planning.

Note: This clarification workflow is expected to run (and be completed) BEFORE invoking `/project-plan`. If the user explicitly states they are skipping clarification (e.g., proof of concept), you may proceed, but must warn that downstream rework risk increases.

Execution steps:

1. Determine active project directory:
   - Check current working directory for project.md
   - If not found, scan specs/projects/ for most recent project
   - Parse PROJECT_DIR and PROJECT_SPEC paths
   - If no project found: ERROR "No active project found. Run /project-specify first"

2. Load ONLY upstream context (do NOT load downstream artifacts):
   
   **ALWAYS Load** (upstream/input to clarify):
   - `project.md` (the spec to clarify)
   - `project-import.md` (if exists - brownfield non-code extraction)
   - `project-landscape-overview.md` (if exists - brownfield code extraction)
   
   **NEVER Load** (downstream/created AFTER clarify):
   - ❌ `PRD.md` - Created by /project-plan (comes AFTER clarify)
   - ❌ `context.md` - Created by /project-context (comes AFTER clarify)
   - ❌ `architecture.md` - Created by /project-architecture (comes AFTER clarify)
   - ❌ `design-system.md` - Created later (comes AFTER clarify)
   - ❌ `ux-strategy.md` - Created by /project-ux (parallel/before clarify)
   - ❌ `epics.md` - Created by /project-plan (comes AFTER clarify)
   
   **Why**: Clarify refines the INPUT (project.md). Don't confuse it with OUTPUT artifacts.

3. Perform a structured ambiguity & coverage scan using this taxonomy. For each category, mark status: Clear / Partial / Missing. Produce an internal coverage map used for prioritization (do not output raw map unless no questions will be asked).

   Strategic Scope & Vision:
   - Project boundaries and success definition
   - Explicit exclusions and v2+ deferrals
   - Stakeholder alignment and priorities
   
   User & Market Understanding:
   - User segment definition and validation
   - Problem severity and frequency
   - Alternative solutions evaluation
   - Market timing and urgency
   
   Business Model & Constraints:
   - Revenue/cost model implications
   - Monetization strategy clarity
   - Pricing approach and validation plan
   - Unit economics assumptions (CAC, LTV)
   - Go-to-market strategy
   - Resource availability and skills
   - Timeline drivers and flexibility
   - Compliance and policy requirements
   
   Technical Landscape:
   - Integration requirements specificity
   - Performance and scale expectations
   - Security and privacy requirements
   - Platform and deployment constraints
   
   Risk & Dependencies:
   - Critical path dependencies
   - Technical feasibility concerns
   - Organizational change requirements
   - Market/competitive risks

3. Generate clarifying questions:
   - Maximum 7 questions for project-level (strategic focus)
   - Prioritize by: Risk > Scope > Users > Technical > Other
   - Each question must be specific and actionable
   - Provide 2-3 answer options where helpful
   - Mark which section each answer will clarify
   
   **Brownfield Adaptation**:
   - If project-landscape-overview.md exists, SKIP questions about:
     * Existing features (already discovered in scan)
     * Current tech stack (already documented)
     * Current architecture patterns (already identified)
   - FOCUS brownfield questions on:
     * Strategic direction and future goals
     * User needs not evident in code
     * Business model and monetization
     * Constraints not visible in codebase (team, budget, timeline)
     * Planned enhancements or pivots

4. Present questions professionally:
   ```
   I've analyzed the project specification and identified some areas that would benefit from clarification before planning.

   1. **[Category] - [Specific Question]**
      Context: [Why this matters for project success]
      Options: 
      a) [Option 1]
      b) [Option 2]
      c) [Other/Custom]
      (This will clarify the [Section Name] section)

   [Continue for all questions...]
   ```

5. Process each answer:
   - Acknowledge the response
   - Ask follow-up if answer is ambiguous
   - Identify which section(s) to update

6. Update project.md systematically:
   - Add new "## Clarifications" section after Project Context if not exists
   - Create subsection "### Session YYYY-MM-DD"
   - List each Q&A pair concisely
   - Update relevant sections with clarified information
   - Remove any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers that were resolved
   - Preserve all existing content structure

7. Validate updates:
   - Re-scan for remaining ambiguities
   - Ensure internal consistency
   - Check no contradictions introduced

8. Research need assessment (NEW - happens after Q&A):
   - Review remaining ambiguities after clarification
   - Identify which require research vs simple decisions
   - For each research need, determine:
     * Why it can't be answered via Q&A
     * What kind of research would help
     * Specific research queries to run
   - Categorize by priority: Critical, Important, Nice-to-have

9. Update project.md with research section:
   - Add "## Research Needed" section if research identified
   - List each area with:
     * Topic and why it needs research
     * Priority level
     * Suggested research queries
   - This guides just-in-time research during downstream commands (ux/context/architecture/plan)

10. Report completion:
   - Number of clarifications added
   - Sections updated  
   - Research areas identified (if any)
   - Specific research queries prepared
   - Readiness assessment for next steps

Example interaction:
```
User: /project-clarify
AI: I've analyzed the project specification and identified some areas...

1. **Scope - Should the v1 include mobile apps or web-only?**
   Context: This significantly impacts timeline and resource needs.
   Options:
   a) Web-only for v1, mobile in v2
   b) Mobile-first, web later
   c) Both platforms from start
   (This will clarify the Project Type & Scale section)

User: Let's go with option a - web first, mobile later

AI: Understood. Web-only for v1 with mobile planned for v2.

[Continues through all questions...]

AI: ✅ Project Clarification Complete!

- Clarifications Added: 5
- Sections Updated: Project Type, Scope, Technical Constraints

Research Needed: 3 areas identified
1. **Market Analysis** (Critical)
   - Query: "AI code review tool competitive landscape 2024"
   - Why: Need competitive positioning before defining features

2. **Technical Feasibility** (Important)  
   - Query: "LLM fine-tuning costs and performance at scale"
   - Why: Architecture decisions depend on cost constraints

3. **User Validation** (Important)
   - Query: "Developer workflow integration patterns for AI tools"
   - Why: UX approach needs real-world usage patterns

Next Steps:
- If research needed: Apply the just-in-time research pattern
  (`.cursor/skills/just-in-time-research/SKILL.md`) to answer the queries above, then continue
- If UX-heavy product: /project-ux (define experience strategy)
- If standard product: /project-context (define constraints and standards)
- If very simple (Level 0-1): Skip to /project-plan

Note: Foundation commands (ux, context, constitution) provide essential
inputs for PRD creation. Running them before /project-plan ensures complete PRD.
```

Error conditions:
- No project.md found → ERROR with instructions
- Project already has PRD → WARN "Project already planned, clarifications may require re-planning"
- User skips all questions → WARN about incomplete specification risks
