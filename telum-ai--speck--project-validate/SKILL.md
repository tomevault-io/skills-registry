name: project-validate
description: Load when all epics are complete to verify the project meets its original vision and PRD success metrics. Produces project validation report — required before project-retrospective. FIRST ACTION after loading: read templates at .speck/templates/project/project-validation-report-template.md, .speck/templates/project/project-validation-summary-template.md, and .speck/templates/project/project-punch-list-template.md before any context loading or artifact generation. Use when this capability is needed.

$ARGUMENTS

## ⚠️ Step 0: Read Templates First

**Before any other action** — read ALL THREE templates now using the Read tool:
```
.speck/templates/project/project-validation-report-template.md
.speck/templates/project/project-validation-summary-template.md
.speck/templates/project/project-punch-list-template.md
```
This skill produces three artifacts. Reading all templates first ensures your validation evidence, executive summary, and punch list land in the expected structure.

**Checkpoint**: After reading all three, note each template's top-level sections. Then continue to Play Level Check.

## Play Level Check

Read `.speck/project.json` (if it exists) for `play_level`.

- **Sprint**: Tell the user: "Sprint validation is simple — did you hit your Success Metric? Check your `sprint-log.md` outcome section. If yes and it's growing, run `/project-promote`."
- **Build**: Validate PRD requirements, epic completion, and core quality gates. Skip constitution compliance and design-system coverage sections.
- **Platform** (or no project.json): Full validation flow below.

Comprehensive validation of project completion, ensuring all goals are met and the system is ready for production.

## Subagent Parallelization

This command benefits from parallel validation checks:

```
├── [Parallel] speck-auditor: "Check project.md goals are achieved"
├── [Parallel] speck-auditor: "Verify all PRD requirements are implemented"
├── [Parallel] speck-auditor: "Confirm all epics are complete"
├── [Parallel] speck-auditor: "Test cross-epic integration flows"
├── [Parallel] speck-auditor: "Check code quality, security, accessibility"
├── [Parallel] speck-auditor: "Verify Cursor rules compliance"
└── [Wait] → Synthesize into project-validation-report.md

Each auditor returns PASS | FAIL | PARTIAL with evidence.
```

**Speedup**: 5-6x compared to sequential validation.

---

1. Load project artifacts and status:
   - Original: project.md, PRD.md, epics.md
   - Epic status: Check each epic directory for completion
   - Implementation: Aggregate all story validations
   - Metrics: Gather performance and quality data
   - If files missing: ERROR "Project planning artifacts not found"

2. Epic completion verification:
   ```
   For each epic in epics.md:
   - Check `epics/*/epic-validation-report.md` (and epic-punch-list.md as needed)
   - Verify all stories completed
   - Confirm success criteria met
   - Note any deviations from plan
   ```

3. Multi-level validation:

   **Project Vision Validation**
   - Original vision from project.md achieved?
   - All primary goals met?
   - Target user problems solved?
   - Success metrics reached?

   **PRD Requirement Validation**
   - All functional requirements implemented?
   - Non-functional requirements met?
   - Scope boundaries respected?
   - Edge cases handled?

   **Epic Integration Validation**
   - All epics work together seamlessly?
   - Cross-epic workflows function?
   - No integration gaps?
   - Performance at scale?

   **Quality Standards Validation**
   - Code quality gates passed?
   - Security requirements met?
   - Accessibility standards achieved?
   - Documentation complete?
   - Cursor rules compliance across project?

4. Cursor rules compliance project-wide aggregation:
   - Check if `.cursor/rules/` directory exists
   - If exists, load all rule files (`*.mdc` or `*.md`)
   - Aggregate rule compliance across all epics and stories:
     * Review epic-validation-report.md files for rules compliance sections
     * Collect project-wide compliance patterns
     * Identify systemic issues vs isolated violations
   - Generate project-level rules compliance summary:
     ```
     ## Cursor Rules Compliance (Project Summary)
     
     **Rules Directory**: `.cursor/rules/` [exists/not found]
     **Total Rules**: [X]
     **Epics Evaluated**: [Y]
     **Stories Evaluated**: [Z]
     
     | Rule File | Epic Coverage | Overall Pass Rate | Trend |
     |-----------|---------------|-------------------|-------|
     | [rule.mdc] | 12/12 epics | 98% (156/160 stories) | ✅ Excellent |
     | [rule.mdc] | 8/12 epics | 75% (90/120 stories) | ⚠️ Needs attention |
     | [rule.mdc] | 12/12 epics | 100% (160/160 stories) | ✅ Perfect |
     
     **Project-Wide Patterns**:
     - Rules consistently followed: [list rules with >95% compliance]
     - Rules needing improvement: [list rules with <80% compliance]
     - Rules causing frequent violations: [analysis and recommendations]
     
     **Systemic Issues**:
     - [Pattern 1]: Violated in [X] stories across [Y] epics → [Root cause analysis]
     - [Pattern 2]: Violated in [X] stories across [Y] epics → [Root cause analysis]
     
     **Recommendations for Future**:
     - Update rules that are unclear or too strict
     - Add tooling/automation for commonly violated rules
     - Training needed on specific rule areas
     ```
   - If no `.cursor/rules/` directory: Note "No project-specific rules found"
   - If systemic patterns: Include in lessons learned

5. Execute validation suites:

   **Automated Validation**
   - Run full test suite across all epics
   - Execute integration test scenarios
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Security scanning
   - Accessibility audits

   **Manual Validation**
   - User acceptance test scenarios
   - Cross-epic user journeys
   - Edge case verification
   - Production readiness checklist

6. Metrics collection and analysis:
   ```
   Original Success Metrics (from project.md):
   - [Metric 1]: Target [X]
     * Actual: [Y]
     * Status: [Met/Not Met/Exceeded]
   
   - [Metric 2]: Target [X]
     * Actual: [Y]
     * Status: [Met/Not Met/Exceeded]
   ```

7. Generate comprehensive validation report:

   **CRITICAL**: Load and follow the template exactly:
   ```
   .speck/templates/project/project-validation-report-template.md
   ```

   Write output to: `[PROJECT_DIR]/project-validation-report.md`

8. Generate executive summary:

   **CRITICAL**: Load and follow the template exactly:
   ```
   .speck/templates/project/project-validation-summary-template.md
   ```

   Write output to: `[PROJECT_DIR]/project-validation-summary.md`

9. Generate punch list:

   **CRITICAL**: Load and follow the template exactly:
   ```
   .speck/templates/project/project-punch-list-template.md
   ```

   Write output to: `[PROJECT_DIR]/project-punch-list.md`

10. Save validation artifacts:
   - Full report: `[PROJECT_DIR]/project-validation-report.md`
   - Executive summary: `[PROJECT_DIR]/project-validation-summary.md`
   - Punch list: `[PROJECT_DIR]/project-punch-list.md`

11. Output summary:

## Full JTBD Smoke Test (REQUIRED — Product-Level Coherence)

**This is the ultimate composition check** — verifying the product works as a whole, not just as a collection of validated epics.

### Step A: Core JTBD End-to-End Walkthrough

1. Read `project.md` and identify the **primary job the user hired this product to do**
2. Start from scratch — open the app as a brand-new user would
3. Attempt to complete the core JTBD without any developer knowledge:
   - No dev-mode headers
   - No hardcoded UUIDs or API keys
   - No terminal commands or direct API calls
   - No "you need to go to the other platform for this"
4. Record every step, every dead end, every moment of confusion

### Step B: Cross-Epic Flow Verification

For each dependency arrow in `epics.md`:
- Test the actual data/auth/navigation flow between epics
- Verify a user can move between features from different epics seamlessly
- Check that context (auth, org, user) carries through the entire product

### Step C: Platform Coherence

If the project spans multiple platforms (web + mobile, desktop + API, etc.):
- Each platform MUST deliver a usable version of the core JTBD
- "Use the other platform for this" is acceptable for secondary features only
- Primary features must be reachable on every supported platform

### Step D: No Dead Ends

- Every reachable feature has a way back
- Every user action has feedback (success, error, loading)
- No features require dev knowledge to operate
- No scaffolding (UUID inputs, debug headers) remains in production UI

### Step E: Generate JTBD Smoke Test Section

Include in `project-validation-report.md`:

```markdown
## Product Coherence — JTBD Smoke Test

**Primary JTBD**: [From project.md — what the user hired this product to do]
**Test Date**: [When performed]
**Platforms Tested**: [Web, Mobile, etc.]

### Core Journey

| Step | User Action | Expected | Actual | Status |
|------|-------------|----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | First visit / signup | [Expected] | [Actual] | ✅/❌ |
| 2 | [Next action] | [Expected] | [Actual] | ✅/❌ |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**JTBD Completion**: [COMPLETE / PARTIAL / BLOCKED]

### Cross-Epic Flows

| Flow | Epics Involved | Status | Issues |
|------|---------------|--------|--------|
| [User journey spanning epics] | E001 → E003 | ✅/❌ | [Details] |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Platform Coherence

| Platform | Core JTBD Completable? | Missing Features | Status |
|----------|----------------------|------------------|--------|
| Web | Y/N | [List] | ✅/❌ |
| Mobile | Y/N | [List] | ✅/❌ |

### Dead Ends Found

- [List any features that are unreachable, have no navigation, or require dev knowledge]

### Scaffolding Remaining

- [List any dev-mode shortcuts still in production UI]
```

### Step F: JTBD Status Overrides Project Status

| JTBD Smoke Test | Project Status |
|-----------------|----------------|
| COMPLETE | GO (if all other checks pass) |
| PARTIAL | CONDITIONAL — list missing pieces |
| BLOCKED | NO-GO — product cannot deliver its core value |

**CRITICAL**: A project with all epics validated but a BLOCKED JTBD is a NO-GO.

---

Note: This is the final gate before production deployment. Be thorough and honest about readiness. Check both bottom-up (all specs met) AND top-down (product actually works for users).
