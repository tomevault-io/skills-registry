name: story-implement
description: Load when user says 'implement this', 'write the code', 'build it', or all planning artifacts are in place and reviewed. PREREQUISITE GATE — before executing, verify all four artifacts exist in the story directory: spec.md (from /story-specify), plan.md (from /story-plan), tasks.md (from /story-tasks), and analysis-report.md with no unresolved CRITICALs (from /story-analyze). If any are missing, do NOT implement — route to the missing step first (story-specify → story-plan → story-tasks → story-analyze → story-implement). Use when this capability is needed.

User input:

$ARGUMENTS

1. Locate the active story directory (STORY_DIR) and verify ALL prerequisites exist:

   **Step A — Find the story directory**:
   - Preferred: user is already in the story directory (or a subfolder like `contracts/`)
   - Walk up from current directory until you find `spec.md`
   - If NO `spec.md` found anywhere in the directory tree:
     * ERROR "No story spec found. Run `/story-specify` first to define what to build, then `/story-plan` → `/story-tasks` → `/story-analyze` before implementing."
   - If `spec.md` found but lifecycle state is `Draft (Placeholder)`:
     * ERROR "This story's spec.md is still a Draft placeholder — `/story-specify` has not been run yet. Complete the specification before implementing."

   **Step B — Verify the full prerequisite chain**:
   - `{STORY_DIR}/spec.md` — REQUIRED (ERROR if missing: "Run `/story-specify` first")
   - `{STORY_DIR}/plan.md` — REQUIRED (ERROR if missing: "Run `/story-plan` first")
   - `{STORY_DIR}/tasks.md` — REQUIRED (ERROR if missing: "Run `/story-tasks` first")
   - `{STORY_DIR}/analysis-report.md` — REQUIRED (ERROR if missing: "Run `/story-analyze` first — it is non-negotiable")

   All four must exist before a single line of implementation code is written.

   **⚠️ PRE-IMPLEMENTATION CHECK**:
   Verify `analysis-report.md` has no CRITICAL issues unresolved. If it does:
   - List the CRITICAL issues
   - Refuse to proceed: "Fix the CRITICAL issues in analysis-report.md before implementing"
   - story-analyze catches spec/plan/task conflicts BEFORE implementation — never skip it

2. Load and analyze the implementation context:
   - **REQUIRED**: Read tasks.md for the complete task list and execution plan
   - **REQUIRED**: Read plan.md for tech stack, architecture, and file structure
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read data-model.md for entities and relationships
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read contracts/ for API specifications and test requirements
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read plan.md for technical decisions and constraints (research is embedded here)
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read quickstart.md for integration scenarios
   
   **REQUIRED FOR UI STORIES**: Load visual design context:
   - Read `specs/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/design-system.md`
   - Extract and hold in context:
     * **Design Philosophy** — Core principle, emotional keywords, visual vibe, anti-patterns
     * **Bold Choices (Non-Negotiable)** — The specific opinionated rules that define this product's personality
     * **What Success Looks Like** — The feel test for visual quality
   - These sections define what "beautiful" means for THIS project
   - Every UI task must be implemented with these constraints actively in mind
   - Reference: `.cursor/skills/visual-quality/SKILL.md` fires automatically for UI files
   - If design-system.md lacks these sections: WARN "Design system missing Design Philosophy / Bold Choices / What Success Looks Like sections — UI quality will suffer. Consider running /project-design-system to add them."
   
   **Update tasks.md YAML frontmatter** to mark implementation started:
   ```yaml
   ---
   status: in_progress
   ---
   ```

3. Parse tasks.md structure and extract:
   - **Task phases**: Setup, Tests, Core, Integration, Polish
   - **Task dependencies**: Sequential vs parallel execution rules
   - **Task details**: ID, description, file paths, parallel markers [P]
   - **Execution flow**: Order and dependency requirements

4. Execute implementation following the task plan:
   - **Phase-by-phase execution**: Complete each phase before moving to the next
   - **Respect dependencies**: Run sequential tasks in order, parallel tasks [P] can run together  
   - **Follow TDD approach**: Execute test tasks before their corresponding implementation tasks
   - **File-based coordination**: Tasks affecting the same files must run sequentially
   - **Validation checkpoints**: Verify each phase completion before proceeding

   **Subagent Parallelization** - For tasks marked `[P]`, spawn parallel speck-coder:
   ```
   Phase 2: Tests (example)
   - [P] [ ] T2.1: Write user tests → speck-coder instance 1
   - [P] [ ] T2.2: Write auth tests → speck-coder instance 2 (parallel!)
   - [P] [ ] T2.3: Write API tests  → speck-coder instance 3 (parallel!)
   - [ ] T2.4: Integration tests    → speck-coder (sequential, depends on above)
   ```
   
   Each speck-coder receives:
   - Task ID and description
   - Files to create/modify
   - Relevant patterns from codebase scan
   - TDD flag (write test first)
   
   Wait for all parallel tasks to complete before proceeding to dependent tasks.

5. Implementation execution rules:
   - **Setup first**: Initialize project structure, dependencies, configuration
   - **Tests before code**: If you need to write tests for contracts, entities, and integration scenarios
   - **Core development**: Implement models, services, CLI commands, endpoints
   - **Integration work**: Database connections, middleware, logging, external services
   - **Polish and validation**: Unit tests, performance optimization, documentation

6. Progress tracking and error handling:
   - Report progress after each completed task
   - Halt execution if any non-parallel task fails
   - For parallel tasks [P], continue with successful tasks, report failed ones
   - Provide clear error messages with context for debugging
   - Suggest next steps if implementation cannot proceed
   - **IMPORTANT** For completed tasks, make sure to mark the task off as [X] in the tasks file.

7. **Visual Quality Review** (for UI stories — if any tasks created/modified UI files):
   
   Before marking implementation complete, perform a visual self-review:
   
   - Re-read the **Design Philosophy**, **Bold Choices**, and **What Success Looks Like** from design-system.md (loaded in step 2)
   - For each screen/component you created or modified, check:
     * Does it embody the Design Philosophy's core principle?
     * Are ALL Bold Choices (Non-Negotiable) honored? Check each one explicitly.
     * Would it pass the "What Success Looks Like" feel test?
     * Is there intentional typography hierarchy (not flat/boring)?
     * Is negative space active and deliberate (not cramped/random)?
     * Do interactive states (hover/focus/active) feel designed (not browser-default)?
     * Does the UI have texture/depth (not flat/lifeless)?
     * Do components have personality (not generic boilerplate)?
   - If ANY check fails: **iterate on the implementation before proceeding**
   - Grade your UI: BEAUTIFUL / ACCEPTABLE / NEEDS_WORK / UGLY
   - If NEEDS_WORK or UGLY: fix it now. Functionally correct is NOT done.
   
   Include the grade in the completion summary.

8. Completion validation:
   - Verify all required tasks are completed
   - Mark all completed tasks as [X] in tasks.md
   - Report final status with summary of completed work
   - Suggest running `/story-validate` to verify implementation against spec
   
   **CRITICAL: Update tasks.md YAML frontmatter to mark completion**:
   ```yaml
   ---
   status: completed
   ---
   ```
   
   The orchestrator uses `status: completed` to know implementation is done.

9. Next steps:
   ```
   ✅ Story Implementation Complete!
   
   Tasks Completed: [X] of [Y]
   Files Created/Modified: [List]
   Tests Status: [Passing/Failing]
   
   Next Steps:
   1. Review implementation changes
   2. Required: /story-validate (comprehensive validation)
   3. If validation fails: Fix issues and re-run /story-implement
   4. If validation passes: Ready for PR/merge
   
   Note: /story-validate will check:
   - Requirements traceability (all FRs implemented)
   - Test results (all tests passing)
   - Performance targets (if specified)
   - Constitution compliance
   - Generate validation-report.md
   ```

Note: This command assumes a complete task breakdown exists in tasks.md. If tasks are incomplete or missing, suggest running `/story-tasks` first to regenerate the task list.
