name: story-plan
description: Load after spec.md (and optional clarify/outline/scan) to produce plan.md with the technical design, data model, contracts, and test strategy. Required before story-tasks. Use when user says 'plan this story', 'how should we build this?', or moves from spec to planning. FIRST ACTION after loading: read template at .speck/templates/story/plan-template.md before any context loading or artifact generation. Use when this capability is needed.

The user input to you can be provided directly by the agent or as a command argument - you **MUST** consider it before proceeding with the prompt (if not empty).

User input:

$ARGUMENTS

Given the implementation details provided as an argument, do this:

## ⚠️ Step 0: Read Template First

**Before any other action** — read this template now using the Read tool:
```
.speck/templates/story/plan-template.md
```
The template defines required sections and formatting for `plan.md`. Reading it first tells you what to extract from spec.md and what the research and design phases need to produce. Generating `plan.md` from memory without reading this template produces structurally incorrect output.

**Checkpoint**: After reading, note the top-level sections from the template. Then continue to Step 1.

**Research Approach**: Uses just-in-time research pattern (`.cursor/skills/just-in-time-research/SKILL.md`) for implementation patterns, code examples, and API usage

## Subagent Parallelization

This command benefits from parallel execution:

**Context Loading** - Load multiple docs in parallel:
```
├── [Parallel] Load project constitution.md (specs/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/constitution.md)
├── [Parallel] Load epic constitution.md ({EPIC_DIR}/constitution.md if present)
├── [Parallel] Load domain-model.md
├── [Parallel] Load ux-strategy.md
├── [Parallel] Load design-system.md
├── [Parallel] Load codebase-scan-*.md (all scans)
└── [Continue] with all context loaded
```

**Research Phase** - Spawn parallel speck-researcher:
```
├── [Parallel] speck-researcher: "API usage for [library]"
├── [Parallel] speck-researcher: "Testing patterns for [functionality]"
├── [Parallel] speck-researcher: "Edge cases for [scenario]"
└── [Wait] → Embed findings in plan
```

**Speedup**: 4-5x compared to sequential execution.

---

1. Locate the active story directory (STORY_DIR):
   - Preferred: user is already in the story directory (or a subfolder like `contracts/`)
   - Determine STORY_DIR by walking up from current directory until you find `spec.md`
   - If no `spec.md` found: instruct user to `cd` into the story directory or run `/speck` to route
   - Define:
     - SPEC_PATH = `{STORY_DIR}/spec.md`
     - PLAN_PATH = `{STORY_DIR}/plan.md`

   Clarification gate (reduce rework):
   - Inspect SPEC_PATH for unresolved `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: …]` markers or obvious ambiguities.
   - If unresolved markers remain and user did not explicitly override, PAUSE and instruct them to run `/story-clarify` first.

2. **Architecture Decision Gate** (From OpenSpec: Only create architecture/design docs when needed):

   Check if this story needs architecture documentation:
   
   **Create architecture/design artifacts if ANY of**:
   - [ ] Cross-cutting change (affects 2+ services/components/modules)
   - [ ] New architectural pattern being introduced  
   - [ ] New external dependency (API, library, service)
   - [ ] Significant data model (>3 entities or complex relationships)
   - [ ] Security-critical implementation
   - [ ] Performance-critical with specific targets
   - [ ] High technical ambiguity or multiple approach options
   
   **Skip architecture if ALL of**:
   - [x] Single-file implementation
   - [x] Follows existing patterns from codebase-scan
   - [x] Clear how to implement
   - [x] Standard operations (CRUD, form, component)
   
   If criteria met for architecture:
   - Create comprehensive plan.md with architecture section
   - Consider running `/story-outline` for research if ambiguity high
   
   If criteria NOT met:
   - Create minimal plan.md (just data-model, contracts, quickstart)
   - Skip detailed architecture discussion
   - Let design emerge during implementation
   
   Default to minimal unless evidence shows architecture needed!

3. **Determine planning mode** (enables new workflow while preserving backward compatibility):
   
   **Check for outline.md** at `{STORY_DIR}/outline.md`:
   - **IF outline.md EXISTS**: 
     * Mode: Post-research planning
     * Load outline.md for Technical Context
     * Proceed to step 6 (constitution check), then continue through execution
   - **IF outline.md MISSING**:
     * Mode: Full planning (current behavior)
     * Proceed to step 4 (full planning mode)

4. **Full planning mode** (outline.md missing - current behavior):
   - Read and analyze the feature specification to understand:
     * Feature requirements and user stories
     * Functional and non-functional requirements
     * Success criteria and acceptance criteria
     * Technical constraints or dependencies mentioned
   - Fill Technical Context by analyzing spec (as in plan-template.md step 2)
   - Detect project type from repository structure
   
   **Check for available context**:
  - **Codebase Scan**: Check STORY_DIR for `codebase-scan-*.md`
     * If present: Use existing tech stack, patterns, conventions in Technical Context

5. **Post-research mode** (outline.md exists):
   - Load Technical Context from outline.md (already filled)
   - Note research areas that were flagged
   
   **Load available context artifacts**:
   - **Research Reports**: Check STORY_DIR for `research-report-*.md` files
     * Incorporate recommendations directly into plan.md (research is embedded)
  - **Codebase Scans**: Check STORY_DIR for `codebase-scan-*.md` files
     * Load ALL scan reports (auth, user, design-system, api, data, etc.)
     * Use for consistency in Phase 1 design (data-model, contracts, quickstart)
     * Reference existing patterns, naming conventions, file organization
     * Validate architecture choices against existing tech stack
     * Use existing component patterns when designing new features
     * **Brownfield Adaptation**: Prioritize refactoring existing code over creating new when scan shows overlapping functionality
   
   **IF no research reports found**:
   - Note: "No research reports found. /story-plan will proceed with just-in-time research (current behavior)"
   - This is fine - outline is optional
   
   **IF no codebase scans found**:
   - Note: "No codebase scans found. Planning will proceed without existing pattern references"
   - Still valid for greenfield projects or new domains

6. Load the full constitution chain (both levels, if they exist):
   - **Project**: `specs/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/constitution.md` — universal principles for the project
   - **Epic**: `{EPIC_DIR}/constitution.md` — domain-specific extensions for this epic
   
   The epic constitution inherits from and specializes the project constitution — never contradicts it.
   Apply the combined rule set when making implementation decisions in the plan.
   Epic-level MUST rules take precedence over project defaults within this epic's domain.

7. **Load Project Context Documents** (CRITICAL for consistency):
   
   Determine PROJECT_ID from the story path (e.g., `specs/projects/001-myproject/epics/...`).
   
   **Check for and load project documents**:
   - `specs/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/domain-model.md` → Domain terminology, rules, and principles
   - `specs/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/ux-strategy.md` → UX principles, voice/tone, design vision
   - `specs/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/design-system.md` → Design tokens, components, patterns
   
   **IF domain-model.md exists**:
   - Use glossary terms consistently in data model and contracts
   - Validate data model against domain entities
   - Ensure domain invariants are respected in validation rules
   - Reference domain principles in architectural decisions
   
   **IF ux-strategy.md exists**:
   - Extract UX principles for Constitution Check
   - Note voice/tone guidelines for Brand Voice Copy Bank
   - Apply accessibility standards from the document
   
   **IF design-system.md exists**:
   - Extract design tokens (colors, typography, spacing)
   - Note available components for Design System Component Registry
   - Use token values in any UI-related contract specifications
   
   **IF neither exists AND story has UI requirements**:
   - WARN: "No project design documents found. Consider running `/project-ux` and `/project-design-system` for UI consistency."
   - Proceed but note in plan.md that design decisions may need alignment later

   **Load Epic-Level UX Artifacts** (for UI stories — travel up to the EPIC_DIR):
   - Determine EPIC_DIR by walking up from STORY_DIR (parent of `stories/`)
   - `[EPIC_DIR]/user-journey.md` (from `/epic-journey`) — if present:
     * Identify which journey stage this story implements
     * Note the emotional target and pain points for that stage — these inform
       UX quality requirements and error-handling UX in the plan
   - `[EPIC_DIR]/wireframes.md` (from `/epic-wireframes`) — if present:
     * Identify which screen(s) this story implements
     * Note layout, interaction patterns, and responsive requirements
     * Note in plan.md: "See wireframes.md [screen name] for visual spec — run `/story-ui-spec`
       to translate these wireframes into implementation-ready UI spec before tasks"
   - These are soft loads — do not block planning if absent, but DO use them when present
   
   **UI Component Detection** (for downstream guidance):
   - Check if this story has UI requirements by looking for:
     * Frontend components mentioned in spec.md
     * User interface acceptance criteria
     * Visual/interactive elements described
   - **IF UI requirements detected**: Note in plan.md that `/story-ui-spec` is REQUIRED before `/story-tasks`
   
   **Load Visual Testing Configuration** (if UI detected):
   - Read `specs/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/project.md` frontmatter for `_active_recipe:` field
   - If recipe found, load `.speck/recipes/[recipe-name]/recipe.yaml`
   - Extract `visual_testing:` section:
     ```yaml
     platform: [web|mobile-flutter|mobile-rn|desktop-electron|desktop-tauri|extension]
     strategy: [browser-mcp|golden-tests|maestro|playwright|webdriverio|puppeteer]
     breakpoints: {...}
     devices: {...}
     agent_commands: {...}
     ```
   - Note in plan.md Technical Context:
     ```
     ## Visual Testing
     - Platform: {platform}
     - Strategy: {strategy}
     - Breakpoints/Devices: {from recipe}
     - Pattern Reference: .cursor/skills/visual-testing-web/SKILL.md (or platform-specific skill per pattern_file)
     ```
   - This ensures `/story-validate` has the context it needs

8. Just-In-Time Research (before executing plan template):
   
   **Reference**: Follow the just-in-time research pattern (`.cursor/skills/just-in-time-research/SKILL.md`)
   
   Before making implementation decisions, identify knowledge gaps and conduct research:
   
   ### Research Areas for Story Planning
   
   **1. API Usage & Code Examples**:
   - Decision: How do we use [library/API] for [feature]?
   - Web Search: API documentation, code examples, SDK tutorials
   - Deep Research (rarely needed): Most APIs have good docs
   
   **2. Implementation Patterns**:
   - Decision: What's the best pattern for [functionality]?
   - Web Search: Framework patterns, best practices, code snippets
   - Deep Research (if needed): Complex pattern analysis
   
   **3. Edge Case Handling**:
   - Decision: How should we handle [edge case]?
   - Web Search: Error handling patterns, validation strategies
   - Deep Research (rarely needed): Most patterns are well-documented
   
   **4. Integration Approaches**:
   - Decision: How do we integrate with [service/component]?
   - Web Search: Integration guides, SDK documentation, examples
   - Deep Research (if needed): Complex integration scenarios
   
   **5. Testing Strategies** (tactical):
   - Decision: How do we test [specific functionality]?
   - Web Search: Test patterns for framework, mocking strategies
   - Deep Research (rarely needed): Most testing patterns are standard
   
   ### Execute Research
   
   For each area with knowledge gaps:
   1. **Quick web search** for code examples and patterns
   2. **Generate deep research prompt** if web search insufficient (rare at story level)
   3. **Document findings** - will be embedded in plan.md's research section
   
   If deep research needed (rare), PAUSE and instruct user:
   ```
   ⏸️ Deep Research Needed
   
   Topic: [Research Area]
   Prompt Generated: story-plan-research-prompt-[topic].md
   
   Please:
   1. Review research prompt in story directory
   2. Run in Perplexity/Claude/Gemini/Grok
   3. Save results as: story-plan-research-report-[topic].md
   4. Re-run this command to continue
   ```

9. Execute the implementation plan:
   
   **CRITICAL**: Load and follow the template exactly:
   ```
   .speck/templates/story/plan-template.md
   ```
   
   The template is self-documenting - follow all sections, phases, and guidelines within it.
   Write output to PLAN_PATH. Use codebase-scan-*.md for existing patterns if available.

10. Verify execution completed:
   - Check Progress Tracking shows all phases complete
   - Ensure all required artifacts were generated
   - Confirm no ERROR states in execution

11. Report results with branch name, file paths, and generated artifacts:
   ```
   ✅ Story Technical Plan Complete!
   
   Story: [Name]
   Path: {STORY_DIR}
   
   Generated Artifacts:
   - plan.md (implementation guidance with embedded research)
   - data-model.md (entities and relationships)
   - contracts/ (API specifications)
   - quickstart.md (test scenarios)
   
   Research Integration:
   - Web searches conducted: [X topics]
   - Code examples found: [Y]
   - Research embedded in plan.md
   
   Next Steps:
   1. Review technical design with team
   2. ⚠️ If UI components detected: /story-ui-spec (REQUIRED before tasks)
   3. Required: /story-tasks (generate implementation tasks)
   4. ⚠️ REQUIRED: /story-analyze (quality check before implementation - DO NOT SKIP)
   5. Then: /story-implement (execute the tasks)
   
   Note: /story-tasks will use these artifacts to generate concrete,
   numbered tasks that /story-implement can execute.
   ```

Use absolute paths with the repository root for all file operations to avoid path issues.
