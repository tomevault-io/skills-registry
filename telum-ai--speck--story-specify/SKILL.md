name: story-specify
description: Load when starting a new story — either detailing a placeholder from epic-breakdown, or creating a story from scratch. Use when user says 'let's work on story X', 'specify [feature detail]', or picks up a story from the breakdown. Produces spec.md — required before all other story commands. FIRST ACTION after loading: read template at .speck/templates/story/story-template.md before any Q&A or artifact generation. Use when this capability is needed.

The user input to you can be provided directly by the agent or as a command argument - you **MUST** consider it before proceeding with the prompt (if not empty).

User input:

$ARGUMENTS

The text the user typed after `/story-specify` in the triggering message **is** the story description. Assume you always have it available in this conversation even if `$ARGUMENTS` appears literally below. Do not ask the user to repeat it unless they provided an empty command.

## ⚠️ Step 0: Read Template First

**Before any other action** — read this template now using the Read tool:
```
.speck/templates/story/story-template.md
```
The template defines required sections and formatting for `spec.md`. Reading it first shapes your Q&A — you'll know exactly what information you need to gather. Generating `spec.md` from memory without reading this template produces structurally incorrect output.

**Checkpoint**: After reading, note the top-level sections from the template. Then continue to Step 1.

## Play Level Check

Read `.speck/project.json` (if it exists) for `play_level`.

- **Sprint**: Sprint projects don't use stories — just ship it. Tell the user: "Sprint projects skip formal story specs. Just build what's in your PRD.md Build Plan. If the project is growing, run `/project-promote` to move to Build level."
- **Build**: Proceed with a lightweight spec (spec.md + plan.md only). Skip tasks.md, validation-report.md, and story-retro.md from next-step recommendations unless the user asks.
- **Platform**: Full story workflow, proceed normally below.

## Context-Aware Story Creation

Since commands can't rely on directory context, establish hierarchy:

### Step 1: Context Discovery

Parse arguments for context:
- "project:XXX epic:YYY [story description]"
- "in epic YYY of project XXX"
- "for [epic name] in [project name]"

If context missing, ask progressively:
1. "Which project is this story for?"
2. "Which epic does this story belong to?"
3. "What's the story description?"

List available options:
```bash
# List projects
find specs/projects -name "project.md" -exec dirname {} \; | xargs -I {} basename {}

# List epics for selected project
ls specs/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/epics/
```

### Step 2: Detect Placeholder Spec (From Epic Breakdown)

Check if a `spec.md` already exists for this story (created as a placeholder by `/epic-breakdown`):

```bash
SPEC=$(ls -1 specs/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/epics/[EPIC_ID]/stories/[STORY_ID]-*/spec.md 2>/dev/null | head -1 || true)
```

**If `spec.md` exists, check its lifecycle state**:
- Read the `**Current State**` line in the file
- If state is `Draft (Placeholder)` or `Draft`:
  - This is a `/epic-breakdown` placeholder — proceed with the enhance flow below
  - Display to user: "Found a draft placeholder spec from epic breakdown. I'll fill it in."
  - **Preserve the YAML frontmatter** (especially `depends_on` and `blocks`)
  - Validate and enhance through interactive Q&A (Steps 4-8)
  - Save the completed version back to the same `spec.md`
  - Update lifecycle state to `Specified`
- If state is already `Specified`:
  - Warn: "This story's spec.md already shows 'Specified' — `/story-specify` appears to have already run. Do you want to re-specify or refine?"
  - Wait for user confirmation before overwriting

**CRITICAL**: The `depends_on` field in the YAML frontmatter is read by the orchestrator to determine story blocking. Always preserve it.

**If no spec.md exists**: Continue with normal interactive specification flow (create from scratch).


### Step 3: Pre-Validation Checklist (Prevent Duplication)

Before creating the story, check:

**Duplication Check (Docs/Specs Only)**:
- [ ] Check if similar story already exists in this epic
  - Search epic-breakdown.md for similar story names/descriptions
  - Review existing story specs in `stories/` directory
  - If similar exists: Suggest updating existing vs creating new
  
- [ ] Check if this belongs at story level
  - Is it small enough for a story? (5-minute explainability)
  - Or should it be an epic? (if >10 stories or major feature)
  
- [ ] Review epic scope alignment
  - Load epic.md to understand epic goals
  - Validate story aligns with epic scope
  - If misaligned: Suggest different epic or epic scope expansion

**Clarify if Ambiguous**:
- [ ] If request is ambiguous: Ask 1-2 clarifying questions before scaffolding
- [ ] Verify user intent before creating spec

**Note**: Only check specs/docs for duplication, not implementation code.

### Step 4: Load Context Documents

Load project-level documents for consistency:
```
LOAD (if exists):
- specs/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/domain-model.md → Domain terminology and rules
- specs/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/ux-strategy.md → UX principles and voice
- specs/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/design-system.md → UI components and tokens
```

**Domain Model Usage**:
- Use glossary terms from domain-model.md in story descriptions
- Respect domain invariants in acceptance criteria
- Reference domain entities for data requirements

### Step 5: Story Validation

Validate story fits epic scope:
- Load epic spec: `specs/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/epics/[EPIC_ID]/epic.md`
- Validate story aligns with epic goals
- If duplication found: "Similar story exists: [name]. Should we update that instead?"

If mismatch: "This story seems outside the epic scope. Would you like to:
1. Create it in a different epic?
2. Expand the current epic scope?
3. Create a new epic for this?"

### Step 6: Interactive Story Development

If minimal description (or upgrading from draft), gather/validate details:

**If upgrading from a Draft placeholder spec.md**:
- Show draft content to user
- Ask: "Does this draft capture your intent? What would you change?"
- Focus on gaps and refinements rather than starting from scratch

**If starting fresh**, gather details:

**Story Essentials:**
1. "As a [who], I want to [what], so that [why]"
2. "What triggers this story?"
3. "What indicates completion?"

**Acceptance Criteria:**
4. "What are the must-have requirements?"
5. "Any specific constraints?"
6. "How will we test this?"

**Technical Considerations:**
7. "Frontend, backend, or both?"
8. "Any API changes needed?"
9. "Database impacts?"

### Step 7: Create Story Structure

Create directly in the **current hierarchical structure** (if not already created by epic-breakdown):
```bash
# Generate story ID and create directory (skip if already exists from epic-breakdown)
mkdir -p specs/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/epics/[EPIC_ID]/stories/[STORY_ID]-[story-name]
```

Note: Speck stories live in the hierarchical structure under:
`specs/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/epics/[EPIC_ID]/stories/[STORY_ID]-[story-name]/`

### Step 8: Story Specification

**CRITICAL**: Load and follow the template exactly:
```
.speck/templates/story/story-template.md
```

The template is self-documenting - follow all sections and guidelines within it.

**Output**: Save as `spec.md` with lifecycle state updated to `Specified`.

**Lifecycle state** — always set in the saved `spec.md`:
- `**Current State**: Specified`
- Checkboxes:
  ```
  - [x] **Draft** - Placeholder spec.md created by `/epic-breakdown` (check if was a draft)
  - [x] **Specified** - spec.md completed by `/story-specify`
  ```
  (If the spec was previously a Draft placeholder, check both boxes to show full progression.
  If created fresh from scratch, only the Specified box is checked.)

### Step 9: Apply 10-Minute Understandability Rule

Before finalizing, validate story scope:

**5-Minute Test**: Can you explain this story to a new teammate in <5 minutes?
- What it does
- Why it's needed  
- How success is measured

**If NO** → Story is too complex, split it!

**Check for "AND"**: Does the story description need "AND"?
- Example: "Add login form AND registration flow"
- Action: Split into separate stories

**Complexity Indicators**:
- Needs >3 acceptance scenarios → Might be multiple stories
- Touches >3 different components → Might be too broad
- Requires extensive context to explain → Simplify or split

If story seems too complex, suggest splitting and ask user approval.

### Step 10: Update Epic Tracking

Add story to epic's story list with status "specified"

### Step 11: Optional Step Evaluation + Guide Next Steps

After saving `spec.md`, scan its content and evaluate each optional step. Output a recommendation table with **specific text or observations from spec.md** that drove each decision — not generic advice.

**Evaluation criteria**:

| Step | 🔴 Required when | ⚠️ Recommended when | ⬜ Skip when |
|------|-----------------|---------------------|------------|
| `/story-clarify` | Acceptance criteria vague or missing; scope boundary unclear; edge cases unaddressed; [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers | Some scenarios lack explicit success criteria | All criteria are specific and testable; scope is unambiguous |
| `/story-outline` | Technology not used elsewhere in project; TBD/unknown sections; multiple competing implementation approaches mentioned | One or two minor unknowns; would benefit from a quick research pass | Implementation path clear; follows well-established project patterns |
| `/story-scan` | Story extends, modifies, or refactors existing code modules; brownfield context | Story touches code that exists but isn't deeply modified | Fully greenfield story with no existing code to understand |
| `/story-ui-spec` | Any mention of: UI, screen, form, modal, component, button, layout, page, design, front-end, UX | Story has minor UI concerns alongside backend work | Pure backend, API-only, or CLI-only story |

**Output format** (fill from actual spec content — no placeholders):

```
## Optional Step Evaluation

| Step | Recommendation | Evidence from spec.md |
|------|---------------|----------------------|
| /story-clarify | ⬜ / ⚠️ / 🔴 | "[specific quote or observation]" |
| /story-outline | ⬜ / ⚠️ / 🔴 | "[specific quote or observation]" |
| /story-scan    | ⬜ / ⚠️ / 🔴 | "[specific quote or observation]" |
| /story-ui-spec | ⬜ / 🔴       | "[specific quote or observation]" |

Recommended path to /story-plan:
→ [only Required/Recommended steps in flow order] → /story-plan → [/story-ui-spec if needed] → /story-tasks → /story-analyze → /story-implement

Shall I proceed with [first recommended step]?
```

**Flow order**: `/story-clarify` → `/story-outline` → `/story-scan` → `/story-plan` → `/story-ui-spec` → `/story-tasks` → `/story-analyze` → `/story-implement`

**If `/story-ui-spec` is 🔴 Required**, note it clearly after `/story-plan`:
> "This story has UI components — run `/story-ui-spec` after `/story-plan` and before `/story-tasks`. Skipping it means the implementation will guess at layout, states, and design token usage."

Note: If your team uses a branch-based workflow, create a branch for this story (e.g. `[STORY_ID]-[story-name]`) before implementation.
