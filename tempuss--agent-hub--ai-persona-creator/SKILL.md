## 📋 Step-by-Step Execution

### Phase 1: Research (30-45 min)

**STEP 1 → Run Web Search Strategy**

Execute this prompt:
```
Run comprehensive web research for [Role] persona:

Search Categories (8-12 queries each):
1. Job Understanding: "[Role] responsibilities", "[Role] daily challenges"
2. Decision Psychology: "[Role] decision-making process", "how [Role] evaluates [Project type]"
3. Org Culture: "[Role] reporting structure", "[Role] KPIs and metrics"
4. Field Testimony: "[Role] forum discussions", "[Role] Reddit/community quotes"

Save all results to: research/[role-name]/web-search-results.md
```

**STEP 2 → Synthesize Research**

Execute this prompt:
```
Synthesize web research with cross-verification:

Requirements:
- Minimum 3 independent sources per insight
- 5+ direct practitioner quotes required
- Cross-verify conflicting information
- Calculate confidence levels (%)

Save findings to: research/[role-name]/research-findings.md
```

---

### Phase 2: Analysis (20-30 min)

**STEP 3 → Apply 4-Layer Analysis**

Execute this prompt:
```
Analyze [Role] using Divide & Conquer method:

Layer 1 (Surface): What do they say publicly?
Layer 2 (Hidden): What are they really thinking?
Layer 3 (Org Pressure): What organizational forces drive behavior?
Layer 4 (Primal): What evolutionary instincts are triggered?

Use research findings from STEP 2.
```

**STEP 4 → Run 5 Why Technique**

Execute this prompt:
```
Trace [Role]'s behavior to root psychological cause:

Start with: [Observed behavior, e.g., "Rejects cloud proposals"]
Why 1: [First-level reason]
Why 2: [Deeper reason]
Why 3: [Organizational reason]
Why 4: [Psychological reason]
Why 5: [Root evolutionary/primal reason]

Save analysis to psychology profile.
```

---

### Phase 3: Psychology (20 min)

**STEP 5 → Apply 10 Frameworks (Tier 1 Foundation + Core Frameworks)**

Execute this prompt:
```
Apply all 10 psychological frameworks to [Role]:

TIER 1 FOUNDATION (Critical base layer - read first):
- frameworks/08_motivational_psychology.md → SDT, McClelland's needs, goal orientation
- frameworks/09_personality_psychology.md → Big Five/OCEAN, regulatory focus, Type A/B
- frameworks/10_trust_risk_psychology.md → Trust equation, loss aversion, betrayal sensitivity

Then apply CORE FRAMEWORKS with Tier 1 foundation context:
- frameworks/01_kahneman.md → System 1/2, biases (contextualized by personality)
- frameworks/02_cialdini.md → 6 persuasion principles, ranked by motivation profile
- frameworks/03_voss.md → Hidden needs, black swans (aligned with trust baseline)
- frameworks/04_navarro.md → Stress triggers, comfort zones (type A/B based)
- frameworks/05_ariely.md → Irrationality patterns (personality-driven)
- frameworks/06_evolution.md → Primal drives (survival, status, tribal)
- frameworks/07_organization.md → Power structure, stakeholders

Integration approach:
- First establish WHO they are (Personality), WHAT drives them (Motivation), SAFETY needs (Trust)
- Then apply remaining frameworks contextualized by Tier 1 foundation
- Use frameworks/00_integration.md for weighted importance and integration logic

Save to: research/[role-name]/psychology-profile.md
```

**STEP 6 → Create Comprehensive Profile**

Execute this prompt:
```
Generate comprehensive profile with Tier 1 foundation + analysis:

TIER 1 FOUNDATION (WHO they are fundamentally):
- Personality (Big Five): Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism
- Motivation (McClelland): Achievement (nAch), Power (nPow), Affiliation (nAff)
- Trust Baseline: Current trust level, credibility, reliability, intimacy, self-orientation

Core Fears (Top 3 with % confidence, grounded in Tier 1):
1. [Fear] (X%) - Evidence: "[Quote]" (Source) - Tier 1 drivers: [personality/motivation/trust factors]
2. [Fear] (Y%) - Evidence: "[Quote]" (Source)
3. [Fear] (Z%) - Evidence: "[Quote]" (Source)

Core Motivations (Top 3 with % confidence, aligned with motivation profile):
1. [Motivation] (X%) - Evidence + Implication
2. [Motivation] (Y%) - Evidence + Implication
3. [Motivation] (Z%) - Evidence + Implication

Decision Style Prediction (contextualized by personality):
- System 1 (Emotion): X%
- System 2 (Logic): Y%
- Primary bias: [Bias name]
- Personality drivers: [How Big Five and regulatory focus shape decision-making]

Top 3 Persuasion Levers (ranked by motivation + personality fit):
1. [Cialdini principle] (X%) - Why effective for [personality/motivation profile]
2. [Cialdini principle] (Y%) - Why effective for this role
3. [Cialdini principle] (Z%) - Why effective for this role
```

### Phase 4: Generation (10-15 min)

**STEP 7 → Generate Persona Prompt**

Execute this prompt:
```
Create complete persona prompt using template:

Read template: templates/persona-prompt.md

Fill in all sections:
- Background (with past trauma)
- Psychological profile (all 7 frameworks)
- Feedback generation framework (3 steps)
- Red flag detection (4 categories)
- Research sources (all citations)

Save to: research/[role-name]/persona-prompt.md
```

**STEP 8 → Self-Refine (3 Rounds)**

Execute this prompt:
```
Self-refine persona through 3 rounds:

Round 1 - Evidence Check:
[ ] 3+ sources per major claim?
[ ] 5+ field testimonials?
[ ] All 10 frameworks applied (Tier 1 + 7 core)?
[ ] Tier 1 foundation explicitly established (personality/motivation/trust)?

Round 2 - Quality Rubric (50 points):
[ ] Research quality (10 pts)
[ ] Analysis depth (10 pts)
[ ] Tier 1 foundation integration (5 pts) - NEW
[ ] Psychological insight (15 pts) - includes Tier 1 contextualization
[ ] Actionability (10 pts) - aligned with psychological profile
[ ] Citations (5 pts)

Round 3 - Final Polish:
[ ] Confidence levels accurate?
[ ] Tier 1 foundation (personality/motivation/trust) clearly articulated?
[ ] Framework integration shows how Tier 1 shapes other frameworks?
[ ] Tactical applications clear and grounded in psychology?
[ ] Alternative solutions provided?

Target: 45+/50 points (90%+) with full Tier 1 foundation integration
