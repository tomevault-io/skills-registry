# Web Research with Sources

## When to Use

Claude should automatically activate this skill when detecting:

**Research requests**:
- "research", "investigate", "find information about"
- "search for", "look up", "what's the latest on"
- "find case studies", "industry trends", "market analysis"

**Comparison requests**:
- "compare technologies", "benchmark", "alternatives to"
- "competitor analysis", "market landscape"
- "find references", "best practices"

**Proposal preparation**:
- "background research", "market data", "industry statistics"
- "credible sources for", "evidence that"

## Quick Reference

### 4-Step Research Process

| Step | Action | Output |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1. Design Queries | Extract keywords → Create 3-5 search queries | Search query list |
| 2. Execute Research | WebSearch → Filter by credibility → WebFetch details | Raw findings |
| 3. Document Sources | Summarize + Cite source + Include URL | Structured notes |
| 4. Create Document | Use standard template → Add insights | Final report |

### Credibility Criteria

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: For detailed credibility assessment, ALWAYS refer to **SOURCE-CREDIBILITY-GUIDE.md**

| Level | Source Type | Examples | Usage |
|-------|------------|----------|-------|
| ✅ Tier 1 (90-100%) | Official/Academic | Government, .edu, journals | Primary sources only |
| ✅ Tier 2 (70-90%) | Expert/Media | Forbes, HBR, McKinsey | Industry trends |
| ⚠️ Tier 3 (50-70%) | Community | Stack Overflow, Reddit | Cross-verify required |
| ❌ Tier 4 (30-50%) | Unknown/Anonymous | No authorship | Avoid or re-verify |

**Full Credibility Guide**: See `SOURCE-CREDIBILITY-GUIDE.md` for:
- 4-Tier credibility classification (90-100%, 70-90%, 50-70%, 30-50%)
- Research purpose-based source selection strategies (technical implementation, troubleshooting, trends, regulatory, ideation)
- Information verification checklists (basic + cross-verification)
- Real-world scenario applications (Django, pharmaceutical, AWS, troubleshooting)

## Core Process

### STEP 0: Analyze Request & Select Source Strategy

**Goal**: Understand research intent and select optimal source types before searching

**Process**:
```
User request → Decompose query → Identify research intent → Map to source types → Select search strategy
```

**Analysis Framework**:
```yaml
1. Request Decomposition:
   - What: Core research subject (company? market? technology? statistics?)
   - Why: Research purpose (investment? proposal? benchmarking? compliance?)
   - Depth: Required information depth (overview? detailed? comprehensive?)
   - Scope: Geographic/industry/timeframe scope

2. Intent Classification:
   by_category:
     - Technical Implementation: Official docs + technical communities
     - Market Research: Industry reports + news + analyst insights
     - Compliance/Regulatory: Official government/standards bodies only (Tier 1)

---

### STEP 1: Design Search Queries

**Goal**: Create targeted queries that find credible, recent information

**Process**:
```
Selected sources → Extract keywords → Generate 3-5 queries → Include recency
```

**Example**:
```
Request: "Research manufacturing automation digital transformation success stories"

Selected Sources (from STEP 0):
  - Official documentation (technical guides)
  - Industry reports (market analysis)
  - Web search (case studies)

Queries:
1. "manufacturing AI digital transformation case study 2024"
2. "manufacturing company successful automation implementation"
3. "industrial automation adoption ROI manufacturing"
4. "smart factory platform efficiency improvements"
5. "manufacturing IoT implementation best practices"
```

**Best Practices**:
- Mix English and target language queries
- Combine specific + broad terms
- Add year/recency indicators ("2024", "latest", "recent")
- Include domain-specific terms
- ⭐ **Reference selected sources**: Design queries based on sources selected in STEP 0

### STEP 2: Execute Research

**Goal**: Gather information from credible sources

**Process**:
```
Search for information → Analyze results → Apply credibility filter → Fetch detailed content from specific URLs
```

**Credibility Filter**:
1. **Check source type**: Official > Academic > Media > Blog > Unknown
2. **Verify author credentials**: Named experts, institutions
3. **Check publication date**: Prefer recent (last 2 years)
4. **Cross-reference**: Confirm facts from 2+ sources

### STEP 3: Document with Sources

**Goal**: Record findings with proper attribution

**Format**:
```markdown
## [Topic/Finding]

[Summary or key points - 2-3 sentences]

**Source**: [Document Title] - [Publisher] ([Publication Date])
**Link**: [Full URL]
**Credibility**: [Official/Academic/Media/Expert Blog]
```

**Example**:
```markdown
## Pfizer's AI Drug Discovery Platform

Pfizer partnered with IBM Watson in 2023 to implement AI-powered molecular
screening. The platform reduced preclinical development time by 30% and
increased successful compound identification by 45%.
