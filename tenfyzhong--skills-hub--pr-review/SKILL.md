# PR Review Skill

Review a Pull Request comprehensively by analyzing the diff against the upstream merge base.

## Prerequisites Check (MUST verify first)

Before proceeding, verify:

```bash
# 1. Check if in a git repository
git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree

# 2. Check if gh CLI is available and authenticated
gh auth status
```

If either check fails, STOP and inform the user:

- Not in git repo → "This skill requires a git repository. Please navigate to a git project."
- gh not authenticated → "Please run `gh auth login` first."

## Input

The user provides a PR link in one of these formats:

- Full URL: `https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123`
- Short form (if in repo): `#123` or `123`

## Workflow

### Step 1: Extract PR Information

```bash
# Get comprehensive PR metadata
gh pr view <PR_URL> --json number,title,body,state,author,baseRefName,baseRefOid,headRefName,headRefOid,additions,deletions,changedFiles,files,commits,reviewDecision,reviews,labels,milestone,createdAt,updatedAt

# Get the diff
gh pr diff <PR_URL>

# Get list of changed files
gh pr diff <PR_URL> --name-only

# Get detailed file changes with additions/deletions
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/files
```

### Step 2: Analyze the Merge Base

```bash
# Get base and head commits
BASE_REF=$(gh pr view <PR_URL> --json baseRefOid -q .baseRefOid)
HEAD_REF=$(gh pr view <PR_URL> --json headRefOid -q .headRefOid)

# Find merge base (requires local clone)
git fetch origin $BASE_REF $HEAD_REF 2>/dev/null || true
git merge-base $BASE_REF $HEAD_REF 2>/dev/null || echo $BASE_REF
```

### Step 3: Deep Code Analysis

For each changed file, analyze:

1. **Read the full diff** - Understand every change
2. **Read surrounding context** - Use `gh api` or local files to understand the code being modified
3. **Identify patterns** - What coding patterns does this codebase use?
4. **Check for tests** - Are there corresponding test changes?

## Output Format (MANDATORY)

Your review MUST include ALL of the following sections in this exact order:
