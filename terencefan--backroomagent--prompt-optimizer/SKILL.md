# Prompt Optimizer Skill

This skill helps you analyze, optimize, and improve prompt files for LLM-based agents, with specific support for LangGraph agent architectures.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need to:
- Analyze existing `.prompt` files in `backroom_agent/prompts/` or subagent prompt directories
- Improve prompt clarity, structure, or effectiveness
- Debug agent behavior by examining and refining prompts
- Create new prompts following best practices
- Ensure prompts are properly structured for LangGraph nodes
- Optimize token usage while maintaining instruction quality
- Validate prompt consistency across subagents

## Optimization Framework

### 1. Prompt Analysis Checklist

When analyzing a prompt file, evaluate:

**Clarity & Structure**
- [ ] Clear purpose statement at the beginning
- [ ] Logical section organization with headers
- [ ] Unambiguous instructions (no vague terms)
- [ ] Proper use of formatting (bullets, numbering, code blocks)

**Specificity**
- [ ] Concrete examples provided where needed
- [ ] Clear input/output format specifications
- [ ] Explicit constraints and boundaries
- [ ] Specific terminology definitions

**Completeness**
- [ ] All required context provided
- [ ] Edge cases addressed
- [ ] Error handling instructions included
- [ ] Output format fully specified

**Efficiency**
- [ ] No redundant instructions
- [ ] Concise language without losing clarity
- [ ] Relevant context only (no extraneous information)
- [ ] Optimal length for the task complexity

**Agent-Specific (LangGraph)**
- [ ] State key references are accurate
- [ ] Node-specific instructions are clear
- [ ] Context passing between nodes is explicit
- [ ] Type expectations match protocol definitions

### 2. Common Issues to Fix

**Vague Instructions**
- ❌ "Process the data appropriately"
- ✅ "Extract entity names from the text using Named Entity Recognition, returning a list of strings"

**Missing Context**
- ❌ "Generate a response"
- ✅ "Generate a response in second-person perspective (you/your), incorporating the player's current location from state['current_location']"

**Ambiguous Output Format**
- ❌ "Return the results"
- ✅ "Return a JSON object with keys: 'success' (boolean), 'message' (string), 'data' (list of dicts)"

**Redundant Information**
- ❌ Repeating the same instruction in multiple sections
- ✅ State once clearly, reference if needed later

**Over-complicated Structure**
- ❌ Deeply nested sections with overlapping content
- ✅ Flat, scannable structure with clear headers

### 3. Best Practices

#### Structure Template
```
# [Primary Goal/Purpose]

## Context
[Brief description of when/how this prompt is used]
[Reference to state keys available]

## Input Format
[Exact specification of expected inputs]

## Task Instructions
1. [Step-by-step numbered instructions]
2. [Each step should be actionable]
3. [Use imperative mood: "Extract", "Generate", "Return"]

## Output Format
[Exact specification with examples]

## Constraints
- [Explicit limitations]
- [What NOT to do]

## Examples
### Example 1: [Scenario]
Input: ...
Output: ...

### Example 2: [Edge Case]
Input: ...
Output: ...
```

#### Language Guidelines
- **Use imperative mood**: "Extract entities" not "You should extract entities"
- **Be specific**: "Return 3-5 suggestions" not "Return some suggestions"
- **Avoid hedge words**: "might", "could", "possibly", "maybe"
- **Use consistent terminology**: Define terms once, use them consistently
- **Provide examples**: Show, don't just tell

#### State Key References (for LangGraph agents)
When referencing state keys in prompts:
- Use exact key names from `state.py` files
- Include type information: `state['player_inventory'] (List[Item])`
- Note if keys might be None/empty: `state['active_events'] (List[Event], may be empty)`
- Group references by the node that produces them

### 4. Optimization Process

**Step 1: Understand the Node's Role**
- What is the node's single responsibility?
- What state does it read?
- What state does it produce?
- How does it fit in the graph flow?

**Step 2: Analyze Current Prompt**
- Run through the analysis checklist above
- Identify specific issues using the common issues list
- Note token count and complexity

**Step 3: Draft Improvements**
- Restructure for clarity using the template
- Simplify language while adding specificity
- Add missing examples or constraints
- Remove redundancy

**Step 4: Validate**
- Check alignment with `state.py` definitions
- Ensure protocol compliance (refer to `PROTOCOL.md`)
- Verify examples are accurate
- Confirm output format matches expected types

**Step 5: Document Changes**
- List what was improved and why
- Note any assumptions or decisions made
- Suggest related prompts to review for consistency

## Working with BackroomAgent Prompts

For the BackroomAgent project specifically:

### Directory Structure
```
backroom_agent/
├── prompts/
│   ├── dm_agent.prompt              # Main DM agent system prompt
│   ├── game_context_to_script.prompt
│   └── init_summary.prompt
└── subagents/
    ├── event/
    │   └── prompts/
    │       ├── analyze.prompt
    │       ├── execute.prompt
    │       └── trigger.prompt
    ├── level/
    │   └── prompts/
    │       ├── analyze.prompt
    │       └── fetch.prompt
    └── suggestion/
        └── prompts/
            ├── analyze.prompt
            └── generate.prompt
```

### Protocol Alignment
Always cross-reference prompts with:
- `PROTOCOL.md` - Source of truth for data structures
- `backroom_agent/protocol.py` - Pydantic models
- `backroom_agent/state.py` - Main agent state
- `backroom_agent/subagents/*/state.py` - Subagent states

### Consistency Rules
- All prompts should use consistent terminology from the protocol
- Item/Entity references should align with the "lists of strings" pattern
- Event triggers should reference the event schema structure
- Level data should match the Go agent's output structure

## Example Optimization

See [example-optimization.md](./example-optimization.md) for a detailed before/after example of optimizing a prompt file.

## Tips

- **Test prompts**: Use `scripts/run_*.py` to test agent behavior after changes
- **Version control**: Keep the original prompt commented out temporarily
- **Incremental changes**: Optimize one section at a time and test
- **Context awareness**: Consider what the model has already seen before this prompt
- **Token efficiency**: Aim for 20-30% reduction without losing clarity
- **Readability**: A human should be able to understand the prompt without context
