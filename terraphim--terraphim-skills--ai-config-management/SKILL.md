# AI-Enabled Configuration Management Specification

## Workflow

Producing an AI-enabled CM specification follows this sequence:

1. **Scope the system** -- Identify operational context, enterprise constraints, AI maturity level
2. **Define the governance model** -- Authority structure, RACI/RASIC, escalation paths
3. **Specify functional requirements** -- See [functional-requirements.md](references/functional-requirements.md)
4. **Define AI agent architecture** -- See [ai-agents.md](references/ai-agents.md)
5. **Map control surfaces and baselines** -- See [control-surfaces.md](references/control-surfaces.md)
6. **Design drift detection framework** -- See [drift-detection.md](references/drift-detection.md)
7. **Establish metrics and health indicators** -- See [metrics.md](references/metrics.md)
8. **Compose the deliverable** -- See [deliverable-structure.md](references/deliverable-structure.md) for required sections and format

## Core Principles

Treat context as a **controlled architectural variable**, not an ambient condition.

- AI augments human authority; it does not replace it
- Entropy is reduced through semantic baselining, reconciliation protocols, and gated progression
- Progression halts when semantic integrity is violated
- Operational mechanisms, not philosophical descriptions

## Operating Constraints

The CM system addresses environments characterised by:

- Probabilistic AI behaviour with non-deterministic outputs
- Evolving prompts, model versions, and training data
- Shifting domain definitions under commercial pressure
- Artefact proliferation across lifecycle stages
- Multiple stakeholder interpretation layers

Explicit threats the specification must counter:

| Threat | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Context entropy | Semantic baselining + reconciliation |
| Semantic drift | Terminology stability index + drift alerts |
| Unmanaged scope expansion | Baseline freeze + formal change control |
| Informal commitments bypassing governance | Decision container governance + traceability |
| Artefact inconsistency | Cross-artefact consistency engine + contradiction detection |

## Deliverable Structure

The specification output must contain these sections (see [deliverable-structure.md](references/deliverable-structure.md) for full detail):

1. Executive Overview
2. System Architecture (textual description)
3. Formal Requirements (numbered, FR-xxx / NFR-xxx)
4. Workflow Narratives
5. Data Model Schema (conceptual)
6. Governance Matrix (RACI/RASIC)
7. Risk Register
8. Implementation Phases

Use formal systems engineering language. Avoid generic project management phrasing. Align terminology with configuration control, semantic governance, and systems architecture.

## ZDP Integration (Optional)

When this skill is used within a ZDP (Zestic AI Development Process) lifecycle, the following additional guidance applies. **This section can be ignored for standalone usage.**

### ZDP Context

AI-enabled CM specification maps to the ZDP **Design** stage as a governance artefact produced alongside the Architecture Document. The CM specification's lifecycle stages align directly with ZDP's 6D model (Discovery through Drive). CM gate definitions (FR-C01-C05) should reference ZDP gate types (PFA, LCO, LCA, IOC, FOC, CLR) when producing specifications for ZDP-governed programs.

### Additional Guidance

When producing CM specifications within a ZDP lifecycle:
- Map CM control surface baselines (control-surfaces.md) to ZDP stage-gate boundaries
- Reference ZDP artefact types in the artefact classification schema (FR-B01): PVVH, business scenarios, domain model, design brief, prompt specs align to control surfaces 1-10
- Integrate epistemic status classification from perspective-investigation into gate readiness assessments (FR-C01-C04): gate checklist items should carry Known/Sufficient, Partially Known, Contested, Underdetermined, or Out-of-Scope status
- Reference the Responsible AI Risk Register (from `/responsible-ai`) as input to Risk Register section (Section 7 of deliverable)
- Align drift monitoring categories (drift-detection.md) with ZDP Drive stage monitoring requirements

### Cross-References

If available, coordinate outputs with:
- `/architecture` -- CM specification complements the Architecture Document
- `/responsible-ai` -- AI-specific risks feed into CM risk register
- `/perspective-investigation` -- epistemic status classification for gate items
- `/mlops-monitoring` -- operational drift monitoring complements CM drift specification
- `/requirements-traceability` -- CM traceability requirements (FR-H) align with traceability matrix production

## Reference Navigation

| Need | Reference File |
|------|---------------|
| Functional capabilities (A through I) | [functional-requirements.md](references/functional-requirements.md) |
| AI agent roles, inputs, outputs, authority | [ai-agents.md](references/ai-agents.md) |
| Control surfaces, baselines, freeze logic | [control-surfaces.md](references/control-surfaces.md) |
| Drift detection framework | [drift-detection.md](references/drift-detection.md) |
| Metrics and health indicators | [metrics.md](references/metrics.md) |
| Full deliverable structure and format | [deliverable-structure.md](references/deliverable-structure.md) |
| Governance templates (RACI, risk register) | [governance-templates.md](references/governance-templates.md) |

Load only the reference files relevant to the current task. For a full specification, read all. For targeted work (e.g., only drift detection), read only the applicable file.
