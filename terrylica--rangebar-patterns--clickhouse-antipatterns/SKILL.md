## Critical Rules (Never Violate)

### 1. Window-Based Forward Arrays (NOT Self-Join)

```sql
-- CORRECT: Pre-compute forward arrays as window functions in base_bars (11s, 1.5 GB)
base_bars AS (
    SELECT *,
        arraySlice(groupArray(high) OVER (
            ORDER BY close_time_ms ROWS BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND 101 FOLLOWING
        ), 2, 101) AS fwd_highs,
        arraySlice(groupArray(low) OVER (
            ORDER BY close_time_ms ROWS BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND 101 FOLLOWING
        ), 2, 101) AS fwd_lows,
        -- same for fwd_opens, fwd_closes
    FROM open_deviation_bars WHERE ...
)
-- Then carry fwd_* arrays through CTEs, no self-join needed

-- WRONG: Self-join for forward arrays (133s, 165 MB but 11x slower)
forward_arrays AS (
    SELECT s.*, groupArray(b.high) AS fwd_highs ...
    FROM signals s INNER JOIN base_bars b ON b.rn BETWEEN s.rn + 1 AND s.rn + 101
    GROUP BY ...
)
-- The range join ON b.rn BETWEEN s.rn + 1 AND s.rn + 101 is O(N×M) — ClickHouse
-- cannot index into a CTE and does a nested loop scan.
```

**Memory tradeoff**: Window approach uses ~10x more memory (1.5 GB vs 165 MB) because it computes arrays for ALL bars, not just signals. At 16 parallel queries: 1.5 GB × 16 = 24 GB — safe on 61 GB hosts. For memory-constrained hosts, the self-join is acceptable for sparse patterns (<2% signal coverage).

**Gen600 Production Confirmation** (2026-02-11): AP-14 window approach confirmed at scale — 284K+ results collected at 3.2 queries/sec (xargs -P16), 3-5s per query regardless of pattern density (sparse 1.2% to dense 49%), zero errors, memory stable at ~24 GB peak (1.5 GB/query × 16 parallel).

**Historical note**: AP-01 originally recommended self-join over window approach because Gen200 had 1.4M bars × 51 elements = 2.36 GB with the WRONG window frame (`ROWS BETWEEN 1 FOLLOWING AND 51 FOLLOWING` on ALL bars). The CORRECT window approach uses `arraySlice(..., 2, 101)` on `ROWS BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND 101 FOLLOWING` — slicing off the current row. Gen600 benchmarking proved the window approach is 11x faster for dense patterns (36K+ signals) where the self-join becomes the dominant bottleneck.

### 2. Pre-Compute Barrier Prices as Columns

```sql
-- CORRECT: Pre-compute in separate CTE (avoids CH bug #45028)
param_with_prices AS (
    SELECT *, entry_price * (1.0 + tp_mult * 0.025) AS tp_price FROM param_expanded
),
barrier_scan AS (
    SELECT arrayFirstIndex(x -> x >= tp_price, ...) AS raw_tp_bar FROM param_with_prices
)

-- WRONG: Lambda closure over outer column
SELECT arrayFirstIndex(x -> x >= entry_price * (1.0 + tp_mult * 0.025), fwd_highs)
```

### 3. Always Guard arrayFirstIndex with > 0

```sql
-- CORRECT: Explicit 0-not-found guards
CASE
    WHEN raw_sl_bar > 0 AND raw_tp_bar > 0 AND raw_sl_bar <= raw_tp_bar THEN 'SL'
    WHEN raw_sl_bar > 0 AND raw_tp_bar > 0 AND raw_tp_bar < raw_sl_bar THEN 'TP'
    WHEN raw_sl_bar > 0 AND raw_tp_bar = 0 THEN 'SL'
    WHEN raw_tp_bar > 0 AND raw_sl_bar = 0 THEN 'TP'
    WHEN window_bars >= max_bars THEN 'TIME'
    ELSE 'INCOMPLETE'
END

-- WRONG: No guard (0 < any positive = always true)
CASE WHEN raw_tp_bar <= raw_sl_bar THEN 'TP' ELSE 'SL' END
```

### 4. leadInFrame Requires UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING

```sql
-- CORRECT: Explicit frame includes next row
leadInFrame(open, 1) OVER (
    ORDER BY close_time_ms
    ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
) AS entry_price

-- WRONG: Default frame excludes next row, returns NULL
leadInFrame(open, 1) OVER (ORDER BY close_time_ms) AS entry_price
```

### 5. Threshold-Relative Parameters

```sql
-- CORRECT: Multipliers scale with threshold
entry_price * (1.0 + tp_mult * 0.025) AS tp_price  -- @250dbps
entry_price * (1.0 + tp_mult * 0.05)  AS tp_price  -- @500dbps

-- WRONG: Absolute percentages (don't scale)
entry_price * (1.0 + 0.01) AS tp_price  -- Same 1% regardless of threshold
```

### 6. NEVER Expanding Window — Always Rolling 1000-Bar

```sql
-- CORRECT: Rolling 1000-bar window
quantileExactExclusive(0.95)(trade_intensity) OVER (
    ORDER BY close_time_ms
    ROWS BETWEEN 999 PRECEDING AND 1 PRECEDING
) AS ti_p95_rolling

-- WRONG: Expanding window (inflates early-data quality, produces false-positive Kelly)
quantileExactExclusive(0.95)(trade_intensity) OVER (
    ORDER BY close_time_ms
    ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND 1 PRECEDING
) AS ti_p95_expanding
```

## Post-Change Checklist

After modifying ANY Gen200+ SQL file:

- [ ] Forward arrays use window-based approach in base_bars (NOT self-join) — see AP-14 / Critical Rule #1
- [ ] tp_price/sl_price pre-computed as columns (not in lambda)
- [ ] All arrayFirstIndex comparisons have `> 0` guards
- [ ] leadInFrame uses `ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING`
- [ ] Parameters use threshold-relative multipliers
- [ ] **ALL quantiles use rolling 1000-bar window (`ROWS BETWEEN 999 PRECEDING AND 1 PRECEDING`), NEVER expanding (`UNBOUNDED PRECEDING`)**
- [ ] Warmup guard `rn > 1000` present for rolling window stability
- [ ] SL exit price uses `least(open, sl_price)` for gap-down
- [ ] TP exit price is exactly `tp_price` (limit fill)
- [ ] Same-bar TP+SL: SL wins (raw_sl_bar <= raw_tp_bar)
- [ ] arraySlice applied before arrayFirstIndex search
- [ ] Query completes < 10s on any pattern density (AP-14 window approach)
- [ ] `lagInFrame` direction lags are correct — current bar uses `direction` directly, not `lagInFrame(direction, 1)` (AP-15)
- [ ] backtesting.py oracle uses `hedging=True, exclusive_orders=False` for multi-position SQL match (AP-16)
- [ ] Derived artifacts (Parquet chunks, combo JSONs) include ALL category dimensions in filename — `_chunk_{direction}_{fmt}_{sym}_{thr}` not `_chunk_{fmt}_{sym}_{thr}` (INV-9)
