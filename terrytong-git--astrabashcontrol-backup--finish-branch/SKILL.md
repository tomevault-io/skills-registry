# Finish Branch - Post-Merge Cleanup

## Overview

This skill handles the cleanup after a PR has been merged. It will:
1. Verify the PR is actually merged (REQUIRED before any cleanup)
2. Delete the git worktree
3. Delete the local and remote branch
4. Close any related GitHub issues

**IMPORTANT**: This skill will NOT delete anything unless the PR is confirmed merged.

## Usage

Invoke this skill when:
- Your PR has been merged and you want to clean up
- You finished an experiment and the results are merged to main
- You need to remove an old worktree after successful merge

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify the Branch and PR

First, ask the user which branch to clean up:

```
Which branch would you like to finish?

Please provide:
1. Branch name (e.g., exp/cot-faithfulness or feature/add-dark-mode)
2. PR number (if known) or I can find it
```

### Step 2: Verify PR is Merged

**CRITICAL**: Before any deletion, verify the PR is merged:

```bash
# Find PR for the branch
gh pr list --head {branch-name} --state merged

# Or check specific PR
gh pr view {pr-number} --json state,mergedAt

# The PR MUST have state: "MERGED" before proceeding
```

If the PR is NOT merged:
```
## Cannot Proceed

The PR for branch '{branch-name}' is not yet merged.
Current state: {state}

Options:
1. Wait for the PR to be merged, then run /finish-branch again
2. Merge the PR now (if you have permissions)
3. Cancel cleanup

What would you like to do?
```

### Step 3: Find Related Issues

```bash
# Get the PR body and look for issue references
gh pr view {pr-number} --json body,closingIssuesReferences

# Common patterns to find:
# - "Closes #123"
# - "Fixes #123"
# - "Resolves #123"
# - Issue links in PR body
```

### Step 4: Delete Worktree (if exists)

```bash
# List worktrees to find the one for this branch
git worktree list

# Remove the worktree
# The worktree path is usually ../worktree-{name} or ../experiment-{name}
git worktree remove ../worktree-{name}

# If the worktree has uncommitted changes, force removal (after user confirmation)
git worktree remove --force ../worktree-{name}
```

### Step 5: Delete Local and Remote Branch

```bash
# Delete local branch
git branch -d {branch-name}

# If the branch wasn't fully merged (shouldn't happen if PR is merged)
# Ask user before force deleting
git branch -D {branch-name}

# Delete remote branch
git push origin --delete {branch-name}
```

### Step 6: Close Related Issues

```bash
# Close each related issue
gh issue close {issue-number} --comment "Closed via merged PR #{pr-number}"
```

### Step 7: Report Results

```
## Branch Cleanup Complete

**Branch**: {branch-name}
**PR**: #{pr-number} (merged at {merged-at})

### Cleanup Actions
- [x] PR verified as merged
- [x] Worktree removed: ../worktree-{name}
- [x] Local branch deleted: {branch-name}
- [x] Remote branch deleted: origin/{branch-name}
- [x] Related issues closed: #{issue-1}, #{issue-2}

### Notes
{any-warnings-or-notes}
```

## Error Handling

### PR Not Found
```
Could not find a PR for branch '{branch-name}'.

Options:
1. Provide the PR number manually
2. Check if the branch was pushed to remote
3. Cancel cleanup
```

### Worktree Not Found
```
No worktree found for branch '{branch-name}'.
This is fine if you were working in the main repository.

Proceeding with branch deletion...
```

### Branch Has Unmerged Commits
```
WARNING: Branch '{branch-name}' has commits not in the merged PR.

Unmerged commits:
- {commit-hash}: {commit-message}

Options:
1. Force delete anyway (lose these commits)
2. Cherry-pick commits to a new branch first
3. Cancel cleanup
```

### Issue Close Failed
```
Could not close issue #{issue-number}: {error}

This might be because:
- Issue doesn't exist
- Issue is already closed
- Insufficient permissions

Proceeding with other cleanup tasks...
```

## Safety Checks

This skill includes several safety measures:

1. **PR merge verification is mandatory** - Will not proceed without confirmed merge
2. **User confirmation for force operations** - Always asks before force deleting
3. **Unmerged commit detection** - Warns if local branch has extra commits
4. **Detailed reporting** - Shows exactly what was deleted

## Examples

### Basic Usage
```
User: /finish-branch
Assistant: Which branch would you like to finish? Please provide the branch name or PR number.

User: exp/mi-estimation, PR #42
Assistant: Let me verify PR #42 is merged...
[Checks PR status]
PR #42 is merged. Proceeding with cleanup...
[Performs cleanup]
Branch cleanup complete!
```

### With Related Issues
```
User: /finish-branch feature/add-auth
Assistant: Found PR #55 for branch feature/add-auth.
PR is merged (merged 2 hours ago).
Found related issues: #50 (Closes), #51 (Fixes)

Proceeding with cleanup...
- Removed worktree: ../worktree-add-auth
- Deleted branch: feature/add-auth
- Closed issue #50
- Closed issue #51

All done!
```

## Integration with Research Executor

The **research-executor** agent MUST use this skill for cleanup. The workflow is:

1. Research executor creates worktree using **/using-git-worktrees** skill
2. Experiment is implemented with TDD methodology
3. PR is created and submitted for review
4. **ONLY AFTER PR is merged**, invoke `/finish-branch` for cleanup

The research-executor will prompt:
```
Experiment complete and PR merged!
Would you like me to clean up the worktree and branch?
```

Upon confirmation, invoke `/finish-branch` with the experiment branch name.

**Critical Rules:**
- NEVER delete worktrees before PR is merged
- NEVER delete worktrees manually - always use this skill
- This is the ONLY approved cleanup method for experiment branches

This ensures experimental worktrees don't accumulate and the repository stays clean.
