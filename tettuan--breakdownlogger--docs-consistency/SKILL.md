description: Verify and fix documentation to match implementation. Use when updating docs, releasing versions, or when user mentions 'docs consistency', 'docs update', 'docs verify', 'ドキュメント更新', '最新にして', 'docsを直して'. Extracts design intent, investigates implementation, then updates docs accordingly. Use when this capability is needed.

# Docs Consistency

Docs explain implementation; they do not rewrite design. Flow: design intent
(What/Why) → implementation survey (How) → docs update (explanation).

## Phase 1: Extract Design Intent

Read design docs (`docs/internal/`) and write
`tmp/docs-review/{feature}-intent.md` capturing What, Why, constraints, and what
users need to know.

## Phase 2: Survey Implementation

Identify implementation files, public API, defaults, and edge cases. Write
`tmp/docs-review/{feature}-implementation.md`.

## Phase 3: Diff Against Current Docs

Compare intent + implementation memos against current docs. Build a diff table:

| Item               | Design/Implementation   | Current docs | Gap  |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- | ------------ | ---- |
| Install command    | `dx jsr:...`            | Documented   | None |
| 3 output modes     | preserve/flatten/single | Missing      | Add  |
| Default output dir | ./breakdownlogger-docs  | Missing      | Add  |

## Phase 4: Fix Docs

Do not change design docs — only update implementation-facing docs.

| Priority | Target                       |
| -------- | ---------------------------- |
| 1        | README.md                    |
| 2        | README.ja.md (sync required) |
| 3        | docs/guides/                 |
| 4        | --help output                |

Use intent/implementation memos as source material for writing.

### Memo disposition after fix

| Situation                         | Action                              |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Low value (simple fix)            | Delete `tmp/docs-review/`           |
| Useful for PR description         | Quote in PR                         |
| Worth preserving as design record | Promote to `docs/internal/changes/` |

## Phase 5: Format Check

```bash
deno task verify-docs          # all checks
deno task verify-docs readme   # README.md/ja sync
deno task verify-docs manifest # manifest.json version
```

When docs files are added or removed: `deno task generate-docs-manifest`.

## Phase 6: Language

| Pattern   | Language                                     |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `*.md`    | English (required)                           |
| `*.ja.md` | Japanese (optional, not distributed via JSR) |

Japanese-only files: rename to `.ja.md`, create English `.md` translation, then
regenerate manifest.

## Distribution Scope

| Included                                                   | Excluded                                        |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `docs/guides/en/`, `docs/internal/`, top-level `docs/*.md` | `docs/guides/ja/`, `docs/reference/`, `*.ja.md` |

## File Classification

| File type                       | Role                       | Editable?                   |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| docs/internal/                  | Design intent record       | No (read only)              |
| docs/reference/                 | External reference         | No (not distributed)        |
| README.md, docs/guides/, --help | Implementation explanation | Yes                         |
| tmp/docs-review/                | Working memo               | Delete or promote after use |
