# Refactoring

Prove the new path inherits every contract from the old path before deleting it.
If you cannot prove it, do not delete.

## Past Incidents

| Date | What happened                                 | Why                                                          | Impact                            |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| 2/14 | externalState handler became a throw stub     | New path was not implemented when old path was deleted       | completionType functionality lost |
| 2/14 | Deno cache served stale version               | --reload not run, so fixed code was not picked up            | Fix existed but bug reproduced    |
| 2/13 | V1 handler exports removed                    | Adapter not created, old interface compatibility lost        | import errors                     |
| 1/18 | Legacy completionType aliases removed         | Old agent.json configs broken with no migration grace period | Config file incompatibility       |
| 1/9  | Dead code left behind (cli.ts, runner/cli.ts) | Old entry points not cleaned up after migration              | Multiple paths caused confusion   |

## Failure Patterns

| Pattern                                | Why it breaks                                             | Prevention                                               |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Old path deleted + new path incomplete | Contract breaks in the intermediate state                 | List all contracts in Before/After table before deleting |
| Parameter gate declaration missing     | Filter blocks undeclared arguments silently               | Verify declarations at every gate from entry to consumer |
| Build cache inconsistency              | Cache serves old module instead of updated one            | Run --reload or clear cache after every change           |
| Dead code left behind                  | Produces false positives in grep/search, causes confusion | Delete superseded code in the same PR                    |
| Documentation not updated              | Users cannot discover preconditions                       | Grep docs for changed names and update all references    |

## Phase 1: Inventory

Map everything being removed or changed before writing any code.

**1. Removal Inventory** — List what is being removed, who consumes it, and what
parameters it receives.

```markdown
| Item                    | File          | Consumers             | Parameters            |
| ----------------------- | ------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- |
| createCompletionHandler | factory.ts:42 | builder.ts, runner.ts | args.issue, args.repo |
```

**2. Gateway Audit** — Trace every value from entry point to consumer,
identifying filters and gates in between. Confirm the new path passes every
parameter the old path consumed.

```
Entry (CLI) → Filter (run-agent.ts:196) → Runner → Factory → Handler
                 ↑ blocked if not declared in definition.parameters
```

**3. Consumer Audit** — Grep imports and call sites to identify every consumer.
Determine the migration target for each. If any consumer has no migration
target, deletion is not allowed.

## Phase 2: Contract & Verification Design

Define what contracts to preserve and how to prove preservation before writing
any code.

**4. Before/After Table** — List each old-path behavior as a row and describe
how the new path achieves it. Any row with an empty "After" column means the
refactoring is not ready.

```markdown
| Behavior                   | Before                                 | After                                        | Verified |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| args.issue reaches handler | Direct path in createCompletionHandler | Registry + definition.parameters declaration | [ ]      |
```

**5. Verification Design** — For each row in the Before/After table, decide what
to verify, why, and how.

**What (what to protect)**: The input/output and error contracts that callers
depend on. Boundary behavior, not implementation details.

**Why (why verify there)**: Past failures show that breakage occurs at
boundaries, not at the point of change.

| Fragile boundary        | Why it breaks                                 | Example                                                       |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Parameter reachability  | Intermediate filter blocks undeclared args    | --issue lost because definition.parameters lacked declaration |
| Interface compatibility | Old and new API method signatures differ      | V2 refreshState/check vs V1 isComplete                        |
| Export continuity       | Removing re-exports breaks downstream imports | V1 exports bulk deletion                                      |
| Module resolution       | Cache serves old version of the module        | DENO_DIR split across two directories                         |

**How (how to choose the proof method)**: Match proof method to path complexity.
Tests are a means of proof, not a goal.

| Path characteristic                    | Proof method                                  |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Straight line, 1-2 hops                | Code review is sufficient                     |
| Contains branches, filters, or async   | Automated test on boundary input/output pairs |
| Depends on external state (cache, API) | E2E execution through the real environment    |

## Phase 3: Execute

**6.** 1 commit = 1 concern. Separate into: add new path → migrate consumers →
delete old path → update docs.

**7.** Every commit must pass `deno task ci`. If the intermediate state breaks,
the commit granularity is too coarse.

**8.** Delete dead code in the same PR. "Cleanup later" never comes.

## Phase 4: Verify

**9. Cache clear** — On macOS, DENO_DIR can split across `~/.cache/deno` and
`~/Library/Caches/deno`. Clear both.

```bash
deno cache --reload <entry-point>
```

**10. E2E parameter trace** — Confirm changed parameters reach the endpoint by
running the actual command.

**11. Consumer grep** — Ensure zero remaining references.
`grep -r "OldName" --include='*.ts' | grep -v test` must return empty.

**12. Docs grep** — Ensure zero stale references in docs.
`grep -r "OldName" --include='*.md'` must return empty. See `docs-consistency`
skill for full procedure.

| Assume "nobody uses this" without grep    | Show evidence via consumer audit          |
| Combine refactor and feature in one PR    | Separate for bisectability                |
| Fix the throw site                        | Trace where the parameter was lost        |
| Skip cache clear after refactor           | Always --reload after changes             |
