# Workflow

Main Agent acts as conductor: plan, delegate, judge, integrate. Never do
hands-on work yourself.

    A[Plan] --> B[Done Criteria] --> C[Team] --> D[ToDo]
    D --> E[Delegate] --> F[Record] --> G{Next?}
    G -->|Y| E
    G -->|N| H[Done]
```

## Conductor Pattern

Delegate all investigation and implementation to Sub Agents to preserve context
for decision-making.

| Do                                               | Do NOT                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Plan, delegate, judge, integrate                 | Explore files, write code, run tests     |
| Record progress after each ToDo                  | Work on multiple ToDos simultaneously    |
| Launch parallel Sub Agents for independent tasks | Hold context that Sub Agents should hold |

### Delegation criteria

| Condition                                                 | Action   |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Trivial fix (typo, 3 lines) or single known-location edit | Self     |
| Investigation, multi-file change, or insufficient info    | Delegate |

When in doubt, delegate. Conductor loses sight of the goal when immersed in
hands-on work.

### Sub Agent types

| Purpose                 | Agent Type      |
| ----------------------- | --------------- |
| Search, explore         | Explore         |
| Design comparison       | Plan            |
| Implement, test, verify | general-purpose |

### Coordination protocol

| Phase    | Conductor action                                                     |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Launch   | Specify goal, input, expected output, and output path in Task prompt |
| Parallel | Call multiple Task tools in one message for independent tasks        |
| Receive  | Read result, compare against Done Criteria                           |
| Conflict | Judge manual merge when Sub Agents edit the same file                |
| Failure  | Re-launch with revised prompt, or launch additional Sub Agent        |
| Merge    | Record integrated results in progress.md                             |

## Rules

| #  | Rule                                                                                                       |
| -- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1  | Conductor delegates all hands-on work to Sub Agents                                                        |
| 2  | Externalize thinking to `tmp/<task>/` (plan.md, progress.md, analysis.md)                                  |
| 3  | Complete one → record → next. No self-parallelism (Sub Agent parallelism is fine)                          |
| 4  | Decompose Plan into ToDos via TaskCreate                                                                   |
| 5  | Team table in plan.md. First row is always Conductor. 1 role = 1 purpose                                   |
| 6  | Delegate by type: explore=Explore / design=Plan / implement+verify=general-purpose                         |
| 7  | Define Done Criteria first. Incomplete until all items pass                                                |
| 8  | Record to progress.md immediately on completion                                                            |
| 9  | Technical decisions: decide without asking. Policy decisions: present options with recommendation          |
| 10 | Visualize dependencies and ToDo map in analysis.md with Mermaid                                            |
| 11 | Delegate detailed procedures to specialized skills. When direction is unclear, use `thinking-method` skill |
| 12 | Structural code changes (module moves, renames, old path deletions) require `refactoring` skill first      |

## tmp/ structure

```
tmp/<task>/
├── plan.md        # Goal, Done Criteria, Team, Approach, Scope
├── progress.md    # Incremental records
├── analysis.md    # Mermaid diagrams
└── investigation/ # Sub Agent results
```

## Plan template

```markdown
# Plan: <task name>

## Goal

## Done Criteria

- <checkable condition>

## Team

| Role      | Purpose                          | Agent Type | ToDo    |
| --------- | -------------------------------- | ---------- | ------- |
| Conductor | Plan, delegate, judge, integrate | Main Agent | Overall |

## Approach

## Scope

Do: / Do not:
```

## progress.md format

Append after each ToDo completion. Separate What/Why (rationale) from How
(procedure).

```markdown
### T1: <task name>

**What/Why** - <purpose and rationale> **How** - <procedure, tools, output path>
**Result** - [x] YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM <fact>
```

## Question template

```markdown
## Decision: <topic>

| Option            | Summary | Pro | Con |
| ----------------- | ------- | --- | --- |
| A (recommended)   |         |     |     |
| B                 |         |     |     |
| → Proceed with A? |         |     |     |
```
