# Focus.AI Brand System

This skill applies Focus.AI brand guidelines to create consistent, on-brand materials across two sub-brands.

## Required Reading

**IMPORTANT**: Before creating any branded material, you MUST read the appropriate design system files:

### For ALL Brand Work
First, read the shared foundations:
```
Read: ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/THEFOCUS_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md
```

### Then, Based on Context

**For Client Materials** (proposals, case studies, client work, service pages):
```
Read: ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/THEFOCUS_CLIENT_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md
```

**For Labs Materials** (research, experiments, blog posts, open source):
```
Read: ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/THEFOCUS_LABS_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md
```

## Brand Selection Guide

| Context | Brand | Design System File |
|---------|-------|-------------------|
| Client proposals | Client | THEFOCUS_CLIENT_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md |
| Case studies | Client | THEFOCUS_CLIENT_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md |
| Service pages | Client | THEFOCUS_CLIENT_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md |
| Product marketing | Client | THEFOCUS_CLIENT_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md |
| Conference analysis | Labs | THEFOCUS_LABS_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md |
| Research reports | Labs | THEFOCUS_LABS_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md |
| Experiments | Labs | THEFOCUS_LABS_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md |
| Technical blog posts | Labs | THEFOCUS_LABS_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md |
| Open source projects | Labs | THEFOCUS_LABS_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md |

**Rule of thumb**: Client work or selling services → Client brand. Sharing learnings or exploring → Labs brand.

## Quick Difference Summary

| Aspect | Client | Labs |
|--------|--------|------|
| **Aesthetic** | Magazine / editorial | Bell Labs / RAND Corporation |
| **Primary accent** | Petrol `#0e3b46` | Rand-Blue `#0055aa` |
| **Secondary accent** | Vermilion `#c3471d` | Alert-Red `#d93025` |
| **Voice** | Confident, professional, clear | Curious, wry, generous |

## Workflow

1. **Determine brand**: Client work → Client brand. Research/sharing → Labs brand.
2. **Read foundations**: Load `THEFOCUS_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`
3. **Read brand specifics**: Load the appropriate brand file (Client or Labs)
4. **Apply guidelines**: Follow typography, colors, layout, and voice from the loaded files
5. **Verify**: Check against the quality checklist in the design system files

## Commands

### `/report` - Generate Printable Report

Convert a markdown file to a styled HTML report for PDF printing:

```
/report file:./my-document.md style:labs
/report file:./proposal.md style:client
```

- **file**: Path to the markdown file (required)
- **style**: Brand style - `labs` (default) or `client`

The command generates a self-contained HTML file, opens it in your browser, and you can print to PDF with Cmd+P.

## Assets

- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/assets/fonts/` — Font files (use Inter + Courier Prime for new work)
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/assets/examples/` — HTML implementation examples
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/` — HTML report templates (client-report.html, labs-report.html)
