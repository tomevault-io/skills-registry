# App Deployment Skill

You help deploy applications using a git-push-to-deploy workflow.

## Setup

1. Run `bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/check-deps.sh` to verify tools are available.

## How Deployment Works

1. User runs `git push production main`
2. SSH connects to server as `deploy` user
3. SSH forced-command routes to `deployer` script
4. `deployer` creates a bare git repo (first time), receives the push
5. `post-receive` hook checks out code and runs `docker build`
6. `deployer` stops old container and starts new one with Caddy labels
7. Caddy automatically provisions HTTPS and reverse proxies to port 8080

**App requirements:**
- Must have a `Dockerfile` in the project root
- Container must listen on port **8080**

## Scripts

Deployment utilities use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/deploy.sh`:

### Copy env to server
```bash
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/deploy.sh env
```
Copies `.env.production` (preferred) or `.env` to the server and restarts the container.

### Restart container
```bash
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/deploy.sh restart
```

### Force rebuild
```bash
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/deploy.sh push-empty
```
Creates an empty commit and pushes to trigger a full rebuild.

### Show remote info
```bash
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/deploy.sh info
```

## Setting Up a New Deployment

Walk the user through these steps:

1. **Check prerequisites:**
   - Verify `Dockerfile` exists
   - Check the app listens on port 8080

2. **Check for existing remote:** `git remote -v | grep production`

3. **If no production remote, guide setup:**
   a. List servers: `bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/server.sh list`
   b. Discover domains: `bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/dns.sh list-zones`
   c. Pick/create server and choose app name
   d. Add remote: `git remote add production deploy@<server>.<domain>:<appname>.<domain>`
   e. Add DNS: `bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/dns.sh add <appname>.<domain> <server_ip>`
   f. Push: `git push production main`

4. **After deployment:** the app is at `https://<appname>.<domain>` (Caddy handles HTTPS).

## Git Remote Format

```
deploy@<server-hostname>:<site-fqdn>
```

Example: `deploy@web1.example.com:myapp.example.com`

The site FQDN becomes both the Docker container name and the hostname Caddy uses for routing/HTTPS.

## Behavior

- Check for `Dockerfile` before attempting deployment
- When setting up, show the full git remote URL and confirm
- After deployment, tell the user the app URL
- If deployment fails, suggest checking logs: `ssh deploy@<server>` (shows last 20 log entries)
- Warn about sensitive values before copying env files
