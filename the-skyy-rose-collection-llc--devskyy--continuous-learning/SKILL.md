# Continuous Learning

Extract reusable patterns from sessions and save to Serena memory for future reference.

## When This Activates

- `/wordpress-copilot:learn` command
- Stop hook (automatic at session end)
- User asks to "save this pattern" or "remember this"
- After solving unique problems
- Discovering new WordPress patterns

---

## What Gets Extracted

### 1. Error Resolution Patterns

**Example**: CSP blocking 3D CDNs

```markdown
# WordPress.com CSP Blocking External CDNs

**Problem**: Platform-level CSP headers block cdn.babylonjs.com

**Root Cause**: WordPress.com injects CSP at Nginx layer (before PHP)

**Attempted Fixes**:
1. wpcom_csp_allowed_sources filter ❌
2. header() override in theme ❌
3. custom-redirects.php ❌
4. CSP Manager plugin ❌

**Solution**: Self-hosted WordPress for full CSP control

**When to Use**: Any WordPress.com site requiring custom external CDNs
```

### 2. Framework Workarounds

**Example**: Elementor 3D widget integration

```markdown
# Elementor Widget with Three.js

**Context**: Custom Elementor widget loading Three.js scene

**Challenge**: Elementor's rendering lifecycle conflicts with Three.js initialization

**Solution**: Use requestAnimationFrame after Elementor ready event

```php
elementorFrontend.hooks.addAction('frontend/element_ready/widget', function($scope) {
    requestAnimationFrame(() => {
        initThreeJS($scope.find('.canvas')[0]);
    });
});
```

**When to Use**: Any Elementor widget with complex JavaScript initialization
```

### 3. Performance Optimizations

**Example**: WooCommerce query optimization

```markdown
# Optimize WooCommerce Product Queries

**Problem**: Loading 100 products took 3.2s

**Solution**: Only fetch IDs, then selectively load data

```php
// Before: 3.2s
$products = wc_get_products(['limit' => 100]);

// After: 0.8s
$ids = wc_get_products(['limit' => 100, 'return' => 'ids']);
```

**Impact**: 75% faster (3.2s → 0.8s)

**When to Use**: Any large WooCommerce product queries
```

### 4. Debugging Techniques

**Example**: Tracing WordPress.com CSP source

```markdown
# Diagnose Platform-Level Header Injection

**Problem**: Can't determine where CSP header originates

**Technique**: Multi-layer diagnostic logging

```bash
# Layer 1: Check headers in response
curl -sI https://site.com/ | grep -i content-security

# Layer 2: Test if headers_list() sees it
<?php var_dump(headers_list()); ?>

# Layer 3: Test custom-redirects.php execution order
<?php error_log('custom-redirects executed'); ?>
```

**Conclusion**: If headers_list() doesn't see it, injected at server level

**When to Use**: Diagnosing any unexplained HTTP headers
```

### 5. Project-Specific Conventions

**Example**: SkyyRose branding patterns

```markdown
# SkyyRose Brand Application

**Primary Color**: #B76E79 (rose gold)
**Tagline**: "Where Love Meets Luxury"
**Typography**: Playfair Display (headings), Inter (body)

**CSS Convention**:
```css
:root {
    --skyy-primary: #B76E79;
    --skyy-transition: cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.46, 0.45, 0.94);
}
```

**Meta Conventions**:
- Collection: _skyyrose_collection (signature, black_rose, love_hurts)
- Featured: _featured (yes/no)

**When to Use**: All SkyyRose theme/plugin development
```

## How It Works

### Automatic Extraction (Stop Hook)

```json
// hooks/hooks.json includes Stop hook
{
  "Stop": [{
    "matcher": "*",
    "hooks": [{
      "type": "prompt",
      "blocking": false,
      "prompt": "Review this session for patterns to extract..."
    }]
  }]
}
```

### Manual Extraction (/learn Command)

```markdown
User: "/wordpress-copilot:learn"

Copilot:
1. Reviews recent conversation
2. Identifies patterns worth saving
3. Formats as markdown skill/reference
4. Saves to Serena memory
5. Reports what was learned
```

---

## Pattern Quality Criteria

Only save patterns that are:

1. **Reusable**: Applies to multiple scenarios
2. **Non-obvious**: Not in standard docs
3. **Tested**: Proven to work
4. **Specific**: Concrete code/steps, not theory
5. **Contextual**: Clear when to use

## Example: Full Pattern Extraction

**Session Context**: User struggled with WordPress.com CSP blocking, tried 5 fixes, discovered platform limitation

**Extracted Pattern**:

```markdown
# WordPress.com Platform CSP Limitation

## Context
WordPress.com Business plan site requiring custom CDNs (cdn.babylonjs.com for 3D viewer)

## Problem
Platform injects Content-Security-Policy headers at Nginx reverse proxy layer.
Theme code cannot override these headers.

## Evidence
```bash
# 1. Curl shows platform CSP
curl -sI https://skyyrose.co/ | grep content-security-policy

# 2. headers_list() in PHP doesn't see it
<?php var_dump(headers_list()); // CSP not in array

# 3. Custom headers get overridden
header('Content-Security-Policy: ...'); // Ignored by platform
```

## Failed Approaches (All 5)
1. **wpcom_csp_allowed_sources filter**: Filter doesn't exist or doesn't apply
2. **header() in theme**: Overridden by platform
3. **Nonce extraction**: Can't extract platform nonce
4. **custom-redirects.php**: Also overridden
5. **CSP Manager plugin**: Uses PHP hooks, same limitation

## Root Cause
Nginx layer injection happens AFTER PHP execution completes.
No PHP code can modify infrastructure-level headers.

## Solutions

### Option A: File Support Ticket (Uncertain)
Request WordPress.com platform team whitelist specific domains.
Success not guaranteed.

### Option B: Migrate to Self-Hosted (Definitive)
- Export site content
- Set up self-hosted WordPress
- Deploy theme with full CSP control
- 2-hour process, $10-25/mo hosting

## When to Use This Pattern
- WordPress.com Business plan
- Custom external CDNs required (3D libraries, specific analytics)
- Platform restrictions blocking features
- Need server-level header control

## Related Patterns
- WordPress.com REST API quirks (index.php?rest_route=)
- WordPress.com SFTP deployment workflow
- Self-hosted migration process
```

---

## When User Requests Learning

1. **Review session**: What problems were solved?
2. **Identify patterns**: Reusable, non-obvious, tested?
3. **Extract structure**: Problem, solution, when to use
4. **Format markdown**: Clear, concise, with code examples
5. **Save to Serena**: Appropriate memory category
6. **Report back**: "Saved pattern: [name] to Serena memory"

---

## Continuous Improvement

As patterns accumulate:
- Skills become more specific
- Fewer "trial and error" attempts
- Faster problem resolution
- Better recommendations

**Goal**: Every unique problem solved should become a reusable pattern for future sessions.
