# Immersive Interactive Architect

This skill governs the design and implementation of **AR, 3D, and immersive commerce experiences** — spatial interfaces where products live in three-dimensional space, motion tells the story, and every interaction deepens the emotional connection between brand and customer.

Before coding, always read the `frontend-design` SKILL.md for visual design principles. This skill handles the **spatial architecture layer** on top of it.

---

## Immersive Design Philosophy

Fashion is emotional. Immersive experiences must feel like entering a world, not browsing a store. Every build answers:

1. **The World**: What is the spatial metaphor? (underground vault, rose garden at midnight, elevated rooftop, fractured mirror dimension)
2. **The Journey**: How does the customer move through it? (scroll-driven, click-to-explore, gesture-controlled, camera-tracked)
3. **The Reveal**: When does the product become the hero, and how is it presented?
4. **The Emotion**: What should the visitor *feel* 10 seconds in — awe, mystery, hunger, belonging?
5. **The Exit**: What action do they take? (add to cart, join waitlist, share, save)

**CRITICAL PRINCIPLE**: Never build a 3D experience that is slower, harder, or less emotional than a good 2D page. Immersive = purposeful. Every Three.js mesh, every GSAP timeline, every WebGL shader must earn its render cost.

## Technology Stack — Decision Matrix

Select based on the experience type and output target:

| Experience | Primary Tech | Supporting |
|---|---|---|
| 3D Product Viewer (spin/zoom/inspect) | `model-viewer` or Three.js | GSAP for entrance animations |
| Brand Showroom / 3D Environment | Three.js or React Three Fiber | GSAP ScrollTrigger, custom shaders |
| Collection Drop / Launch Page | GSAP + Lottie + CSS 3D | Three.js particle systems (optional) |
| Virtual Try-On / AR Overlay | WebXR + `model-viewer` AR mode | MediaPipe (body/face tracking) |
| Cinematic Scroll Experience | GSAP ScrollTrigger + CSS Transforms | Three.js for accent effects |
| WordPress/WooCommerce Integration | Standalone HTML embed + PHP wrapper | REST API for product data |

## Output Format Patterns

### React / JSX (Claude.ai Artifacts)
- Use `import * as THREE from 'three'` (r128 available)
- Use `useEffect` + `useRef` for Three.js canvas lifecycle
- **Do NOT use** `THREE.CapsuleGeometry` (added r142+) — use `CylinderGeometry` + `SphereGeometry` composites
- GSAP via CDN script tag injected dynamically, or use CSS animations
- State management: `useState`/`useReducer` for experience phases (loading → explore → selected → cart)

### Standalone HTML/CSS/JS
- Single-file unless complexity demands otherwise
- All CDN libs loaded in `<head>` with `defer`
- Canvas element as full-viewport layer, UI elements as absolute-positioned HTML overlay
- Use CSS custom properties for brand theming
- Mobile-first: touch events alongside mouse events always

### WordPress / WooCommerce
- Deliver as a **self-contained shortcode embed** — PHP wrapper + enqueued scripts
- Use WooCommerce REST API (`/wp-json/wc/v3/products`) for live product data
- Inject product data as `window.SKYYROSE_PRODUCT_DATA = <?php echo json_encode($product_data); ?>`
- NEVER block the WordPress render thread — all 3D init must be `async`/deferred
- Provide both: (a) the shortcode PHP snippet, (b) the full HTML/JS embed file

### Any Other Language / Stack
- Identify the runtime, then output the canonical pattern for that environment
- Python (Flask/Django): Jinja2 templates + static JS bundles
- Vue/Svelte/Next.js: Component-based with the same Three.js lifecycle patterns
- Always document environment assumptions at the top of the file

## Experience Type: 3D Product Viewer

**Goal**: Customer inspects the product from every angle before buying. Eliminates return anxiety. Builds confidence.

**Architecture**:
```
Canvas (Three.js WebGLRenderer)
├── Scene
│   ├── AmbientLight + DirectionalLight (3-point studio setup)
│   ├── ProductMesh (GLTF/OBJ/procedural geometry)
│   ├── EnvironmentMap (HDR or solid gradient)
│   └── ReflectionPlane (optional — adds luxury feel)
├── Camera (PerspectiveCamera, FOV 35-45 for product shots)
├── Controls (OrbitControls or custom drag handler)
└── UI Overlay (HTML)
    ├── Hotspot labels (position projected from 3D to 2D)
    ├── Color/variant switcher
    └── Add to Cart CTA
```

**Lighting Setup for Fashion/Apparel**:
```javascript
// Studio 3-point lighting
const keyLight = new THREE.DirectionalLight(0xffffff, 1.2);
keyLight.position.set(5, 8, 5);

const fillLight = new THREE.DirectionalLight(0xB76E79, 0.4); // rose gold fill
fillLight.position.set(-5, 3, 2);

const rimLight = new THREE.DirectionalLight(0xffffff, 0.8);
rimLight.position.set(0, -3, -5); // backlight for fabric edge glow

const ambient = new THREE.AmbientLight(0x111111, 0.6);
```

**Mobile Handling**: Always implement touch-drag controls with `touchstart`/`touchmove` alongside mouse. Pinch-to-zoom via `touchmove` with two-finger distance delta.

---

## Experience Type: Brand Showroom / 3D Environment

**Goal**: Customer enters a spatial world that IS the brand. Products are discovered, not listed.

**Architecture Pattern**:
```
Scene Graph
├── Environment (skybox or procedural background)
│   ├── Fog (THREE.FogExp2 for depth)
│   └── Background particles / atmospheric effects
├── Collection Zones (spatial groupings)
│   ├── Zone: BLACK ROSE → dark marble surfaces, moody spotlights
│   ├── Zone: LOVE HURTS → deep reds, cracked texture, emotional lighting
│   └── Zone: SIGNATURE → clean planes, neutral tones, editorial
├── Product Objects (instanced meshes for performance)
├── Navigation (raycasting on click/tap, camera lerp to target)
└── UI Layer
    ├── Minimap (optional for large environments)
    └── Product detail panel (slides in on selection)
```

**Camera Movement**:
```javascript
// Smooth cinematic camera lerp — NEVER teleport, always glide
function lerpCamera(targetPosition, targetLookAt, duration = 1.2) {
  gsap.to(camera.position, {
    x: targetPosition.x,
    y: targetPosition.y,
    z: targetPosition.z,
    duration,
    ease: "power2.inOut",
    onUpdate: () => camera.lookAt(currentLookAt)
  });
}
```

**Performance Budget**:
- Max 50k triangles total scene for mobile
- Max 150k triangles for desktop
- Use `THREE.InstancedMesh` for repeated objects (particles, floor tiles)
- Texture atlasing: combine small textures into one 2048×2048 atlas
- Disable shadows on mobile: `renderer.shadowMap.enabled = isMobile ? false : true`

---

## Experience Type: Virtual Try-On / AR Overlay

**Goal**: Customer sees the product on themselves or in their environment using the device camera.

**Implementation Tiers** (choose based on scope):

### Tier 1: model-viewer AR Mode (simplest, iOS + Android)
```html
<model-viewer
  src="product.glb"
  ar
  ar-modes="webxr scene-viewer quick-look"
  camera-controls
  auto-rotate
  shadow-intensity="1"
  environment-image="neutral"
  style="width:100%; height:500px;">
  <button slot="ar-button" class="ar-cta">View in Your Space</button>
</model-viewer>
```

### Tier 2: WebXR Hit-Test (full AR placement)
- Requires HTTPS + WebXR-capable browser (Chrome Android, Safari 16+)
- Use `navigator.xr.requestSession('immersive-ar', { requiredFeatures: ['hit-test'] })`
- Render overlay anchored to real-world surface via hit-test matrix
- Always include a graceful fallback to Tier 1 or 3D viewer

### Tier 3: MediaPipe Body Segmentation (garment overlay)
- Advanced: use `@mediapipe/selfie_segmentation` to isolate body
- Overlay product texture on segmented person silhouette
- GPU-accelerated via WebGL — frame rate critical, target 24fps minimum
- Provide detailed instructions: see `references/ar-mediapipe.md`

**AR Trigger UX**: Always show a clear "View in AR" CTA that feature-detects before launching:
```javascript
async function checkARSupport() {
  if (!navigator.xr) return 'unsupported';
  const supported = await navigator.xr.isSessionSupported('immersive-ar');
  return supported ? 'webxr' : 'model-viewer-fallback';
}
```

---

## Experience Type: Cinematic Collection Drop / Launch Page

**Goal**: A product drop feels like a movie premiere. Scroll = timeline. Every frame is intentional.

**GSAP ScrollTrigger Architecture**:
```javascript
// Phase 1: Hero — product emerges from darkness
gsap.timeline({
  scrollTrigger: { trigger: "#hero", start: "top top", end: "+=100%", scrub: 1.5 }
})
.from(".product-hero", { scale: 0.6, opacity: 0, duration: 1 })
.from(".collection-name", { y: 120, opacity: 0, duration: 0.8 }, "-=0.4")
.from(".hero-particles", { opacity: 0, duration: 1.2 }, "-=0.6");

// Phase 2: Collection reveal — products stagger in
gsap.timeline({
  scrollTrigger: { trigger: "#collection", start: "top 80%", toggleActions: "play none none reverse" }
})
.from(".product-card", {
  y: 80, opacity: 0, stagger: 0.15, ease: "power3.out", duration: 0.9
});

// Phase 3: Story section — text reveals word by word
SplitText and staggered character animations
```

**Lottie Integration**:
```javascript
const anim = lottie.loadAnimation({
  container: document.getElementById('lottie-container'),
  renderer: 'svg',
  loop: false,
  autoplay: false,
  path: 'animation.json'
});
// Sync Lottie frame to scroll progress
ScrollTrigger.create({
  trigger: "#lottie-section",
  start: "top center",
  end: "bottom center",
  onUpdate: (self) => {
    anim.goToAndStop(self.progress * anim.totalFrames, true);
  }
});
```

## SkyyRose Brand Integration

When building for SkyyRose, always:

**Load**: `skyyrose-brand-dna` SKILL.md alongside this skill for full brand context.

**Spatial Brand Palette**:
```css
:root {
  --sr-void: #0A0A0A;          /* scene background */
  --sr-charcoal: #1C1C1C;      /* surfaces */
  --sr-smoke: #2D2D2D;         /* secondary surfaces */
  --sr-rose-gold: #B76E79;     /* accent lights, UI highlights */
  --sr-blood: #8B0000;         /* LOVE HURTS collection energy */
  --sr-white: #F5F5F0;         /* typography, clean surfaces */
}
```

**Per-Collection 3D Environments**:
| Collection | Environment | Light Color | Fog | Particle Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| BLACK ROSE | Dark marble vault | #B76E79 rose gold key, white rim | Dense black fog | Gold dust particles |
| LOVE HURTS | Fractured red glass space | Deep red fill, white backlight | Red mist | Ember/ash particles |
| SIGNATURE | Editorial white studio | Neutral 3-point, soft shadows | None | None |

**Product Interaction Sound Design** (optional but impactful):
- Use Web Audio API for subtle UI sounds (no autoplay — always user-triggered)
- Soft chime on product selection, tactile click on variant switch

---

## Performance Standards

Every immersive experience MUST meet these before delivery:

| Metric | Target | Hard Limit |
|---|---|---|
| Initial load (3G) | < 4s to first render | < 8s |
| FPS (mobile) | 30fps stable | Never drop below 20fps |
| FPS (desktop) | 60fps stable | Never drop below 45fps |
| JS bundle (gzipped) | < 400KB | < 800KB |
| Texture memory | < 50MB | < 100MB |
| Lighthouse Performance | > 70 | > 55 |

**Optimization Checklist**:
- [ ] Progressive loading: show 2D placeholder while 3D initializes
- [ ] `renderer.setPixelRatio(Math.min(window.devicePixelRatio, 2))` — cap DPR
- [ ] Frustum culling enabled (default in Three.js, verify not disabled)
- [ ] `geometry.dispose()` + `material.dispose()` on unmount (React) or scene clear
- [ ] Texture compression: use `.basis` or `.ktx2` for production GLTFs
- [ ] Use `requestAnimationFrame` loop only when canvas is visible (IntersectionObserver pause)

---

## Accessibility & Fallback Architecture

Immersive experiences must be inclusive:

```
Experience Tiers:
1. Full 3D/AR       → WebGL + WebXR capable browsers
2. CSS 3D Fallback  → Modern browsers without WebGL (rare but real)
3. Static Fallback  → Accessible, screen-reader-friendly product page
```

Always implement:
- `<noscript>` block with product images and description
- `aria-label` on canvas: `<canvas aria-label="Interactive 3D product viewer. Use arrow keys to rotate.">`
- Keyboard controls for 3D rotation (arrow keys)
- Prefers-reduced-motion media query: disable all animations, show static scene

```javascript
const prefersReduced = window.matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)').matches;
if (prefersReduced) {
  // Skip GSAP timelines, show static scene
  gsap.globalTimeline.pause();
}
```

---

## File Delivery Format

When delivering an immersive experience, always provide:

1. **The primary file** — fully functional, self-contained when possible
2. **Integration notes** — clear comments for WordPress shortcode, npm install, etc.
3. **Asset checklist** — what GLB/GLTF/texture files the developer needs to supply
4. **Demo data** — if no real assets provided, use procedural geometry + placeholder textures so the experience is fully runnable

For WordPress delivery, output two code blocks:
- `experience.html` — the full standalone experience
- `functions.php snippet` — enqueue + shortcode registration

---

## Reference Files

Load these when you need deeper guidance on specific topics:

- `references/three-js-patterns.md` — Three.js boilerplate, geometry patterns, shader snippets
- `references/gsap-scroll-patterns.md` — ScrollTrigger timelines, SplitText, Lottie sync
- `references/ar-mediapipe.md` — MediaPipe body tracking integration guide
- `references/woocommerce-3d-embed.md` — WordPress/WooCommerce integration patterns

---

## Quick-Start Templates

For common requests, scaffold from these mental templates:

**"Build a 3D product viewer"** → Three.js canvas + OrbitControls + studio lighting + HTML overlay CTA

**"Create an immersive collection page"** → GSAP ScrollTrigger multi-phase timeline + Three.js particle background + product cards with 3D entrance animations

**"AR try-on for mobile"** → `model-viewer` with `ar` attribute + WebXR hit-test upgrade path + graceful feature detection

**"Brand showroom / 3D store"** → Three.js environment + raycasting navigation + collection zone spatial layout + camera lerp transitions

**"Drop launch page"** → Cinematic GSAP countdown + particle burst on reveal + product hero with Three.js depth-of-field effect

Always begin with: **What emotion should hit the visitor in the first 3 seconds?** Then build backward from that feeling.
