# Og Life

## Overview

Enable process/workflow orchestration and entity lifecycle state management for the Beep.OilandGas.LifeCycle solution, including PPDM integration and phase services.

## Quick start

1. Identify the change type: process workflow, entity lifecycle state, integration/orchestration, or database schema.
2. Read `references/lifecycle-overview.md` for service map and dependencies.
3. Apply changes in the correct layer; keep process status and entity status in sync.
4. Update DTOs, integration helpers, and docs if the API surface changes.

## Task playbooks

### Add or modify a process workflow

- Update definitions and steps in `Beep.OilandGas.LifeCycle/Services/Processes/ProcessDefinitionInitializer.cs`.
- Add or change orchestration methods in `Beep.OilandGas.LifeCycle/Services/<Phase>/Processes/*ProcessService.cs`.
- Keep validation rules in `Beep.OilandGas.LifeCycle/Services/Processes/ProcessValidator.cs`.
- Extend DTO mappings in `Beep.OilandGas.PPDM39/Core/DTOs/ProcessDTOs.cs` and `Beep.OilandGas.LifeCycle/Services/Processes/ProcessServiceExtensions.cs` when new inputs or outputs appear.
- Ensure process tables match changes in `Beep.OilandGas.LifeCycle/Scripts/ProcessWorkflowTables.sql`.

### Add or modify entity lifecycle states

- Update state transitions and history in `Beep.OilandGas.LifeCycle/Services/<Entity>Lifecycle/*LifecycleService.cs`.
- Align PPDM status tables and model classes in `Beep.OilandGas.PPDM39/Scripts/Sqlserver/` and `Beep.OilandGas.PPDM.Models/39/`.
- Keep state validation consistent with process workflows.

### Integrate process services and orchestration

- Register services in API DI (see references).
- Use `Beep.OilandGas.LifeCycle/Services/Processes/ProcessIntegrationHelper.cs` to coordinate process execution with state transitions.
- Update `FieldOrchestrator` or phase services to use process services where needed.

### Database and schema updates

- Process workflow schema: `Beep.OilandGas.LifeCycle/Scripts/ProcessWorkflowTables.sql`.
- PPDM entity status schema: `Beep.OilandGas.PPDM39/Scripts/Sqlserver/` plus matching model classes.
