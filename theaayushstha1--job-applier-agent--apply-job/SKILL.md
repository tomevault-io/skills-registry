## Security and Privacy

### Credential Handling
- No passwords or tokens are stored by this skill
- Browser actions use the user's existing authenticated sessions (Gmail, LinkedIn)
- All personal data stays in local files (`profile.json`, `applications.json`)
- No data is sent to external servers beyond the user's own accounts

### Input Sanitization
- Job descriptions fetched via Playwright are treated as untrusted input
- JD content is only used for text comparison (keyword matching, scoring)
- JD content is never executed as code or injected into scripts
- Resume tailoring modifies only markdown content, no code generation or execution

### User Confirmation Required For
- Submitting applications (pre-submit screenshot shown)
- Sending emails via Gmail
- Sending LinkedIn connection requests
- Any action when fit score < 5.0 or dealbreakers detected

### Rate Limiting
- LinkedIn: max 10-15 connections per session
- Emails: sent one at a time with user's own Gmail
- Applications: sequential, not parallelized

---

## Core Principles

### Workflow Automation
- Proceed through routine steps (form filling, screenshot capture) without pausing
- Always pause and confirm before: submitting applications, sending emails, sending LinkedIn requests
- Stop immediately for: login walls, CAPTCHA, critical errors, fit score < 5.0, dealbreakers detected

### Outreach Order
```
1. Find recruiters on LinkedIn (names, titles, URLs)
2. Find publicly available contact info
3. Send cold emails via Gmail FIRST (confirm before sending)
4. THEN send LinkedIn connection requests (confirm before sending)
5. Track everything in applications.json
```
**Email = PRIMARY (higher response rate). LinkedIn = SECONDARY.**

---

## Workflow: Apply to Job URL

### Step 1: Dedup Check
```
1. Read $APPLIER_HOME/data/applications.json
2. Check if URL already exists in applications[]
3. Check if same company + similar role title exists (fuzzy match)
4. If duplicate found:
   - Show: "Already applied to [Role] at [Company] on [Date]"
   - Ask user if they want to proceed anyway
   - If no, skip and exit
```

### Step 2: Extract Job Description
```
1. Navigate to job URL with Playwright
2. Capture page snapshot
3. Extract: title, company, location, requirements, salary range
4. Identify key skills/technologies
5. Detect application platform (LinkedIn, Greenhouse, Lever, Workday, etc.)
```

### Step 3: Smart Fit Scoring (0-10 each)

**Standard Scores:**
- **Technical Fit**: Skills match percentage
- **Level Match**: Appropriate for experience level
- **Location**: Remote/local/relocation
- **Mission**: Company alignment

**Dealbreaker Detection (AUTO-FAIL if any triggered):**
```
Check for these red flags in the JD:
- Security clearance required (user doesn't have one)
- 5+ years experience required (new grad)
- Senior/Staff/Principal level explicitly required
- Specific license required (PE, CPA, etc.)
- Location restriction with no remote (if user is remote-only)
```

If dealbreaker detected:
- Score = 0.0 regardless of other scores
- Show: "DEALBREAKER: [reason]. Skip? (y/n)"
- Default to skip unless user overrides

Score >= 5.0 and no dealbreakers: proceed to next step
Score < 5.0: notify user and wait for confirmation

### Step 4: ATS Keyword Analysis
```
1. Extract keywords from JD:
   - Hard skills (Python, React, AWS, etc.)
   - Soft skills (leadership, collaboration)
   - Domain terms (fintech, healthcare, etc.)
   - Action verbs the JD uses
2. Compare against master_resume.md
3. Calculate match percentage
4. Generate keyword gap report:
   - MATCHED: [list of matching keywords]
   - MISSING (in JD, not in resume): [list]
   - EXTRA (in resume, not in JD): [list]
   - ATS Score: X/100
5. If match < 60%, warn user about low ATS pass rate
```

### Step 5: Company Research Brief
```
1. WebFetch company website
2. WebSearch "[company] news 2025 2026"
3. WebSearch "[company] glassdoor reviews engineering"
4. Compile brief:
   - What they do (1 sentence)
   - Recent news/funding/launches
   - Tech stack (if discoverable)
   - Employee sentiment highlights
   - Why this matters for your application
5. Save to $APPLIER_HOME/applications/<Company>/research.md
```

### Step 6: Tailor Resume
```
1. Read $APPLIER_HOME/resume/master_resume.md
2. Create tailored markdown version:
   - Reorder projects by relevance to JD
   - Emphasize matching skills (use JD keywords from ATS analysis)
   - Bold technologies that match JD exactly
   - Reorder skills section (JD technologies first)
   - Add power words matching JD focus
3. Save to $APPLIER_HOME/applications/<Company>/resume_tailored.md
```

**Rules**: Never add fake skills. Never fabricate metrics. Only reorder/emphasize/reword.

**Power Words by JD Focus:**
| JD Focus | Use These Words |
|----------|-----------------|
| Scale | "high-traffic", "thousands of requests", "production system" |
| Performance | "sub-second", "reduced latency", "optimized" |
| Data | "data pipelines", "real-time", "event processing" |
| AI | "AI-powered", "LLMs", "ML models" |

### Step 7: Generate Cover Letter
```
1. Read $APPLIER_HOME/templates/cover_letter.md
2. Use company research brief for personalization
3. Reference specific company news/product in opening
4. Keep to 250-350 words
5. Save to $APPLIER_HOME/applications/<Company>/cover_letter.txt
```

### Step 8: Auto-Fill Application
Use Playwright to fill forms based on platform:
- LinkedIn Easy Apply
- Company career pages (Greenhouse, Lever, Workday, ADP, etc.)
- Upload resume, add cover letter if field exists

### Step 9: Track & Screenshot
```
1. Take confirmation screenshot
2. Update $APPLIER_HOME/data/applications.json with:
   - All standard fields
   - fit_score, ats_score, dealbreakers (if any)
   - follow_up_date (applied_date + 7 days)
   - company_research: true/false
   - category tag (backend, frontend, ai-ml, fullstack, devops)
3. Update stats
```

### Step 10: Recruiter Outreach
See [WORKFLOWS.md](WORKFLOWS.md) for detailed outreach steps.

```
1. Read application entry from applications.json
2. Read saved company research (or generate fresh)
3. Read the original JD (from saved files or re-fetch URL)
4. Generate prep document:

   === Interview Prep: [Role] at [Company] ===

   ## Company Overview
   - What they do, recent news, tech stack
   - Key products/services

2. For each application where status = "applied":
   - Calculate days since applied_date
   - If 7+ days and no follow_up_sent:
     FLAG for follow-up
   - If 14+ days and follow_up_sent but no response:
     FLAG for second follow-up
3. Display:

   === Follow-Up Reminders ===

   OVERDUE (14+ days, no response):
   - [Company] - [Role] - Applied [date] - [recruiter contacts]

   DUE (7+ days):
   - [Company] - [Role] - Applied [date] - [recruiter contacts]

   RECENT (< 7 days):
   - [Company] - [Role] - Applied [date] - No action needed

4. For each overdue/due item, offer to:
   - Draft follow-up email
   - Send follow-up via Gmail
   - Update tracking
```

---

## ATS Keyword Check (Standalone)

**Trigger**: `/apply-job ats-check <url>`

Runs just the ATS analysis without applying:
```

2. Run full keyword analysis against master_resume.md
3. Display match report with score
4. Suggest resume tweaks to improve score
5. Show which keywords to add/emphasize
```

---

## Smart Batch Apply

**Trigger**: `/apply-job search <query>`

Enhanced batch mode with smart filtering:
```

   - WebSearch: "<query> jobs 2026"
   - WebSearch: "<query> new grad entry level"
   - WebSearch: "site:linkedin.com/jobs <query>"
   - WebSearch: "site:greenhouse.io <query>"

2. Collect URLs and quick-score each:
   - Navigate, extract basic info
   - Run dealbreaker check (fast fail)
   - Calculate fit score
   - Check for duplicates against applications.json

3. Filter results:
   - Remove dealbreakers
   - Remove duplicates (already applied)
   - Sort by fit score descending

4. Display filtered list:
   Found 15 jobs, 3 filtered out (1 duplicate, 2 dealbreakers):

   1. [9.2] Software Engineer @ Google - Remote
   2. [8.5] AI Engineer @ OpenAI - SF
   3. [7.8] Backend Dev @ Stripe - NYC
   ...
   Filtered: CompanyX (already applied), CompanyY (requires clearance)

5. Proceed with top 10 (or user-specified number)
6. Run full workflow for each
7. Report summary at end
```
