The `prompt-critic` agent in this plugin shares the same rubric and is the right tool when the user wants a scored assessment without a rewrite.

# Meta-prompt optimizer

Audit and rewrite prompts so they work well on Claude Opus 4.7. Every run produces two deliverables: a scored audit (what's wrong and why) and a rewritten prompt that applies the fixes.

The guidance is grounded in Anthropic's official prompting best-practices doc for the Claude 4.x family, with emphasis on the Opus 4.7-specific behavior shifts (literal instruction following, adaptive thinking, effort-driven calibration, dialed-back emphasis language, positive framing).

## The three modes

The user's request determines which mode to run.

| Mode                  | Trigger                                                                          | Output                                                      |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Audit only**        | "review this prompt", "critique this", "is this any good?", "score this"         | Structured audit report (pass/fail per rubric item + notes) |
| **Audit + rewrite**   | "improve this", "rewrite for 4.7", "optimize this", "fix this prompt"            | Audit report **+** revised prompt **+** changelog           |
| **Draft from intent** | "write a system prompt that…", "draft an agent for…", "give me a CLAUDE.md for…" | New prompt written against the rubric from the start        |

If the mode is ambiguous, ask once. Default to **audit + rewrite** when the user hands over an existing prompt.

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Identify the target type

Different prompt types need different treatment. Pick the matching section of `references/target-types.md` and load it before proceeding:

- **CLAUDE.md** (project or global memory) — 200-line auto-load ceiling, must stay terse, imports via `@path` are an option.
- **Claude Code agent definition** (`.md` with YAML frontmatter) — description is the triggering mechanism, body is the system prompt.
- **Slash command** (`.md` with YAML frontmatter) — arguments, bash execution, may compose with other skills.
- **SKILL.md** body — description is the triggering mechanism, progressive disclosure via references.
- **System prompt in production code** — usually a multi-line string or Jinja2 template. Often templated with variables.
- **Pydantic v2 or Zod tool / tool-input description** — terse natural-language strings the model reads when deciding whether and how to call a tool.

If you can't tell what type it is from context, ask.

### Step 2 — Read the relevant references

Always load:

- `references/opus-4-7-principles.md` — the principles you're grading against.
- `references/rubric.md` — the scoring rubric.

Load selectively:

- `references/rewriting-patterns.md` — when rewriting (modes 2 and 3).
- `references/target-types.md` — the section matching the detected type.

### Step 3 — Run the audit

For each rubric item, mark it pass / needs work / rethink and note a concrete finding. Cite line numbers or specific phrases in the source prompt when calling out issues. Audits without evidence are not useful.

The rubric has four categories:

1. **Directness and clarity** — is the ask specific, imperative, verifiable?
2. **Framing and tone** — positive statements rather than negative? Emphasis used sparingly? Contrastive phrasing avoided?
3. **Structure** — appropriate use of XML tags, ordered by stability for caching, scope stated explicitly?
4. **Type-specific fitness** — passes the checks for its target type (e.g., CLAUDE.md under 200 lines, agent description describes when to trigger).

A full rubric walkthrough lives in `references/rubric.md`. Use it verbatim — do not improvise new rubric items mid-audit.

### Step 4 — Rewrite (if the mode calls for it)

Apply the transformations from `references/rewriting-patterns.md`. The most common ones:

1. **Flip negatives to positives.** Say what to do, not just what to avoid. Cite source: Anthropic prompt-engineering doc, "Tell Claude what to do instead of what not to do."
2. **Dial back shouting.** Reserve `**IMPORTANT:**` / `**YOU MUST:**` for one or two high-cost rules. Opus 4.x over-triggers on aggressive language that was tuned for older models.
3. **State scope explicitly.** Opus 4.7 interprets prompts literally and won't generalize. "Apply this to every section, every file, every tool call" — not "apply this."
4. **Add motivation after non-obvious rules.** One clause of "because…" turns a rule into a principle the model can generalize from.
5. **Remove hedging.** Replace "likely / probably / maybe" with the specific finding.
6. **Cut self-evident instructions.** If a rule describes behavior the model would already produce, it's filler. Remove it.
7. **Match format to stability.** For cached prompts, put stable content first, volatile content last.
8. **Use XML tags for structure when the prompt mixes content types.** `<instructions>`, `<context>`, `<examples>`, `<frontend_aesthetics>`.

### Step 5 — Produce the deliverable

Output format depends on mode:

**Audit only:**

```markdown
## Audit: [prompt name or summary]

### Scores

| Category              | Score                       | Notes              |
| --------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Directness & clarity  | Pass / Needs work / Rethink | [specific finding] |
| Framing & tone        | …                           | …                  |
| Structure             | …                           | …                  |
| Type-specific fitness | …                           | …                  |

### Findings

1. **[Finding title]** — [what's wrong, with line reference]. Impact: [why it matters].
2. …

### Top priorities to fix

[numbered list of the 2-3 highest-leverage changes]
```

**Audit + rewrite:**

Same audit section, then:

```markdown
### Rewritten prompt

[the full revised prompt]

### Changelog

- [Change 1] — [which rubric item it addresses]
- [Change 2] — …
```

**Draft from intent:**

```markdown
## Drafted prompt: [name]

[the prompt]

### Rationale

- [Decision 1] — [why]
- [Decision 2] — …
```

### Step 6 — Offer to run the critic

After producing the deliverable, offer to run the `prompt-critic` agent on the result for an independent second opinion. The critic uses the same rubric from an unbiased starting point — useful for checking that the rewrite actually improved the scores rather than shuffling them.

Invoke it with the `Agent` tool, `subagent_type: "prompt-critic"`, passing the rewritten prompt and the prompt's target type. Don't auto-run it — ask first, because users iterating quickly may not want the extra round trip. (Note: the `prompt-critic` agent is not bundled in this plugin — it lives in the upstream `personal-plugins` repo. If unavailable, the rewrite is the deliverable.)

## Special cases

### Jinja2 templates

Audit the template skeleton and the rendered output separately. Silent invalidators (per-request timestamps, user IDs, unsorted dict serialization) inside the template will break prompt caching. Flag them. See `references/target-types.md` → "Jinja2 templates".

### Pydantic v2 / Zod tool descriptions

These are terse by nature. The rubric applies differently — short is good here, but the description must answer three questions: what does this tool do, when should the model call it, what do the parameters mean. See `references/target-types.md` → "Tool descriptions".

### Migration tasks

If the user is migrating a prompt from an older model (e.g., Sonnet 3.7 → Opus 4.7), the rewrite should remove obsolete parameter guidance (sampling parameters, `budget_tokens`), dial back the shouting that older models needed, and flip negative framings. Note the migration explicitly in the changelog.

## Anti-patterns to avoid in your own output

This skill is a prompt-optimizer — its output is held to the same standard it grades against.

- Don't pad audits with "Based on our analysis…" or "Overall the prompt has strengths and weaknesses." Lead with the finding.
- Don't hedge scores. If a rubric item fails, say it fails. "Mostly passes" is not useful.
- Don't rewrite for the sake of rewriting. If a section passes the rubric, leave it alone and say so in the changelog.
- Don't invent rubric items that aren't in `references/rubric.md`. The rubric is the contract.
