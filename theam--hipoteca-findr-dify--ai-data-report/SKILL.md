## Instructions for Claude

When user invokes `/project-report`:

1. **Detect mode:**
   - If first interaction or they ask for "initial report" → Mode 1
   - If they ask for "session summary" or "what did we do" → Mode 2

2. **Gather data:**
   - Read `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `.env.example` to detect services
   - Check `git log` for recent commits
   - Check `git remote -v` for URLs
   - Look for production URLs in README or configs

3. **Be data-driven:**
   - Use real data from code, don't make things up
   - If data is missing, indicate "[pending configuration]"
   - Include specific numbers when possible

4. **Format:**
   - Use tables for structured information
   - Use emojis for main sections
   - Be concise but complete
