# Git Workflow

This skill provides structured guidance for Git version control best practices, covering branching strategies, commit conventions, pull request workflows, and conflict resolution patterns.

## Prerequisites

- Git installed and configured
- Access to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)
- Basic Git command knowledge

## When to Use This Skill

- Setting up a branching strategy for a team
- Writing consistent, useful commit messages
- Managing pull requests and code reviews
- Resolving merge conflicts
- Recovering from Git mistakes
- Establishing team Git conventions

## Branching Strategies

### Strategy Comparison

| Strategy | Best For | Complexity | Branch Types |
|----------|----------|------------|-------------|
| **Trunk-Based** | CI/CD, small teams | Low | main + short-lived feature branches |
| **GitHub Flow** | Open source, continuous deploy | Low | main + feature branches + PRs |
| **Git Flow** | Scheduled releases, complex projects | High | main, develop, feature, release, hotfix |
| **Release Train** | Multiple supported versions | Medium | main + release branches |

### Trunk-Based Development (Recommended for Most Teams)

```
main ─────●────●────●────●────●────●────●────
           \  /      \  /      \  /
feat/a     ●─●       │         │
feat/b              ●─●       │
feat/c                        ●─●

Rules:
- Feature branches live < 2 days
- Merge to main via PR (or direct if small)
- Main is always deployable
- Feature flags for incomplete work
```

### GitHub Flow

```
main ─────●─────────────●──────────●────
           \           / \         /
feat/a     ●─●─●─●──PR    │       │
feat/b                    ●─●─●─PR

Rules:
- Create branch from main
- Add commits with descriptive messages
- Open a pull request for discussion
- Review, approve, and merge
- Delete branch after merge
```

### Branch Naming Convention

```
<type>/<ticket>-<short-description>

Types:
  feat/     New feature
  fix/      Bug fix
  refactor/ Code refactoring
  docs/     Documentation
  test/     Test additions/changes
  chore/    Build, CI, tooling

Examples:
  feat/AUTH-123-add-oauth-login
  fix/PAY-456-handle-null-discount
  refactor/CORE-789-extract-validator
```

## Commit Conventions

### Conventional Commits

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

#### Types

| Type | When to Use | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| `feat` | New feature | `feat(auth): add OAuth2 login flow` |
| `fix` | Bug fix | `fix(payments): handle null discount code` |
| `refactor` | Code restructure (no behavior change) | `refactor(api): extract validation helpers` |
| `docs` | Documentation only | `docs(readme): add setup instructions` |
| `test` | Test additions/changes | `test(auth): add login failure cases` |
| `chore` | Build, CI, tooling | `chore(deps): bump next to 14.1` |
| `perf` | Performance improvement | `perf(query): add index for user lookups` |
| `style` | Formatting, whitespace | `style(lint): fix trailing commas` |

#### Commit Message Rules

1. **Imperative mood** — "add feature" not "added feature" or "adds feature"
2. **Subject ≤ 72 characters** — Short and scannable
3. **No period at end** — It's a title, not a sentence
4. **Blank line between subject and body** — Standard Git format
5. **Body explains why, not what** — The diff shows what; explain motivation
6. **Reference issues in footer** — `Closes #123` or `Refs #456`

```bash
# ✅ Good commits
git commit -m "feat(api): add rate limiting to public endpoints

Implemented sliding window rate limiter using Redis.
Anonymous: 30/min, Authenticated: 100/min, Premium: 300/min.

Closes #234"

git commit -m "fix(auth): prevent session fixation on login

Regenerate session ID after successful authentication
to prevent session fixation attacks."

# ❌ Bad commits
git commit -m "fixed stuff"
git commit -m "WIP"
git commit -m "changes"
git commit -m "update"
```

### Atomic Commits

Each commit should represent one logical change:

```bash
# ✅ Atomic: Each commit is one coherent change
git commit -m "feat(auth): add login endpoint"
git commit -m "test(auth): add login endpoint tests"
git commit -m "docs(api): document login endpoint"

# ❌ Non-atomic: Mixed concerns in one commit
git commit -m "add login, fix bug, update docs"

# ❌ Over-split: One logical change across multiple commits
git commit -m "add login part 1"
git commit -m "add login part 2"
git commit -m "add login part 3"
```

## Pull Request Workflows

### PR Template

```markdown
## Summary
<!-- Brief description of what this PR does and why -->

## Type of Change
- [ ] Feature
- [ ] Bug fix
- [ ] Refactor
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Test
- [ ] Chore

## How to Test
1. Step-by-step instructions
2. Expected behavior

## Checklist
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] No breaking changes (or documented if there are)
- [ ] Self-reviewed the diff
- [ ] Updated relevant documentation

## Related Issues
Closes #
```

### PR Size Guidelines

| Size | Lines Changed | Action |
|------|--------------|--------|
| 🟢 Small | < 200 | Quick review, approve readily |
| 🟡 Medium | 200–500 | Thorough review, same day |
| 🔴 Large | 500+ | Break into smaller PRs if possible |

### Code Review Checklist

- **Correctness**: Does it do what the PR says?
- **Edge cases**: Are error cases handled?
- **Security**: Any injection, auth, or data exposure risks?
- **Performance**: N+1 queries, unnecessary loops, missing indexes?
- **Tests**: Are new behaviors tested?
- **Naming**: Variables, functions, files clearly named?
- **Docs**: Are public APIs documented?

### Review Etiquette

```
# ✅ Constructive feedback
"Consider extracting this into a helper function — it would be 
reusable in the settings page too."

"Nit: This variable name could be more descriptive. `userCount` 
instead of `n`?"

# ❌ Unhelpful feedback
"Wrong."
"This is bad."
"Change this."
```

## Conflict Resolution

### Prevention

1. **Pull/rebase frequently** — At least daily from main
2. **Small PRs** — Fewer changes = fewer conflicts
3. **Communicate** — Tell teammates about files you're changing
4. **Separate concerns** — Don't modify the same file for unrelated features
5. **Short-lived branches** — The longer a branch lives, the more it drifts

### Resolution Process

```bash
# Step 1: Update your branch with latest main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout feature/my-branch
git rebase main

# Step 2: When conflicts occur
# Git marks conflicts in the file:
# <<<<<<< HEAD (your changes)
# your code
# =======
# their code
# >>>>>>> main (incoming changes)

# Step 3: Resolve each conflict manually
# - Open each conflicted file
# - Choose: yours, theirs, or a combination
# - Remove conflict markers (<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>)

# Step 4: Mark as resolved and continue
git add <resolved-file>
git rebase --continue

# Step 5: Force push (rebase rewrites history)
git push --force-with-lease origin feature/my-branch
```

### Conflict Resolution Strategies

| Strategy | When to Use | Command |
|----------|------------|---------|
| **Manual** | Complex conflicts | Edit file, choose best of both |
| **Accept ours** | Your change supersedes | `git checkout --ours <file>` |
| **Accept theirs** | Their change supersedes | `git checkout --theirs <file>` |
| **Combine** | Both changes needed | Edit to include both logically |

## Recovery Commands

### Undo Last Commit (keep changes)

```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1      # Undo commit, keep staged
git reset --mixed HEAD~1     # Undo commit, keep unstaged (default)
git reset --hard HEAD~1      # Undo commit, discard changes ⚠️
```

### Amend Last Commit

```bash
# Fix commit message
git commit --amend -m "correct message"

# Add forgotten files
git add forgotten-file.js
git commit --amend --no-edit
```

### Recover Deleted Branch

```bash
# Find the commit SHA
git reflog
# a1b2c3d HEAD@{5}: checkout: moving from feature/lost to main

# Recreate the branch
git branch feature/lost a1b2c3d
```

### Clean Up

```bash
# Remove merged local branches
git branch --merged main | grep -v "main" | xargs git branch -d

# Remove stale remote-tracking references
git remote prune origin

# Interactive rebase to clean up commits (before push)
git rebase -i HEAD~3  # Edit last 3 commits
```

## Repository Setup

### Initial Configuration

```bash
# Essential config
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
git config --global pull.rebase true

# Helpful aliases
git config --global alias.st "status -sb"
git config --global alias.co checkout
git config --global alias.br branch
git config --global alias.lg "log --oneline --graph --decorate -20"
git config --global alias.last "log -1 HEAD --stat"

# Conventional commit template
git config --global commit.template ~/.gitmessage
```

### .gitignore Template

```
# Dependencies
node_modules/
vendor/
.venv/

# Build output
dist/
build/
*.min.js
*.min.css

# Environment
.env
.env.*
!.env.example

# IDE
.vscode/
.idea/
*.swp

# OS
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Logs
*.log
logs/

# Coverage
coverage/
.nyc_output/
```

## Tips

- Commit early and often locally; squash before pushing if needed
- Use `git push --force-with-lease` instead of `--force` — it checks for remote changes
- Write the PR description before the code — it clarifies your thinking
- Keep main green: CI should pass before merge, and main should always be deployable
- Use `git stash` to temporarily shelve work: `git stash push -m "WIP: auth refactor"`
- Review your own PR before assigning reviewers — you'll catch obvious issues first
- Rebase feature branches onto main rather than merging main into them (cleaner history)
