# Act - GitHub Actions Workflow Syntax

Use this skill when creating or modifying GitHub Actions workflow files (`.github/workflows/*.yml`). This covers workflow structure, triggers, jobs, steps, and best practices for workflows that work both on GitHub and locally with act.

## Workflow File Structure

Every GitHub Actions workflow follows this basic structure:

```yaml
name: Workflow Name
user-invocable: false
on: [push, pull_request]  # Triggers

jobs:
  job-name:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Step name
        run: echo "Commands here"
```

### Top-Level Fields

- `name`: Human-readable workflow name (optional but recommended)
- `on`: Trigger events (push, pull_request, workflow_dispatch, etc.)
- `env`: Environment variables available to all jobs
- `jobs`: Map of job definitions
- `permissions`: Token permissions for the workflow

## Workflow Triggers

### Event Triggers

```yaml
# Single event
on: push

# Multiple events
on: [push, pull_request]

# Event with filters
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - 'releases/**'
    paths:
      - '**.js'
      - '!docs/**'
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]
```

### Manual Triggers

```yaml
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      environment:
        description: 'Target environment'
        required: true
        default: 'staging'
        type: choice
        options:
          - staging
          - production
```

### Schedule Triggers

```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 9 * * 1'  # Every Monday at 9am UTC
```

## Job Configuration

### Basic Job

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm test
```

### Job with Environment Variables

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      NODE_ENV: production
      API_URL: ${{ secrets.API_URL }}
    steps:
      - run: echo "Deploying to $NODE_ENV"
```

### Job Dependencies

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: npm run build

  test:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: npm test

  deploy:
    needs: [build, test]
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: npm run deploy
```

### Matrix Builds

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest]
        node: [18, 20, 22]
      fail-fast: false
    steps:
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node }}
      - run: npm test
```

## Steps

### Using Actions

```yaml
steps:
  # Checkout code
  - uses: actions/checkout@v4

  # Setup Node.js
  - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
    with:
      node-version: '20'
      cache: 'npm'

  # Upload artifacts
  - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
    with:
      name: dist
      path: dist/
```

### Running Commands

```yaml
steps:
  # Single line
  - run: npm install

  # Multi-line
  - run: |
      npm ci
      npm run build
      npm test

  # With name
  - name: Install dependencies
    run: npm ci

  # With working directory
  - run: npm test
    working-directory: ./packages/core

  # With shell
  - run: echo "Hello"
    shell: bash
```

### Conditional Steps

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Deploy to production
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    run: npm run deploy

  - name: Run on success
    if: success()
    run: echo "Previous steps succeeded"

  - name: Run on failure
    if: failure()
    run: echo "A step failed"

  - name: Always run
    if: always()
    run: echo "Runs regardless of status"
```

## Expressions and Contexts

### Common Contexts

```yaml
steps:
  - run: echo "Event: ${{ github.event_name }}"
  - run: echo "Branch: ${{ github.ref_name }}"
  - run: echo "SHA: ${{ github.sha }}"
  - run: echo "Actor: ${{ github.actor }}"
  - run: echo "Job status: ${{ job.status }}"
  - run: echo "Runner OS: ${{ runner.os }}"
```

### Using Secrets

```yaml
steps:
  - run: echo "Token is set"
    env:
      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      API_KEY: ${{ secrets.API_KEY }}
```

### Functions

```yaml
steps:
  - if: contains(github.event.head_commit.message, '[skip ci]')
    run: echo "Skipping CI"

  - if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')
    run: echo "This is a tag"

  - if: endsWith(github.ref, '/main')
    run: echo "This is main branch"

  - run: echo "${{ format('Hello {0}', github.actor) }}"
```

## Act-Specific Considerations

### Testing Locally with Act

```bash
# Run all workflows
act

# Run specific event
act push

# Run specific job
act -j build

# Dry run (validate without executing)
act --dryrun

# List workflows
act -l

# Use specific platform
act -P ubuntu-latest=catthehacker/ubuntu:act-latest
```

### Environment Variables for Act

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check environment
        run: |
          if [ "$ACT" = "true" ]; then
            echo "Running in act"
          else
            echo "Running on GitHub"
          fi
```

### Secrets with Act

Create `.secrets` file for local testing:

```
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_token_here
API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Then run:

```bash
act --secret-file .secrets
```

Or pass secrets individually:

```bash
act -s GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_token -s API_KEY=key
```

## Best Practices

### DO

✅ Use semantic job and step names
✅ Pin action versions (`actions/checkout@v4`)
✅ Use `fail-fast: false` for matrix builds to see all results
✅ Set appropriate `timeout-minutes` for jobs
✅ Use `working-directory` instead of cd commands
✅ Test workflows locally with `act --dryrun` before pushing
✅ Use caching for dependencies
✅ Use environments for deployment jobs

### DON'T

❌ Hardcode secrets in workflow files
❌ Use `latest` tags for actions
❌ Run workflows on every file change (use path filters)
❌ Create overly complex workflows (split into multiple files)
❌ Ignore act compatibility when using GitHub-specific features
❌ Forget to validate YAML syntax

## Common Patterns

### Build and Test

```yaml
name: CI
user-invocable: false
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          cache: 'npm'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm test
      - run: npm run build
```

### Deploy on Tag

```yaml
name: Deploy
user-invocable: false
on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*'

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Get version
        id: version
        run: echo "VERSION=${GITHUB_REF#refs/tags/}" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
      - run: echo "Deploying ${{ steps.version.outputs.VERSION }}"
```

### Monorepo with Changed Files

```yaml
jobs:
  detect-changes:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      api: ${{ steps.changes.outputs.api }}
      web: ${{ steps.changes.outputs.web }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: dorny/paths-filter@v3
        id: changes
        with:
          filters: |
            api:
              - 'packages/api/**'
            web:
              - 'packages/web/**'

  build-api:
    needs: detect-changes
    if: needs.detect-changes.outputs.api == 'true'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Building API"
```
