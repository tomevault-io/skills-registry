## Name

github:view-workflow - View GitHub Actions workflow runs and status

## Synopsis

```

## Description

View GitHub Actions workflow runs and status

## Implementation

View the status of GitHub Actions workflow runs for a repository or pull request.

## Usage

```
/view-workflow [owner/repo] [run-id or pr-number]
```

This command displays comprehensive workflow and job information.

## What This Command Does

1. Fetches workflow run data for a repository or PR
2. Retrieves all jobs in the workflow using `list_workflow_runs`
3. Displays:
   - Workflow status and duration
   - Individual job statuses
   - Failed job logs (if any)
   - Job durations and timestamps
   - Workflow trigger information

## Prerequisites

- GitHub MCP server must be installed and configured
- You must have access to the repository
- OAuth authentication must be completed

## Example Interaction

### Recommendations
1. Check database connection in test environment
2. Review test timeout settings
3. Re-run workflow after fixes
```

## Arguments

- `owner/repo` (required): Repository in owner/repo format
- `run-id` (optional): Specific workflow run ID to view
- `pr-number` (optional): View workflows for a specific PR

## Tips

- Monitor workflows during active development
- Investigate failed jobs immediately
- Compare run times to identify bottlenecks
- Check if tests are flaky or consistently failing
- Review job logs for specific error messages
- Use workflow status to determine PR readiness

## Common Issues

### Failed Tests

- Review test logs for specific failures
- Check if tests pass locally
- Verify test environment configuration
- Look for flaky tests

### Build Errors

- Check for missing dependencies
- Verify build configuration
- Look for syntax or compilation errors

### Timeout Issues

- Increase timeout values if needed
- Optimize slow tests or builds
- Check for infinite loops
