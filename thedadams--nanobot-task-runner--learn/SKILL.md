description: Review workflow execution results and apply improvements to the workflow file. Use after running a workflow to analyze what succeeded, failed, or needed retries, then propose and apply targeted fixes to step prompts, format specs, error handling, or agent selection. Use when this capability is needed.

Analyze the workflow execution that just completed and propose improvements to the workflow file itself.

## What to Look For

**Step Issues:**
- Steps that needed retries - why? Unclear prompt? Missing format spec?
- Steps that failed or timed out - too broad? Wrong agent?
- Steps that produced poor output - missing context? Vague instructions?
- Steps that had to be fixed on-the-fly - what fix worked?

**Structural Issues:**
- Steps that should be split into multiple smaller steps
- Missing error handling (`On error:`) for steps that failed
- Conditions that didn't evaluate as expected

**Input/Output Issues:**
- Values that should have been inputs but were hardcoded
- Missing required inputs that caused problems
- Optional inputs that should have had different defaults
- Output format that didn't serve downstream steps well

**Agent Selection:**
- Wrong agent for the task (e.g., used `general` when `explore` was better)
- Agent that struggled with the task scope

## Process

1. **Review the execution** - Look at:
   - Which steps succeeded/failed/were retried
   - What fixes were applied during execution
   - Any observations or issues noted in the summary
   - The actual prompts that were sent vs. what worked

2. **Identify improvements** - For each issue, determine the concrete change:
   - Rewrite a step's task description to be clearer
   - Add explicit format requirements (JSON schema, list format, etc.)
   - Add examples to step prompts
   - Split a step into multiple steps
   - Change the agent for a step
   - Add/modify `On error:` or `Condition:`
   - Add/modify inputs with better defaults

3. **Propose changes** - Present each change to the user:
   ```
   ## Proposed Changes to <workflow-name>.md

   ### 1. Step: <step_id>
   **Issue:** <what went wrong>
   **Change:** <what you want to modify>

   Current:
   > <existing text>

   Proposed:
   > <new text>

   ### 2. ...
   ```

4. **Get approval** - Ask the user which changes to apply:
   - "Apply all changes?"
   - "Apply changes 1, 3, 4?"
   - "Skip all?"

5. **Apply changes** - Only after user approval, edit the workflow file

## What NOT to Change

- Don't add verbose explanations or comments to the workflow
- Don't change things that worked fine
- Don't add complexity that isn't justified by an actual problem
- Don't change the workflow's fundamental purpose or scope
- Don't remove steps that succeeded without issues

## Example

After an execution where step `analyze_issues` failed because the agent returned prose instead of JSON:

```
## Proposed Changes to issue-triage.md

### 1. Step: analyze_issues
**Issue:** Agent returned prose instead of JSON array. Had to retry with explicit format instructions.
**Change:** Add explicit JSON format requirement with example.

Current:
> Analyze each issue and categorize by priority.
> Return the results as JSON.

Proposed:
> Analyze each issue and categorize by priority.
>
> Return as a JSON array with this exact structure:
> ```json
> [{"number": 1, "title": "...", "priority": "High|Medium|Low", "reason": "..."}]
> ```
>
> Process ALL issues. Do not truncate.
