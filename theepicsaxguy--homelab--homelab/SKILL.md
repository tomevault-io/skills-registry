# Minecraft Plugin Updater

Run the update script to check every plugin URL against its upstream API and rewrite `plugins.txt` with the latest versions.

## Usage

```bash
python3 scripts/update-plugins.py \
  /home/develop/homelab/k8s/applications/games/minecraft/plugins/plugins.txt
```

The script:
- Fetches the latest version/build from each plugin's upstream API
- Validates each new URL returns HTTP 200 before accepting it
- Rewrites `plugins.txt` in-place with updated URLs
- Prints a clear diff: what changed and what was already up to date
- Skips any plugin whose API is unreachable and warns instead of aborting

## After running

1. Review the printed diff to confirm the changes look right
2. Run `kustomize build --enable-helm /home/develop/homelab/k8s/applications/games/minecraft` to validate
3. Apply: `kubectl apply -k /home/develop/homelab/k8s/applications/games/minecraft`
4. Delete the pod to pick up the new configmap: `kubectl delete pod -n minecraft minecraft-bedrock-0`
