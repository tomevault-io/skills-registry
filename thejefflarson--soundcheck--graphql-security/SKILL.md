# GraphQL Security Check (CWE-400)

## What this checks

Protects against GraphQL-specific attack vectors: unbounded query depth that causes
exponential resolver execution, introspection left enabled in production (exposing
the full schema to attackers), and batch/alias attacks that bypass rate limiting.

## Vulnerable patterns

- GraphQL server constructed with no depth-limit or cost-analysis validation rule
- Deeply nested query allowed because no maximum-depth rule rejects it before resolver execution
- Alias batching that repeats a credential-accepting field many times in one request, bypassing per-HTTP-request rate limits
- Introspection left enabled in production, exposing the full schema to unauthenticated callers

## Fix immediately

Flag the vulnerable code and explain the risk. Translate the principles below to the
language and framework of the audited file — use that stack's documented validation
rule, plugin, or middleware API; do not roll your own.

For each finding, establish these properties:

1. **Query depth is capped at a small fixed value** (typically 5–10) by a
   validation rule or middleware that runs before resolver execution. Unbounded
   depth lets a single query trigger exponential resolver work.
2. **Total query cost is bounded.** Either a cost-analysis layer that assigns
   weights to fields and rejects over-budget queries, or alias/field-count limits
   — the goal is that a single request cannot do unbounded work regardless of
   depth. Alias batching bypasses per-request rate limits unless this is enforced.
3. **Introspection is disabled in production.** Leaving it on exposes the full
   schema — including deprecated fields, admin types, and hints for targeted
   attacks — to anyone who can hit the endpoint. Gate it on an environment flag.
4. **Every credential-accepting mutation (login, passwordReset, mfaVerify) has
   a rate limit that survives alias batching** — apply per operation, not per
   HTTP request, so a thousand aliased `login` selections count as a thousand
   attempts.

## Verification

- [ ] Query depth is limited to a fixed maximum (typically 5-10) via a validation rule or middleware
- [ ] Introspection is disabled in production environments
- [ ] Batch/alias attacks are mitigated by cost analysis, alias limits, or per-operation rate limiting
