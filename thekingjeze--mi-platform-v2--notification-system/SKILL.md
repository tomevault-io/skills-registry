# Notification System Design

## Purpose

Design notification systems that surface important buying signals while respecting cognitive limits. Core philosophy: **"Never miss something important" without "constant interruption anxiety."**

## Related Skills

- `adhd-interface-design` — For cognitive load and batching patterns
- `action-oriented-ux` — For toast notifications and undo patterns
- `b2b-visualisation` — For alert severity badges
- `uk-police-design-system` — For semantic colour system

---

## The Core Problem

Standard notification architectures prioritise real-time delivery and uniform visual urgency, inadvertently triggering:
- Executive dysfunction
- Alert fatigue
- Decision paralysis
- Platform abandonment

---

## The Solution: Neuro-Adaptive Signal Engine

Shift from "Push-First" to a system that:
- Treats attention as a **finite, non-renewable resource**
- Adapts the **"Quiet Cockpit" philosophy** from aviation
- Distinguishes between **immediate intervention**, **ambient awareness**, and **scheduled consumption**
- Decouples **information availability** from **interruption**

### Two Goals in Tension (Resolved)

| Goal | Traditional | Our Approach |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| **Don't miss important signals** | Push everything immediately | Persistent placement + escalation ladders |
| **Don't create anxiety** | Let users disable notifications | Batching + ambient awareness + rare interruptions |

---

## Multi-Axis Alert Classification

### The Five Classification Axes

| Axis | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Urgency** | Time available to respond |
| **Severity/Impact** | Expected impact intensity |
| **Certainty/Confidence** | Probability the alert is "real" |
| **Actionability** | Does it require human action? |
| **Context/Workload** | Is this a bad moment to interrupt? |

### Priority Score Calculation

```
Priority Score = (0.45 × Urgency) + (0.35 × Impact) + (0.20 × Confidence)
```

**Urgency Scores:**
- Hiring surge: 0.9 (24-48h window)
- Follow-up overdue: 0.9
- Follow-up due today: 0.7
- Job posting: 0.6 (≤7d window)
- Market trend: 0.2

**Impact Scores:**
- Key account (strong relationship): 1.0
- Target account (some relationship): 0.7
- General account: 0.4

**Lane Assignment:**
- **Lane A (Interruptive):** Score ≥ 0.80 AND Actionable = true
- **Lane B (Digest):** Score 0.40-0.79
- **Lane C (Ambient):** Score < 0.40

## Four-Tier Severity Model

| Tier | Examples | Delivery | Interrupts? |
|------|----------|----------|-------------|
| **Tier 1: Critical** | Key account hiring surge | Push + persistent badge. Bypasses Focus Mode. | **Yes** |
| **Tier 2: High** | Relationship health drop | Top of inbox + Morning Brief | No |
| **Tier 3: Medium** | New job posting | Daily Digest only | No |
| **Tier 4: Low** | Market trends | Dashboard widget only | Never |

---

## Alert Fatigue Prevention

### Causes of Alert Fatigue

| Cause | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| Too many signals | Missed responses |
| Non-actionable alerts | Desensitisation |
| Poor signal quality | Users ignore everything |
| Non-standard presentation | Confusion, delayed recognition |
| High-workload interruptions | Cognitive disruption |

### ADHD-Specific Challenges

- **Compromised filtering** — Difficulty distinguishing relevant from irrelevant
- **Executive function load** — Manual categorisation drains limited resources
- **Time blindness** — Critical alerts "meant to get to" but never acted upon
- **Object permanence** — Dismissed notifications cease to exist mentally

### Prevention Strategies

**From Clinical Alarm Management:**
- Reduce non-actionable alarms at source
- Tune thresholds and require confidence levels
- Make interruptive alerts rare and highly trustworthy

**From Aviation:**
- Reserve "Red" strictly for immediate danger
- Suppress alerts during high workload
- Indicate if alerts are suppressed

---

## Batched Notification Delivery

### Research Evidence

Predictable batches 3×/day improve well-being outcomes versus "endless stream."

**Critical:** Turning notifications off entirely can increase anxiety/FOMO. Batching provides safety net without interruption.

### The Three-Batch Model

| Batch | Time | Content | Function |
|-------|------|---------|----------|
| **Morning Brief** | 8:00-8:30 AM | Tier 2 + Tier 3 overnight; Top 3 priorities | "Start Ritual" |
| **Midday Check** | 12:00-12:30 PM | New opportunities since morning | Maintains awareness |
| **End of Day** | 4:30-5:00 PM | Lower-priority trends; Loose ends | "Closure" |

### The Rule of Three

Each digest highlights **maximum three** critical items at top. Additional items accessible via expansion.

### Two-Lane Delivery Model

```
INCOMING SIGNAL
      │
      ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│ Priority Calc   │
└────────┬────────┘
         │
    ┌────┴────┐
    │         │
    ▼         ▼
INTERRUPTIVE  DIGEST
(Score ≥0.80) (Score <0.80)
    │         │
    ▼         ▼
Push + Badge  Batched 3×/day
```

### Debouncing

Wait for **Debounce Window** (e.g., 15 minutes) to group related events:

```
Bad:  "Microsoft posted 1 job" → "posted 2 jobs" → ... (15 notifications)
Good: [Wait 15 min] → "Microsoft: 15 New Roles (3 Engineering, 2 Sales...)"
```

---

## Ambient Awareness vs Active Notification

| Surface | Purpose | Interruption |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| **Push notification** | Critical only (Tier 1) | High |
| **Badge on app icon** | Unread count | Medium |
| **In-app inbox** | All alerts, user pulls | Low |
| **Dashboard widget** | Passive awareness | None |
| **Email digest** | Asynchronous consumption | None |

---

## Nagging Protocol for Critical Alerts

For Tier 1 alerts that remain unacknowledged:

| Time Since Alert | Escalation |
|------------------|------------|
| 0-4 hours | Persistent badge in app |
| 4-8 hours | Secondary push notification |
| 8-24 hours | Email reminder |
| 24-48 hours | Highlight in Morning Brief |
| 48+ hours | Manager notification (optional) |

**User Controls:**
- "I've handled this externally" → Resolves without logging
- "Not relevant" → Dismisses with feedback

---

## Noise Control Rules

| Rule | Implementation |
|------|----------------|
| **Threading** | Group by account + signal type + 24h window |
| **Cooldowns** | Max 1 push per account per 24h |
| **Attention budget** | Max 2-3 interruptive pushes/day |
| **Confidence gating** | Low-confidence → never Lane A |
| **Context suppression** | If user viewing account → inline update only |

---

## Visual Design System

### Semantic Colour System

| Tier | Colour | Hex | Usage |
|------|--------|-----|-------|
| **Tier 1 (Critical)** | Coral Red | #FF6B6B | High urgency |
| **Tier 2 (High)** | Amber | #F59E0B | Caution |
| **Tier 3 (Medium)** | Slate Blue | #3B82F6 | Informational |
| **Tier 4 (Low)** | Cool Grey | #6B7280 | Ambient |

### Dual-Coding Requirement

All colour cues must be accompanied by iconography:
- Warning Triangle for critical
- Arrow Up/Down for changes
- Info Circle for informational

---

## User Preference Framework

### Mode Presets

| Mode | Tier 1 | Tier 2 | Best For |
|------|--------|--------|----------|
| **Calm** | Morning Brief only | Morning Brief only | Deep focus |
| **Balanced** | Real-time push | Morning Brief | Most users |
| **Real-Time** | Real-time push | Real-time push | Always-on roles |

---

## Default Configuration

| Signal Type | Delivery | Push? |
|-------------|----------|-------|
| Hiring surge @ key account | Immediate | Yes (budgeted) |
| New job posting | Daily digest | No |
| Relationship decay | Morning Brief | No |
| Market trend | Dashboard widget | Never |
| Follow-up due | Task queue | No |

**"Quiet Cockpit" Default:** Low noise. Only Tier 1 interrupts. User can opt into more.

---

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| **Time to Action** | <5 min for Tier 1 |
| **Snooze Rate** | <20% |
| **Digest Open Rate** | >60% |
| **Dismiss Rate (Not Relevant)** | <10% |
| **Interruptive Volume** | ≤2/day |

---

## Summary Principles

1. **Attention is finite** — Defend it, don't exploit it
2. **Quiet Cockpit** — Only anomalies generate alarms
3. **Predictability beats cleverness** — 3 batches/day > ML-optimised timing
4. **Persistence over pinging** — Items stay visible until resolved
5. **Opportunity framing** — Never punitive, always supportive
6. **One-click actions** — Bridge knowing and doing
7. **Dual coding** — Colour + icon for every state
8. **Rare and trustworthy** — Interruptive alerts must earn credibility
9. **Context-aware snoozing** — "When I view this account" > "In 2 hours"
10. **Cross-device sanity** — One source of truth, no duplicate badges
