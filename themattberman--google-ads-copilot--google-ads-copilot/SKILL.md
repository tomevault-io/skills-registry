# Google Ads Landing Review

## Why this skill exists

"The landing page isn't converting" is the most common complaint in Google Ads.
But it hides two completely different root causes:

1. **Tracking problem** — conversions ARE happening but aren't being counted.
2. **Path problem** — the visitor arrives but the page fails them.

Most operators (and most clients) assume path failure when the numbers look bad.
Half the time, it's a tracking failure. Conflating the two wastes months.

This skill separates them.

Read first:
- `google-ads/references/operator-thesis.md`
- `google-ads/references/tracking-playbook.md`
- `google-ads/references/structure-playbook.md`

Read workspace if available:
- `workspace/ads/account.md`
- `workspace/ads/goals.md`
- `workspace/ads/findings.md`
- `workspace/ads/drafts/_index.md` — check for existing tracking drafts

## Diagnostic Model: Two Forks

```
"Landing page isn't converting"
         │
    ┌────┴────┐
    │         │
  FORK A    FORK B
  Tracking  Path/UX
    │         │
  Is the     Is the page
  signal     actually
  correct?   failing?
```

**Always run Fork A first.** If tracking is broken, Fork B conclusions are unreliable.

---

## Fork A: Tracking Diagnosis (Is the signal trustworthy?)

### What to check

**1. Does a conversion action exist for the goal on this page?**
- Is there a conversion action configured for the form/call/purchase that this landing page is supposed to produce?
- Is it set as primary (`include_in_conversions_metric = TRUE`)?
- Is the counting type correct?

**2. Does the tag actually fire?**
- Is the Google Ads conversion tag (or GA4 event imported to Google Ads) present on the confirmation/thank-you page?
- Does the tag fire when the user completes the action? (Google Tag Assistant, network tab, or manual test)
- Is the tag firing on the WRONG page? (e.g., firing on page load of the form page instead of the thank-you page)

**3. Is the conversion path end-to-end intact?**
- Click on ad → landing page → form/CTA → thank-you page → tag fires → conversion recorded
- Where does the chain break?

**4. Cross-domain / redirect issues?**
- Does the landing page redirect to a different domain for the form/checkout?
- If so, is cross-domain tracking configured?
- Are UTM parameters / GCLID surviving the redirect?

**5. Auto-tagging?**
- Is auto-tagging enabled?
- Are there URL parameters being stripped by the landing page CMS or CDN?

**6. Attribution window?**
- Conversion window too short (e.g., 1 day for a B2B lead that takes a week to decide)?
- Multiple touchpoints lost?

### Fork A Data Acquisition (Connected Mode)

**Conversion actions for this campaign:**
```sql
SELECT
  conversion_action.name,
  conversion_action.type,
  conversion_action.category,
  conversion_action.counting_type,
  conversion_action.include_in_conversions_metric,
  conversion_action.status,
  metrics.conversions,
  metrics.all_conversions
FROM conversion_action
WHERE segments.date DURING LAST_30_DAYS
  AND conversion_action.status = 'ENABLED'
ORDER BY metrics.conversions DESC
```

**Campaign-level conversion data:**
```sql
SELECT
  campaign.name,
  campaign.final_url_suffix,
  metrics.clicks,
  metrics.conversions,
  metrics.all_conversions,
  metrics.cost_micros,
  metrics.cost_per_conversion
FROM campaign
WHERE campaign.status = 'ENABLED'
  AND segments.date DURING LAST_30_DAYS
ORDER BY metrics.clicks DESC
```

**Ad-level landing page URLs and performance:**
```sql
SELECT
  campaign.name,
  ad_group.name,
  ad_group_ad.ad.final_urls,
  ad_group_ad.ad.type,
  metrics.clicks,
  metrics.impressions,
  metrics.conversions,
  metrics.cost_micros
FROM ad_group_ad
WHERE campaign.status = 'ENABLED'
  AND ad_group_ad.status = 'ENABLED'
  AND segments.date DURING LAST_30_DAYS
ORDER BY metrics.clicks DESC
LIMIT 50
```

**Landing page experience (quality score indicators):**
```sql
SELECT
  campaign.name,
  ad_group.name,
  ad_group_criterion.keyword.text,
  ad_group_criterion.quality_info.quality_score,
  ad_group_criterion.quality_info.post_click_quality_score,
  ad_group_criterion.quality_info.creative_quality_score,
  ad_group_criterion.quality_info.search_predicted_ctr
FROM keyword_view
WHERE campaign.status = 'ENABLED'
  AND ad_group.status = 'ENABLED'
  AND ad_group_criterion.status = 'ENABLED'
ORDER BY ad_group_criterion.quality_info.post_click_quality_score ASC
LIMIT 50
```

### Fork A Verdict

| Tracking Status | Meaning | Next Step |
|----------------|---------|-----------|
| **Clean** | Tag fires correctly, conversion action configured right, GCLID passes | Proceed to Fork B |
| **Suspicious** | Tag exists but volume seems too low or too high vs. reality | Investigate specific break, then Fork B |
| **Broken** | No tag, wrong tag, or GCLID stripped | Fix tracking FIRST. Fork B is premature. |
| **Unknown** | Can't verify from API alone — needs manual tag inspection | Recommend Tag Assistant audit, then Fork B |

---

## Fork B: Path/UX Diagnosis (Is the page actually failing?)

Only meaningful if Fork A shows tracking is Clean or Suspicious.

### The Message Match Test

**1. Search intent → Ad promise → Landing page delivery**

The #1 conversion killer in Google Ads is message mismatch:
- User searches "roll-off dumpster rental near me" (specific, purchase-intent)
- Ad says "Container Solutions for Your Business" (vague)
- Landing page is a generic homepage with 12 menu items

Each handoff is a potential drop:

| Handoff | Question | Failure Mode |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| Search → Ad | Does the ad answer the specific search? | Generic ad for specific intent |
| Ad → Landing | Does the LP deliver what the ad promised? | "Request a Quote" ad → page with no form |
| Landing → CTA | Is the CTA visible, clear, and low-friction? | Form buried below fold, 15 fields |
| CTA → Completion | Can the user actually complete the action? | Broken form, redirect fails, captcha blocks |

**2. Specific checks (via browser or URL fetch):**

- **Above-the-fold message:** Does the H1/hero text match the ad's promise? Does it match the search intent?
- **CTA visibility:** Can the user see what to do within 3 seconds? Is the CTA above the fold?
- **Form friction:** How many fields? Required fields? Captcha? Multi-step?
- **Mobile experience:** Does it work on mobile? (Most Google Ads clicks are mobile)
- **Page speed:** Does it load in <3 seconds? (Slow = bounced)
- **Trust signals:** Phone number, reviews, certifications, real photos?
- **Specificity:** Does the page serve ONE intent, or is it a homepage trying to serve all intents?

### The Intent Routing Test

**3. Are different intent classes landing on different pages?**

| Intent Class | Should Land On | Common Failure |
|-------------|----------------|---------------|
| Buyer ("buy X now") | Product/service page with CTA | Homepage |
| Comparison ("X vs Y") | Comparison content | Product page with no comparison |
| Research ("how does X work") | Educational content | Sales page |
| Local ("X near me") | Location/service area page | National homepage |
| Brand ("company name") | Homepage or brand page | Generic product page |

If multiple intent classes all route to the same generic page, that's a structure problem (→ recommend in structure draft), not a landing page problem.

### The Conversion Path Walk

**4. Walk the actual path the user takes:**

```
Click on ad
  → Landing page loads (check: speed, mobile rendering)
    → User reads headline (check: message match)
      → User finds CTA (check: visibility, clarity)
        → User clicks CTA (check: does it work?)
          → Form/checkout loads (check: friction, fields)
            → User submits (check: confirmation page loads)
              → Tag fires (check: conversion recorded)
```

Each step is a potential break. Document where the break is.

### Fork B Scoring

Rate each dimension:

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Message match (search→ad→page) | Strong / Weak / Missing | |
| CTA clarity | Clear / Buried / Missing | |
| Form friction | Low (≤4 fields) / Medium (5-8) / High (9+) | |
| Mobile experience | Good / Adequate / Broken | |
| Page speed | Fast (<3s) / Slow (3-6s) / Broken (>6s) | |
| Trust signals | Strong / Some / None | |
| Intent specificity | Focused / Mixed / Generic | |
| Conversion path completeness | Complete / Partially broken / Broken | |

## Data Acquisition — Landing Page Review

### Connected Mode (MCP + Browser/Fetch)

1. Pull ad final URLs and campaign data via GAQL (see queries above)
2. For each unique landing URL:
   - Fetch with `web_fetch` for content analysis (H1, CTA text, form fields, page structure)
   - Use `browser` for interactive checks if needed (JavaScript-rendered pages, form testing)
   - Check mobile rendering if concerns arise
3. Cross-reference landing pages against search term intent classes from `workspace/ads/intent-map.md`

### Export Mode

Ask the user for:
- Landing page URL(s)
- Which campaigns/ad groups point to which pages
- Conversion action name and how it fires (page load, event, etc.)
- Any known issues (form complaints, mobile problems)
- Recent conversion volume (or "we don't know" — that's data too)

---

## Differential Diagnosis Summary

After running both forks, produce a clear classification:

### Scenario 1: Tracking Problem Masquerading as UX Problem
**Symptoms:** Low/zero conversions, but page looks fine, form works, users seem to engage
**Diagnosis:** Tag not firing, wrong conversion action, GCLID stripped, cross-domain break
**Action:** Fix tracking → then reassess conversion rate with clean data
**Draft type:** Tracking fix (use `drafts/templates/tracking-draft.md`)

### Scenario 2: UX/Path Problem (Tracking Is Fine)
**Symptoms:** Tracking verified clean, but conversion rate is genuinely low
**Diagnosis:** Message mismatch, buried CTA, excessive form friction, wrong page for intent
**Action:** Landing page improvements or intent routing changes
**Draft type:** Landing review draft (use template below) and/or structure draft

### Scenario 3: Both Problems
**Symptoms:** Tracking has issues AND the page has UX problems
**Diagnosis:** Two independent failures compounding
**Action:** Fix tracking first (P0), then address UX (P1) — in that order
**Draft types:** Tracking fix draft + Landing review draft

### Scenario 4: Traffic Quality Problem (Page and Tracking Are Fine)
**Symptoms:** Tracking clean, page is good, but conversion rate still low
**Diagnosis:** The traffic is wrong — keywords matching wrong intent, broad match pulling junk, PMax sending Display/YouTube traffic to a Search landing page
**Action:** Search terms analysis, negative keywords, or structure changes
**Draft type:** Negative draft and/or structure draft (this is NOT a landing page problem)

---

## Draft Output

### Landing Review Draft
**Trigger:** Fork B finds meaningful path/UX issues (at least 2 dimensions scored Weak/Missing/Broken)

Create using the template below:
- Write to `workspace/ads/drafts/YYYY-MM-DD-[account-slug]-landing-review.md`
- Update `workspace/ads/drafts/_index.md`

If Fork A also finds issues, create a SEPARATE tracking fix draft — don't mix them.

### Landing Review Draft Template

```markdown
# Draft: Landing Page Review — [DATE]

- **Cross-reference with intent map:** [link to workspace/ads/intent-map.md findings]

## Dependencies
- [e.g., "Fix tracking (2026-03-15-acme-tracking-fix.md) before assessing conversion rate improvement"]

## Confidence
[High / Medium / Low] — [reasoning]

## Review
- [ ] Evidence checked
- [ ] Collateral risk checked
- [ ] Dependencies checked
- **Decision:** approve | defer | reject
- **Decision reason:** ____
- **Reviewed by:** ____

```

### Always update workspace memory:
- `workspace/ads/findings.md` — landing page diagnosis and classification
- `workspace/ads/learnings.md` — what we learned about this account's conversion path
- Update existing tracking drafts if Fork A reveals new tracking problems

---

## Output Shape

1. **Account Status block** — name, CID, mode, date range, tracking confidence
2. **Diagnostic classification** — tracking problem vs path problem vs both vs traffic quality
3. **Fork A summary** — tracking status for each page/campaign reviewed
4. **Fork B summary** — path/UX scores for each landing page reviewed
5. **Differential diagnosis** — which scenario applies (1, 2, 3, or 4)
6. **Prioritized recommendations** — fix order matters (always tracking before UX)
7. **Drafts created** — with file paths and summaries
8. **Memory updates**

---

## Rules

- **Always run Fork A first.** If tracking is broken, do NOT produce detailed UX recommendations — they will be based on phantom conversion data.
- **Distinguish clearly:** A page with a broken tag and 0% conversion rate is a tracking problem, not a UX problem. Say it explicitly.
- **Don't blame the landing page for traffic quality problems.** If the keywords are sending the wrong people, the page can be perfect and still not convert. Route to negatives/structure skills.
- **Walk the actual path.** Don't just look at the page — follow the entire click → conversion chain.
- **Be specific.** "The form has too many fields" is vague. "The form has 12 required fields including 'company size' and 'annual revenue' which are unnecessary for an initial quote request" is useful.
- **Mobile first.** Most Google Ads clicks are mobile. If you can only check one thing, check mobile.
- **One page at a time.** Don't try to review 10 pages at once. Start with the highest-spend page.
- **Message match is almost always the problem.** When in doubt, check whether the H1 matches the search intent. If there's a mismatch, that's usually the answer.
