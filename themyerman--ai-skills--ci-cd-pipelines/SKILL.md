# ci-cd-pipelines

## What this is

Practical patterns for **GitHub Actions** (primary) and **GitLab CI** (secondary) for **Python internal tools**: workflow layout, caching, matrix builds, secrets hygiene, reusable workflows, and deploy-on-merge. The goal is a pipeline that is **fast**, **correct**, and **safe to copy into a new repo without modification**.

For secrets storage and rotation policy: [`secrets-management`](../secrets-management/SKILL.md). For pre-PR quality gates you run locally first: [`pre-pr-checklist`](../pre-pr-checklist/SKILL.md). For Docker-based deploy targets: [`docker-containerization`](../docker-containerization/SKILL.md).

---

## 1. Workflow structure

### Directory layout

```
.github/
  workflows/
    ci.yml          # lint + type check + test (runs on every PR and push)
    cd.yml          # deploy (runs only on merge to main)
    reusable-test.yml  # shared logic called by ci.yml in other repos
```

**One file per concern.** A single 400-line `main.yml` is hard to read and re-trigger independently. Split when:

- Deploy has different secrets or permissions than test
- You want to retrigger deploy without rerunning tests
- Other repos need to call the same pipeline logic (use `workflow_call`)

### Trigger blocks (`on:`)

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
  workflow_dispatch:    # manual trigger from GitHub UI or API
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 6 * * 1"  # Monday 06:00 UTC — dependency audit, nightly build, etc.
```

**Path filters** — avoid running expensive jobs when only docs changed:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    paths:
      - "src/**"
      - "tests/**"
      - "requirements*.txt"
      - ".github/workflows/**"
```

### Concurrency groups — cancel stale runs

Without this, every `git push` queues a new run behind the previous one. Cancel the in-progress run when a newer push arrives on the same branch:

```yaml
concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
```

Put this at the **workflow level** (not inside a job). On `main`, where you never want a deploy cancelled mid-flight, set `cancel-in-progress: false` in the CD workflow.

---

## 2. Job anatomy

A complete annotated job:

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    name: Test (Python ${{ matrix.python-version }})
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest          # or self-hosted runner label
    timeout-minutes: 15             # hard cap — prevents hung jobs burning minutes

    strategy:
      fail-fast: false              # see §4 for matrix
      matrix:
        python-version: ["3.10", "3.11", "3.12"]

    needs: []                       # list job IDs this one waits for; empty = run in parallel

    if: github.event_name != 'schedule' || github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    # ^ example conditional: skip schedule trigger on non-main branches

    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4   # pin to a tag; see §9 for SHA pinning

      - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}

      - name: Cache pip
        uses: actions/cache@v4
        with:
          path: ~/.cache/pip
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-pip-${{ matrix.python-version }}-${{ hashFiles('requirements*.txt') }}
          restore-keys: |
            ${{ runner.os }}-pip-${{ matrix.python-version }}-
            ${{ runner.os }}-pip-

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt

      - name: Lint (ruff)
        run: ruff check .

      - name: Type check (mypy)
        run: mypy src/ --ignore-missing-imports

      - name: Test (pytest)
        run: pytest -q --cov=src --cov-report=xml

      - name: Upload coverage
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: coverage-${{ matrix.python-version }}
          path: coverage.xml
          retention-days: 7
```

Key options:

| Option | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `timeout-minutes` | Kill hung jobs; default is 6 hours (very expensive) |
| `needs: [job-id]` | Sequential dependency; omit for parallel |
| `if:` | Conditional execution; evaluated before the job starts |
| `continue-on-error: true` | Mark job allowed-to-fail (useful for optional checks or canary Python versions) |
| `uses: org/action@tag` | Calls a pre-built action from the marketplace or your org |
| `run: |` | Shell script; runs in a fresh shell per step |

---

## 3. Caching

Without caching, `pip install` on a cold runner takes 60–120 seconds. With a warm cache it drops to 5–10 seconds.

### Cache pip (recommended approach)

```yaml
- name: Cache pip
  uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    path: ~/.cache/pip
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-pip-${{ matrix.python-version }}-${{ hashFiles('requirements.txt', 'requirements-dev.txt') }}
    restore-keys: |
      ${{ runner.os }}-pip-${{ matrix.python-version }}-
      ${{ runner.os }}-pip-
```

**Cache key strategy:**

- Primary key: exact match on OS + Python version + requirements hash. A requirements change busts the cache correctly.
- Restore keys (fallback, ordered): broader prefixes allow partial cache hits so you only re-download changed packages instead of all packages.

### Cache a venv (alternative)

If you need the venv itself cached (e.g. for reproducible activation in subsequent steps):

```yaml
- name: Cache venv
  uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    path: .venv
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-venv-${{ matrix.python-version }}-${{ hashFiles('requirements*.txt') }}

- name: Create / restore venv
  run: |
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt
  env:
    VIRTUAL_ENV: .venv
```

### Do not cache `node_modules` across major version changes

If your repo has a small JS build step alongside Python, cache with the lockfile hash:

```yaml
key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('package-lock.json') }}
```

---

## 4. Matrix builds

Test across multiple Python versions in parallel:

```yaml
strategy:
  fail-fast: false        # one version failing does NOT cancel the others
  matrix:
    python-version: ["3.10", "3.11", "3.12"]
```

**When to use matrix:**

- Public libraries or packages that advertise multi-version support
- Services where the deployment Python version is still being decided
- Catching compatibility regressions before they reach production

**When matrix is overkill for internal tools:**

- The tool is deployed to a single, pinned Python version (e.g. Python 3.11 on a specific server)
- You control the runtime and can upgrade it — just test on the version you deploy
- Build time is already tight and you want fast feedback

If you run a matrix but only care about one "official" version for coverage uploads or artifacts, use a conditional:

```yaml
- name: Upload coverage
  if: matrix.python-version == '3.11'
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  ...
```

**`fail-fast: false` is almost always the right choice.** When `fail-fast: true` (the default), a failure on Python 3.10 immediately cancels 3.11 and 3.12, so you never learn whether those pass. The only reason to keep `fail-fast: true` is when all matrix jobs share a resource that should be freed immediately on failure.

---

## 5. Secrets in CI

### The right way to pass a secret

```yaml
- name: Deploy
  env:
    DEPLOY_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_TOKEN }}   # exposed to this step's env only
  run: ./scripts/deploy.sh
```

Secrets are available as `${{ secrets.NAME }}` in `env:` blocks and in `with:` inputs to actions. GitHub automatically redacts the secret value from logs — but only if it knows the value. Derived values (base64-encoded, URL-encoded) are **not** auto-redacted.

### Rules

- **Never `echo` a secret** — even a partial echo can leak enough bits.
- **Never put secrets in workflow file variables** at the top level — they appear in `env:` for every job including ones that do not need them.
- **Never put secrets in job `outputs:`** — outputs are visible in the workflow summary.
- **Use `github.token` for repo access** (checking out, creating releases, commenting on PRs). It is automatically available and scoped to the current repo with least privilege. Request additional permissions only when needed:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write    # only if the job comments on PRs
```

- **Scope permissions at the workflow level, not the job level,** unless different jobs genuinely need different scopes.
- **Do not store secrets in `env:` at the workflow level** if only one job needs them.

For secrets storage, rotation, TTLs, and leak response: [`secrets-management`](../secrets-management/SKILL.md) and its `reference.md`.

---

## 6. Reusable workflows

When multiple repos share the same test/lint pipeline, extract it into a `workflow_call` workflow so you change it once and all callers update:

**Callee** (`.github/workflows/reusable-test.yml` in a shared repo):

```yaml
on:
  workflow_call:
    inputs:
      python-version:
        required: false
        type: string
        default: "3.11"
    secrets:
      INTERNAL_PYPI_TOKEN:
        required: false

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: ${{ inputs.python-version }}
      - name: Install
        run: pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt
      - name: Test
        run: pytest -q
        env:
          INTERNAL_PYPI_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.INTERNAL_PYPI_TOKEN }}
```

**Caller** (any repo's `.github/workflows/ci.yml`):

```yaml
jobs:
  call-shared-test:
    uses: my-org/shared-workflows/.github/workflows/reusable-test.yml@main
    with:
      python-version: "3.11"
    secrets:
      INTERNAL_PYPI_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.INTERNAL_PYPI_TOKEN }}
```

**Rules:**

- The callee workflow must be in a repo accessible to the caller (same org, or public).
- Secrets are passed explicitly — they are never inherited automatically.
- Use `@main` or a pinned SHA, not a floating branch, for stability.
- Reusable workflows cannot call other reusable workflows more than one level deep.

## 7. Complete Python CI workflow

Copy this into `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. It covers checkout, setup, caching, lint, type check, test with coverage, and artifact upload. Production-ready for a Python internal tool.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
# Runs on every PR and push to main.
# Requirements: requirements.txt and requirements-dev.txt at repo root.
# Expects: src/ for source code, tests/ for tests.

name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
  workflow_dispatch:

concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  lint:
    name: Lint and type check
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 10

    steps:
      - name: Checkout

          restore-keys: |
            ${{ runner.os }}-pip-3.11-
            ${{ runner.os }}-pip-

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt

      - name: Lint (ruff check)
        run: ruff check .

      - name: Format check (ruff format --check)
        run: ruff format --check .

      - name: Type check (mypy)
        run: mypy src/ --ignore-missing-imports

  test:
    name: Test (Python ${{ matrix.python-version }})
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 15
    needs: lint           # only run tests when lint passes

    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        python-version: ["3.10", "3.11", "3.12"]

    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@11bd71901bbe5b1630ceea73d27597364c9af683  # v4.2.2

      - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}

          key: ${{ runner.os }}-pip-${{ matrix.python-version }}-${{ hashFiles('requirements*.txt') }}
          restore-keys: |
            ${{ runner.os }}-pip-${{ matrix.python-version }}-
            ${{ runner.os }}-pip-

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip

      - name: Run tests
        run: pytest -q --cov=src --cov-report=xml --cov-report=term-missing

      - name: Upload coverage report
        if: matrix.python-version == '3.11'   # upload once, not per version
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@65c4c4a1ddee5b72f698fdd19549f0f0fb45cf08  # v4.6.0
        with:
          name: coverage-report
          path: coverage.xml
          retention-days: 14
```

**Notes on this file:**

- Actions are pinned to **SHAs** (see §9 — why tags are not enough).
- `lint` runs first; `test` has `needs: lint` so you don't burn matrix minutes on broken code.
- `ruff format --check` fails the build if code is not formatted — it does **not** auto-format. Run `ruff format .` locally before pushing.
- Coverage is uploaded only for Python 3.11 to avoid duplicate artifacts.
- `permissions: contents: read` at the workflow level — least privilege.

## 8. CD: deploy on merge

A separate workflow that runs after CI passes on `main`. Keep deploy credentials out of the CI workflow entirely.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/cd.yml
name: CD

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

# No cancel-in-progress — never cancel a deploy mid-flight.
concurrency:
  group: deploy-main
  cancel-in-progress: false

permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  deploy:
    name: Deploy to production
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 20
    # Require CI to pass first. Replace with the actual workflow filename.
    # For cross-workflow dependency, use environments + required status checks
    # in branch protection rules — that is more reliable than needs: across files.
    environment: production    # triggers required reviewers / wait gates if configured

    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@11bd71901bbe5b1630ceea73d27597364c9af683  # v4.2.2

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@0b93645e9fea7318ecaed2b359559ac225c90a2b  # v5.3.0
        with:
          python-version: "3.11"

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt

      # Pattern A: rsync to a server
      - name: Deploy via rsync
        env:
          DEPLOY_SSH_KEY: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_SSH_KEY }}
          DEPLOY_HOST: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_HOST }}
          DEPLOY_USER: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_USER }}
        run: |
          echo "$DEPLOY_SSH_KEY" > /tmp/deploy_key
          chmod 600 /tmp/deploy_key
          rsync -az --delete \
            -e "ssh -i /tmp/deploy_key -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no" \
            src/ scripts/ requirements.txt \
            "$DEPLOY_USER@$DEPLOY_HOST:/opt/myapp/"
          rm -f /tmp/deploy_key

      # Pattern B: Docker build + push to registry, then pull on server
      # - name: Build and push Docker image
      #   env:
      #     REGISTRY_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_TOKEN }}
      #   run: |
      #     echo "$REGISTRY_TOKEN" | docker login ghcr.io -u ${{ github.actor }} --password-stdin
      #     docker build -t ghcr.io/my-org/myapp:${{ github.sha }} .
      #     docker push ghcr.io/my-org/myapp:${{ github.sha }}
```

**Cross-workflow dependency (the reliable way):** Use **branch protection rules** in GitHub → require the `CI / Test` status check to pass before merging. This prevents a deploy from triggering even if someone pushes directly. The `environment: production` block adds an optional manual approval gate.

## 9. Common mistakes

| Mistake | Better approach |
|---------|----------------|
| Running expensive jobs on every PR with no path filter | Add `paths:` filter to `on.push` and `on.pull_request` so jobs only run when relevant files change |
| Pinning actions to a tag (`@v4`) | Pin to the **commit SHA** for the tag — tags are mutable and can be hijacked; SHA is immutable |
| Using `ruff format .` as a CI step | Use `ruff format --check .` — the `--check` flag fails the build without modifying files |
| Putting secrets in workflow-level `env:` | Scope secrets to the specific step `env:` block that needs them |
| Storing secrets in `workflow` outputs or `echo` | Never echo secrets; outputs are visible in the summary |
| One giant workflow file for everything | Split CI and CD; use `workflow_call` for shared logic |
| `fail-fast: true` (the default) in a matrix | Set `fail-fast: false` so all versions report results |
| No `timeout-minutes` on jobs | The default is 6 hours; a hung test will burn your minutes quota |
| No `concurrency:` group | Old runs pile up and run redundantly; cancel stale runs |
| Skipping the `permissions:` block | Default is read+write on all scopes; specify `contents: read` minimum |
| `needs:` across workflow files | Use branch protection required status checks instead — cross-file `needs:` does not work |
| Caching with a key that never changes | Always include a file hash (`hashFiles(...)`) so the cache busts when dependencies change |
| Running deploy on every push branch | Gate deploy on `github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'` or use `on.push.branches: [main]` |

### SHA pinning for actions

Tags like `actions/checkout@v4` can be repointed to a different commit at any time (a compromised maintainer or a tag force-push). Pin to the full SHA:

```yaml
# Insecure — tag can be moved
uses: actions/checkout@v4

# Secure — SHA is immutable; keep the tag as a comment for readability
uses: actions/checkout@11bd71901bbe5b1630ceea73d27597364c9af683  # v4.2.2
```

Use [Dependabot for GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/working-with-dependabot/keeping-your-actions-up-to-date-with-dependabot) or a tool like `pin-github-action` to keep SHAs current.

## 10. GitLab CI equivalent

For teams on GitLab or GitHub Enterprise running GitLab CI (`.gitlab-ci.yml`):

### Key concept mapping

| GitHub Actions | GitLab CI |
|----------------|-----------|
| `on:` | `workflow:rules:` or `only:`/`except:` (use `rules:`) |
| `jobs:` | top-level job names |
| `needs:` | `needs:` (same concept, same keyword) |
| `strategy.matrix` | `parallel: matrix:` |
| `env:` | `variables:` |
| `secrets.NAME` | CI/CD Variables (masked, protected) |
| `actions/cache` | `cache:` block with `key:` |
| `workflow_call` | `include:` with a remote template |
| `runs-on:` | `tags:` (to select a runner) |
| `environment:` | `environment:` (same concept) |

### Complete `.gitlab-ci.yml` for Python (equivalent to §7)

```yaml
# .gitlab-ci.yml
# Stages run in order; jobs within a stage run in parallel.

stages:
  - lint
  - test
  - deploy

variables:
  PIP_CACHE_DIR: "$CI_PROJECT_DIR/.cache/pip"
  PYTHON_VERSION: "3.11"

# Cache pip downloads across jobs and pipelines.
.pip-cache: &pip-cache
  cache:
    key:
      files:
        - requirements.txt
        - requirements-dev.txt
      prefix: pip-$PYTHON_VERSION
    paths:
      - .cache/pip
    policy: pull-push

lint:
  stage: lint
  image: python:$PYTHON_VERSION-slim
  <<: *pip-cache
  script:
    - pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
    - ruff check .
    - ruff format --check .
    - mypy src/ --ignore-missing-imports
  rules:
    - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "merge_request_event"
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH

test:
  stage: test
  needs: [lint]
  image: python:${PYTHON_VERSION}-slim
  parallel:
    matrix:
      - PYTHON_VERSION: ["3.10", "3.11", "3.12"]
  <<: *pip-cache
  script:
    - pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt
    - pytest -q --cov=src --cov-report=xml --cov-report=term-missing
  artifacts:
    when: always
    paths:
      - coverage.xml
    expire_in: 14 days
  rules:
    - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "merge_request_event"
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH

deploy:
  stage: deploy
  image: python:$PYTHON_VERSION-slim
  needs: [test]
  environment:
    name: production
  script:
    - pip install -r requirements.txt
    - ./scripts/deploy.sh
  rules:
    # Only deploy on push to default branch, not on MRs
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH
      when: on_success
```

**GitLab-specific notes:**

- **`rules:`** over `only:`/`except:` — `rules:` is evaluated top-to-bottom and is more predictable.
- **Masked variables** — in GitLab CI/CD settings, mark secrets as **Masked** (redacted from logs) and **Protected** (only available on protected branches). Never pass secrets as plain `variables:` in the YAML file.
- **`cache: policy: pull-push`** — the default; a job that does not install deps should use `policy: pull` to avoid writing a stale cache.
- **`needs:`** works the same as in GitHub Actions for cross-stage dependencies.
- **`parallel: matrix:`** is the GitLab equivalent of `strategy.matrix`; `fail-fast` equivalent does not exist — use `allow_failure: true` on specific matrix entries if needed.
