name: git-workflow
description: Enterprise git workflow for branch management, code review, and change investigation. Triggers: branch, commit, diff, blame, 'who/what changed', merge, rebase, cherry-pick, stash, history, log, 'compare branches', 'review changes', 'check the diff', shelve. Provides safe branching, blame/history investigation, clean commits, and merge/rebase procedures. Use when this capability is needed.

# Git Workflow Best Practices

## Tool Availability

All git operations use `run_command` with standard git CLI commands. The `changelist_shelve` tool
provides IDE-native IntelliJ changelist shelving.

`run_command` blocks destructive remote operations (push, fetch, pull, clone, reset --hard, clean -f,
rebase, merge, and any command referencing origin/ or upstream/).

## Before Any Git Operation
1. Use `run_command("git status")` to understand current state (branch, uncommitted changes)
2. Use `run_command("git branch -a")` to see available branches — NEVER assume "main" or "master" exists

## Comparing Branches
To check if changes exist between branches:
1. `run_command("git branch -a")` — find the actual branch names
2. `run_command("git merge-base <ref1> <ref2>")` — find divergence point
3. `run_command("git diff <target-branch>")` — see actual differences
4. For a specific file: `run_command("git diff <target-branch> -- src/main/Foo.kt")`

NEVER use `run_command("git diff origin/...")` — this references remote refs which are blocked.

## Checking if a Ticket's Changes Are on a Branch
1. `run_command("git log --oneline -30")` — search commit messages for the ticket key
2. `run_command("git show <hash>")` — view the specific commit's changes
3. `run_command("git diff <base-branch> -- <changed-file>")` — compare with base

## Reviewing File History
1. `run_command("git log --oneline --follow -- src/main/Foo.kt")` — all commits that touched this file (follows renames)
2. `run_command("git blame src/main/Foo.kt -L 40,60")` — who changed specific lines
3. `run_command("git show HEAD~5:src/main/Foo.kt")` — file content 5 commits ago

## Viewing a File at a Different Branch
Use `run_command("git show <branch>:src/main/Foo.kt")` — NOT `run_command("git checkout <branch>")`.
NEVER switch branches. NEVER checkout. Read file content at any ref without modifying working tree.

## Understanding Branch Divergence
1. `run_command("git merge-base feature-branch develop")` — find common ancestor
2. `run_command("git log --oneline develop -20")` — recent commits on the target branch
3. `run_command("git diff develop")` — full diff between current branch and target

## Shelving Changes (IntelliJ Changelists)
Use `changelist_shelve` to shelve IntelliJ changelists (IDE-native, not git stash):
- Shelve uncommitted changes before switching context
- Unshelve when returning to the task
- Prefer this over `git stash` when working inside IntelliJ

## PR-Related Tasks

For PR-related git tasks, use Bitbucket tools (deferred — activate via `tool_search` first):
- `bitbucket_pr(action="get_pr_diff")` for diffs
- `bitbucket_pr(action="get_pr_changes")` for changed files
- `bitbucket_pr(action="get_pr_commits")` for commit history
- `bitbucket_pr(action="create_pr")` to create PRs

## CI Context

Before confirming a branch is ready to merge, check build status (deferred — activate via `tool_search` first):
- `bamboo_builds(action="build_status")` for Bamboo CI
- `bitbucket_repo(action="get_build_statuses")` for Bitbucket pipelines

## Destructive Operations

If the user asks to rebase, merge, or force-push, explain that these operations are blocked for safety. Offer to help prepare the command for the user to run manually.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Don't assume the base branch is "main" — enterprise repos often use "develop", "master", or custom names
- Don't use `run_command("git diff origin/main")` — use `run_command("git diff main")` instead
- Don't checkout other branches to read files — use `run_command("git show <ref>:<path>")` instead
- Don't run `git log` with huge output — use `-20` or `--oneline` to limit
- Don't forget `--follow` for file history — include it in `git log --follow -- <file>`
- Don't reference remote refs (origin/, upstream/) — they are blocked for safety
