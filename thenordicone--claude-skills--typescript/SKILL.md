# TypeScript Code Style

Strict, opinionated rules. Follow these to write correct code on the first draft.

## Control Flow

- **Early returns for guard clauses** — return early for error/edge cases to keep main logic flat
- **Always use block bodies** for `if` with `return` — never `if (!x) return;` on one line
- **Prefer positive conditions** — check what should happen, not what shouldn't. Does NOT apply to guard clauses, where negative checks are expected
- **No `else` after `return`** — if a branch returns, the next block needs no `else`
- **`switch` over chained `if`** — when checking the same variable against multiple values

## Type Safety

- **No `any`** — forbidden. Use `unknown` for uncertain types, generics to preserve/relate types
- **No non-null assertions (`!`)** — forbidden. Use optional chaining (`?.`) or guard clauses
- **Minimize `as` casting** — fix types at the source. Use generics, `satisfies`, or type guards instead
- **Generics over broad types** — prefer generic parameters over accepting broad types and casting results
- **Let TypeScript infer return types** — only annotate when needed (public APIs, recursion, or when inference produces the wrong type)

## Enums

**No enums** — forbidden. Use `as const` objects with derived types:

```typescript
const Status = {
  Active: 'active',
  Inactive: 'inactive',
} as const;

type Status = (typeof Status)[keyof typeof Status];
```

## Naming

- **Be descriptive** — prefer specificity over brevity. `activeUsers` not `data`, `sortByDate` not `process`
- **No `I`/`T` prefixes** — `User` not `IUser`, `Config` not `TConfig`
