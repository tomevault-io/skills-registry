# Admin Catalog Manager

## Overview

Create a secure admin surface and data model so large organizations can manage products, materials, suppliers, and stock availability, and expose those items correctly on the public Create experience.

## Workflow Decision Tree

- If the request is primarily about **data model or RLS**, load `references/schema.md` and `references/rls.md`.
- If the request is about **image uploads or storage**, load `references/storage.md`.
- If the request is about **admin UI or access control**, load `references/ui-admin.md`.
- If the request is about **Create.tsx carousels or dynamic types/subtypes**, load `references/create-integration.md`.

## Core Workflow

1. Map the domain: products, parts, subparts, materials, suppliers, stock, and images.
2. Implement Supabase tables and foreign keys.
3. Add RLS policies for admin-only writes and public reads of `available` items.
4. Configure storage bucket and signed/public URLs for images.
5. Build admin UI (list + create/edit + image upload + stock adjustments).
6. Adapt `Create.tsx` to render dynamic parts/subparts from the database.
7. Add minimal validation and smoke tests.

## Quality Bar

Follow these non-negotiables:
- Enforce admin access with RLS; do not rely on client checks.
- Keep public reads limited to `available = true`.
- Store images in a dedicated bucket and only save URLs/paths in tables.
- Keep Create page resilient to missing data and empty states.

## References

Use these reference files when needed:
- `references/schema.md`
- `references/rls.md`
- `references/storage.md`
- `references/ui-admin.md`
- `references/create-integration.md`
