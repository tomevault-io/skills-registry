name: backend-migrations
description: Create and manage database migrations following best practices for reversibility, zero-downtime deployments, and version control. Use this skill when creating migration files, modifying database schemas, adding or removing tables/columns, managing indexes, or performing data transformations. Apply when working on migration files (migrations/*.ts, migrations/*.sql, *_migration.py), Prisma schema changes, Supabase migrations, or any database evolution tasks. This skill ensures reversible migrations with rollback/down methods, small focused single-change migrations, zero-downtime deployment compatibility, separated schema and data migrations, safe concurrent index creation on large tables, clear descriptive naming conventions, and proper version control practices (never modify deployed migrations). Use when this capability is needed.

# Backend Migrations

## When to use this skill:

- When creating new database migration files
- When modifying existing database schemas (adding/removing tables or columns)
- When working on migration files (migrations/*.ts, migrations/*.sql, *_migration.py)
- When adding or modifying database indexes for performance
- When performing data migrations or transformations
- When implementing rollback/down methods for migrations
- When ensuring zero-downtime deployment strategies
- When managing schema versioning and migration order
- When separating schema changes from data migrations
- When working with Prisma migrate, Supabase migrations, or Entity Framework migrations
- When creating indexes on large PostgreSQL tables using concurrent options
- When planning backwards-compatible schema changes for high-availability systems

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle backend migrations.
