# System Design Master

This skill provides comprehensive system design guidance based on the System Design Master Guide, combining 200+ interview experiences with real-world senior engineering knowledge.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Designing new systems or architectures from scratch
- Making architectural decisions (database selection, API design, scaling strategies)
- Reviewing or refactoring existing systems
- Preparing for system design interviews
- Evaluating trade-offs between different technical approaches
- Optimizing system performance and scalability
- Implementing security best practices
- Creating UI/UX designs following psychology principles
- Writing code that needs to follow senior engineering standards

## Core Principles to Always Apply

### 1. Software Design Principles

**KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**
- Build the simplest solution to your current, known problem
- Avoid unnecessary complexity and premature optimization
- Write clear, straightforward code

**DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) - But Be Strategic**
- Only abstract when consolidating a single business rule or concept
- Use the "Rule of Three" (abstract on the third repetition)
- Prefer duplication over wrong abstraction when concepts differ

**Boy Scout Rule**
- Leave code cleaner than you found it
- Make small, positive improvements as you work
- Prevent mess accumulation through continuous cleanup

**Avoid Over-engineering**
- Solve the problem you have today, not hypothetical future problems
- Ask: "What is the simplest thing that could possibly work?"

**Ship Stable Code**
- Focus on consistency, reliability, and incremental improvement
- Avoid large, risky changes that cause regressions

### 2. The 23 Essential Coding Standards

When writing code, always follow these 23 rules:

1. **Always Use DaisyUI** - Maintain consistent styling
2. **Create Modular UI Components** - Break into smaller, manageable pieces
3. **Component Documentation** - Include purpose, functionality, location
4. **Vercel Compatibility** - Ensure all endpoints work on Vercel
5. **Quick and Scalable Endpoints** - Optimize for performance
6. **Asynchronous Data Handling** - Use async operations and streaming
7. **API Response Documentation** - Document response structures
8. **Database Integration with SSR** - Use Server-Side Rendering
9. **Maintain Existing Functionality** - Never break current features
10. **Comprehensive Error Handling** - Include detailed error checks and logging
11. **Optimize for Quick Use** - Minimize loading animations
12. **Complete Code Verification** - Ensure code is error-free and bug-free
13. **Use TypeScript** - All development with proper type definitions
14. **Security and Scalability** - Build secure, scalable applications
15. **Error Checks and Logging** - Handle edge cases effectively
16. **Protect Exposed Endpoints** - Rate limiting and authentication
17. **Secure Database Access** - Follow best practices
18. **Step-by-Step Planning** - Plan before implementing
19. **Utilize Specified Tech Stack** - Next.js, appropriate database, Vercel
20. **Consistent Use of Existing Styles** - Reuse existing components
21. **Specify Script/File for Changes** - Always specify which file to modify
22. **Organize UI Components Properly** - All in `/components` folder
23. **Efficient Communication** - Optimize AI chat interactions

### 3. System Design Process

#### Step 1: Gather Requirements (3-5 min)
- Ask clarifying questions, even if the problem seems clear
- Distinguish between functional and non-functional requirements
- Freeze requirements before proceeding

**Functional Requirements:**
- Critical product features
- What users can do
- Core workflows

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
- Performance (latency, throughput)
- Reliability/Uptime
- Scalability
- Security

#### Step 2: Estimate Scale (5-7 min)
Calculate:
- Daily Active Users (DAU)
- Read/Write ratios
- Requests per second (TPS)
- Storage requirements
- Bandwidth needs

**Formula:**
```
DAU → % that write/read → TPS → Storage requirements
```

#### Step 3: Design Goals (3-5 min)
- Apply CAP Theorem (choose Consistency vs Availability)
- Define latency requirements
- Identify trade-offs

#### Step 4: Single Server Design (15-20 min)
- **Always start with RDBMS** (not NoSQL) unless justified
- Design database schema
- Define API endpoints
- Implement business logic

#### Step 5: Scale & Optimize (15-20 min)
Identify bottlenecks:
- High read TPS → Caching, Read replicas
- High write TPS → Sharding, Message queues
- Single DB → Partition/Shard
- Single server → Load balancer + multiple servers

### 4. Database Design Principles

#### Relational Data Modeling
- **Master Trick:** Underline all NOUNS and VERBS in requirements
  - Nouns → Entities or Attributes
  - Verbs → Status changes or Relationships

#### Relationship Types
- **One-to-Many:** Add foreign key in "many" side
- **Many-to-Many:** Create mapping/junction table
- **Never store lists in a single column** (causes O(n) scans)

#### SQL vs NoSQL Decision Matrix

**Use SQL When:**
- Structured data with clear relationships
- Need ACID transactions (banking, finance)
- Complex queries with JOINs
- Strong consistency required

**Use NoSQL When:**
- Unstructured/semi-structured data
- High write throughput needed
- Horizontal scaling required
- Flexible schema needed

### 5. API Design Best Practices

#### RESTful APIs
- Use plural nouns (not verbs): `GET /products` not `GET /getProducts`
- Support filtering, sorting, pagination via query parameters
- Version APIs: `/api/v1/products`
- Use proper HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
- Return appropriate status codes

#### API Security
- Rate limiting (per endpoint, per user/IP, global)
- CORS configuration
- Parameterized queries (prevent SQL injection)
- Authentication (JWT, OAuth 2.0)
- Authorization (RBAC, ABAC, ACL)

### 6. Scaling Strategies

#### Vertical vs Horizontal Scaling
- **Vertical (Scale Up):** Add resources to existing server
  - Simple, but has hardware limits
- **Horizontal (Scale Out):** Add more servers
  - No hardware limits, fault tolerant, but more complex

#### Load Balancing
- Distribute traffic evenly
- Health checks (detect failed servers)
- Routing algorithms: Round Robin, Weighted, Least Connections, IP Hash
- Layer 4 (faster) vs Layer 7 (more flexible)

#### Caching Strategies
- **Write-Through:** Update cache + DB (consistent, slower writes)
- **Write-Back:** Update cache, async DB (fast, risk of data loss)
- **Write-Around:** Update DB only (cache miss on first read)
- **Cache-Aside:** Check cache, query DB on miss (most common)

#### Consistent Hashing
- Use when servers change frequently
- Minimizes data reshuffling
- Supports replication with virtual nodes

### 7. CAP Theorem & PACELC

**CAP Theorem:** You can only guarantee 2 out of 3:
- **Consistency** - All nodes see same data
- **Availability** - System remains operational
- **Partition Tolerance** - System continues despite network failures

**Reality:** In distributed systems, P is mandatory. Choose between C and A.

**PACELC Extension:**
- If PARTITION: Choose Availability or Consistency
- ELSE: Choose Latency or Consistency

### 8. Security Best Practices

#### Authentication
- Bearer tokens (JWT)
- OAuth 2.0 + JWT
- Access + Refresh tokens
- Single Sign-On (SSO)

#### Authorization
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)
- Access Control Lists (ACL)

#### API Security Techniques
- Rate limiting
- CORS configuration
- SQL/NoSQL injection prevention
- Firewalls (WAF)
- CSRF protection
- XSS prevention

### 9. UI/UX Design Principles

#### Psychology Laws to Apply

**Fitt's Law:**
- Minimum touch target: 44x44px (mobile), 32x32px (desktop)
- Primary CTAs larger than secondary actions
- Place related actions close together

**Hick's Law:**
- Limit navigation items to 5-7 maximum
- Break complex forms into multi-step wizards
- Use progressive disclosure

**Miller's Law:**
- Group content into chunks of 7±2 items
- Use visual separators between groups

**Jakob's Law:**
- Follow platform conventions
- Place navigation where users expect
- Use familiar icons

**Doherty Threshold:**
- Target <400ms for all interactions
- Show loading states immediately
- Use skeleton screens, not spinners

### 10. Interview Mastery Framework

#### 5-Step Interview Process (45-60 min)
1. **Gather Requirements** (3-5 min) - Ask clarifying questions
2. **Estimate Scale** (5-7 min) - Calculate users, TPS, storage
3. **Design Goals** (3-5 min) - Define trade-offs
4. **Single Server Design** (15-20 min) - Schema, APIs, logic
5. **Scale & Optimize** (15-20 min) - Identify bottlenecks, solutions

#### Golden Rules for Interviews

**DO:**
- Use diagrams - Visualize everything
- Start with RDBMS - NoSQL needs justification
- Ask clarifying questions
- State assumptions
- Discuss trade-offs
- Think out loud
- Iterate

**DON'T:**
- Jump to NoSQL without justification
- Say "use Redis" without knowing WHY and HOW
- Over-engineer (YAGNI)
- Skip requirements
- Forget scale estimates
- Ignore failure scenarios

## Quick Reference

### Database Selection
- **PostgreSQL:** Structured data, ACID needed, complex queries
- **MongoDB:** Unstructured, massive scale, low latency
- **Redis:** Caching, sessions, rate limiting

### When to Use What
- **Caching:** Read-heavy, same data accessed often
- **Sharding:** Data too large for single machine
- **Replication:** High availability, read scaling
- **Load Balancer:** Multiple servers, fault tolerance
- **Message Queue:** Async processing, decouple services
- **CDN:** Static content, global users

## Implementation Checklist

- Think about failure scenarios - what if X goes down?
- Use diagrams to visualize architecture
- Estimate numbers early - they guide decisions
