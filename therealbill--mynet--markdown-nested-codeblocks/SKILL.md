## Overview

When markdown contains code blocks inside other code blocks (nested fences), same-length fences break rendering. The k+1 rule solves this: wrap content containing k backticks in a fence of k+1 backticks, or switch the outer fence to tildes.

**Critical:** This rule applies ALWAYS - even under time pressure, even for "quick" documentation, even when you think "it'll probably work." Broken rendering is worse than taking 10 extra seconds to count backticks.

Broken nested fences cause documentation that doesn't render on GitHub/GitLab and code examples visible as plain text.

## The k+1 Rule

**If your content contains a run of k backticks, wrap it in a fence of k+1 backticks (or use tildes).**

```
Inner uses:  ```  (3 backticks)
Outer needs: ```` (4 backticks = 3+1)  OR  ~~~ (tildes)
```

**Rules:**
- Content has ``` (3 backticks) → Use ```` (4 backticks) or ~~~ (3 tildes) for outer fence
- Content has ```` (4 backticks) → Use ````` (5 backticks) or ~~~~ (4 tildes) for outer fence
- Close with the **exact same** fence you opened with (same character, same length)
- You don't need to escape the inner backticks; the longer outer fence makes them literal text

**Mnemonic:** Count inner backticks, add one for outer. Always.

## Common Scenario: Documentation with Code Examples

### ❌ Broken (Same Length Fences)

This markdown breaks because both fences use 3 backticks:

````markdown
```markdown
# Example

```go
func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello")
}
```
```
````

**Problem:** First ``` after opening closes the outer block prematurely. The Go code isn't escaped.

### ✅ Fixed (k+1 Backticks)

Use 4 backticks for outer fence when inner has 3:

`````markdown
````markdown
# Example

```go
func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello")
}
```
````
`````

### ✅ Alternative (Tildes)

Switch outer fence to tildes:

````markdown
~~~markdown
# Example

```go
func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello")
}
```
~~~
````

## Quick Reference

| Inner Content | Outer Fence Options |
|---------------|-------------------|
| ` ``` ` (3 backticks) | ```` (4 backticks) or `~~~` (3 tildes) |
| ` ```` ` (4 backticks) | ````` (5 backticks) or `~~~~` (4 tildes) |
| ` ~~~ ` (3 tildes) | ```` (4 backticks) or `~~~~` (4 tildes) |

## Detection Checklist

Nested code blocks are needed when you're:

- Writing markdown that shows markdown syntax
- Creating tutorials that include code examples
- Documenting how to use code blocks
- Showing examples of configuration files with code in them

## Common Mistakes

### Using Same-Length Fences
`````markdown
# ❌ WRONG
```markdown
Content with ```code``` blocks
```

# ✅ CORRECT
````markdown
Content with ```code``` blocks
````
`````

### Forgetting to Match Closing Fence
`````markdown
# ❌ WRONG - Opening is 4 backticks, closing is 3
````markdown
Content
```

# ✅ CORRECT - Both are 4 backticks
````markdown
Content
````
`````

### Trying to Escape Inner Backticks
`````markdown
# ❌ WRONG - Don't escape, use longer fence
```markdown
Content with \`\`\`code\`\`\` blocks
```

# ✅ CORRECT - Longer outer fence makes inner backticks literal
````markdown
Content with ```code``` blocks
````
`````

## When to Use Tildes vs Longer Backticks

**Use tildes when:**
- Inner content uses backticks (more readable contrast)
- You want to avoid counting backtick length

**Use k+1 backticks when:**
- Consistency with existing codebase style
- Inner content uses tildes
- Both work - choose based on readability

## Constraint: No Exceptions

Apply the k+1 rule on every code fence that contains other code fences. Never use same-length fences for nested blocks regardless of urgency, simplicity, or assumed parser tolerance. There are no cases where skipping this rule is acceptable.
