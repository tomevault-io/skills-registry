# Temporal Upgrade Guide

Safe procedures for upgrading Temporal server, SDKs, and schema versions.

## When to Use

- Planning a Temporal server version upgrade
- Checking SDK compatibility for a server upgrade
- Running schema migrations during upgrade
- Rolling back a failed upgrade
- Upgrading from one major version to another

## Upgrade Planning

### Pre-Upgrade Checklist

1. **Review release notes** for the target version
2. **Check SDK compatibility matrix** - ensure your application SDK versions are compatible
3. **Identify schema migrations** - check if database schema changes are required
4. **Test in staging** - always upgrade a non-production environment first
5. **Plan maintenance window** - coordinate with stakeholders
6. **Prepare rollback procedure** - document how to revert if needed

### Version Compatibility

Follow sequential upgrade paths for major versions. Do not skip major versions:

```
1.21.x -> 1.22.x -> 1.23.x -> 1.24.x
```

Check SDK compatibility before upgrading:

- Go SDK and Python SDK versions must match the server version range
- Review the compatibility matrix in the Temporal release notes
- Update application dependencies before deploying workers against the new server

## Upgrade Process

### 1. Backup Database

Always backup both the main and visibility databases before upgrading:

```bash
pg_dump -h <host> -U temporal temporal > temporal_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql
pg_dump -h <host> -U temporal temporal_visibility > temporal_visibility_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql
```

### 2. Scale Down Application Workers

```bash
kubectl scale deployment <worker-deployment> --replicas=0 -n <app-namespace>
```

Wait for workers to drain active tasks before proceeding.

### 3. Upgrade Temporal Server

```bash
helm repo update
helm upgrade temporal temporal/temporal \
  --namespace temporal \
  -f values.yaml \
  --version <target_version>
```

### 4. Run Schema Migrations (If Required)

Check release notes for migration requirements. Use the `temporal-sql-tool` from the admintools pod to apply versioned schema changes.

### 5. Verify Cluster Health

```bash
temporal operator cluster health
temporal operator cluster describe
kubectl get pods -n temporal
```

### 6. Update SDK and Deploy Workers

Update your application's SDK dependency to a compatible version, then deploy:

```bash
kubectl apply -f worker-deployment.yaml
kubectl rollout status deployment/<worker-deployment> -n <app-namespace>
```

### 7. Post-Upgrade Verification

- All Temporal pods running
- Cluster health check passes
- Workers connected and processing tasks
- Test workflow completes successfully
- Monitoring dashboards show normal metrics

## Rollback Procedure

If issues occur after upgrading:

1. **Rollback Helm release**: `helm rollback temporal <previous-revision> -n temporal`
2. **Restore database** (if schema changed): restore from backup
3. **Redeploy previous workers**: `kubectl rollout undo deployment/<worker> -n <app-namespace>`

## Common Upgrade Issues

- **Pod startup failures**: Check init container logs, verify schema compatibility, review resource limits
- **Schema migration errors**: Verify database connectivity, check admintools logs
- **SDK incompatibility**: Update SDK to a version compatible with the new server, check for deprecated API usage
- **Non-determinism after upgrade**: New server versions may change default behavior; review workflow replay compatibility

- Use `/tl-upgrade` command for interactive upgrade planning
- Use the `temporal-ops` agent for operational guidance during upgrades
- See `versioning-guide` skill for workflow versioning during SDK updates
