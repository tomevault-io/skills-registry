# Agentic Workspace Skill

Expert guide for designing and implementing SOTA agentic architectures in multi-project
VS Code workspaces. Covers the full stack: agents, skills, instructions, prompts, context
engineering, and the interplay between them.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Progressive Disclosure (Token Efficiency)
Context is expensive. Load the minimum at startup, expand on demand:

| Tier | What | When | Token Budget |
|------|------|------|-------------|
| **Metadata** | `name` + `description` | Always (startup) | ~100 tokens/skill |
| **Instructions** | Full `SKILL.md` body | On activation | < 5 000 tokens |
| **Resources** | `references/`, `scripts/`, `assets/` | On demand | As needed |

**Rule:** Every piece of context should earn its token cost. Challenge each element: "Does this justify its presence?"

### 2. Layered Context Architecture
Context flows from general to specific. More specific layers override less specific ones.

```
Layer 1  User-level instructions     (~/.agents/skills/, VS Code userdata)
Layer 2  Repository root             AGENTS.md + .github/copilot-instructions.md
Layer 3  Project root                project/AGENTS.md (nearest-file-wins)
Layer 4  Path-specific instructions  .github/instructions/*.instructions.md (applyTo globs)
Layer 5  Skills (triggered)          ~/.agents/skills/ + .github/skills/ (on activation)
Layer 6  Agents (when invoked)       .github/agents/*.agent.md
Layer 7  Prompts (when invoked)      .github/prompts/*.prompt.md
```

**Nearest-file-wins:** The nearest `AGENTS.md` in the directory tree takes precedence.

### 3. Separation of Concerns

| Artifact | Purpose | Scope | Activation |
|----------|---------|-------|------------|
| **Skill** | Reusable capability with scripts/resources | CrossProject portable | Dynamically by task relevance |
| **Instruction** | Project-specific coding rules | Path-scoped or repo-wide | Auto by file match (`applyTo`) |
| **Prompt** | Reusable template for specific task | Workspace or user | Manually invoked |
| **Agent** | Role/persona with tools + handoffs | Workspace or user | Manually selected or via handoff |
| **AGENTS.md** | Context index and entry point for agents | Per directory tree | Always included |

## Protocol — Setting Up an Agentic Workspace

### Step 1 — Audit Current State
- List all existing `.agent.md`, `SKILL.md`, `.instructions.md`, `.prompt.md`, `AGENTS.md` files
- Map the project structure (monorepo? multi-root? packages?)
- Identify duplications, gaps, and context pollution risks
- Check if global skills (`~/.agents/skills/`) are in lock file

### Step 2 — Design the Agent Hierarchy
Choose the right architecture pattern (see `references/architecture-patterns.md`):
- **Linear Pipeline**: Research → Plan → Implement → Review (simple, predictable)
- **Orchestrator-Workers**: Supervisor routes to specialists (flexible, SOTA for complex tasks)
- **Swarm/Handoffs**: Lightweight specialist handoffs (good for well-defined roles)

For most workspaces: **Orchestrator at root** + **specialists per project/domain**.

### Step 3 — Define Agent Taxonomy

```
Root (shared across all projects)
├── Orchestrator  — task analysis + routing
├── Research      — web + codebase research, freshness validation
├── Plan          — read-only exploration + structured planning
└── Review        — QA, architecture compliance, testing validation

Project-specific (override or extend root agents)
├── Deploy        — deployment workflows
├── Migration     — database/API migrations
└── <domain>      — domain-specific specialist
```

**Tool scoping by agent role:**
- Research: `['search', 'fetch', 'codebase', 'problems']` — read-only
- Plan: `['search', 'codebase', 'problems']` — read-only
- Review: `['search', 'codebase', 'problems', 'diagnostics']` — read-only
- Implement: `['editFile', 'createFile', 'terminal', 'search', 'codebase']` — full access
- Orchestrator: `['search', 'codebase']` — routing only (minimal tools)

### Step 4 — Design the Skill Ecosystem

```
Global skills (~/.agents/skills/)        — cross-project, install via skills.sh or manual
Project skills (.github/skills/)         — project-specific, committed to repo
```

**Decision criteria:**
- Will this skill be useful in >1 project? → Global
- Is this tightly coupled to this project's stack? → Project-local
- Does it need scripts or data files? → Use `scripts/`, `references/`, `assets/` subdirs

### Step 5 — Write Instructions (Path-Specific Context Injection)

Instructions auto-activate based on `applyTo` glob patterns. Cover every significant directory:

```yaml
# Standard instruction set for a TypeScript project
applyTo: "src/core/**"          → domain rules (zero deps, Result pattern)
applyTo: "src/adapters/**"      → adapter rules (implement ports, DI injection)  
applyTo: "src/cli/**"           → CLI conventions (framework, one-file-per-command)
applyTo: "**/tests/**"          → test rules (Vitest, no infra deps for unit tests)
applyTo: "**/*.test.ts"         → same as above
```

### Step 6 — Write AGENTS.md Files

One per project + one at monorepo root (if applicable):
- **Root AGENTS.md**: Monorepo index (projects, shared agents, global skills, architecture)
- **Project AGENTS.md**: Project-specific details (stack, commands, build/test, local skills)

See `references/agents-md-template.md` for templates.

### Step 7 — Connect to MCP and VS Code

- Add `.vscode/mcp.json` for MCP server auto-discovery
- Add `chat.agentFilesLocations` in `settings.json` if agents live in non-standard paths
- Ensure `copilot-instructions.md` is in root `.github/` for GitHub-hosted projects

### Step 8 — Verify

Checklist before considering the agentic setup complete:
- [ ] Nearest-file-wins works (test by opening files in different subprojects)
- [ ] All agents appear in Copilot Chat agents dropdown
- [ ] Skills trigger correctly by description keyword match
- [ ] Instructions activate only for matching `applyTo` patterns
- [ ] AGENTS.md at each level is non-redundant with parent AGENTS.md
- [ ] No secrets or credentials in any agent/skill/instruction file
- [ ] Tool scoping is correct (read-only agents can't edit files)

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Duplicate AGENTS.md at multiple levels with same content | Context confusion, drift risk | Root = index, project = detail, no duplication |
| Monolithic agent doing Research + Plan + Review | Violates SRP, context bloat | Split into specialized agents with handoffs |
| Hardcoded project info in global skills | Global skills become un-reusable | Keep global skills generic, project context in local skills |
| Missing `applyTo` on instructions | Instructions activate everywhere, pollute context | Always set `applyTo` to narrowest appropriate glob |
| Agent with all tools (editFile + search + terminal) | No guardrails, risky agent | Scope tools by role (read-only for Research/Plan/Review) |
| Skills > 500 lines in SKILL.md | Context overload | Move detail to `references/` subdirectory |
| Prompts tightly coupled to one agent | Reduces reusability | Use `agent: "agent"` default, or bind explicitly per use case |
| No handoff graph | Agents are isolated silos | Define explicit handoffs with clear labels and prompts |
