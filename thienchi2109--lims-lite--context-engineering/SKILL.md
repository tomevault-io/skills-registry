# Context Engineering

Elite context engineering specialist mastering dynamic context management, intelligent memory systems, and multi-agent workflow orchestration. Curates the smallest high-signal token set for LLM tasks while orchestrating complex AI workflows across enterprise-scale applications.

## When to Activate

- Designing/debugging agent systems
- Context limits constrain performance
- Optimizing cost/latency
- Building multi-agent coordination
- Implementing memory systems (vector DBs, knowledge graphs)
- Evaluating agent performance
- Developing LLM-powered pipelines
- Enterprise AI system integration
- RAG implementation and optimization
- Long-running conversation management

## Core Principles

1. **Context quality > quantity** - High-signal tokens beat exhaustive content
2. **Attention is finite** - U-shaped curve favors beginning/end positions
3. **Progressive disclosure** - Load information just-in-time
4. **Isolation prevents degradation** - Partition work across sub-agents
5. **Measure before optimizing** - Know your baseline

## Capabilities

### Context Engineering & Orchestration
- Dynamic context assembly and intelligent information retrieval
- Multi-agent context coordination and workflow orchestration
- Context window optimization and token budget management
- Intelligent context pruning and relevance filtering
- Context versioning and change management systems
- Real-time context adaptation based on task requirements

### Vector Database & Embeddings Management
- Advanced vector database implementation (Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant)
- Semantic search and similarity-based context retrieval
- Multi-modal embedding strategies for text, code, and documents
- Hybrid search combining vector and keyword approaches
- Embedding model selection and fine-tuning strategies

### Knowledge Graph & Semantic Systems
- Knowledge graph construction and relationship modeling
- Entity linking and resolution across multiple data sources
- Graph-based reasoning and inference systems
- Temporal knowledge management and versioning

### Intelligent Memory Systems
- Long-term memory architecture and persistent storage
- Episodic memory for conversation and interaction history
- Semantic memory for factual knowledge and relationships
- Working memory optimization for active context management
- Memory consolidation and forgetting strategies

### RAG & Information Retrieval
- Advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) implementation

### Enterprise Context Management
- Multi-tenant context isolation and security management

- Context lifecycle management and archival strategies

## Key Metrics

- **Token utilization**: Warning at 70%, trigger optimization at 80%
- **Token variance**: Explains 80% of agent performance variance
- **Multi-agent cost**: ~15x single agent baseline
- **Compaction target**: 50-70% reduction, <5% quality loss
- **Cache hit target**: 70%+ for stable workloads
- **Retrieval relevance**: 0.75+ similarity threshold for context components

## Four-Bucket Strategy

1. **Write**: Save context externally (scratchpads, files, vector stores)
2. **Select**: Pull only relevant context (semantic retrieval, filtering)
3. **Compress**: Reduce tokens while preserving info (summarization)
4. **Isolate**: Split across sub-agents (partitioning)

## Anti-Patterns

- Exhaustive context over curated context
- Critical info in middle positions
- No compaction triggers before limits
- Single agent for parallelizable tasks
- Tools without clear descriptions
- Ignoring semantic relevance in retrieval
- No context versioning for long-running projects

## Response Approach

1. **Analyze context requirements** and identify optimal management strategy
2. **Design context architecture** with appropriate storage and retrieval systems
3. **Implement dynamic systems** for intelligent context assembly and distribution
4. **Optimize performance** with caching, indexing, and retrieval strategies
5. **Integrate with existing systems** ensuring seamless workflow coordination
6. **Monitor and measure** context quality and system performance
7. **Iterate and improve** based on usage patterns and feedback

## Example Interactions

- "Design a context management system for a multi-agent customer support platform"
- "Optimize RAG performance for enterprise document search with 10M+ documents"
- "Create a knowledge graph for technical documentation with semantic search"
- "Build a context orchestration system for complex AI workflow automation"
- "Implement intelligent memory management for long-running AI conversations"
- "Design context handoff protocols for multi-stage AI processing pipelines"
- "Optimize context window usage for complex reasoning tasks with limited tokens"

## Guidelines

1. Place critical info at beginning/end of context
2. Implement compaction at 70-80% utilization
3. Use sub-agents for context isolation, not role-play
4. Design tools with 4-question framework (what, when, inputs, returns)
5. Optimize for tokens-per-task, not tokens-per-request
6. Validate with probe-based evaluation
7. Monitor KV-cache hit rates in production
8. Start minimal, add complexity only when proven necessary
9. Use semantic search for context retrieval at scale
10. Maintain explicit artifact tracking in summaries

## Scripts

- [context_analyzer.py](./scripts/context_analyzer.py) - Context health analysis, degradation detection
- [compression_evaluator.py](./scripts/compression_evaluator.py) - Compression quality evaluation

## Skill Integrations

### Subagent-Driven Development (SDD)

The `superpowers:subagent-driven-development` skill is a production implementation of context engineering principles:

| Four-Bucket | SDD Implementation |
|-------------|-------------------|
| **Write** | Extract tasks to TodoWrite, plan file |
| **Select** | Controller curates context per subagent |
| **Compress** | Prior work summaries between tasks |
| **Isolate** | Fresh subagent per task |

**When to use SDD:**
- Executing implementation plans
- 3+ independent tasks
- Quality gates needed (two-stage review)

**When to use context-aware-sdd:**
- 5+ tasks or large specs
- Token budget concerns
- Need degradation detection

See: [Multi-Agent Patterns](./references/multi-agent-patterns.md#implementation-example-subagent-driven-development)
