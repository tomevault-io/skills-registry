Browser-based UI testing with Playwright, Puppeteer, Cypress, and accessibility tools.

## Install Playwright

```bash
# Install Playwright and browsers
npm init playwright@latest
npx playwright install --with-deps

# Install specific browser only
npx playwright install chromium
```

## Run Playwright tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npx playwright test

# Run specific test file
npx playwright test tests/login.spec.ts

# Run in headed mode (visible browser)
npx playwright test --headed

# Run in specific browser
npx playwright test --project=chromium
npx playwright test --project=firefox
npx playwright test --project=webkit

# Run with debug inspector
npx playwright test --debug
```

## Generate tests from URL

```bash
# Open codegen to record interactions
npx playwright codegen https://example.com

# Save generated test to a file
npx playwright codegen --output tests/generated.spec.ts https://example.com

# Codegen with specific viewport
npx playwright codegen --viewport-size=1280,720 https://example.com
```

## Screenshot page

```bash
# Take a screenshot of a URL
npx playwright screenshot --full-page https://example.com screenshot.png

# Screenshot with specific viewport
npx playwright screenshot --viewport-size=1280,720 https://example.com screenshot.png
```

## Visual regression

```bash
# Run Playwright tests with snapshot comparison
npx playwright test --update-snapshots

# Compare screenshots (expects toHaveScreenshot in tests)
npx playwright test tests/visual.spec.ts

# Show visual diff report
