# Designing Tests

## Test Implementation Workflow

Copy this checklist and track progress:

```
Test Implementation Progress:
- [ ] Step 1: Identify what to test
- [ ] Step 2: Select appropriate test type
- [ ] Step 3: Write tests following templates
- [ ] Step 4: Run tests and verify passing
- [ ] Step 5: Check coverage meets targets
- [ ] Step 6: Fix any failing tests
```

## Testing Pyramid

Apply the testing pyramid for balanced coverage:

```
        /\
       /  \     E2E Tests (10%)
      /----\    - Critical user journeys
     /      \   - Slow but comprehensive
    /--------\  Integration Tests (20%)
   /          \ - Component interactions
  /------------\ - API contracts
 /              \ Unit Tests (70%)
/________________\ - Fast, isolated
                   - Business logic focus
```

## Framework Selection

### JavaScript/TypeScript
| Type | Recommended | Alternative |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| Unit | Vitest | Jest |
| Integration | Vitest + MSW | Jest + SuperTest |
| E2E | Playwright | Cypress |
| Component | Testing Library | Enzyme |

### Python
| Type | Recommended | Alternative |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| Unit | pytest | unittest |
| Integration | pytest + httpx | pytest + requests |
| E2E | Playwright | Selenium |
| API | pytest + FastAPI TestClient | - |

### Go
| Type | Recommended |
|------|-------------|
| Unit | testing + testify |
| Integration | testing + httptest |
| E2E | testing + chromedp |

## Coverage Strategy

### What to Cover
- ✅ Business logic (100%)
- ✅ Edge cases and error handling (90%+)
- ✅ API contracts (100%)
- ✅ Critical user paths (E2E)
- ⚠️ UI components (snapshot + interaction)
- ❌ Third-party library internals
- ❌ Simple getters/setters

### Coverage Thresholds
```json
{
  "coverageThreshold": {
    "global": {
      "branches": 80,
      "functions": 80,
      "lines": 80,
      "statements": 80
    },
    "src/core/": {
      "branches": 95,
      "functions": 95
    }
  }
}
```


## Mocking Strategy

### When to Mock
- ✅ External APIs and services
- ✅ Database in unit tests
- ✅ Time/Date for determinism
- ✅ Random values
- ❌ Internal modules (usually)
- ❌ The code under test

## Test Validation Loop

After writing tests, run this validation:

```
Test Validation:
- [ ] All tests pass: `npm test`
- [ ] Coverage meets thresholds: `npm test -- --coverage`
- [ ] No flaky tests (run multiple times)
- [ ] Tests are independent (order doesn't matter)
- [ ] Test names clearly describe behavior
```

If any tests fail, fix them before proceeding. If coverage is below target, add more tests for uncovered code paths.
