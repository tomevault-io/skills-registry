# Platform Setup

Set up the Harness Platform account baseline using the `harness-platform-setup` module.

**Module directory:** `harness-platform-setup/`

$ARGUMENTS

## What This Creates

- **Shared Resource Access** role — grants access to account-level shared resources
- **Harness Account Admins** user group with account_admin role binding
- **All Account Users** group updated with Shared Resource Access role binding
- **OPA Governance Policies:**
  - Enforce Template Version Schema (templates must use `v{number}` versioning)
  - Enforce Harness API Token Age (30-day maximum age)

## Required Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Harness Account ID | **Yes** | Your Harness account identifier |
| Platform URL | No | Defaults to `https://app.harness.io/gateway` for SaaS |
| Tags | No | Custom resource tags |

## Steps

1. **Auto-detect** the account ID from `HARNESS_ACCOUNT_ID` env var. If not set, ask the user.

2. **Ask:**
   - Are you using Harness SaaS (app.harness.io) or a self-managed instance?
   - Any custom tags to add to resources? (optional)

3. **Generate `terraform.tfvars`** in `harness-platform-setup/` with the collected values.

4. **Ensure `providers.tf` exists** — copy from `providers.tf.example` at repo root if missing.

5. **Run `tofu init`** in the module directory.

6. **Run `tofu plan`** and present results in plain language:
   - "This will create X roles, Y user groups, and Z OPA governance policies at the account level."

7. **Ask for confirmation**, then run `tofu apply -auto-approve -var-file=terraform.tfvars`.

8. **Show results** and next steps:
   - "Account baseline is configured. Next, create an organization with `/harness-factory:org-setup`."

## Prerequisites

- None — this is the first module in the dependency chain
