# Deployment Status

Check the deployment state across all Harness Factory modules.

$ARGUMENTS

## Steps

1. **List all modules and their status:**
   ```bash
   bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/list-modules.sh
   ```

2. **For each deployed module, read detailed state:**
   ```bash
   bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/read-state.sh <module-name>
   ```

3. **Present a summary table:**

   | Module | Status | Resources | Key Outputs |
   |--------|--------|-----------|-------------|
   | harness-platform-setup | Deployed/Not deployed | N | ... |
   | harness-organization | ... | ... | org_id = ... |
   | ... | ... | ... | ... |

4. **Show dependency-aware recommendations:**
   - Which modules can be deployed next (all dependencies satisfied)
   - Which modules are blocked (missing prerequisites)
   - Group by category: Platform, CI, Security, CCM, etc.

5. **If a specific module is mentioned**, show detailed state:
   - Full resource list
   - All output values
   - Last modified timestamp
   - What depends on this module

## Status Legend

- **Deployed** — terraform state exists with resources
- **Configured** — tfvars generated but not yet applied
- **Not deployed** — no configuration or state
