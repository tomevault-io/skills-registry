# Content Harness — From the Temple

This skill helps Thiago Temple produce high-quality content that matches his established voice, structure, and standards. It works in two modes and handles both content types (articles and newsletter issues).

## First: Load the Guidelines

Before doing anything else, read the content guidelines:

```
Read docs/content-guidelines.md
```

This file is located relative to the project root (the SvelteKit site at `src/thitemple.me/`). It contains the voice principles, anti-patterns, structural rules, editing checklist, and newsletter-specific rules that define Thiago's writing. Everything in this skill references those guidelines. If the guidelines file is not found, ask the user where it is — the skill cannot function without it.

---

## Determine Mode

Ask the user or infer from context:

**EVALUATE mode** — The user has a draft (or near-final content) and wants quality feedback.

- Trigger phrases: "review", "check", "evaluate", "feedback", "how does this look", "is this ready"
- Output: Structured scorecard with pass/fail rubrics, specific line-level feedback, and an overall verdict

**ASSIST mode** — The user has rough notes, an outline, or a partial draft and wants help shaping it into finished content.

- Trigger phrases: "help me write", "flesh this out", "turn this into", "I have some notes", "rough draft"
- Output: A polished draft that sounds like Thiago, with annotations explaining key choices

If unclear, ask: "Do you want me to evaluate what you have, or help you build it out?"

---

## Determine Content Type

Identify whether this is an **article** or a **newsletter issue**:

- Articles are long-form (typically 1000-2000+ words), single-topic deep dives
- Newsletter issues have three sections: "What's on my mind", "Worth your time", "From me lately"

If the content type isn't obvious from context, ask.

## EVALUATE Mode

### Step 1: Read the Draft

Read the full draft. If it's a file path, use the Read tool. If it's pasted in the conversation, work from that.

### Step 2: Run the Rubrics

Score each rubric as PASS, SOFT FAIL, or FAIL. A SOFT FAIL means the issue is present but minor — it won't tank the piece but should be fixed.

For the full rubric definitions, read: `references/rubrics.md`

Summary of rubrics:

**Universal (R1-R7):** Voice Match, Reader Test, Value Signal, No Generic Content, No Self-Indulgence, Over-Qualifying Language, Sections Earn Space

**Article-specific (R8-R10):** Front-Loaded Value, Traps Before Solutions, Thesis Anchor

**Newsletter-specific (R11-R13):** Three Sections Present, Curated Links Have Context, Scannable in 5 Minutes

### Step 3: Compile the Scorecard

Present results in this format:

```
## Content Evaluation: [Title]
Type: [Article / Newsletter Issue #X]

### Scorecard
R1  Voice Match              [PASS/SOFT FAIL/FAIL]  — [one-line explanation]
R2  Reader Test              [PASS/SOFT FAIL/FAIL]  — [one-line explanation]
R3  Value Signal             [PASS/SOFT FAIL/FAIL]  — [one-line explanation]
R4  No Generic Content       [PASS/SOFT FAIL/FAIL]  — [one-line explanation]
R5  No Self-Indulgence       [PASS/SOFT FAIL/FAIL]  — [one-line explanation]
R6  Over-Qualifying Language [PASS/SOFT FAIL/FAIL]  — [one-line explanation]
R7  Sections Earn Space      [PASS/SOFT FAIL/FAIL]  — [one-line explanation]
[R8-R10 for articles / R11-R13 for newsletters]

### Line-Level Feedback
[Specific passages that need attention, with suggested rewrites where helpful]

### Verdict
[SHIP / REVISE / RETHINK]
```

Verdict definitions:

- **SHIP**: All rubrics pass or soft-fail only. Minor polish needed at most.
- **REVISE**: 1-2 hard fails. Fixable without major restructuring.
- **RETHINK**: 3+ hard fails or a fundamental voice/value problem.

### Step 4: Offer to Help Fix

After presenting the scorecard, offer: "Want me to help fix the issues I flagged? I can switch to assist mode and work through the revisions with you."

---

## ASSIST Mode

### Step 1: Understand What Exists

Ask for or read the raw material. This could be rough notes, bullet points, a partial draft, a voice memo transcript, or just a topic idea.

### Step 2: Clarify the Piece

Before writing, confirm:

- **Content type**: Article or newsletter issue?
- **Core lesson or insight**: What's the one thing the reader should take away?
- **Personal experience**: Is there a specific story or example from Thiago's experience that anchors this?

If the user doesn't have a personal story, note that the piece may need one and ask. The guidelines are clear: personal experience should serve as evidence for a transferable lesson.

### Step 3: Draft or Reshape

Write the content following the guidelines. The voice calibration checklist:

- Use contractions naturally ("I'm", "don't", "it's")
- Short paragraphs (2-4 sentences)
- Specific over abstract — name the tool, the project, the situation
- Cut throat-clearing intros
- One qualifier per paragraph max
- Be opinionated — take a position and back it up
- Personal stories serve the lesson, never the other way around

For detailed structural guidance per content type, read: `references/structure-guide.md`

### Step 4: Annotate Key Choices

After presenting the draft, briefly explain 2-3 key structural or voice choices. This helps Thiago decide if the choices fit. Keep annotations to 1-2 sentences each.

Example: "I opened with the server migration story because it sets up the 'familiar vs. new' tension before the lesson. If you have a stronger personal example, swap it in."

### Step 5: Self-Evaluate

Run the EVALUATE rubrics on your own draft before presenting it. If any rubric hard-fails, fix it first. Present the draft only when it would score SHIP or REVISE with soft fails only.

Note in your response: "I ran this through the evaluation rubrics — here's how it scored: [brief summary]."

---

## Edge Cases

**Content that's already good:** Don't manufacture feedback. If it passes all rubrics, say so. It's okay for the scorecard to be all green.

**Raw notes too thin to draft from:** Don't fabricate content. Ask for the missing pieces: "I need a bit more to work with. What's the specific experience or lesson you want to anchor this around?"

**Breaking from usual structure:** The guidelines say structure should evolve. Evaluate against voice and value rubrics but be flexible on structural ones. Note in the scorecard why the deviation works.

**Topic outside usual expertise:** Flag it: "This topic is outside your usual territory. The piece will need stronger evidence or a clearer 'I'm learning this too' framing to maintain credibility."
