# Orchestrating Workflows

## Workflows

| Command | Workflow Reference                                |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `/code` | `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/code-workflow.md` |
| `/fix`  | `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/fix-workflow.md`  |

## Patterns

| Pattern         | Reference                                                                    |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| IDR Generation  | [hooks/lifecycle/idr-pre-commit.sh](../../hooks/lifecycle/idr-pre-commit.sh) |
| TDD Cycle       | `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/tdd-cycle.md`                                |
| Test Generation | `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/test-generation.md`                          |

## Quality Gates

| Gate         | Target           | Verification                               |
| ------------ | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Tests        | All passing      | `npm test` exit code 0                     |
| Lint         | 0 errors         | `npm run lint` exit code 0                 |
| Types        | No errors        | `tsc --noEmit` exit code 0                 |
| Coverage     | C0 ≥90%, C1 ≥80% | Coverage report                            |
| Test Quality | ≥70              | `test-quality-evaluator` (skip if no Spec) |

### Test Quality Gate

When a Spec with Test Scenarios exists, spawn `test-quality-evaluator` as a
background agent:

```
Agent(subagent_type: "test-quality-evaluator",
      prompt: "spec_path: <path>\ntest_paths: <paths>",
      run_in_background: true)
```

Score ≥70 → pass. Score <70 → report uncovered/excess/intent issues, fix before
proceeding. Skip when no Spec exists (e.g., `/fix`, ad-hoc changes).

### Review Gate

After RGRC cycles, spawn `code-quality-reviewer` as a background agent:

```
Agent(subagent_type: "code-quality-reviewer",
      prompt: "Review files changed in this session: <paths>",
      run_in_background: true)
```

High severity → fix before Quality Gates. Medium/low → advisory (note in IDR).
Skip for `/fix` and single-file changes.

### Gate Result Output

```text
Tests:        pass | fail (detail)
Lint:         pass | fail (detail)
Types:        pass | fail (detail)
Coverage:     C0 XX% / C1 XX% — pass | fail
Test Quality: XX/100 — pass | skip (no Spec)
```

All 5 lines required. Empty lines indicate a skipped gate — investigate before
proceeding.

## Rationalization Counters

| Excuse                                   | Counter                                                        |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Tests pass, lint can wait"              | Lint errors are tech debt. Zero errors before commit           |
| "Type errors are just warnings"          | `tsc --noEmit` exit 0 or no ship. Type warnings are errors     |
| "Coverage is close enough"               | "Close enough" is failure with extra steps. Meet the threshold |
| "This gate doesn't apply to this change" | All 4 gates apply to every change. No exceptions               |
