# Sync Specs from Session

Analyze the current session context to identify implemented features, compare with existing SPECLAN specifications, and create or update specs based on user confirmation.

## Core Principle: Implementation-Agnostic Specs

**SPECS MUST NEVER CONTAIN IMPLEMENTATION OR ARCHITECTURE DETAILS.** This skill analyzes code changes internally to understand WHAT was built, but specs describe only user-facing capabilities and business value. Never include file paths, code references, library names, technical approaches, architectural decisions, design patterns, or any implementation-specific information in generated specs.

## When to Use

- After completing implementation work and wanting to document it
- When user asks to sync or update specs based on recent work
- To capture newly implemented functionality in SPECLAN format

## Workflow Overview

```
1. Analyze Session → 2. Scan Speclan → 3. Compare & Diff → 4. Ask User → 5. Apply Changes
```

## Step 1: Analyze Session Context

Review the conversation history to identify:

### 1.1 Code Changes Made (Internal Analysis)

Look for patterns indicating implementation (for internal matching only - these details are NOT included in specs):
- Files created or modified (Write/Edit tool usage)
- Functions, classes, or components added
- API endpoints implemented
- Database schema changes
- Configuration updates

**Purpose:** Use these implementation signals to identify WHAT was built, then translate into user-facing capability descriptions for specs.

### 1.2 Extract Feature Information

For each identified change, extract:

```yaml
feature_candidate:
  title: "<descriptive name>"
  description: "<what it does for users and why it matters>"
  _code_paths: ["<files involved>"]  # INTERNAL USE ONLY - for matching, never included in specs
  type: "new" | "enhancement" | "bugfix"
  scope: "feature" | "requirement" | "both"
```

**Note:** `_code_paths` is used internally to match session work to existing specs. It is NEVER written to spec files.

### 1.3 Categorize Changes

Group related changes into logical features:
- Multiple file changes for one feature = single feature
- Independent changes = separate features
- Small fixes to existing features = requirement updates

## Step 2: Scan Speclan Directory

### 2.1 Detect Speclan Location

```bash
# Check common locations
if [ -d "speclan" ]; then
  SPECLAN_DIR="speclan"
elif [ -d "specs/speclan" ]; then
  SPECLAN_DIR="specs/speclan"
else
  # No speclan directory - all features are new
  SPECLAN_DIR=""
fi
```

### 2.2 Index Existing Specs

If speclan directory exists, build an index:

```bash
# List all features
find "$SPECLAN_DIR/features" -name "F-*.md" -type f 2>/dev/null

# Extract titles and paths
for f in $(find "$SPECLAN_DIR/features" -name "F-*.md" -type f); do
  id=$(grep "^id:" "$f" | head -1 | cut -d: -f2 | tr -d ' ')
  title=$(grep "^title:" "$f" | head -1 | cut -d: -f2-)
  echo "$id|$title|$f"
done
```

### 2.3 Build Existing Spec Map

Create a mapping of:
- Feature ID → Title → File path (spec file location, not code)
- Feature ID → Status (for edit rules)
- Feature ID → Key capabilities (for semantic matching)

**Note:** Use titles and capability descriptions for matching, not code paths. Well-formed specs should not contain implementation or architecture references.

## Step 3: Compare and Generate Diff

### 3.1 Match Session Work to Existing Specs

For each feature candidate from session:

1. **Title similarity check**: Compare with existing feature titles
2. **Capability overlap**: Check if the described functionality matches existing features
3. **Description similarity**: Semantic comparison of purpose and user-facing behavior

**Note:** Matching is based on functional capabilities and user outcomes, not on code paths, implementation details, or architectural decisions.

### 3.2 Classify Each Change

| Session Feature | Existing Spec | Classification |
|-----------------|---------------|----------------|
| New capability | No match | **CREATE** new feature |
| Related capability | Match found, status editable | **UPDATE** existing feature |
| Related capability | Match found, status locked | **CHANGE_REQUEST** needed |
| Enhancement | Partial match | **ADD_REQUIREMENT** to feature |

### 3.3 Prepare Change Summary

Build a structured summary:

```yaml
# NOTE: _code_paths are INTERNAL ONLY for matching - never written to specs
changes:
  create:
    - title: "User Authentication"
      description: "Secure login with automatic session refresh"
      _code_paths: ["src/auth/", "src/middleware/auth.ts"]  # internal matching only

  update:
    - id: "F-1142"
      title: "Pet Management"
      changes: "Added bulk import capability for pet records"
      _code_paths: ["src/pets/import.ts"]  # internal matching only

  change_requests:
    - parent_id: "F-1089"
      title: "Add Export Feature"
      reason: "Feature is in-development status"

  requirements:
    - feature_id: "F-1142"
      title: "Validate CSV format on import"
      _code_paths: ["src/pets/validators/csv.ts"]  # internal matching only
```

## Step 4: Ask User for Confirmation

Present the identified changes to the user using AskUserQuestion or direct prompting.

### 4.1 Summary Format

```markdown
## Identified Changes from Session

Based on our session, I identified the following potential spec updates:

### New Features to Create
1. **User Authentication** - Secure login with automatic session refresh

### Existing Features to Update
1. **F-1142 Pet Management** - Add bulk import capability for pet records
   - Current status: draft (editable)

### Change Requests Needed
1. **F-1089 Data Export** - Feature is locked (in-development)
   - Proposed: Add export option for user data

### New Requirements
1. For **F-1142**: Validate file format on import
```

**IMPORTANT:** Keep descriptions implementation-agnostic (see `references/implementation-agnostic-guidelines.md`).

### 4.2 Ask for User Selection

Use AskUserQuestion to let user choose:

```yaml
questions:
  - question: "Which changes would you like to apply to specs?"
    header: "Apply"
    multiSelect: true
    options:
      - label: "Create: User Authentication"
        description: "New feature for secure login with session refresh"
      - label: "Update: F-1142 Pet Management"
        description: "Add bulk import capability to existing feature"
      - label: "CR for F-1089: Data Export"
        description: "Create change request for locked feature"
      - label: "Requirement for F-1142"
        description: "Add file format validation requirement"
```

### 4.3 Handle User Response

- **Selected items**: Proceed to create/update
- **"Other" response**: User may provide custom instructions
- **No selection**: Skip spec updates

## Step 5: Apply Changes

### 5.1 Generate IDs

For new entities, generate collision-free IDs:

```bash
SCRIPT="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/speclan-id-generator/scripts/generate-id.mjs"

# Generate a feature ID
FEATURE_ID=$(node "$SCRIPT" --type feature --speclan-root "$SPECLAN_DIR" | jq -r '.data.ids[0]')

# Generate a requirement ID under a parent feature
REQ_ID=$(node "$SCRIPT" --type requirement --parent "$FEATURE_ID" --speclan-root "$SPECLAN_DIR" | jq -r '.data.ids[0]')
```

### 5.2 Create New Features

For each new feature:

1. **Create directory structure:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p "$SPECLAN_DIR/features/F-####-slug"
   mkdir -p "$SPECLAN_DIR/features/F-####-slug/requirements"
   ```

2. **Write feature file** with YAML frontmatter:
   ```yaml
   ---
   id: F-####
   type: feature
   title: <Title>
   status: under-test
   owner: <from session or "Developer">
   created: "<ISO-8601>"
   updated: "<ISO-8601>"
   goals: []
   ---

   # <Title>

   ## Overview
   <Description from session analysis - focus on WHAT and WHY, not HOW>

   ## Scope
   <Bullet points of functionality - user-facing capabilities, not code details>
   ```

Specs must be 100% implementation and architecture agnostic. For the complete DO/DON'T list with examples, consult `references/implementation-agnostic-guidelines.md`.

### 5.3 Update Existing Features

For features with editable status (draft, review, approved):

1. **Read current file**
2. **Update relevant sections:**
   - Add new scope items (user-facing capabilities only)
   - Update description if needed (keep implementation-agnostic)
3. **Update `updated` timestamp**
4. **Write file back**

**Remember:** Never add implementation details, architecture decisions, code references, or technical approaches to existing specs.

### 5.4 Create Change Requests

For locked entities (features or requirements in-development, under-test, released):

1. **Generate CR ID:**
   ```bash
   CR_ID=$(node "$SCRIPT" --type change-request --speclan-root "$SPECLAN_DIR" | jq -r '.data.ids[0]')
   ```

2. **Create CR file:**
   ```yaml
   ---
   id: CR-####
   type: changeRequest
   title: <Change title>
   status: under-test
   owner: Developer
   created: "<ISO-8601>"
   updated: "<ISO-8601>"
   parentId: <F-#### or R-####>
   parentType: <feature or requirement>
   changeType: enhancement
   description: <Brief description - user-facing, no implementation details>
   changes: |
     <Detailed change narrative - describe WHAT changes for users, not HOW it's implemented>
   ---
   ```

   **Note:** Change request descriptions must also be implementation-agnostic (see guidelines).

3. **Place in correct location (adjacent to target entity):**
   ```
   # For features:
   speclan/features/F-####-slug/change-requests/CR-####-slug.md

   # For requirements:
   speclan/features/.../requirements/R-####-slug/change-requests/CR-####-slug.md
   ```

### 5.5 Create New Requirements

For requirements under existing features:

1. **Generate requirement ID**
2. **Create requirement directory structure:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p "speclan/features/F-####-parent/requirements/R-####-slug"
   ```
3. **Write requirement file:**
   ```
   speclan/features/F-####-parent/requirements/R-####-slug/R-####-slug.md
   ```
4. **Update parent feature's `updated` timestamp**

## Step 6: Report Results

After applying changes, report:

```markdown
## Spec Sync Complete

### Created
- F-#### User Authentication (speclan/features/F-####-user-authentication/)
- R-#### CSV Validation (speclan/features/F-1142-pet-management/requirements/R-####-csv-validation/)

### Updated
- F-1142 Pet Management - added bulk import scope

### Change Requests Created
- CR-#### for F-1089 Data Export (speclan/features/F-1089-.../change-requests/)
- CR-#### for R-#### (speclan/.../requirements/R-####-.../change-requests/)

### Next Steps
- Review created specs for accuracy
- Assign goals to new features
- Process pending change requests
```

## Edge Cases

### No Speclan Directory

If speclan/ doesn't exist:
1. Ask user if they want to initialize it
2. If yes, create basic structure:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p speclan/goals speclan/features speclan/templates
   ```
3. Proceed with creating new features

### No Identifiable Features

If session has no clear feature work:
- Report: "No significant feature implementations detected in this session"
- Offer to manually describe what to document

### Ambiguous Matches

When a session feature could match multiple existing specs:
- Present options to user
- Let them choose the correct match or create new
