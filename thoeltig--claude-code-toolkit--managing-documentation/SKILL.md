# Managing Documentation

Comprehensive agent skill for creating, updating, and maintaining high-quality project documentation. Follows established best practices from agile, Google, and Write the Docs methodologies.

## When to Use This Skill

Activate when:
- Creating new documentation for projects, features, or products
- Updating or improving existing documentation quality
- Validating documentation against style and inclusivity standards
- Writing guides, API documentation, or README files
- Ensuring documentation works for global, diverse audiences
- Checking for inclusive language and accessibility
- Applying lean/agile documentation principles
- Planning documentation structure and organization
- Reviewing documentation for clarity and completeness

## Core Workflows

### Workflow 1: Creating New Documentation

#### Step 1: Define Purpose and Audience
Before writing:
- **Clarify purpose**: What is this documentation meant to achieve? Who will use it?
  - **If unclear, ask user**: "What problem should this documentation solve? Who will read it?"
- **Identify customers**: Actual end-users, developers, operators, support staff?
  - **If uncertain, ask user**: "Who is the primary audience? What's their experience level?"
- **Determine scope**: What should be covered? What's out of scope?
  - **If uncertain, ask user**: "What specific topics must be covered? What can be linked or omitted?"
- **Choose doc type**: Guide, API reference, README, tutorial, troubleshooting, architecture overview

#### Step 2: Plan Structure
Follow these principles:
- **Skimmable**: Use clear headings, start paragraphs with key concepts, use lists
- **Cumulative**: Order content so prerequisites come first (especially for guides/tutorials)
- **Exemplary**: Include examples for most concepts, especially in guides and API docs
- **Concise**: Keep just barely good enough - avoid over-documentation

Structure recommendations:
- **Getting Started Guides**: Introductory context → prerequisites → step-by-step → examples
- **API Documentation**: Purpose of API group → parameter descriptions → examples → error cases
- **README**: Brief intro → installation/quick start → usage → contributing → license
- **Troubleshooting**: Common problems → diagnostics → solutions with examples

#### Step 3: Write with Global Audience in Mind
- Use **simple, concise language**: Avoid idioms, colloquialisms, jargon (unless industry-standard and explained)
- Use **active voice and present tense** for clarity
- Use **shorter sentences** - easier to understand and translate
- **Define abbreviations** on first use
- **Avoid phrasal verbs** when simpler verbs work (use "start" not "commence")
- **Use concrete examples** - show don't just tell
- Avoid **dated language** like "new", "currently", "soon" - focus on what is, not what changed

Example: ❌ "Our product now supports the latest feature" ✅ "Our product supports feature X for use case Y"

**Never document future features:**
- Don't pre-announce anything unless approved by legal counsel
- Focus on current capabilities, not roadmaps or planned features
- Document what exists now, not what will exist later
- Example: ❌ "Feature X will be available soon" ✅ [omit until released]

**Avoid excessive or unverifiable claims:**
- Don't use superlatives: "best", "fastest", "simplest", "never", "always"
- Be careful with "ensure" and "guarantee" - use only when truly guaranteed
- Reference data sources for performance claims
- Example: ❌ "Our product is the fastest" ✅ "Our product processes X requests/sec"
- Example: ❌ "Prevents all security attacks" ✅ "Helps prevent attacks by..."
- Example: ❌ "The best solution for your needs" ✅ "A solution that handles X, Y, and Z"

**Avoid overusing politeness:**
- Don't overuse "please" in instructions - it's implied and adds unnecessary words
- Example: ❌ "Please click the button" ✅ "Click the button"
- Example: ❌ "For more information, please see the guide" ✅ "For more information, see the guide"
- Exception: Use "please" when making significant requests or in sensitive contexts

#### Step 4: Ensure Inclusivity
**Avoid problematic language:**
- No ableist terms: ❌ "sanity check" ✅ "final check", ❌ "blind to" ✅ "overlook", ❌ "cripples" ✅ "slows down"
- No gendered terms: ❌ "man-hours" ✅ "person-hours", ❌ "he/she" ✅ "they", avoid gendered pronouns in examples
- No violent language: Avoid "kill", "hit", avoid animal slaughter metaphors
- No culturally specific references, slang, or humor
- Use diverse names in examples

**Be specific about people:**
- "person with disabilities" not "the disabled"
- "older adults" not "seniors" or "the elderly"
- "quadriplegic person" not "a quadriplegic"
- Research community preferences before writing about disabilities

**For code/commands with non-inclusive terms in them**, use code formatting and minimize:
- ✅ "Configure the `master` node (shown in the file)"
- ✅ "Execute the `START SLAVE` statement"
- Use preferred term in surrounding text

#### Step 5: Review and Validate
**Consider automated documentation generation where appropriate:**
- API docs: JSDoc, TSDoc, rustdoc, Sphinx, Doxygen, JavaDoc
- Architecture diagrams: PlantUML, Mermaid diagrams from code
- Dependency graphs: Generated from package managers
- Test reports: Generated from test suites
- Remember: Generated docs still need human review and enhancement

**Alternatives when no technical writer available:**
- Pair documenting: Write documentation with a partner (like pair programming)
- Shared ownership: Multiple people maintain and improve documentation
- Text-to-speech software: Listen to your writing to find awkward passages
- Peer review: Have colleagues review for clarity before publishing

Before publishing, check:
- [ ] Clear purpose defined
- [ ] Audience needs addressed
- [ ] Examples provided for key concepts
- [ ] No jargon without explanation
- [ ] Simple language, active voice
- [ ] No outdated time-based words (new, currently, soon, latest, now)
- [ ] No excessive claims (best, fastest, simplest, never, always)
- [ ] No future features mentioned
- [ ] No overuse of "please" in instructions
- [ ] No ableist, gendered, or violent language
- [ ] No culturally specific references
- [ ] Consistent terminology throughout
- [ ] Concise but sufficient detail
- [ ] Headings clear and descriptive
- [ ] Links to related info (if applicable)

### Workflow 2: Updating Existing Documentation

#### Step 1: Assess Current State
- Read existing documentation completely
- Identify outdated information
- Check for consistency issues
- Look for jargon without explanation
- Check for problematic language (ableist, gendered, violent, cultural specificity)
- Verify examples still work
- Check clarity for non-expert readers

#### Step 2: Prioritize Changes
Categorize improvements:
- **Critical**: Incorrect information, broken examples, high-impact clarity issues
- **Major**: Consistency problems, missing key examples, jargon not explained, outdated phrasing
- **Minor**: Grammar, tone refinement, better formatting

#### Step 3: Update Content
When updating:
- Use "Old approaches" sections for deprecated items (never use dates)
- Preserve working examples while updating references
- Improve clarity by breaking up long paragraphs
- Replace problematic language consistently
- Update jargon explanations
- Ensure consistency with updated terminology

#### Step 4: Verify Changes
- All examples updated and correct
- No broken links or references
- Terminology consistent throughout
- Language inclusive and accessible
- Clarity improved without removing necessary detail
- Matches current product/feature state

### Workflow 3: Validating Documentation Quality

Apply these validation checks:

#### Content Quality (ARID Principles)
- **Accept Repetition**: Some business logic will be described multiple ways - this is acceptable
- **Skimmable**: Readers can quickly find what they need without reading everything
- **Exemplary**: Common use cases have examples, not everything needs examples
- **Consistent**: Same term used consistently, same formatting applied systematically
- **Current**: Reflects actual state of product, not historical or future states

#### Clarity & Accessibility
- No industry jargon without explanation, or uses "click here" link text
- Sentences under 20 words when possible
- Active voice used primarily
- Present tense used for current capabilities
- Examples provided for important concepts
- Headings clearly describe content below

#### Inclusive Language
- No ableist language (sanity check, blind to, cripples, dumb, etc.)
- No gendered terms (man-hours, he/she pronouns, actress/actor distinctions)
- No violent figurative language (kill, hit, slaughter metaphors)
- No unnecessary cultural specificity
- Diverse names in examples when people shown
- Neutral language about disabilities

#### Global Audience
- No colloquialisms, idioms, or slang
- No humor (difficult to translate)
- No geographic specificity (seasons, holidays, sports)
- Dates and times unambiguous and clear
- Simple words chosen over complex synonyms
- No assumed prior knowledge

#### Completeness
- Key information comprehensive (covers all main topics OR clearly states what's excluded)
- Edge cases addressed or acknowledged
- Error scenarios documented
- Prerequisites clearly stated
- Related topics referenced

#### Currency
- No "new", "currently", "now", "soon", "latest" references to product features
- Reflects actual capabilities not future plans
- Deprecated features clearly marked if included
- Version-specific info generalized when possible

### Workflow 4: Applying Agile/Lean Principles

Documentation should be "just barely good enough" - sufficient for current needs without unnecessary detail.

#### Document Late, Update Constantly
- Don't document speculative features before they stabilize
- Write documentation towards end of development when you know what you've built
- Document just-in-time when most needed
- Update only when pain of using outdated docs exceeds effort to update

#### Document with Purpose
- Create documents only when they fulfill clear, important goals
- Focus on what customers actually need, not what you think they should need
- Justify documentation requests: why needed? who benefits? what's the cost?

#### Prefer Executable Specifications
- Use tests as specifications where possible
- Link to code examples rather than duplicate specifications
- Generate system documentation from code when possible

#### Choose Best Communication Medium
Documentation is often NOT the best choice:
- Direct conversation > documentation for immediate understanding
- Involved stakeholders > documentation for knowledge transfer
- Well-structured code > documentation for technical details

Documentation becomes increasingly valuable as distance (physical or temporal) makes direct communication more difficult or less practical.

#### Minimize Document Overlap
- Define scope clearly for each document
- Avoid same information in multiple places
- Use references/links instead of duplication
- Link to single source of truth

#### Display Information Publicly
- Share models, diagrams, documentation during development
- Use documentation as "information radiator" for team communication
- Status indicators help readers understand context (draft vs. finalized)

## Quality Checklist by Document Type

### Guides & Tutorials
- [ ] Introduces topic gently before technical details
- [ ] Prerequisites clearly stated upfront
- [ ] Step-by-step instructions are concrete (not abstract)
- [ ] Examples build on previous examples (not new problems each time)
- [ ] Code examples short (~3-5 lines), not full implementations
- [ ] Assumptions about reader knowledge clearly stated
- [ ] Next steps or related topics referenced at end

### API Documentation
- [ ] Purpose of API group explained before diving into individual methods
- [ ] Each method shows purpose, parameters, return values
- [ ] Examples provided for common use cases
- [ ] Error cases documented
- [ ] Request/response examples clear and realistic but simplified
- [ ] No complex real-world implementations in examples
- [ ] Shared terminology used throughout

### README Files
- [ ] Brief description in opening paragraph
- [ ] Installation/quick start section early
- [ ] Common use cases covered
- [ ] Troubleshooting or FAQ included
- [ ] Links to full documentation
- [ ] Contributing guidelines if accepting contributions
- [ ] License clearly stated

### Architecture/System Documentation
- [ ] High-level overview comes first
- [ ] Diagrams supplement (not replace) text description
- [ ] Key concepts explained at high level before details
- [ ] Links to code for implementation details
- [ ] Major components described (not every detail)
- [ ] Clear what's documented vs. what's in code
- [ ] Design decisions explained (the "why" not just the "what")

## Writing Style Principles

### Tone and Voice
- Conversational, friendly, and respectful (not stuffy or overly formal)
- Sound like knowledgeable friend, not textbook or marketing material
- Be human and memorable, but focus on information delivery
- Avoid super-entertaining or super-dry extremes

### Things to Avoid
- Buzzwords and unnecessary jargon
- Overly cute, wacky, or zany tone
- Ableist language or problematic figures of speech
- Placeholder phrases ("please note", "at this time")
- Choppy or overly long sentences
- Current pop-culture references (won't age well)
- Excessive exclamation marks
- Mixing or overextending metaphors
- Internet slang or abbreviations (tl;dr, ymmv)

### Techniques That Work
- Read aloud - does it sound natural? (not every sentence, but check awkward ones)
- Use transitions between sentences for flow
- Step back and ask "what am I really trying to say?"
- Get colleague feedback on tone and clarity
- Focus on communicating useful info clearly - that's most important

## Tool Usage Patterns for This Skill

### Finding Documentation Files
- **Glob for documentation**: `**/*.md`, `**/README.md`, `**/docs/**`, `**/documentation/**`
- **Glob for API docs**: `**/api/**`, `**/reference/**`, `**/swagger/**`
- **Glob for specific doc types**: `**/CONTRIBUTING.md`, `**/CHANGELOG.md`, `**/LICENSE.md`

### Validating Content for Problematic Terms
Use Grep to search for terms that violate guidelines:
- **Ableist language**: `"sanity|crazy|insane|blind to|cripple|dumb|stupid"`
- **Gendered language**: `"he |she |his |her |man-hours|mankind|actress|waitress"`
- **Violent language**: `" kill | hit |STONITH|hang |hung "`
- **Time-based words**: `"currently|soon|new |latest|now |presently"`
- **Excessive claims**: `"best |fastest|simplest|never |always |ensure |guarantee"`
- **Politeness overuse**: `"[Pp]lease click|[Pp]lease see|[Pp]lease enter"`
- **Future features**: `"will be |coming soon|planned|roadmap"`

### Understanding Context Before Writing
- **Read source code**: Use Read tool to understand features before documenting them
- **Find existing patterns**: Use Grep to find how similar features are documented
- **Check project conventions**: Read existing docs to match style and terminology

### Large-Scale Operations
- **Use Task tool with Haiku** for validating 50+ documentation files simultaneously
- **Use Task tool for codebase exploration** when searching for undocumented features or APIs
- **Use Bash tool** for running documentation generators or build commands

### Example Validation Commands
```bash
# Search for ableist terms across all markdown files
grep -r "sanity\|crazy\|insane\|blind to\|cripple\|dumb" docs/

# Find time-based language
grep -r "currently\|soon\|new \|latest" **/*.md

# Check for gendered pronouns
grep -r " he \| she \| his \| her " docs/
```

## Common Issues and Fixes

| Issue | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Outdated information | Documented too early | Don't document until feature stabilizes |
| Too much detail | No prioritization | Focus on common cases, link to code for details |
| Unclear jargon | Assumed audience knowledge | Define all industry-specific terms |
| Hard to find info | No clear structure | Use descriptive headings, start paragraphs with key concepts |
| Inconsistent terminology | Multiple authors/rewrites | Maintain consistent term list, audit before publishing |
| Culturally insensitive | No consideration for diversity | Review for idioms, holidays, sports, slang references |
| Violates inclusivity | Ableist/gendered/violent language | Search for: sanity, blind, cripple, he/she, kill, hit, etc. |
| Incomplete examples | Show only happy path | Include error cases, edge cases, realistic scenarios |

## Implementation Approach

When helping with documentation:

1. **Understand context**: What's the purpose? Who reads it? What do they need?
2. **Assess quality**: What's working? What needs improvement?
3. **Plan improvements**: Prioritize critical → major → minor issues
4. **Apply standards**: Use clear structure, simple language, inclusive voice
5. **Validate**: Check against this skill's checklists and principles
6. **Iterate**: Get feedback, refine, publish

The goal is documentation that is clear, accessible, sufficient for actual needs, and welcoming to readers from all backgrounds.
