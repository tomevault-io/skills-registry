# Managing Plugins

## When to Use This Skill

Activate when user mentions: plugin creation, bundling, packaging, plugin.json, marketplace, team distribution, .claude-plugin, plugin structure

## Terminology

**Manifest**: Refers to the plugin.json file located at `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`. These terms are used interchangeably throughout this skill.

**Subagents**: Referred to as "agents/" directory in plugins. Subagents are specialized agents started as subordinate processes from Claude Code's main agent instance. For detailed subagent creation guidance, see the managing-agents skill.

## Core Operations

### OP1: Create Plugin Structure

Input: plugin name, components list
Output: directory structure with manifest

Process:
1. Use Bash tool: `mkdir -p plugin-name/.claude-plugin` to create plugin directory
2. Use Write tool to create plugin-name/.claude-plugin/plugin.json with required fields: name, description, version, author.name
3. Use Bash tool: `mkdir -p plugin-name/{commands,skills,hooks,agents}` to create component directories
4. For each component file: Use Bash tool `cp -r source plugin-name/target-dir` to copy files to appropriate directories
5. Verify structure created:
   - Use Read tool to confirm plugin-name/.claude-plugin/plugin.json exists and is readable
   - Use Bash tool: `ls -la plugin-name` to list all created directories
   - Expected output includes: .claude-plugin/, commands/, skills/, hooks/, agents/
6. Validate structure (OP4)

Resulting directory structure:
```
plugin-name/
  .claude-plugin/
    plugin.json
  commands/
  skills/
  hooks/
  agents/
```

For detailed plugin.json schema and directory structure requirements, load plugin-spec.md

### OP2: Bundle Components by Prefix

Input: prefix pattern (e.g., "git")
Output: plugin with all matching components

Working directory assumptions:
- Search from user's .claude directories (~/.claude and .claude)
- Or use explicit paths if provided by user

Detection process:
1. Use Glob tool with pattern `commands/**/{prefix}-*.md` to find matching command files
2. Use Glob tool with pattern `skills/**/{prefix}-*/**` to find matching skill directories
3. Use Glob tool with pattern `hooks/hooks.json` to check if hooks config exists
   - If exists: Use Read tool to load hooks/hooks.json
   - Parse JSON to find event handlers with names matching prefix pattern
4. Use Glob tool with pattern `.mcp.json` to check if MCP config exists
   - If exists: Use Read tool to load .mcp.json
   - Parse JSON to check mcpServers section for keys starting with prefix
5. Collect all matched file paths into components list

Bundling process:
1. Create plugin structure (OP1)
2. For each matched component:
   - Use Bash tool: `cp -r source-path plugin-name/target-dir` to copy files
   - Preserve relative directory structure
3. Use Read tool to load first matched component's frontmatter/metadata
4. Generate manifest fields (name, description) from component metadata
5. Verify bundling completed:
   - Use Bash tool: `find plugin-name -type f` to list all bundled files
   - Confirm count matches expected number of components
6. Validate no broken references (OP4)

For detailed component formats and path rules, load plugin-spec.md

### OP3: Create Marketplace Config

Input: plugin paths, marketplace name, owner
Output: marketplace.json

Template:
```json
{"name":"MARKETPLACE","owner":{"name":"OWNER"},"plugins":[{"name":"NAME","source":"./path","description":"DESC"}]}
```

Sources: local path, git URL, or tarball

For complete marketplace.json schema and source types, load marketplace-spec.md

### OP4: Validate Plugin

Input: plugin directory path
Output: validation status with specific errors if any

Validation sequence:
1. Use Read tool to attempt loading .claude-plugin/plugin.json
   - If fails: Return error "Manifest not found at .claude-plugin/plugin.json"
2. Parse JSON content to extract fields
   - If invalid JSON: Return error "Invalid JSON syntax in plugin.json"
3. Check required field 'name' exists
   - If missing: Return error "Missing required field: name"
4. If 'version' field present: Validate semver format (pattern: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
   - If invalid: Return error "Invalid version format, must be semver (e.g., 1.0.0)"
5. If 'author' field present: Verify it has 'name' subfield
   - If missing author.name: Return error "author object must have 'name' field"
6. Use Glob tool with pattern `plugin-name/**/*.md` to find all markdown files
7. For each .md file: Use Read tool to load and verify YAML frontmatter is valid
   - If invalid YAML: Collect error "Invalid YAML frontmatter in {filepath}"
8. Use Glob tool to list component directories: commands/, skills/, hooks/, agents/
9. For each directory: Verify expected file structure (commands have .md, skills have SKILL.md)
   - If structure invalid: Collect error "Invalid structure in {directory}"
10. Check for duplicate names across components
    - If duplicates found: Return error "Duplicate component names: {list}"
11. If no errors collected: Return "Validation passed"
    - If errors collected: Return all errors as list

For comprehensive validation checklist and debugging guidance, load validation-rules.md

### OP5: Pack for Distribution

Input: plugin dir
Output: ready-to-distribute structure

Steps:
1. Validate plugin (OP4)
2. If .gitignore patterns specified: Use Bash tool to remove matching files
3. If archive requested: Use Bash tool `tar -czf plugin-name.tar.gz -C plugin-name .` to create tarball
4. Use Write tool to create plugin-name/README.md with usage instructions
5. Include installation command in README: `/plugin install name@marketplace`

For semver versioning guidelines and distribution methods, load distribution-guide.md

## Component Integration

**Commands**: Copy to commands/, preserve .md extension, keep frontmatter
**Skills**: Copy entire skill dir to skills/, preserve SKILL.md and supporting files
**Hooks**: Merge hooks.json or copy individual hook configs
**MCPs**: Copy .mcp.json, merge mcpServers section if exists
**Subagents**: Copy to agents/ directory (subordinate agents created via managing-agents skill)

## Context Detection Rules

Prefix matching priority:
1. Exact prefix match (git-commit matches git)
2. Semantic grouping (auth-login, auth-register both auth-related)
3. Explicit file lists override auto-detection
4. Check descriptions for shared keywords

Decision tree for bundling:
1. Count total matches from detection process (OP2 step 5)
2. Check if user provided explicit file list
3. Apply decision logic:

   IF match_count == 0:
   - Generate suggestions: Use Glob to find similar prefixes
   - Use AskUserQuestion tool: "No components found matching prefix '{prefix}'. Did you mean: {suggestions}?"
   - Wait for user response before proceeding

   ELSE IF match_count == 1:
   - Proceed directly to bundling process
   - No user confirmation needed

   ELSE IF match_count >= 2 AND user_provided_explicit_list == false:
   - List all matched components with types (command/skill/hook/mcp)
   - Use AskUserQuestion tool: "Found {count} components matching '{prefix}': {list}. Bundle all matching components or select specific ones?"
   - Wait for user selection

   ELSE IF user_provided_explicit_list == true:
   - Proceed with explicit list only
   - Ignore auto-detected matches

## Progressive References

Load when detailed information needed:

**plugin-spec.md**: Complete plugin.json schema, directory structure requirements, component formats, path rules, environment variables
**marketplace-spec.md**: marketplace.json schema, source types, distribution patterns, installation commands
**distribution-guide.md**: Semver versioning, distribution methods (local/git/team/archive), testing workflow, pre-distribution checklist
**validation-rules.md**: Comprehensive validation checklist, debugging with --debug flag, common issues and fixes, error messages reference

## Anti-Patterns

- Don't include non-plugin files in bundle
- Don't auto-generate descriptions (require user input)
- Don't modify original files (copy only)
- Don't create plugins without validation
- Don't bundle unrelated components

## Quick Checks

- [ ] plugin.json has all required fields
- [ ] Component dirs match actual files
- [ ] No absolute paths in manifests
- [ ] Version is valid semver
- [ ] No broken references
- [ ] Descriptions are specific

## Output Format

Completion report:
- Plugin name and location
- Components included (count by type)
- Validation status
- Installation command
- Next steps

## Error Handling

Common failures:
- Missing required fields → prompt user
- Invalid semver → suggest correction
- Broken references → list broken paths
- Duplicate names → list conflicts
- No components found → show search paths
