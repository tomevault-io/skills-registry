# GCP Cloud Build Management

Manage Cloud Build triggers, view build history, monitor running builds, and start new builds.

## Prerequisites

Requires authenticated `gcloud` CLI and `jq`. Use the unified `gcp-build-tool` script for all operations.

## Quick Reference

```bash
gcp-build-tool auth                    # Verify auth & show project
gcp-build-tool list                    # List all triggers
gcp-build-tool details <trigger>       # Show trigger configuration
gcp-build-tool history [trigger]       # Show build history
gcp-build-tool running                 # Show active builds
gcp-build-tool start <trigger> [opts]  # Start a build
```

## Workflow

### 1. Always Verify Authentication First

```bash
gcp-build-tool auth
```

**If authentication fails**, tell user to run:
```bash
gcloud auth login
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
```

**If targeting a different project**: User must authenticate to that project first. Tell user the command above.

### 2. Operations

**List triggers:**
```bash
gcp-build-tool list
```

**View trigger details** (name or ID):
```bash
gcp-build-tool details my-deploy-trigger
```

**View build history:**
```bash
gcp-build-tool history                     # All builds
gcp-build-tool history my-deploy-trigger   # Filter by trigger
```

**Check running builds:**
```bash
gcp-build-tool running
```

**Start a build:**
```bash
gcp-build-tool start my-trigger
gcp-build-tool start my-trigger --branch main
gcp-build-tool start my-trigger --sub _ENV=prod --sub _VERSION=1.2.3
gcp-build-tool start my-trigger --dry-run  # Preview only
```

## Error Handling

| Error | User Action |
|-------|-------------|
| Not authenticated | `gcloud auth login` |
| No project set | `gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID` |
| API not enabled | `gcloud services enable cloudbuild.googleapis.com` |
| Permission denied | Need `cloudbuild.builds.viewer` or `cloudbuild.builds.editor` role |

## Build Statuses

`SUCCESS` ✅ | `FAILURE` ❌ | `WORKING` 🔄 | `QUEUED` ⏳ | `TIMEOUT` ⏱️ | `CANCELLED` 🚫
