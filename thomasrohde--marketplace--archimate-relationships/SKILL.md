# ArchiMate Relationships

ArchiMate defines **11 core relationships** organized into four categories. Understanding proper relationship usage is critical for model quality and analysis.

## Relationship Categories

### Structural Relationships (Static Construction)

| Relationship | Notation | Usage |
|-------------|----------|-------|
| **Composition** | Solid line + filled diamond | Strong whole-part; parts cannot exist independently |
| **Aggregation** | Solid line + hollow diamond | Weak whole-part; parts may belong to multiple aggregations |
| **Assignment** | Solid line + circle at source | Who/what performs behavior; links actors to roles, components to functions |
| **Realization** | Dashed line + hollow triangle | Logical-to-physical mapping; cross-layer implementation |

### Dependency Relationships (Support/Usage)

| Relationship | Notation | Usage |
|-------------|----------|-------|
| **Serving** | Solid line + open arrowhead | Service delivery; arrow points toward consumer |
| **Access** | Dotted line + optional arrowhead | Data access; use mode indicators (r, w, rw) |
| **Influence** | Dashed line + open arrowhead | Affects motivation elements; can include +/- strength |
| **Association** | Solid line (undirected/directed) | Generic relationship; use when no specific type applies |

### Dynamic Relationships (Temporal/Flow)

| Relationship | Notation | Usage |
|-------------|----------|-------|
| **Triggering** | Solid line + filled arrowhead | Temporal/causal precedence between behaviors |
| **Flow** | Dashed line + filled arrowhead | Transfer of objects between behaviors; label what flows |

### Other

| Relationship | Notation | Usage |
|-------------|----------|-------|
| **Specialization** | Solid line + hollow triangle | Type hierarchies; same-type elements only |

## Key Direction Principle

ArchiMate relationships consistently point **toward enterprise goals and results**:
- From Technology → Application → Business
- From Active Structure → Behavior → Passive Structure

## Cross-Layer Relationship Patterns

### Business ↔ Application

**Supporting:**
```
[Application Service] → [serves] → [Business Process/Function]
[Application Interface] → [serves] → [Business Role]
```

**Realizing:**
```
[Application Process/Function] → [realizes] → [Business Process/Function]
[Data Object] → [realizes] → [Business Object]
```

### Application ↔ Technology

**Supporting:**
```
[Technology Service] → [serves] → [Application Component/Function]
```

**Realizing:**
```
[Artifact] → [realizes] → [Application Component]
[Artifact] → [realizes] → [Data Object]
```

### Service-Driven Architecture Pattern

The canonical layered view shows service chains connecting layers:

```
[Business Actor: Customer]
    ↓ served by
[Business Service]
    ↓ realized by
[Business Process]
    ↓ served by
[Application Service]
    ↓ realized by
[Application Component]
    ↓ served by
[Technology Service]
    ↓ realized by
[Node: Device + System Software]
```

## Common Relationship Patterns

### Actor-Role-Function Pattern
```
[Business Actor] → [assignment] → [Business Role] → [assignment] → [Business Process/Function]
```

### Service Realization Pattern
```
[Business Role] → [assignment] → [Business Process] → [realization] → [Business Service]
[Business Interface] → [assignment] → [Business Service]
```

### Deployment Pattern
```
[Application Component] ← [realized by] ← [Artifact] → [assigned to] → [Node/System Software]
```

## Relationship Selection Guide

| Want to show... | Use |
|-----------------|-----|
| What performs behavior | **Assignment** |
| What implements/realizes something | **Realization** |
| What provides service to whom | **Serving** |
| What reads/writes data | **Access** (with r/w/rw) |
| What causes what to happen | **Triggering** |
| What passes between behaviors | **Flow** (label it) |
| Part-whole (dependent) | **Composition** |
| Part-whole (independent) | **Aggregation** |
| Type hierarchy | **Specialization** |
| Motivation impact | **Influence** (+/-) |
| Generic connection | **Association** (last resort) |

## Output Format for Relationships

### Notation Format
```
[Source Element] → [relationship type] → [Target Element]
```

### With Access Modes
```
[Application Function: Process Order] → [access (rw)] → [Data Object: Order Record]
```

### With Flow Labels
```
[Business Process: Receive Order] → [flow: Order Data] → [Business Process: Validate Order]
```
