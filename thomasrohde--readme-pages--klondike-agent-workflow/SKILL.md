description: Manage multi-session AI agent workflows using klondike CLI. Use when working on klondike-managed projects (those with .klondike/ directory), when starting/ending coding sessions, tracking features through lifecycle, or maintaining coherence across context window resets. Triggers on session management, feature tracking, progress handoffs, and verification workflows. Use when this capability is needed.

# Klondike Agent Workflow

Klondike bridges context windows for long-running agent sessions. **Critical: Always use CLI commands—never directly read/edit .klondike/*.json files or agent-progress.md.**

## CRITICAL: Common Mistakes to Avoid

**❌ NEVER do these:**
- `klondike --help` (wrong syntax - use `klondike` alone or `klondike <command>` without --help)
- `klondike feature --help` (wrong - just run the command, it will show usage)
- Read `.klondike/features.json` directly (use `klondike feature list`)
- Edit `agent-progress.md` manually (auto-generated, changes are lost)
- `klondike feature start` without feature ID (must be `klondike feature start F001`)
- Feature IDs like `f001` or `1` (must be uppercase: `F001`)

**✓ DO these:**
- `klondike` alone shows all commands
- `klondike feature list` to see features
- `klondike feature show F001` for details
- `klondike status` to see project overview

## Quick Decision Tree

```
Starting work?     → klondike status → klondike session start --focus "F001 - desc"
Working on feature → klondike feature start F001
Feature complete?  → Test E2E → klondike feature verify F001 --evidence "..."
Blocked?           → klondike feature block F001 --reason "..."
Ending session?    → klondike session end --summary "..." --next "..."
```

## Session Lifecycle

### 1. Session Start (Always Do First!)

```bash
klondike status                                    # See project state
klondike validate                                  # Check artifact integrity
klondike session start --focus "F001 - Login UI"  # Begin session
klondike feature start F001                        # Mark feature in-progress
```

### 2. During Work

- **One feature at a time** (tracked by `feature start`)
- Commit after each meaningful change
- Test incrementally, not at end
- If blocked: `klondike feature block F001 --reason "..."`

### 3. Session End (Before Leaving!)

```bash
klondike feature verify F001 --evidence "test-results/F001.png"
klondike session end --summary "Done" --next "Implement logout"
```

## Core Commands

| Action | Command | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Status | `klondike status` | Always start here |
| Add feature | `klondike feature add "desc" --notes "hints"` | **--notes is critical** |
| Start feature | `klondike feature start F001` | One at a time |
| List features | `klondike feature list` | Never read JSON directly |
| Show details | `klondike feature show F001` | View single feature |
| Verify | `klondike feature verify F001 --evidence "proof"` | E2E test first |
| Block | `klondike feature block F001 --reason "why"` | When stuck |
| Start session | `klondike session start --focus "F001 - desc"` | Begin work |
| End session | `klondike session end --summary "..." --next "..."` | Before leaving |

## Essential Rules

**Always:**
- Start every session with `klondike status` to see project state
- Use `--notes` when adding features (gives future agents critical context)
- Capture evidence (screenshots, logs) before `feature verify`
- Run pre-commit checks before every commit
- End sessions with `session end --summary ... --next ...`

**Never:**
- Use `klondike --help` or `klondike feature --help` (wrong syntax - see Common Mistakes)
- Read or edit `.klondike/*.json` files directly (use CLI commands)
- Edit `agent-progress.md` manually (auto-generated, edits are lost)
- Verify features without E2E testing (unit tests aren't enough)
- Commit code with failing tests, lint errors, or build failures

## Pre-Commit Checks

Detect project type and run checks. **Never commit if any fail.**

**Python (uv):** `uv run ruff check src tests && uv run pytest`  
**Node.js:** `npm run lint && npm run build && CI=true npm test`  
**Rust:** `cargo clippy && cargo test`  
**Go:** `golangci-lint run && go test ./...`
