# Documentation

Write for the reader who has zero context from this conversation.
If it only makes sense to you right now, it will confuse someone else later.

---

## References

- `references/readme.md` — README structure, quick-start rules, what to document vs what not to
- `references/changelog.md` — Keep a Changelog format with section types and examples
- `references/adr.md` — Architecture Decision Record template and when to write one
- `references/openapi.md` — OpenAPI spec minimum requirements per endpoint

See `assets/templates.md` for README skeleton, changelog entry, and ADR templates.
