# GitHub Issues Management

GitHub workflow integration for the LucidData project using MCP tools for issue tracking and project management.

## Overview

This skill enables efficient GitHub issue management for LucidData, providing templates for bug reports, feature requests, security vulnerabilities, and test failures. It follows best practices for issue tracking in a privacy-first personal data bank application.

## When to Use This Skill

Activate this skill when you need to:

- **Create bug reports**: Document bugs with encryption/audit log context
- **Request features**: Propose new functionality with privacy impact assessment
- **Report security vulnerabilities**: Follow responsible disclosure practices
- **Track test failures**: Document failing Vitest/Playwright tests
- **Update issues**: Add labels, assign team members, update status
- **Search issues**: Find existing issues by keyword, label, or status
- **Comment on issues**: Add technical context or updates

## LucidData-Specific Issue Categories

### Bug (label: `bug`)
Software defects, incorrect behavior, crashes

**Common subcategories**:
- **Encryption** (`encryption`): Issues with AES-256-GCM encryption/decryption
- **Database** (`database`): Prisma queries, migrations, data integrity
- **Auth** (`auth`): Supabase authentication, session management
- **UI** (`ui`): React component bugs, layout issues

### Enhancement (label: `enhancement`)
New features, improvements to existing functionality

**Common subcategories**:
- **Privacy** (`privacy`): Consent management, data portability
- **Security** (`security`): Security improvements, audit logging
- **Performance** (`performance`): Speed optimizations, caching
- **UX** (`ux`): User experience improvements

### Security Vulnerability (label: `security`)
Security issues requiring responsible disclosure

**Severity labels**:
- `critical`: RCE, data breach, auth bypass
- `high`: XSS, CSRF, SQL injection
- `medium`: Information disclosure
- `low`: Minor security improvements

### Testing (label: `testing`)
Test failures, missing test coverage, test infrastructure

### Documentation (label: `documentation`)
README updates, API docs, code comments

## Issue Templates

### Bug Report Template

```markdown
## Bug Description
[Clear, concise description of the bug]

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to...
2. Click on...
3. Enter...
4. Observe error

## Expected Behavior
[What should happen]

## Actual Behavior
[What actually happens]

## Environment
- **Browser**: Chrome 131 / Firefox 133 / Safari 17
- **OS**: Windows 11 / macOS 15 / Ubuntu 22.04
- **Node.js**: v18.x
- **Next.js**: 15.1.3

## Screenshots/Logs
[Attach screenshots or paste error logs]

## Additional Context
- **Encryption context**: [If related to vault data]
- **Audit log ID**: [If related to audit trail]
- **User ID**: [Anonymized if needed]

## Security Considerations
⚠️ **DO NOT include**: Encryption keys, passwords, real user data, API keys
```

### Feature Request Template

```markdown
## Feature Description
[Clear description of the proposed feature]

## User Story
As a [user type], I want to [action] so that [benefit].

## Use Case
[Describe the problem this feature solves]

## Proposed Solution
[How should this feature work?]

## Privacy Impact Assessment
- **Data collected**: [What new data, if any?]
- **Consent required**: [Yes/No]
- **Encryption**: [How will data be protected?]
- **Audit logging**: [What events to log?]

## Alternatives Considered
[Other approaches considered]

## Additional Context
[Mockups, wireframes, references]
```

### Security Vulnerability Template

```markdown
## Vulnerability Type
[XSS / CSRF / SQL Injection / etc.]

## Severity
[Critical / High / Medium / Low]

## Affected Component
[Vault API / Consent management / Auth system / etc.]

## Description
[Detailed description of the vulnerability]

## Proof of Concept
[Steps to reproduce - DO NOT include actual exploit code for critical issues]

## Impact
[What could an attacker do?]

## Suggested Fix
[Recommended remediation]

## Security Considerations
⚠️ **This issue contains sensitive security information**
- DO NOT publicly disclose until patch is released
- Coordinate with maintainers for responsible disclosure
```

### Test Failure Template

```markdown
## Test Information
- **Test file**: `path/to/test.test.ts`
- **Test name**: "should validate encryption"
- **Framework**: Vitest / Playwright

## Failure Output
```
[Paste test error output]
```

## Expected Result
[What should the test check?]

## Actual Result
[What is the test finding?]

## Reproducibility
- [ ] Fails consistently
- [ ] Fails intermittently (flaky test)
- [ ] Fails only in CI/CD
- [ ] Fails only locally

## Context
[Recent changes that may have caused this]
```

## Standard Labels

### Type Labels
- `bug` - Software defect
- `enhancement` - New feature or improvement
- `security` - Security issue or improvement
- `documentation` - Documentation updates
- `testing` - Test-related issues

### Component Labels
- `encryption` - AES-256-GCM encryption/decryption
- `database` - Prisma, PostgreSQL, migrations
- `auth` - Supabase authentication
- `consent` - Consent management system
- `audit-log` - Audit trail and hash chain
- `vault` - Vault data management
- `ui` - User interface, React components

### Priority Labels
- `critical` - Blocking issue, immediate attention
- `high` - Important, should be addressed soon
- `medium` - Standard priority
- `low` - Nice to have, not urgent

### Status Labels
- `needs-triage` - Needs initial review
- `needs-info` - Waiting for more information
- `in-progress` - Being worked on
- `blocked` - Blocked by dependency
- `wontfix` - Will not be fixed
- `duplicate` - Duplicate of another issue

## Security Considerations

### What NOT to Include in Issues

⚠️ **NEVER include in public issues**:
- Encryption keys (ENCRYPTION_KEY)
- API keys or secrets (SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY)
- Real user data (emails, names, PII)
- Database connection strings
- Session tokens or auth credentials
- Actual exploit code for critical vulnerabilities

### Safe Issue Reporting

✅ **Safe to include**:
- Anonymized user IDs (`user-***`)
- Test/dummy data
- Stack traces (after removing secrets)
- Screenshots (after redacting sensitive info)
- Code snippets (without hardcoded secrets)

### Responsible Disclosure

For **critical security vulnerabilities**:
1. Email maintainers privately FIRST
2. Wait for acknowledgment (24-48 hours)
3. Coordinate public disclosure timeline
4. Create issue AFTER patch is released

## MCP Tool Usage

### Create Issue

```typescript
// Using GitHub MCP
await mcp__github__create_issue({
  title: "Bug: Vault encryption fails on large files",
  body: "Bug report content...",
  labels: ["bug", "encryption", "high"],
  assignees: ["maintainer-username"],
});
```

### Update Issue

```typescript
await mcp__github__update_issue({
  issue_number: 123,
  labels: ["bug", "encryption", "in-progress"],
  assignees: ["developer-username"],
});
```

### Search Issues

```typescript
await mcp__github__search_issues({
  query: "label:encryption is:open",
  sort: "created",
  order: "desc",
});
```

### Add Comment

```typescript
await mcp__github__add_issue_comment({
  issue_number: 123,
  body: "Additional context: This affects Prisma 6.19.1+ with large BLOBs",
});
```

## Workflow Best Practices

1. **Search first**: Check for existing issues before creating duplicates
2. **Use templates**: Follow issue templates for consistency
3. **Add labels**: Tag with appropriate type, component, priority labels
4. **Be specific**: Include steps to reproduce, environment details
5. **Protect secrets**: Never include keys, passwords, or real user data
6. **Follow up**: Add updates as you investigate or fix issues
7. **Close when done**: Close issues with resolution summary
