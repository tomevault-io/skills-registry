# GitHub PR Workflows

<metadata>

- **Load if**: Creating PRs, reviewing code, merging, stacked PRs
- **Prerequisites**: @smith-principles/SKILL.md, @smith-standards/SKILL.md, `@smith-git/SKILL.md`

</metadata>

## CRITICAL (Primacy Zone)

<required>

- MUST run quality checks before creating PR
- MUST ensure branch is up-to-date before requesting review or merging
- MUST link to related issues
- MUST have all CI checks passing before merge
- MUST have explicit user request before creating PRs
  -- listing is NOT consent to create

</required>

## Avoid GitHub MCP

<forbidden>

- GitHub MCP tools (`mcp__github__*`) - hard to control pagination (token waste), less complete than CLI, requires personal token

</forbidden>

**Use instead**: `gh pr-review` extension, `gh api`, or GraphQL queries

## PR Title Format

Follow conventional commits format. See `@smith-style/SKILL.md` for details.

## PR Creation Workflow

<required>

**Pre-PR checklist:**
1. Run linter and formatter
2. Run tests
3. Rebase onto parent branch (not always main - check stacked PRs)
4. Push to remote

</required>

**AI-generated descriptions**: Analyze full diff, read ALL commits, identify tickets, generate structured summary (What/Why/Testing/Dependencies).

## Working on Existing PRs

<required>

- ALWAYS get actual branch name: `gh pr view {PR} --json headRefName`
- ALWAYS check for review comments before making changes
- ALWAYS update PR title/body after pushing changes

</required>

## Code Review Cycle

1. Fetch review comments using `gh pr-review` (see "Fetching Review Comments" below)
2. **Get ALL comments including Nitpicks** - don't skip minor issues
3. Categorize: Actionable > Nitpick > Clarification > Discussion
4. **Proactively audit similar issues** in other files not explicitly mentioned
5. Implement fixes with confidence scoring (high: implement, low: ask)
   - **High confidence**: Small surface area change, aligns with existing patterns, covered by tests
   - **Low confidence**: Ambiguous behavior, architectural impact, requires design discussion
6. Reply to comments with commit SHA
7. **Resolve threads after addressing** - don't leave resolved issues open
8. Re-check for new comments after CI passes

<required>

**Code review response rules:**
- **File-inline comments** (on specific lines): MUST reply in-thread using `gh pr-review comments reply --thread-id {PRRT_xxx}`, NOT as PR-level comment. This keeps discussion traceable to the code location.
- **PR-level comments** (general discussion, `<details>` blocks): Reply with `gh pr comment` or GitHub's "Quote reply"
- Reply with commit SHA, then resolve thread with `gh pr-review threads resolve`
- Proactive audit: search codebase for similar issues before committing
- **CodeRabbit `<details>` comments** (Nitpicks, Duplicated, Outside diff range): These appear in PR thread, not inline on files. Use GitHub's "Quote reply" to include Markdown blockquote of the essential part (e.g., `> The redundant text...`), making response traceable
- **Attribution**: When Claude Code generates or posts a comment, state authorship with the user's @ mention per medium (e.g., GitHub: "Posted by Claude Code on behalf of @username", Notion: "Posted by Claude Code on behalf of @Display Name"). Omit when the user manually authors the comment.
- Research questionable suggestions before implementing (see `@smith-research/SKILL.md`)

**Review reply tone and style:**
- **Concise**: Lead with the action taken or answer; no filler
- **Evidence-based**: Cite commit SHA, file:line, docs URL, or
  test output as proof — strongest evidence available
- **Grateful**: Thank the reviewer for catching the issue
  (e.g., "Good catch — fixed in abc1234")
- **Humble**: If uncertain, say so; don't over-explain or
  defend — ask for guidance instead
- **Gentle**: When disagreeing, present evidence respectfully
  (e.g., "I kept X because [reason] — happy to change if
  you see it differently")

</required>

<forbidden>

- NEVER reply to file-inline comments with `gh pr comment` (loses thread context)
- NEVER mention `@copilot` in replies (triggers unwanted sub-PRs)

</forbidden>

## Fetching Review Comments

<required>

**Use `gh pr-review`** over `gh api` - structured output with thread IDs.

All commands require `--pr {number} -R {owner}/{repo}` for numeric PR selectors.

</required>

**Install**: `gh extension install agynio/gh-pr-review` (consider pinning to vetted SHA)

**On `gh pr-review` errors:**
1. Check if extension installed: `gh extension list | grep pr-review`
2. Verify command syntax (common: missing `--pr`, wrong `-R` format)
3. Verify repo name: `gh repo view --json nameWithOwner`
4. If not installed: `gh extension install agynio/gh-pr-review`

**List unresolved threads**: `gh pr-review threads list --pr {number} -R {owner}/{repo} --unresolved`

### gh-pr-review Commands

**View reviews** (use `--unresolved`, `--reviewer`, `--states` to filter):
`gh pr-review review view --pr {number} -R {owner}/{repo}`

**Reply to thread**:
`gh pr-review comments reply --pr {number} -R {owner}/{repo} --thread-id {PRRT_xxx} --body "..."`

**Resolve/unresolve thread**:
`gh pr-review threads resolve --pr {number} -R {owner}/{repo} --thread-id {PRRT_xxx}`

Output includes `thread_id` (PRRT_xxx format) needed for reply/resolve operations.

### REST API (Single Comments)

URL patterns map to API endpoints:
- `#issuecomment-{id}` → `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/comments/{id}`
- `#discussion_r{id}` → `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/comments/{id}`
- `#pullrequestreview-{id}` → `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr}/reviews/{id}`

## Rebase Decision Tree

**Behind base, no conflicts, explicit "update"**: AUTO-REBASE
**Behind base, no conflicts, not explicit**: ASK user
**Behind base, conflicts detected**: INFORM + ASK
**Parent PR merged**: INFORM + OFFER cascade
**About to request review, outdated**: BLOCK + INFORM

**Staleness thresholds**: <5 commits (fresh), 5-10 (notify), >10 (recommend), >20 (urgent)

**Note**: The above decision tree provides guidance during active development. The MUST requirement for up-to-date branches is enforced when requesting review or merging.

## Merge Strategies

**Merge commit**: Feature branches with meaningful history
**Squash**: Small fixes, docs, single logical change
**Rebase**: Linear history required, clean commits

## Stacked PRs

For stacked PRs, merge parent WITHOUT `--delete-branch`, then:
```shell
gh pr edit {CHILD} --base main
git rebase --onto origin/main feat/parent_branch
git push --force-with-lease
git push origin --delete feat/parent_branch
```

## Automated PR Review Monitoring

<context>

**`/loop` for review cycles** — periodically poll for
new review comments and auto-address them:

```shell
/loop 5m /smith-gh-pr:check-reviews
```

Note: `check-reviews` is a conceptual pattern, not a
built-in sub-command. Implement the workflow below manually
or as a custom skill.

**Auto-address workflow:**
1. Fetch unresolved comments:
   `gh pr-review threads list --pr {number} -R {owner}/{repo} --unresolved`
2. Classify each: code change vs clarification vs resolved
3. High-confidence fixes: implement, commit, reply with SHA
4. Low-confidence: draft reply, ask user before posting
5. Re-check after CI passes

**Proactive self-review** — before reviewer sees changes:
- Run CodeRabbit review via configured integration (e.g. `coderabbit:review` skill or GitHub App) after pushing
- Address mechanical feedback (lint, naming, tests)
  before human review begins

**When to use:**
- Long review cycles with multiple rounds
- Mechanical feedback (formatting, naming, missing tests)
- Large PRs with many inline comments

</context>

## Claude Code Plugin Integration

<context>

**When plugins are available, prefer plugin commands:**

- **`/code-review`**: Launches 4 parallel agents with confidence scoring (threshold 80)
- **`/commit-push-pr`**: Commits, pushes, and creates PR in one step
- **pr-review-toolkit agents**: Specialized review via Task tool
  - `code-reviewer` - CLAUDE.md compliance, style, bugs
  - `silent-failure-hunter` - Error handling issues
  - `pr-test-analyzer` - Test coverage gaps

**Plugin commands complement** (not replace) manual `gh` workflows.

## ACTION (Recency Zone)

**Create PR:**
```shell
gh pr create --title "feat: add feature" --body "..." --assignee @me
```

**Merge PR:**
```shell
gh pr merge {PR} --squash
```

Options: `--squash`, `--merge`, or `--rebase`

**Post-merge cleanup:**
```shell
git checkout main && git fetch --prune origin && git pull
git branch -d feat/my_feature
```

**Check freshness:**
```shell
git fetch origin
BEHIND=$(git rev-list HEAD..origin/main --count)
```
