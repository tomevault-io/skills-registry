# Git Workflow Gotchas

<metadata>

- **Load if**: Git commits, merges, branch management
- **Prerequisites**: @smith-principles/SKILL.md, @smith-standards/SKILL.md

</metadata>

## CRITICAL (Primacy Zone)

<required>

- MUST use `git mv` for renames (preserves history)
- MUST GPG sign all commits: `git commit -S -m "..."`
- MUST keep branches linear (prefer rebase over merge) - essential for stacked PRs, see `@smith-stacks/SKILL.md`
- MUST verify current branch (`git branch --show-current`) before `git commit`, `git push`, or `git rebase` — confirm it matches the branch you intend to modify

</required>

<forbidden>

- NEVER force push to main or shared branches
- NEVER commit directly to main branch
- NEVER rebase shared branches (only personal feature branches)
- NEVER use `--no-verify` to bypass git hooks
- NEVER use `--no-gpg-sign` to skip commit signing

</forbidden>

## Operation Boundaries

<forbidden>

- NEVER interpret "list", "check", or "show" as
  permission to create or modify
- NEVER create branches or tags beyond what was requested

</forbidden>

<required>

- Match action to request: list=list, create=create
- State planned operations before multi-step workflows
- For scope/approval rules, see @smith-guidance/SKILL.md
- For PR creation rules, see `@smith-gh-pr/SKILL.md`

</required>

## Worktree Safety

<required>

- Before write operations (commits, pushes, dev servers, tests): verify `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` matches your intended working directory
- If multiple worktrees exist, use `git worktree list` to identify the correct one
- If in wrong worktree: stop, `cd` to the correct one before proceeding

</required>

## Worktree Patterns

<context>

**Git worktree basics:**

```shell
git worktree add ../feature-branch feat/feature
```

```shell
git worktree list
```

```shell
git worktree remove ../feature-branch
```

**Parallel branch work:**
- Each worktree = independent working directory
- Share same `.git` — branches, stash, reflog shared
- Useful for: hotfix while mid-feature, parallel reviews

**Claude Code integration:**
- `isolation: "worktree"` in Agent tool — auto-creates
  worktree for subagent, cleaned up when done
- Manual worktree tools may be available depending on the
  agent platform (see platform docs for exact tool names)
- Worktree lifecycle hooks (create/remove) fire on
  worktree operations for custom automation
- Agent worktrees auto-cleanup; persistent ones need
  manual `git worktree remove`

</context>

<required>

- ALWAYS verify worktree path before write operations
- NEVER leave orphaned worktrees (check `git worktree list`)
- Clean up persistent worktrees after branch is merged

</required>

## Branch Naming

**Pattern**: `type/descriptive_name` — type MUST match commit type

**Separators** (abbreviated quick-ref; see `@smith-style/SKILL.md` for full rules):
- **Underscore (_)**: Multi-word single concept → `fix/query_processor`
- **Hyphen (-)**: Hierarchy/variant/ticket → `feat/auth-login`, `fix/JIRA-1234-query_processor`

## Commit Standards

**Format**: See `@smith-style/SKILL.md` for conventional commits.

**Atomic commits**: One logical change per commit, passes tests, reversible.

## Non-Obvious Flags

- **`-u`**: Use on first push to set upstream tracking
- **`--force-with-lease`**: Safe force push for personal branches - required for stacked PRs after rebase, see `@smith-stacks/SKILL.md`
- **`--no-ff`**: Preserve merge commit for feature branches (maintains history)
- **`-S`**: GPG sign commits

## Claude Code Plugin Integration

<context>

**When commit-commands plugin is available:**

- **`/commit`**: Auto-generates commit message, stages files, creates commit
- **`/clean_gone`**: Cleans up branches deleted from remote (including worktrees)

**Manual commands still needed for:**
- GPG signing (`-S` flag)
- Interactive rebase
- Force push with lease

</context>

## Ralph Loop Commit Strategy

<required>

**Atomic commits mark iteration boundaries.** Include iteration number; enables `git bisect` for regressions.

See `@smith-ralph/SKILL.md` for full commit patterns.

</required>

<related>

- `@smith-stacks/SKILL.md` - Stacked PR workflows (uses linear history, force-with-lease)
- `@smith-gh-pr/SKILL.md` - PR creation, review cycles, merge strategies
- `@smith-gh-cli/SKILL.md` - GitHub CLI commands
- `@smith-style/SKILL.md` - Naming conventions, conventional commits
- `@smith-ctx-claude/SKILL.md` - Claude Code agent features and context management

</related>

## ACTION (Recency Zone)

<required>

**First push to new branch:**
```shell
git push -u origin feat/my_feature
```

**Safe force push (personal branches only):**
```shell
git push --force-with-lease origin feat/my_feature
```

**Feature merge (preserve history):**
```shell
git merge --no-ff feat/my_feature
```

**Interactive rebase (local commits only):**
```shell
git rebase -i HEAD~3
```

</required>
