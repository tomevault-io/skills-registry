# Presenting Data

## Purpose

This component skill guides creation of professional data-driven presentations and whitepapers. Use it when:
- Communicating analysis findings to stakeholders
- Creating executive summaries and detailed technical reports
- Documenting reproducible research with proper citations
- Building a presentation hierarchy: slides → whitepapers (drill-in capability)
- Referenced by process skills for final deliverables

**Supports two complementary formats:**
- **Presentations (marp)** - Slide decks for meetings, pitches, and executive summaries
- **Whitepapers (pandoc)** - Comprehensive documents with citations, cross-references, and academic formatting

## Prerequisites

- Analysis completed with clear findings
- Query results documented and interpreted (use `interpreting-results` skill)
- Visualizations prepared (use `creating-visualizations` skill)
- Understanding of data sources, queries, and reproducibility requirements
- Clear communication goal and target audience identified

## Data Presentation Process

Create a TodoWrite checklist for the 5-phase presentation process:

```
Phase 1: Analyze Audience & Purpose - pending
Phase 2: Structure Narrative - pending
Phase 3: Create Content - pending
Phase 4: Add Citations & Reproducibility - pending
Phase 5: Generate Outputs - pending
```

Mark each phase as you complete it. Document all presentation materials in your analysis directory.

---

## Phase 1: Analyze Audience & Purpose

**Goal:** Understand who will consume your presentation and what decisions they need to make.

### Identify Your Audience

**Executive Stakeholders:**
- Format: Slide presentation (5-10 slides)
- Focus: Key findings, business impact, recommendations
- Detail Level: High-level metrics, visual emphasis
- Tool: **marp** for quick, visual presentations

**Technical Peers:**
- Format: Whitepaper or technical report (20-50 pages)
- Focus: Methodology, reproducibility, detailed analysis
- Detail Level: SQL queries, statistical methods, data quality notes
- Tool: **pandoc** for comprehensive documentation

**Mixed Audience:**
- Format: Both (presentation + supporting whitepaper)
- Focus: Slides for overview, whitepaper for drill-in details
- Detail Level: Presentation hierarchy allowing progressive disclosure
- Tools: **marp** for slides, **pandoc** for backing documents

### Define Communication Goals

**What decisions will this presentation support?**
- Strategic planning (high-level trends and forecasts)
- Operational changes (specific process improvements)
- Technical validation (methodology and reproducibility)
- Policy changes (compliance, risk, standards)

**What actions should the audience take?**
- Approve/reject a proposal
- Allocate budget or resources
- Change operational procedures
- Investigate further (drill into details)

**CHECKPOINT:** Before proceeding to Phase 2, you MUST have:
- [ ] Target audience identified (executive, technical, or mixed)
- [ ] Primary communication goal defined
- [ ] Desired audience action articulated
- [ ] Output format selected (presentation, whitepaper, or both)

---

## Phase 2: Structure Narrative

**Goal:** Organize findings into a compelling narrative that guides the audience to your conclusions.

### Use the 3-Paragraph Essay Structure

**→ See [frameworks/3-paragraph-essay.md](./frameworks/3-paragraph-essay.md) for detailed guidance**

The classic essay structure adapts perfectly to data presentations:

1. **Introduction & Thesis**
   - State the question or problem
   - Present your key finding or recommendation
   - Preview supporting evidence

2. **Body & Supporting Arguments**
   - Present data findings that support your thesis
   - Use visualizations to make patterns clear
   - Address alternative explanations
   - Cite data sources and methodology

3. **Conclusion & Next Steps**
   - Restate key findings
   - Articulate implications and recommendations
   - Identify limitations and follow-up questions

4. **Bibliography & Supporting Documentation**
   - Data sources and SQL queries
   - Reproducibility information (versions, timestamps)
   - References to prior research or methodology
   - Links to detailed whitepapers or repositories

### Apply Narrative Structure for Data Stories

**→ See [frameworks/narrative-structure.md](./frameworks/narrative-structure.md) for storytelling patterns**

Data presentations follow narrative arcs:
- **Setup**: Establish business context and question
- **Conflict**: Present the data challenge or pattern
- **Resolution**: Show findings and recommendations
- **Call to Action**: Define next steps

### Outline Your Presentation

Create outline document: `analysis/[session-name]/presentation-outline.md`

**For Presentations (Marp):**
```markdown
# Presentation Outline

## Slide 1: Title & Context
- Analysis question
- Time period and data sources

## Integration with Process Skills

Process skills reference this component skill when presenting findings:

```markdown
Use the `presenting-data` component skill to create professional
deliverables from your analysis:
- Executive presentations (marp) for quick communication
- Technical whitepapers (pandoc) for detailed documentation
- Both formats with proper citations and reproducibility
```

When presenting analysis results:
1. **Choose format** based on audience (Phase 1)
2. **Structure narrative** using essay or story patterns (Phase 2)
3. **Create content** with marp/pandoc (Phase 3)
4. **Add citations** and reproducibility documentation (Phase 4)
5. **Generate outputs** for delivery (Phase 5)

**Typical Usage Contexts:**
- `exploratory-analysis` → Use presenting-data for final report
- `guided-investigation` → Use presenting-data to document findings
- `hypothesis-testing` → Use presenting-data to publish results
- `comparative-analysis` → Use presenting-data for comparison reports
