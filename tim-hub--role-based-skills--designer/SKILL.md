# Designer — UX Review & Improvement

Evaluate interfaces through the lens of **"easy to use, easy to understand"**. Review existing UI code, identify friction, and provide actionable improvements categorized by impact.

## Review Process

### Step 1: Understand Context

Before reviewing, determine:
- **Who** are the users? (developers, end-users, admins)
- **What** is the interface? (web page, modal, form, CLI, settings panel)
- **What** is the primary task the user is trying to accomplish?

### Step 2: Audit Using the UX Checklist

Evaluate the interface against these categories (in priority order):

#### 1. Clarity
- Can the user immediately understand what this screen/component does?
- Are labels, headings, and instructions clear and jargon-free?
- Is the information hierarchy obvious? (most important content first)

#### 2. Simplicity
- Can anything be removed without losing function?
- Are there unnecessary steps, fields, or options?
- Is progressive disclosure used where appropriate? (show basics first, details on demand)

#### 3. Consistency
- Do similar elements look and behave the same way?
- Does it follow the project's existing design patterns?
- Are spacing, colors, and typography consistent?

#### 4. Feedback & State
- Does the UI respond to user actions? (loading, success, error states)
- Are error messages helpful and actionable? (say what went wrong AND how to fix it)
- Is the current state always visible? (selected item, active page, progress)

#### 5. Accessibility
- Sufficient color contrast (4.5:1 for text, 3:1 for large text)?
- Interactive elements keyboard-navigable?
- Semantic HTML used? (headings, landmarks, labels)
- Screen reader friendly? (alt text, aria-labels where needed)

#### 6. Interaction Cost
- Minimize clicks/taps to complete the primary task
- Reduce cognitive load: don't make users remember information across steps
- Smart defaults and autofill where possible
- Obvious clickable/tappable areas (sufficient size, clear affordance)

#### 7. Error Prevention
- Constrain inputs where possible (dropdowns vs free text, date pickers vs text)
- Validate inline and early, not just on submit
- Confirm destructive actions
- Allow undo where feasible

### Step 3: Categorize Findings

Rate each finding by impact:

| Level | Label | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| **P0** | **Critical** | Blocks users or causes serious confusion/errors |
| **P1** | **Moderate** | Noticeably hurts usability or breaks conventions |
| **P2** | **Minor** | Polish — improves experience but not blocking |

### Step 4: Report & Implement

Format findings as:

```
## UX Review: [Component/Page Name]

### P0 — Critical
- **[Category]**: Description of issue → Suggested fix

### P1 — Moderate
- **[Category]**: Description of issue → Suggested fix

### P2 — Minor
- **[Category]**: Description of issue → Suggested fix

### Summary
[One-line overall assessment and top recommendation]
```

After reporting, **implement the fixes** in code — starting from P0 down. Ask the user before making large structural changes.

## Quick Patterns — Common Wins

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Wall of text | Break into sections with headings; use bullet points |
| Too many options at once | Group and collapse; use progressive disclosure |
| Mystery icons | Add labels or tooltips |
| No loading state | Add skeleton/spinner for async operations |
| Generic error "Something went wrong" | Specific message + recovery action |
| Tiny click targets | Min 44x44px touch / 24x24px mouse |
| No empty state | Add helpful message + primary action when list is empty |
| Inconsistent button styles | Establish primary/secondary/destructive hierarchy |
| Form with no inline validation | Validate on blur, show errors next to the field |
| Long form without progress | Break into steps or add progress indicator |

## Principles to Reference

When justifying recommendations, cite these as needed:
- **Hick's Law** — More choices = slower decisions. Reduce options.
- **Fitts's Law** — Larger, closer targets are easier to hit. Size important buttons appropriately.
- **Jakob's Law** — Users prefer interfaces that work like ones they already know.
- **Miller's Law** — Working memory holds ~7 items. Chunk information.
- **Aesthetic-Usability Effect** — Users perceive attractive designs as more usable.

For detailed heuristics, see [heuristics.md](heuristics.md).

## Interface-Specific Notes

### Web
- Responsive: test at mobile (375px), tablet (768px), desktop (1280px)
- Focus visible states for keyboard navigation
- Use `prefers-reduced-motion` for animations

### Mobile
- Thumb-friendly zones for primary actions (bottom of screen)
- Swipe gestures should have visible button alternatives
- Respect platform conventions (iOS vs Android patterns)

### CLI
- `--help` output should be scannable (grouped flags, examples)
- Use color/bold sparingly for emphasis, support `NO_COLOR`
- Provide sensible defaults; don't force flags for common use cases
