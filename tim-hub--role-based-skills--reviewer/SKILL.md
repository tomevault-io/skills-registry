# Reviewer

Review code changes from git history, then challenge every flaw using the challenger methodology.

## Inputs

The user may provide:
- **Two commit hashes**: review changes from `<start_hash>` to `<end_hash>`
- **One commit hash**: review that single commit
- **No commit hashes**: review the last commit (`HEAD~1..HEAD`), stashed uncommited changes or unstashed changes

## Workflow

Copy this checklist and track progress:

```
Review Progress:
- [ ] Step 1: Resolve commit range
- [ ] Step 2: Gather change context
- [ ] Step 3: Read changed files for pattern context
- [ ] Step 4: Analyze changes
- [ ] Step 5: Produce challenge report
```

### Step 1: Resolve Commit Range

Determine the commit range based on user input:

| Input | Git range |
|-------|-----------|
| Two hashes: `<start>` `<end>` | `<start>..<end>` |
| One hash: `<hash>` | `<hash>~1..<hash>` |
| No hashes | `HEAD~1..HEAD` |

Run: `git log --oneline <range>` to confirm the commits exist and list them.

### Step 2: Gather Change Context

Run these commands to collect the full picture:

```bash
# List all changed files
git diff --name-status <range>

# Get the full diff with context
git diff <range>

# Get commit messages for intent
git log --format="%h %s%n%b" <range>
```

### Step 3: Read Changed Files for Pattern Context

For each **modified** file (not deleted), read the full current version to understand:
- Existing code style and conventions
- Patterns used in the surrounding code
- How similar functionality is implemented elsewhere in the same file

For **new** files, find similar files in the same directory or module to establish expected patterns:

```bash
# Find sibling files for pattern reference
ls <directory_of_new_file>/
```

Read 1-2 sibling files to understand local conventions.

### Step 4: Analyze Changes

Review each change against these criteria:

**Pattern Adherence** (primary focus alongside challenger dimensions):
- Does the change follow the existing code style in the file?
- Are naming conventions consistent with the codebase?
- Does it reuse existing utilities rather than reinventing?
- Does it follow established architectural patterns in the module?
- Are imports organized consistently with the rest of the file?
- Does error handling follow the existing pattern?

### Step 5: Produce Challenge Report

Apply the **Challenger** methodology from `/Users/hbai/.cursor/skills/challenger/SKILL.md`. Read that skill and follow its challenge dimensions and output format.

Add one extra dimension to the challenger report:

### 8. Pattern Adherence
- Deviations from existing code style
- Inconsistent naming with surrounding code
- Reinvented utilities that already exist
- Architectural pattern violations
- Import style inconsistencies

## Output Format

Structure the final output as:

```
## Code Review: <short description of changes>

### Commits Reviewed
- `<hash>` <message>
- ...

### Files Changed
- A: <new files>
- M: <modified files>
- D: <deleted files>

## Challenge Report

### Critical (must fix)
- **[DIMENSION]**: Description. Why it's dangerous. Attack/failure scenario.

### High Risk (strongly recommend fixing)
- **[DIMENSION]**: Description. Impact. Scenario.

### Medium Risk (should consider)
- **[DIMENSION]**: Description. Impact. Scenario.

### Low Risk (nitpick / hardening)
- **[DIMENSION]**: Description.

### Summary
X critical, Y high, Z medium, W low issues found.
Verdict: SAFE / RISKY / DANGEROUS
```

## Rules

1. **Always read the actual changed code** — never guess from file names alone.
2. **Always read surrounding code** — pattern adherence requires full file context.
3. **Be specific** — cite exact files, lines, and functions.
4. **Never say "looks good"** — there is always something to challenge.
5. **Prioritize ruthlessly** — critical issues first, nitpicks last.
6. **Challenge assumptions** — if the author assumes X, ask "what if not X?"
7. **Question missing things** — missing validation? missing tests? missing error handling?
