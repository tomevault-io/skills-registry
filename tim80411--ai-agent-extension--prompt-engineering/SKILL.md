# Prompt Engineering for Educational Assessment

Guide the analysis of prompts and identification of required materials for generating xAPI statements in educational assessment contexts.

## Core Concept: Context Material Mapping

To generate valid xAPI statements, identify and collect these material categories:

| xAPI Component | Required Materials | Source |
|----------------|-------------------|--------|
| Actor | User ID, name, account info | Authentication system |
| Verb | Action type, interaction mode | Assessment design |
| Object | Question/quiz metadata, content | Content management |
| Result | Answer, score, duration | Runtime collection |
| Context | Course hierarchy, session info | LMS context |

## Prompt Analysis Framework

### Step 1: Identify the Learning Activity Type

Determine which assessment scenario the prompt describes:

| Scenario | Characteristics | Primary Verb |
|----------|-----------------|--------------|
| Quiz attempt | Multiple questions, scored | attempted → completed |
| Single question | One interaction | answered |
| Course progress | Module completion | progressed |
| Certification | Pass/fail criteria | passed/failed |
| Practice | No scoring | experienced |

### Step 2: Extract Actor Requirements

Identify learner identification needs:

**Required materials:**
- User identifier (account ID, email, or unique name)
- Account home page (LMS URL)
- Display name (optional but recommended)

**Analysis questions:**
- How are users authenticated?
- What unique identifier is available?
- Is the actor an individual or group?

### Step 3: Map Verb Selection

Match the described action to appropriate verb:

**Decision tree:**
```
Is it a question response? → answered
Is it starting an activity? → attempted / launched
Is it finishing an activity? → completed
Is there a pass/fail criterion? → passed / failed
Is it passive consumption? → experienced
Is it progress without completion? → progressed
```

### Step 4: Define Object Structure

Extract activity/question metadata:

**For assessments:**
- Quiz/test unique identifier (URI)
- Title and description
- Activity type (assessment, cmi.interaction)
- For questions: interaction type, choices, correct answers

**For interactions:**
- Question text
- Answer options (for choice types)
- Correct response pattern
- Scoring rules

### Step 5: Determine Result Requirements

Identify what outcome data to collect:

| Result Field | When Required | Data Source |
|--------------|---------------|-------------|
| score.scaled | Scored assessments | Calculation |
| score.raw/min/max | Detailed scoring | Assessment config |
| success | Pass/fail activities | Threshold comparison |
| completion | Trackable activities | Completion logic |
| response | Question interactions | User input |
| duration | Timed activities | Timer |

### Step 6: Build Context Requirements

Identify contextual relationships:

**Hierarchical context:**
- Parent: Direct container (quiz for question)
- Grouping: Broader context (course, program)
- Category: Profile compliance (cmi5)

**Session context:**
- Registration UUID (attempt identifier)
- Platform identifier
- Language

## Material Collection Checklist

### For Quiz/Assessment Scenarios

**Before quiz starts (static materials):**
- [ ] Quiz ID and metadata (title, description)
- [ ] Question bank with IDs
- [ ] For each question:
  - [ ] Question text
  - [ ] Interaction type
  - [ ] Answer options (if applicable)
  - [ ] Correct answer(s)
  - [ ] Scoring weight
- [ ] Pass/fail threshold (if applicable)
- [ ] Time limit (if applicable)
- [ ] Course/module hierarchy

**At runtime (dynamic materials):**
- [ ] Learner account information
- [ ] Session/registration ID
- [ ] Timestamp for each action
- [ ] Learner responses
- [ ] Time spent per question
- [ ] Calculated scores

### For Single Question Scenarios

**Static materials:**
- [ ] Question ID (URI)
- [ ] Question text
- [ ] Interaction type
- [ ] Options/choices (if applicable)
- [ ] Correct response pattern
- [ ] Parent activity ID

**Dynamic materials:**
- [ ] Learner identifier
- [ ] Response value
- [ ] Response timestamp
- [ ] Duration

## Prompt-to-xAPI Mapping Examples

### Example 1: Multiple Choice Quiz

**Prompt:** "Track when a student answers a multiple choice question about xAPI verbs"

**Analysis:**
- Actor: Student (need user ID)
- Verb: answered
- Object: Question with interaction type "choice"
- Result: response, success, score

**Required materials:**
```
Static:
- Question ID: "https://lms.example.com/questions/xapi-verbs-q1"
- Question text: "Which verb indicates completion?"
- Choices: ["completed", "attempted", "launched", "terminated"]
- Correct answer: "completed"

Dynamic:
- Student account: { homePage, name }
- Response: student's selection
- Timestamp: when answered
- Duration: time to answer
```

### Example 2: Course Completion

**Prompt:** "Generate xAPI when learner finishes the xAPI fundamentals course"

**Analysis:**
- Actor: Learner
- Verb: completed
- Object: Course activity
- Result: completion=true, duration

**Required materials:**
```
Static:
- Course ID: "https://lms.example.com/courses/xapi-fundamentals"
- Course title
- Course description

Dynamic:
- Learner account
- Total duration
- Completion timestamp
```

### Example 3: Scored Assessment with Threshold

**Prompt:** "Track quiz results where 80% is passing"

**Analysis:**
- Actor: Learner
- Verb: passed or failed (based on score)
- Object: Assessment activity
- Result: score, success, completion

**Required materials:**
```
Static:
- Assessment ID
- Assessment metadata
- Mastery score: 0.8
- Maximum possible score

Dynamic:
- Learner account
- Raw score achieved
- Calculated scaled score
- Pass/fail determination
- Total duration
```

## Common Patterns

### Pattern: Question within Quiz

Context hierarchy for nested tracking:

```
Quiz (parent)
└── Question (object)
```

Statement structure:
```json
{
  "object": { "id": "question-uri" },
  "context": {
    "contextActivities": {
      "parent": [{ "id": "quiz-uri" }]
    }
  }
}
```

### Pattern: Attempt Tracking

Track individual attempts with registration:

```json
{
  "context": {
    "registration": "attempt-uuid"
  }
}
```

Use same registration for all statements in one attempt.

### Pattern: Multi-Language Content

Support internationalization:

```json
{
  "object": {
    "definition": {
      "name": {
        "en-US": "Quiz Title",
        "zh-TW": "測驗標題"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Validation Questions

Before generating statements, verify:

1. **Actor clarity:** Is the learner identifier unique and consistent?
2. **Verb appropriateness:** Does the verb match the actual action?
3. **Object completeness:** Are all required definition fields present?
4. **Result accuracy:** Are scores calculated correctly?
5. **Context relationships:** Are parent/grouping activities correct?
6. **Timestamp precision:** Are timestamps in ISO 8601 format?
