# Performance Optimization

Language-agnostic performance optimization guidance distilled from Google's Abseil performance engineering wisdom. Applicable to C++, Rust, and TypeScript.

## Core Philosophy

Forget about small efficiencies 97% of the time. But a 12% improvement, easily obtained, is never considered marginal. Choose faster alternatives when readability and complexity remain unaffected. Reserve deep optimization for the measured critical 3%.

For full philosophy, estimation techniques, and latency numbers, consult **`references/philosophy.md`**.

## The Optimization Workflow

```
1. MEASURE  →  2. IDENTIFY  →  3. OPTIMIZE  →  4. VERIFY
   Profile       Find the          Apply           Measure
   first         bottleneck        technique        again
```

### 1. Measure First

Never optimize without a baseline measurement. Profile production or representative workloads.

### 2. Identify the Bottleneck

Determine which resource is constrained: CPU, memory, network, disk. Use the appropriate profiling tool.

### 3. Apply the Right Technique

Use the decision tree below to select the appropriate reference file.

### 4. Verify the Improvement

Measure again with the same methodology. Compare primary and proxy metrics. An unmeasured optimization is worthless.

## Quick Reference: Latency Numbers

| Operation | Latency |
|-----------|---------|
| L1 cache reference | 0.5 ns |
| L2 cache reference | 3 ns |
| Branch mispredict | 5 ns |
| Mutex lock/unlock | 15 ns |
| Main memory reference | 50 ns |
| Compress 1KB | 1 us |
| Read 4KB from SSD | 20 us |
| Datacenter round trip | 50 us |
| Read 1MB sequentially (RAM) | 64 us |
| Read 1MB from SSD | 1 ms |
| Disk seek | 5 ms |
| Read 1MB from disk | 10 ms |

Extended table with additional entries and notes in **`references/philosophy.md`**.

## Decision Tree: Which Reference to Consult

**"The algorithm is wrong or suboptimal"**
→ **`references/techniques-algorithms.md`** — Algorithmic complexity, data structure selection, bulk APIs, search/iteration optimization, regex optimization.

**"Too much memory used, or memory access is slow"**
→ **`references/techniques-memory.md`** — Compact structs, field reordering, indices vs. pointers, batched storage, inlined storage, arenas, bit vectors, reducing indirections.

**"Code does unnecessary work"**
→ **`references/techniques-execution.md`** — Fast paths, precomputation, deferred computation, specialization, caching, compiler hints, stats reduction.

**"Too many allocations or copies"**
→ **`references/techniques-allocations.md`** — Avoid unnecessary allocations, reserve/resize, move vs. copy, reuse temporaries, object pooling.

**"Need to measure or profile correctly"**
→ **`references/measurement.md`** — Profiling methodology, flat profiles, microbenchmarking, hardware counters, measurement ROI, decision-making with imperfect data.

**"Need to think about the optimization approach"**
→ **`references/optimization-process.md`** — Project selection, success metrics, reversibility, rollout strategy, automation, estimation calibration.

**"Need the equivalent technique in another language"**
→ **`references/language-equivalents.md`** — C++ → Rust → TypeScript mapping for all techniques, applicability matrix, TypeScript-specific concerns.

**"Need to understand the performance mindset"**
→ **`references/philosophy.md`** — The critical 3%, performance-aware design, back-of-envelope estimation, latency reference table, structural thinking.

## Optimization Categories at a Glance

| Category | Key Insight | Impact |
|----------|------------|--------|
| Algorithm/data structure | Reduce complexity class (O(N²) → O(N)) | 10-1000x |
| Memory representation | Smaller = fewer cache misses = faster everything | 2-10x |
| Avoid unnecessary work | Fast paths, precompute, defer, specialize | 2-20x |
| Reduce allocations | Each alloc costs time + cache + GC pressure | 1.2-5x |
| Bulk APIs | Amortize per-item overhead across N items | 2-10x |
| Measurement methodology | Measure the right thing the right way | Enables all above |

## Process Checklist

When undertaking performance optimization work:

- [ ] Define primary success metric before starting
- [ ] Estimate expected improvement (back-of-envelope)
- [ ] Profile to identify the actual bottleneck (do not guess)
- [ ] Apply one technique at a time for measurability
- [ ] Measure after each change with pre-defined methodology
- [ ] Compare estimate to actual result for calibration
- [ ] Consider non-local effects (cache pressure, distributed system impacts)
- [ ] Prefer two-way door decisions (reversible via feature flags)

## Language-Specific Quick Notes

**Rust**: Move semantics are default. Use `Vec::with_capacity`, `smallvec`, `bumpalo` for allocation control. `hashbrown` (default `HashMap`) uses SwissTable internally. Profile with `perf`, `criterion`, `flamegraph`. LLVM backend shared with C++ enables `llvm-mca` analysis.

**TypeScript**: Focus on algorithmic complexity, V8 hidden class stability (monomorphic objects), GC pressure reduction, and TypedArrays for numeric work. Most C++ memory-layout techniques do not apply. Profile with Chrome DevTools and `clinic.js`. Bundle size affects parse/compile time.

**C++**: Full access to all techniques. Use `absl::` types (InlinedVector, flat_hash_map, Span, string_view) for efficient defaults. Profile with `pprof` and `perf`. Use `llvm-mca` for instruction-level analysis.

For comprehensive cross-language mapping, consult **`references/language-equivalents.md`**.
