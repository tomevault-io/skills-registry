## Action Items

| Action | Owner | Due Date |
|--------|-------|----------|

| Implement validation | @person | YYYY-MM-DD |
| Update runbook | @person | YYYY-MM-DD |

## Lessons Learned

Key takeaways for the team.
```

## Principles

### Blameless

- Focus on systems, not people
- "The system allowed X" not "Person did X"
- Assume good intentions

### Actionable

- Every finding has an action item
- Actions have owners and dates
- Follow up on completion

### Honest

- Don't minimize impact
- Include what went wrong
- Acknowledge gaps

## 5 Whys Example

1. Why did the query fail? → Null user_id
2. Why was user_id null? → Auth didn't set it
3. Why didn't auth set it? → Token was expired
4. Why wasn't expiry handled? → Missing check
5. Why was check missing? → No test coverage

**Root cause:** Missing test for token expiry path
