description: Guide for creating effective subagents (custom agents). Use when users want to create a new subagent that can be dispatched via Task tool for autonomous work. Covers frontmatter fields (name, description, tools, model, permissionMode, skills), prompt design, and when to use subagents vs skills. Use when this capability is needed.

# Subagent Creator

Create effective subagents that handle autonomous tasks via the Task tool.

## Subagents vs Skills

| Aspect | Subagent | Skill |
|--------|----------|-------|
| **Invocation** | Explicit via Task tool | Auto-triggered by context |
| **Context** | Isolated (fresh context window) | Shared with parent |
| **Complexity** | Single .md file | Folder with resources |
| **Use case** | Autonomous discrete tasks | Guidance and procedures |
| **Nesting** | Cannot spawn other subagents | Can reference other skills |

**Use subagent when:**
- Task is discrete and autonomous
- Fresh context window is beneficial
- Task can run in parallel with other work
- Specialized tool restrictions needed

**Use skill when:**
- Guidance needed throughout conversation
- Context sharing is important
- Multiple resources (scripts, references) needed

## Subagent Structure

```
agents/
└── agent-name.md
    ├── YAML frontmatter (metadata)
    └── Markdown body (system prompt)
```

### Frontmatter Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | Yes | Lowercase, hyphens only (e.g., `code-reviewer`) |
| `description` | Yes | When to use - this triggers dispatch decisions |
| `tools` | No | Comma-separated: `Bash, Glob, Grep, Read, Edit, Write` |
| `model` | No | `sonnet`, `opus`, `haiku`, or `inherit` (default: inherit) |
| `permissionMode` | No | `default`, `acceptEdits`, `bypassPermissions`, `plan` |
| `skills` | No | Comma-separated skills to auto-load |

### Tools Reference

```
Read-only:     Glob, Grep, Read, WebFetch, WebSearch
Write:         Edit, Write, NotebookEdit
Execute:       Bash
All:           * (or omit field)
```

### Permission Modes

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `default` | Normal permission prompts |
| `acceptEdits` | Auto-accept file edits |
| `bypassPermissions` | Skip all permission prompts |
| `plan` | Plan mode - explore but don't modify |

## Writing Effective Prompts

### Structure

```markdown
---
name: agent-name
description: When to use this agent. Be specific about triggers.
tools: Tool1, Tool2
model: sonnet
---

# Agent Name

One-line role description.

## Input Required
What the agent expects to receive.

## Process
Step-by-step what the agent does.

## Output Format
Exact format of the response.

## Rules
- Constraints and boundaries
- What to avoid
```

### Best Practices

1. **Be specific about role** - First line defines identity
2. **Define clear inputs** - What must be provided
3. **Structure the process** - Numbered steps
4. **Specify output format** - Use code blocks for templates
5. **Set boundaries** - What NOT to do

### Description Guidelines

The `description` field triggers when the agent is suggested. Include:
- Primary use case
- Required inputs
- Expected output type

```yaml
# Good
description: Use after completing a task to review code changes. Provide BASE_SHA, HEAD_SHA, and requirements. Returns issues with file:line references.

# Bad
description: Reviews code.
```

## Examples

### Minimal Subagent

```markdown
---
name: summarizer
description: Use to summarize long documents or conversations. Provide the content to summarize.
tools: Read
model: haiku
---

# Summarizer

Summarize the provided content in 3-5 bullet points.

Focus on: key decisions, action items, conclusions.
Skip: greetings, filler, obvious context.
```

### Full Subagent

See `references/subagent-examples.md` for complete examples.

## Creation Process

1. **Define the task** - What autonomous work does this agent do?
2. **Choose tools** - Minimum needed (prefer restrictive)
3. **Choose model** - haiku for simple, sonnet for complex, opus for critical
4. **Write prompt** - Role, process, output, rules
5. **Test** - Dispatch via Task tool, iterate

### Init Script

```bash
scripts/init_subagent.py <agent-name> --path <output-directory>
```

Creates template agent file with proper structure.

## Anti-Patterns

- **Too broad** - Agent tries to do everything
- **Too many tools** - Give minimum necessary
- **Vague output** - Always specify exact format
- **No boundaries** - Must define what NOT to do
- **Wrong model** - Don't use opus for simple tasks
