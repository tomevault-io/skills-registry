# Prompt Engineering Instructional Language (PEIL)

PEIL is a structured methodology for generating high-quality system prompts for AI agents and large language models.

## When to Use This Skill

- Creating system prompts for autonomous agents
- Improving existing prompts for better LLM performance
- Applying research-backed prompting techniques
- Structuring complex instructions clearly

## PEIL Template Structure

Use the following variables to construct effective prompts:

```
{Role} {ProvideClearContext} {BreakDownComplexQuestions} {ProvideSpecificInstructions} {DefineConciseness} {PromptingTechniques} {StateDesiredOutput}
```

### Variable Definitions

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Role** | Specify the persona or expertise the model should adopt |
| **ProvideClearContext** | Set the domain and focus area for precise, tailored responses |
| **BreakDownComplexQuestions** | Decompose complex topics into manageable sub-questions |
| **ProvideSpecificInstructions** | Define constraints, requirements, or rules |
| **DefineConciseness** | Set word limits or brevity requirements |
| **PromptingTechniques** | Apply research-backed techniques (see [TECHNIQUES.md](references/TECHNIQUES.md)) |
| **StateDesiredOutput** | Specify the expected format, structure, or content |

## Hybrid Prompt Structure

Based on research from [arXiv:2503.06926](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06926), employ a hybrid structure:

1. **Opening Statement**: Short sentence or paragraph stating role and goal
2. **Bullet Points**: Specific rules, options, or constraints

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Define the Role**: Start with "You are a [domain] expert" or similar
2. **Set Context**: Explain the domain and what the model should focus on
3. **Break Down Questions**: If complex, split into sub-questions
4. **Add Constraints**: Include any specific rules or requirements
5. **Set Length**: Define word limits if needed
6. **Choose Technique**: Select from [TECHNIQUES.md](references/TECHNIQUES.md) based on task type
7. **Specify Output**: Define format (Markdown, JSON, bullet points, etc.)

## Quick Reference: Technique Selection

| Task Type | Recommended Technique |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Reasoning & Logic | Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Tree-of-Thoughts |
| Reduce Hallucination | RAG, Chain-of-Verification (CoVe) |
| Code Generation | Scratchpad, Program of Thoughts (PoT) |
| New Tasks | Zero-Shot or Few-Shot Prompting |
| Complex Analysis | Decomposed Prompting, Thread of Thought |

See [TECHNIQUES.md](references/TECHNIQUES.md) for the complete techniques table.

## Example Prompt

```
You are a cybersecurity expert specializing in enterprise security architecture, focused on practical measures for protecting sensitive data in cloud environments.

When responding:
- Include at least three key components of a strong security strategy
- Provide specific examples of implementation
- Address both technical and human factors

Think through each security layer step by step. Provide a structured Markdown response with clear headings, limited to 300 words.
```

## Empirical Evidence

A 2026 quantitative evaluation tested PEIL across 4 model architectures (GPT-4.1, GPT-5.2, Grok-4-fast-reasoning, DeepSeek-R1-0528) on 18 research-paper patterns. Key findings:

- **PEIL labels improve quality over unlabelled prompts** on 13/18 patterns (+0.094 overall, +0.208 on fabrication reduction).
- **Fabrication reduction is the strongest benefit** — explicit labels help models stay grounded and avoid inventing facts.
- **PEIL is most effective for structured output tasks** such as template filling (+0.69), expert assessment (+0.50), and code generation (+0.38).
- **Role framing is critical for sensitive domains** — in a cybersecurity case study, a naive prompt was refused by the model while the PEIL-structured prompt with Role and Context framing produced a full professional analysis.
- **PEIL is designed as a system prompt for agents.** When tested as a single-turn chat prompt without embedded task data, models correctly recognised the system-prompt architecture and waited for user input — validating the design but requiring adaptation for single-turn use.

### Usage Modes

| Mode | How It Works | When to Use |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **System-prompt mode** (primary) | PEIL defines agent behaviour in the system prompt; user messages supply task data separately | Agent and multi-turn workflows |
| **Single-turn mode** (portable) | All task data must be embedded in the prompt body, typically after the Output section | One-off chat interactions, benchmarks |
