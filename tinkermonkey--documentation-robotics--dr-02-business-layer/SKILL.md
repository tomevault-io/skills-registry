# Business Layer Skill

**Layer Number:** 02
**Specification:** Metadata Model Spec v0.8.3
**Purpose:** Represents business services, processes, actors, and objects that define the organization's operational structure and capabilities.

---

## Layer Overview

The Business Layer captures the **operational structure** of the organization:

- **WHO** - Business actors, roles, and collaborations
- **WHAT** - Business services and products
- **HOW** - Business processes, functions, and interactions
- **INFORMATION** - Business objects and their representations

This layer uses **ArchiMate 3.2 Business Layer** standard without custom extensions, with optional extensions for BPMN integration, SLA tracking, and security controls.

## Entity Types

> **CLI Introspection:** Run `dr schema types business` for the authoritative, always-current list of node types.
> Run `dr schema node <type-id>` for full attribute details on any type.

## Type Decision Tree

Use this decision tree **before assigning a type** to any observed business concept.

```
IS this an individual person, organization, or system that acts in the business domain?
  → BusinessActor (e.g., Customer, Supplier, Partner)

IS this a named responsibility or hat worn by an actor?
  → BusinessRole (e.g., Sales Representative, Account Manager)

IS this a group of roles working together toward a shared goal?
  → BusinessCollaboration (e.g., Sales Team, Project Team)

IS this a channel or contact point where a business service is accessed?
  → BusinessInterface (e.g., Customer Portal, Phone Support Line)

IS this a structured sequence of steps that produces a business outcome?
  → BusinessProcess (e.g., Order Fulfillment, Loan Approval)

IS this a grouping of related business behaviors (department-level capability)?
  → BusinessFunction (e.g., Marketing, Finance, Customer Support)

IS this a joint behavior performed by two or more roles together?
  → BusinessInteraction (e.g., Contract Negotiation, Sales Meeting)

IS this something that happens and triggers a response in the business?
  → BusinessEvent (e.g., Order Received, Payment Confirmed)

IS this an externally visible capability the business offers to stakeholders?
  → BusinessService (e.g., Order Management Service, Payment Service)

IS this a key domain concept or data entity used in business language?
  → BusinessObject (e.g., Order, Invoice, Customer)

IS this a formal agreement with binding terms between parties?
  → Contract (e.g., SLA, Purchase Agreement, Terms of Service)

IS this a concrete form in which a business object is communicated?
  → Representation (e.g., Invoice PDF, Order Confirmation Email)

IS this a coherent bundle of services with a value proposition for customers?
  → Product (e.g., E-commerce Platform, Premium Support Package)
```

## Common Misclassifications

| Misclassification                                     | Correct Classification                                                                                         | Why                                                                                |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A department or team as `BusinessService`             | `BusinessFunction` (department) or `BusinessCollaboration` (team)                                              | Services are externally visible capabilities; departments are behavioral groupings |
| A REST endpoint or UI as `BusinessInterface`          | `BusinessInterface` is correct — but link it to the `ApplicationInterface` in the application layer            | Business interfaces are the business-facing access point, not the technical one    |
| A business rule or policy as `BusinessProcess`        | `BusinessProcess` only for sequences of steps; rules belong in Motivation layer as `Principle` or `Constraint` | Processes produce outcomes through behavior; rules govern behavior                 |
| A domain entity (Order, Invoice) as `BusinessProcess` | `BusinessObject`                                                                                               | Objects are concepts; processes are sequences of behavior                          |
| A job title (Sales Rep) as `BusinessActor`            | `BusinessRole`                                                                                                 | Roles are responsibilities; actors are the people/orgs that fill them              |
| An SLA document as `BusinessService`                  | `Contract`                                                                                                     | An SLA is a formal agreement, not the service itself                               |
| A product feature as `BusinessFunction`               | `Product` if it bundles services with customer value; `BusinessService` if it's a single capability            | Products aggregate services; functions are internal behavioral groupings           |

- **Realization**: Application services realize business services
- **Support**: Technology supports business operations
- **Traceability**: APIs map to business interfaces

---

## Codebase Detection Patterns

### Pattern 1: Service Layer Classes

```python
# FastAPI Business Service
@app.post("/api/orders")
async def create_order(order_data: OrderRequest):
    """Creates a new customer order (Business Service: Order Management)"""
    pass
```

**Maps to:**

- BusinessService: "Order Management Service"
- BusinessProcess: "Create Order Process"
- BusinessObject: "Order"
- BusinessInterface: "API Interface"

### Pattern 2: Domain Models

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Customer:
    """Customer business object"""
    customer_id: str
    name: str
    email: str
    status: str  # active, inactive, suspended
```

**Maps to:**

- BusinessObject: "Customer"
- Potential BusinessProcess: "Customer Management"

### Pattern 3: Event Definitions

```typescript
// Domain events
export enum BusinessEvents {
  ORDER_CREATED = "order.created",
  ORDER_FULFILLED = "order.fulfilled",
  PAYMENT_RECEIVED = "payment.received"
}
```

**Maps to:**

- BusinessEvent entities (order.created, order.fulfilled, payment.received)

### Pattern 4: BPMN Process References

```python
# Process definition with BPMN reference
class OrderFulfillmentProcess:
    """
    Order fulfillment business process
    BPMN: processes/order-fulfillment.bpmn
    KPI: 95% orders fulfilled within 24 hours
    """
    def execute(self, order_id: str):
        pass
```

**Maps to:**

- BusinessProcess: "Order Fulfillment"
- Properties: `bpmn-file`, `kpi-target`

### Pattern 5: Role-Based Authorization

```python
from enum import Enum

class BusinessRole(Enum):
    SALES_REP = "sales_representative"
    ACCOUNT_MANAGER = "account_manager"
    CUSTOMER_SERVICE = "customer_service"
    ADMIN = "administrator"

@require_role(BusinessRole.SALES_REP)
def create_opportunity(data):
    pass
```

**Maps to:**

- BusinessRole entities (SalesRepresentative, AccountManager, etc.)

### Pattern 6: SLA Configuration

```yaml
# Service SLA definitions
services:
  order_processing:
    sla:
      availability: 99.9%
      response_time: 500ms
      throughput: 1000 req/sec
    business_hours: "24/7"
```

**Maps to:**

- BusinessService with SLA properties
- Contract entity for formal SLA

## Coverage Completeness Checklist

Before declaring business layer extraction complete, verify ALL 13 entity types have been considered:

```
□ BusinessActor      — people, orgs, or systems that act (Customer, Supplier, Partner)
□ BusinessRole       — named responsibilities assigned to actors (Sales Rep, Admin)
□ BusinessCollaboration — groups of roles working together (Sales Team, Support Dept)
□ BusinessInterface  — access points where services are available (Portal, API, Phone)
□ BusinessProcess    — step sequences producing a business outcome (Order Fulfillment)
□ BusinessFunction   — department-level behavioral capability (Marketing, Finance)
□ BusinessInteraction — collective behavior by a collaboration (Contract Negotiation)
□ BusinessEvent      — triggers: time-driven, state-change, external (Order Received)
□ BusinessService    — externally visible capability (Order Management, Payment)
□ BusinessObject     — key domain concepts (Order, Invoice, Customer, Opportunity)
□ Contract           — formal agreements: SLA, Terms of Service, Purchase Agreement
□ Representation     — concrete forms of objects (format: pdf, html, xml, json, plain-text, binary)
□ Product            — bundles of services with customer value proposition

If any type has ZERO elements, explicitly decide:
  "This type doesn't apply to this codebase" with reasoning.
```

## Modeling Workflow

### Step 1: Identify Business Actors and Roles

```bash
# Add business actors
dr add business actor "Customer" \
  --description "End user purchasing products"

dr add business collaboration "Sales Team" \
  --description "Internal sales organization"

# Add business roles
dr add business role "Sales Representative" \
  --description "Responsible for customer acquisition"

dr add business role "Account Manager" \
  --description "Manages existing customer relationships"
```

### Step 2: Define Business Services

```bash
# Core business service
dr add business service "Order Management Service" \
  --description "Manages customer order lifecycle"

# Link to motivation layer
dr relationship add business.businessservice.order-management-service \
  motivation.goal.improve-order-efficiency --predicate supports
```

### Step 3: Model Business Processes

```bash
# Main process
dr add business process "Order Fulfillment Process" \
  --description "End-to-end order fulfillment from creation to delivery"

# Sub-processes
dr add business process "Pick Items Process" \
  --description "Pick items from warehouse inventory"

dr add business process "Pack Order Process" \
  --description "Pack picked items for shipment"

# Composition relationships
dr relationship add business.businessprocess.order-fulfillment-process \
  business.businessprocess.pick-items-process --predicate composes

dr relationship add business.businessprocess.order-fulfillment-process \
  business.businessprocess.pack-order-process --predicate composes

# Process flows
dr relationship add business.businessprocess.pick-items-process \
  business.businessprocess.pack-order-process --predicate flows-to
```

### Step 4: Define Business Objects

```bash
# Core business objects
dr add business object "Order" \
  --description "Customer purchase order"

dr add business object "Customer" \
  --description "Individual or organization purchasing products"

dr add business object "Product" \
  --description "Item available for purchase"

# Process access to objects
dr relationship add business.businessprocess.order-fulfillment-process \
  business.businessobject.order --predicate accesses
```

### Step 5: Model Business Events

```bash
# Events that trigger processes
dr add business event "Order Received" \
  --description "New order submitted by customer"

dr add business event "Payment Confirmed" \
  --description "Payment successfully processed"

# Event triggering
dr relationship add business.businessevent.order-received \
  business.businessprocess.order-fulfillment-process --predicate triggers
```

### Step 6: Establish Cross-Layer Relationships

```bash
# Link to application layer
dr relationship add business.businessservice.order-management-service \
  application.applicationservice.order-api --predicate realized-by

# Link to motivation layer
dr relationship add business.businessservice.order-management-service \
  motivation.value.customer-satisfaction --predicate delivers

# Link to data layer
dr relationship add business.businessobject.order \
  data-model.objectschema.order --predicate defined-by
```

### Step 7: Validate

```bash
dr validate --layers business
dr validate --relationships
```

## BPMN Integration

When business processes reference BPMN diagrams:

```bash
dr add business process "Loan Approval Process" \
  --description "End-to-end loan application review and approval"
```

**BPMN Properties:**

- `bpmn-file`: Path to BPMN XML file
- `bpmn-version`: BPMN specification version (2.0)
- `bpmn-task-mapping`: Map BPMN tasks to business roles

**Validation:** Ensure BPMN task IDs align with business process sub-processes.

## SLA and Performance Tracking

Business services can define SLA targets:

```yaml
business-service:
  id: "payment-processing-service"
  properties:
    sla-availability: "99.99%"
    sla-response-time: "200ms"
    sla-throughput: "5000 tps"
    business-hours: "24/7"
    escalation-time: "15m"
```

These SLAs flow down to:

- **Application Layer** - Application services inherit targets
- **APM Layer** - Monitoring dashboards track against targets
- **Motivation Layer** - SLAs trace to business goals

## ArchiMate Export

```bash
dr export archimate --layers business --output business.archimate
```

**Supported ArchiMate Elements:**

- All 13 business entity types map directly to ArchiMate 3.2 Business Layer
- Relationships: composition, aggregation, assignment, realization, specialization, triggering, flow, serving, access, association

---

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Services, Not Processes** - Identify WHAT the business provides before HOW it's delivered
2. **Use Process Composition** - Break complex processes into manageable sub-processes
3. **Model Events Explicitly** - Event-driven architectures need explicit BusinessEvent entities
4. **Link to Motivation Early** - Connect services and processes to goals for traceability
5. **Don't Over-Detail** - Focus on architecturally significant processes, not every task
6. **Use BPMN for Complex Workflows** - Reference BPMN files rather than modeling every detail
7. **Distinguish Role from Actor** - Role is responsibility; Actor is individual/team
8. **Model Contracts for SLAs** - Formalize service agreements as Contract entities
9. **Track Business Objects** - Identify key domain concepts even if data model comes later

## Validation Tips

| Issue                        | Cause                                        | Fix                                           |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Orphaned Process             | No event triggers it, no service realizes it | Add triggering event or link to service       |
| Unrealized Service           | No process/function realizes the service     | Add process that implements the service       |
| Missing Business Objects     | Processes don't access any objects           | Identify key domain concepts and add them     |
| No Cross-Layer Relationships | Business not linked to application/data      | Add realization relationships to lower layers |
| Unassigned Roles             | Roles not assigned to processes              | Assign roles to show responsibility           |
| Missing SLA Properties       | Services lack performance targets            | Add SLA properties for monitoring             |
