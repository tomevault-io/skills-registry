# Task Validation Skill

## Purpose

This skill validates that tasks are truly completed with real working implementation, not just documentation or specifications. It enforces quality standards and prevents "paper solutions."

## Usage

Invoke this skill when you need to:
- Validate task completion before marking as done
- Check if implementation is real or just documentation
- Verify working code and test results
- Ensure compliance with quality standards
- Prevent incomplete work from being marked complete

## Validation Process

### 1. File Verification
```bash
# Check claimed files exist
find .claude -name "filename.py" -type f

# Verify file content
ls -la path/to/file.py
wc -l path/to/file.py
```

### 2. Functionality Testing
```bash
# Test code execution
python script.py --help
python script.py test

# Check for errors
python -m py_compile script.py
```

### 3. Evidence Collection
- File creation proof with paths and sizes
- Working code demonstration with outputs
- Test results showing functionality
- Integration verification

### 4. Standards Compliance
- Follow task execution standards
- Proper Git workflow used
- Comprehensive testing included
- Clear documentation provided

## Validation Criteria

### ✅ PASS Criteria
- All claimed files exist with working code
- Code executes without errors
- Functionality produces expected results
- Evidence provided and verified
- Standards compliance confirmed

### ❌ FAIL Criteria
- Files missing or contain only comments
- Code doesn't execute or has errors
- No working proof provided
- Documentation-only solution
- Standards not followed

## Required Evidence

For task completion validation, you MUST provide:

1. **File Evidence**: Paths and sizes of all created/modified files
2. **Working Proof**: Command outputs showing code execution
3. **Test Results**: Test runs demonstrating functionality
4. **Integration Proof**: System working with new code

## Example Usage

```
User: "Validate that task 4 is actually completed"

[System should invoke this skill to:]
- Check all claimed files exist
- Test the implementation
- Verify evidence provided
- Confirm standards compliance
- Provide PASS/FAIL result with reasoning
```

## Integration

This skill works with:
- quality-assurance agent for thorough validation
- task-branch-manager.sh for proper workflow
- task-complete-validator.sh for automated checks
- TASK_EXECUTION_STANDARDS.md for requirements

## Quality Gates

This skill enforces strict quality gates:
- No paper solutions allowed
- Working code mandatory
- Evidence required
- Standards compliance enforced
- Git workflow followed
