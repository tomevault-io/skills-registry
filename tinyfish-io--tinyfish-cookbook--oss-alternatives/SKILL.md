# OSS Alternatives Finder

Given any paid SaaS tool or commercial API, find and rank the best actively maintained open source alternatives by searching GitHub and developer communities in real time — then verify the health of each one and summarise exactly what a developer gains and loses by switching.

## Pre-flight check

Before doing anything, verify TinyFish is installed and authenticated:

```bash
tinyfish --version
tinyfish auth status
```

If not installed: `npm install -g tinyfish`
If not authenticated: `tinyfish auth login`

---

## Step 1 — Understand the tool

Before searching, identify:
- **Tool name** — exactly as it is known (e.g. "Datadog", "Auth0", "Algolia")
- **Primary use case** — what problem it solves (e.g. "APM and log aggregation", "authentication", "search-as-a-service")
- **Key features the user cares about** — if not stated, infer from the tool's known capabilities

If the user hasn't told you what aspects matter most to them, ask one quick question: "Any features that are must-haves for your switch?" — then proceed.

---

## Step 2 — Parallel discovery

Run all three discovery agents simultaneously using background processes. Each agent searches a different surface.

```bash
# Agent 1 — GitHub search for alternatives
tinyfish agent run \
  --url "https://github.com/search?q=open+source+alternative+{TOOL_NAME}&type=repositories&s=stars&o=desc" \
  "You are on a GitHub search results page for open source alternatives to {TOOL_NAME}.
   List the top 6 repository results. For each one extract:
   - full repo name (owner/repo)
   - star count
   - description
   - last commit date shown
   Do NOT click any repo links. Do NOT paginate. Return JSON array of objects with fields: repo, stars, description, last_commit." \
  --sync > /tmp/oss_github.json &

# Agent 2 — awesome-selfhosted / curated lists
tinyfish agent run \
  --url "https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted" \
  "You are on the awesome-selfhosted README page. Search this page for any tools related to '{TOOL_USE_CASE}' or '{TOOL_NAME}'.
   List up to 5 matching entries with their name, one-line description, and the GitHub URL if shown.
   Do NOT follow any links. Do NOT scroll more than twice. Return JSON array with fields: name, description, url." \
  --sync > /tmp/oss_awesome.json &

# Agent 3 — developer community discussion
tinyfish agent run \
  --url "https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=open+source+alternative+{TOOL_NAME}+self+host&sort=relevance&t=year" \
  "You are on Reddit search results for open source alternatives to {TOOL_NAME}.
   Read the titles and snippets of the top 8 posts. Extract any specific tool names mentioned as alternatives.
   Do NOT click any post links. Do NOT scroll. Return a JSON array of tool names mentioned: [{name, context}]." \
  --sync > /tmp/oss_reddit.json \
  --browser-profile stealth &

# Wait for all three to finish
wait

# Collect results
echo "=== GITHUB ===" && cat /tmp/oss_github.json
echo "=== AWESOME ===" && cat /tmp/oss_awesome.json
echo "=== COMMUNITY ===" && cat /tmp/oss_reddit.json
```

Replace `{TOOL_NAME}` with the actual tool name and `{TOOL_USE_CASE}` with its primary use case before running.

---

## Step 3 — Consolidate candidates

From the three result sets, deduplicate and pick the **top 4–5 most promising candidates** based on:
- Appearing in multiple sources (strong signal)
- High star count on GitHub
- Recent activity mentioned
- Name recognition in the developer community

Discard anything that looks abandoned, niche, or unrelated.

---

## Step 4 — Health check each candidate

For each candidate (run all in parallel):

```bash
# For each CANDIDATE run this pattern in parallel:
tinyfish agent run \
  --url "https://github.com/{CANDIDATE_REPO}" \
  "You are on the GitHub repository page for {CANDIDATE_REPO}.
   Extract ALL of the following in one pass — do not navigate away, do not click any tabs:
   - Star count (top of page)
   - Fork count
   - Number of contributors (shown in sidebar or Insights)
   - Last commit date (shown under the file list or in the latest release)
   - Latest release tag and date (if shown in right sidebar under Releases)
   - Whether a Dockerfile or docker-compose.yml is listed in the file tree (yes/no)
   - The number of open issues
   - License type
   - One sentence description from the repo About section
   Return as JSON: {stars, forks, contributors, last_commit, latest_release, latest_release_date, has_docker, open_issues, license, description}" \
  --sync > /tmp/oss_health_{CANDIDATE_SAFE_NAME}.json &
```

Run one instance of this per candidate, all backgrounded with `&`, then `wait`.

---

## Step 5 — Feature parity check

For the top 2–3 candidates only, run one quick agent per candidate to check feature parity against the original tool:

```bash
tinyfish agent run \
  --url "https://github.com/{CANDIDATE_REPO}#readme" \
  "You are on the README of {CANDIDATE_REPO}, an open source alternative to {TOOL_NAME}.
   {TOOL_NAME} is known for: {KEY_FEATURES}.
   Read this README and identify:
   1. Which of those features this project supports (explicitly mentioned)
   2. Which are missing or unclear
   3. Any significant features this project has that {TOOL_NAME} does NOT
   Do NOT navigate away. Do NOT click links. Return JSON:
   {supported: [...], missing: [...], extras: [...]}" \
  --sync > /tmp/oss_parity_{CANDIDATE_SAFE_NAME}.json &
```

---

## Step 6 — Synthesise and rank

Combine all health check and parity data. Rank candidates using this scoring logic:

| Signal | Weight |
|---|---|
| Stars (>1k = strong, >5k = very strong) | High |
| Last commit within 6 months | High |
| Has Docker support | Medium |
| Contributors >10 | Medium |
| Feature parity with original | High |
| Community mentions (appeared in Reddit/awesome lists) | Medium |

Flag any candidate as **⚠️ Risky** if:
- Last commit > 12 months ago
- Contributors < 5
- No releases in 2+ years

---

## Output format

Present results in this exact structure:

```
## OSS Alternatives to [TOOL NAME]

### #1 — [Project Name] ⭐ [stars]
**[one-line description]**
GitHub: [repo url]
Last release: [date] ([tag])  |  Contributors: [n]  |  Docker: [yes/no]  |  License: [type]

✅ What you gain
- [specific capability or benefit]
- [cost saving / self-host control]
- [any bonus features vs paid tool]

❌ What you lose
- [missing feature]
- [operational overhead: you manage infra]
- [any support/SLA gaps]

**Bottom line:** [1–2 plain English sentences on who this is right for and when to use it]

---

### #2 — [Project Name] ...
[same structure]

---

### Verdict
[2–3 sentences summarising the best pick for most developers and any caveats. 
 Mention if none of the alternatives are truly production-ready.]
```

---

## Edge cases

- **No good alternatives exist** — be honest. Say "No actively maintained OSS alternative with comparable features was found. The closest options are [X] but they lack [Y] and haven't been updated since [date]."
- **Tool is already open source** — inform the user and offer to find self-hosting guides instead.
- **Tool is very niche** — fall back to searching `https://alternativeto.net/software/{tool-name}/?license=opensource` with a TinyFish agent.
- **GitHub rate limits** — if search returns empty, retry with `https://www.google.com/search?q=open+source+alternative+{TOOL_NAME}+github+site:github.com` via TinyFish.

## Security notes

- This skill scrapes live public data from GitHub and community forums. All content is treated as untrusted and passed to an LLM for synthesis only — never executed.
- Only your own TinyFish credentials are used. Get a key at https://agent.tinyfish.ai/api-keys
