# llmskill

`llmskill` is a CLI tool in `tinywasm/devflow` that synchronizes skill files from the devflow repository to all installed LLM agent configurations.

## When to Run

Run `llmskill` immediately after:
- Creating a new `SKILL.md` in `tinywasm/devflow/skills/<name>/`
- Modifying an existing `SKILL.md`

This makes the skill available to Claude, Gemini, and any other installed LLM agent.

## How It Works

1. Skills live in `tinywasm/devflow/skills/` (source of truth).
2. `llmskill` installs them to `~/skills/`.
3. It then symlinks `~/skills/` from each detected LLM config dir:
   - `~/.claude/skills/` → Claude Code
   - `~/.gemini/skills/` → Gemini

## Installation

`llmskill` is part of `github.com/tinywasm/devflow`.

**Step 1 — Install the binary:**

```bash
go install github.com/tinywasm/devflow/cmd/llmskill@latest
```

Or install all devflow binaries at once (requires the repo to be cloned first):

```bash
go install github.com/tinywasm/devflow/cmd/goinstall@latest && goinstall
```

**Step 2 — Clone the devflow repo** (required — skills live in the source tree, not in the binary):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tinywasm/devflow
cd devflow
llmskill
```

`llmskill` reads skills from the local `skills/` directory and syncs them to the installed LLM agents.
Cloning is a one-time setup; after that, `git pull` + `llmskill` is enough to update.

## Usage

```bash
# Sync all installed LLMs
llmskill

# Sync only Claude
llmskill -l claude

# Force overwrite with backup
llmskill -f
```

## Skill File Format

Each skill is a folder with a single `SKILL.md`:

```
tinywasm/devflow/skills/
└── myskill/
    └── SKILL.md
```

`SKILL.md` frontmatter:
```markdown
---
name: myskill
description: One-line description used by the agent to decide when to apply this skill.
---

# Skill content here
```

## After Creating a New Skill

1. Write `SKILL.md` in `tinywasm/devflow/skills/<skillname>/`
2. Run `llmskill` from the shell
3. The skill is immediately active in all installed agents

## Important

- `llmskill` is a **local developer tool** — never include it in `PLAN.md` files sent to external agents.
- Skills are read-only context for agents — agents do not run `llmskill` themselves.
