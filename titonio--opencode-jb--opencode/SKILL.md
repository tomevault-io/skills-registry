# OpenCode

## Overview

OpenCode is an open source AI coding agent that runs in your terminal, IDE, or desktop. It provides a server mode that exposes an OpenAPI specification, allowing developers to build custom clients and integrations.

## Using OpenCode

For general information about OpenCode features, privacy, and ecosystem, see [references/overview.md](references/overview.md).

## Building Client Applications

To build a client application that interacts with OpenCode, you should communicate with the OpenCode HTTP server.

### Quick Start
See `scripts/simple_client.py` for a complete Python example of connecting, creating a session, and sending a message.

### Client Development Guide
For detailed patterns on session management, messaging loops, and event streaming, see [references/client_guide.md](references/client_guide.md).

### Server Connection

The server typically runs on `http://127.0.0.1:4096`.
You can start it with `opencode serve`.

### API Reference

For a complete list of available endpoints, see [references/api.md](references/api.md).

The API covers:
- **Sessions**: Create, manage, and interact with coding sessions.
- **Messages**: Send prompts and receive responses.
- **Files**: Read and search files in the workspace.
- **Projects**: Manage projects.
- **TUI Control**: Control the Terminal UI programmatically.

### Common Workflows

#### 1. Connecting to a Session
To interact with an existing session or create a new one:
- List sessions: `GET /session`
- Create session: `POST /session`

#### 2. Sending a Message
To send a prompt to the agent:
- `POST /session/:id/message` with the prompt content.

#### 3. Reading Files
To read file content:
- `GET /file/content?path=<path>`
