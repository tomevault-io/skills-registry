# Beads - Persistent Task Memory for AI Agents

Graph-based issue tracker that survives conversation compaction. Use `bd <command> --help` for any command. Always use `--json` flag.

**Decision test**: "Will I need this context in 2 weeks?" YES → bd. NO → TodoWrite.

| bd | TodoWrite |
|----|-----------|
| Multi-session work | Single-session tasks |
| Dependencies or blockers | Linear step-by-step |
| Needs to survive compaction | All context in conversation |

**Using both**: TodoWrite tracks what to do now, bd records what was learned and why. At milestones, `bd comments add <id> "..."` to persist outcomes. Transition TodoWrite → bd when you discover blockers, dependencies, or won't finish this session.

**Create issues directly** for clear bugs, obvious follow-up, discovered blockers. **Ask first** for fuzzy scope, multiple valid approaches, or potential duplicates.

Sync is handled automatically by the daemon — never run `bd sync` manually.

## Planning & Decomposition

**Think before creating.** Survey the landscape to avoid overlap and understand context:

```bash
# 1. Check what already exists
bd list --status open --json                         # All open work
bd search "<topic>" --status open --json             # Existing work in this area
bd list --label-any <relevant-labels> --json         # Related by label

# 2. Build an external-ref map to detect overlap
bd list --status open --json | jq -r '.[] | select(.external_ref != null) | "\(.id)\t\(.external_ref)\t\(.title)"'
```

**Before creating a ticket, verify**:
- No open bead already covers this work (`bd search`)
- No existing bead shares the same `--external-ref` (same requirement = same ticket)
- The scope is right — not so broad it should be an epic, not so narrow it should be a comment

**Splitting heuristics**:
- Can it be completed in one session? → single ticket
- Does it have 2+ independent deliverables? → epic with children
- Does step N block step N+1? → separate tickets with `blocks` deps
- Is it a different concern discovered mid-work? → `discovered-from`, not a child

### Decomposing Epics

1. Create the epic with clear acceptance criteria for the *whole* outcome
2. Split into children using `--parent` — they get `parent.X` IDs ordered by sequence
3. Add `blocks` deps between children where order is enforced, not just preferred
4. Set `--external-ref` on each child that traces to a specific requirement or use case
5. Verify: no two children share an external ref (overlap signal), every external ref from the parent's scope is covered (completeness signal)

```bash
# Epic with ordered subtasks (parent.X naming)
bd create "API Migration" -t epic -p 1 --json                    # → bd-c4d2e1
bd create "Audit existing endpoints" --parent bd-c4d2e1 --json   # → bd-c4d2e1.1
bd create "Write adapter layer" --parent bd-c4d2e1 --json        # → bd-c4d2e1.2
bd create "Migrate consumers" --parent bd-c4d2e1 --json          # → bd-c4d2e1.3
bd create "Remove legacy API" --parent bd-c4d2e1 --json          # → bd-c4d2e1.4
```

Nesting works to any depth — children of children get `parent.X.Y`:

```bash
# Decompose a subtask further
bd create "Migrate users service" --parent bd-c4d2e1.3 --json   # → bd-c4d2e1.3.1
bd create "Migrate billing service" --parent bd-c4d2e1.3 --json # → bd-c4d2e1.3.2
```

The ID `bd-c4d2e1.3.2` reads naturally: epic `c4d2e1`, phase 3, sub-part 2.

Benefits:
- **Visual ordering**: `.1`, `.2`, `.3` shows the natural sequence of work
- **Grouping**: all children sort together under their parent
- **Context at a glance**: `bd-c4d2e1.3.2` immediately tells you epic → phase 3 → part 2
- **Arbitrary depth**: decompose as finely as the work demands

Use `bd children <parent-id> --json` to list children, or `bd dep tree <parent-id>` for the full hierarchy.

### Issue Content & Traceability

| Field | Purpose | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Title | Clear, specific, action-oriented | "Fix: auth token expires before refresh" |
| Description (`-d`) | Problem + impact + context | "Token expires mid-session causing data loss for users on slow connections" |
| Design (`--design`) | Implementation approach (HOW) | "Use JWT with 1hr expiry, RS256 for rotation" |
| Acceptance (`--acceptance`) | Success criteria (WHAT) | "Tokens persist across sessions; refresh triggers before expiry" |
| Notes (`--notes`) | Supplementary context, research findings | "See RFC 7519 §4.1 for registered claims" |
| External ref (`--external-ref`) | Traceability to external systems | `gh-42`, `jira-AUTH-123`, `linear-ENG-456` |
| Comments | Progress notes, session handoffs | "Found root cause in validate()" |

**Writing good descriptions**: State the problem, its impact, and enough context to act on it. Bad: "Auth is broken". Good: "Token expires before refresh window, causing 401s for users mid-session. Affects ~12% of requests over 45min."

**Formatting**: Use fenced code blocks for directory trees, file structures, or any indented content in descriptions — plain indentation does not render correctly in most viewers.

**Design vs acceptance**: Design can change; acceptance should stay stable. If you rewrote the solution differently, would the criteria still apply? If not, it's a design note.

**Traceability**: Link every issue to its origin. Use `--external-ref` for requirements, use cases, or tickets from external systems. Use `--deps discovered-from:<id>` for issues found while working on another bead. The goal: any issue can be traced back to *why* it exists.

```bash
# Full example with traceability
bd create "Fix token refresh race condition" \
  -t bug -p 1 \
  -d "Token expires before refresh window, causing 401s mid-session" \
  --acceptance "No 401s during active sessions; refresh triggers 5min before expiry" \
  --design "Add refresh buffer to token lifecycle; use sliding window" \
  --external-ref "gh-87" \
  --deps discovered-from:bd-a3f8e9.2 \
  --json
```

For complex multi-session work, add comments with enough context for a fresh Claude to resume — working code, API response samples, desired output format, research context.

## Find Work

```bash
bd ready --json                                           # Unblocked work
bd blocked --json                                         # What's stuck
bd stale --days 30 --json                                 # Not updated recently
```

## Create Issues

```bash
# Always quote titles and descriptions with double quotes
bd create "Issue title" -t bug|feature|task -p 0-4 -d "Description" --json
bd create "Issue title" -t bug -p 1 -l bug,critical --json    # With labels

# Epics with hierarchical children (parent.X naming)
bd create "Auth System" -t epic -p 1 --json         # Returns: bd-a3f8e9
bd create "Login UI" -p 1 --parent bd-a3f8e9 --json              # → bd-a3f8e9.1
bd create "Session Management" -p 1 --parent bd-a3f8e9 --json    # → bd-a3f8e9.2
bd create "Password Reset" -p 1 --parent bd-a3f8e9 --json        # → bd-a3f8e9.3

# Create and link discovered work (one command)
bd create "Found bug" -t bug -p 1 --deps discovered-from:<parent-id> --json

# Quick capture (outputs only the ID)
bd q "Fix login bug"
```

## Update / Close / Reopen

```bash
bd update <id> [<id>...] --status in_progress --json
bd update <id> [<id>...] --priority 1 --json
bd close <id> [<id>...] --reason "Done" --json
bd reopen <id> [<id>...] --reason "Reopening" --json
```

## View Issues

```bash
bd show <id> [<id>...] --json
bd dep tree <id>
```

## Comments

Comments are the primary way to record progress and context. They survive compaction and are critical for multi-session continuity.

```bash
bd comments add bd-123 "Found root cause: missing null check in validate()"
bd comments add bd-123 -f notes.txt
bd comments bd-123 --json                                 # List comments
```

## Dependencies & Labels

Four dependency types. Only `blocks` affects `bd ready`.

| Type | Purpose | Affects `bd ready`? |
|------|---------|---------------------|
| **blocks** | Hard blocker — B can't start until A completes | Yes |
| **related** | Soft link — informational only | No |
| **parent-child** | Hierarchy — epics and subtasks | No |
| **discovered-from** | Provenance — tracks where work was found | No |

```
Does A prevent B from starting?  → blocks
Is B a subtask of A?            → parent-child
Was B discovered while doing A?  → discovered-from
Otherwise                        → related
```

```bash
# Create + link in one command (preferred)
bd create "Issue title" -t bug -p 1 --deps discovered-from:<parent-id> --json

# Or link separately — direction: bd dep add <dependent> <depends-on>
bd dep add B A --type blocks              # B is blocked by A (A must complete before B)
bd dep add B A --type parent-child        # B is subtask of epic A
bd dep add B A --type discovered-from     # B was discovered while working on A
bd dep add A B --type related             # Informational link (direction doesn't matter)

# Labels (supports multiple IDs)
bd label add <id> [<id>...] <label> --json
bd label remove <id> [<id>...] <label> --json
```

**Don't use blocks for preferences** ("should do X first"). Use `related` or note it in the description. Closing a blocking issue automatically unblocks dependents.

**Traceability through deps**: `discovered-from` creates a provenance chain — trace any bug back to the work that uncovered it. Combine with `--external-ref` for full traceability from external requirement → bead → child beads → discovered work.

## Filtering & Search

```bash
bd list --status open --priority 1 --json
bd list --type bug --json
bd list --label bug,critical --json                       # AND: must have ALL
bd list --label-any frontend,backend --json               # OR: has ANY
bd list --title-contains "auth" --json
bd list --status open --priority 1 --label-any urgent,critical --no-assignee --json

bd search "authentication bug"
bd search "login" --status open --json
bd search "bug" --sort priority
```

## Issue Types & Priorities

Types: `bug`, `feature`, `task`, `epic`, `chore`

Priorities: `0` critical, `1` high, `2` medium, `3` low, `4` backlog

## Workflow Patterns

### Status Transitions

```
open → in_progress → closed
  ↓         ↓
blocked   blocked
```

### Session Workflow

```bash
bd ready --json                                           # Find work
bd update bd-42 --status in_progress --json               # Claim it
bd comments add bd-42 "Found root cause in auth.ts:42"    # Record progress
bd close bd-42 --reason "Fixed auth validation" --json    # Complete
```

### Side Quest Handling

When you discover work during a task, create and link in one command:

```bash
bd create "Found auth bug" -t bug -p 1 --deps discovered-from:bd-100 --json
```

If the discovery blocks current work: `bd update bd-100 --status blocked`, work on the blocker. If deferrable: add a comment with context and continue.

### Compaction Recovery

After compaction, conversation history is lost but bd state survives:

1. `bd list --status in_progress --json` — Find what was active
2. `bd show <id> --json` — Read comments for context
3. Resume work based on the context in comments

### Batch Operations

```bash
bd update bd-41 bd-42 bd-43 --priority 0 --json
bd close bd-41 bd-42 bd-43 --reason "Batch completion" --json
bd label add bd-41 bd-42 bd-43 urgent --json
```
