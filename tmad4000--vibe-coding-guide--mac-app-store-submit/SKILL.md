# Mac App Store Submission Guide

Step-by-step process for submitting a macOS app to the Mac App Store via App Store Connect.

## Automation Level

**~95% automatable** via Chrome DevTools MCP. The entire App Store Connect UI flow (metadata, screenshots, submission) can be handled automatically.

**Only manual step:** Certificate and provisioning profile setup in Xcode (one-time per app/team).

## Prerequisites

Before submitting, ensure you have:
- Apple Developer account ($99/year)
- **[MANUAL]** Distribution certificate created in Xcode (Signing & Capabilities → Team → Manage Certificates)
- **[MANUAL]** Provisioning profile for App Store distribution (auto-created by Xcode when you archive)
- Build archived and uploaded (can be automated - see Build Upload section)

## Required Metadata (Must Complete Before Submission)

### 1. App Privacy (`/distribution/privacy`)

**Two parts:**
1. **Privacy Policy URL** - Required. Can use GitHub README section (e.g., `https://github.com/user/repo#privacy`)
2. **Data Collection Questionnaire** - Click "Get Started", answer questions about data collection
   - For simple local-only apps: Select "No, we do not collect data from this app"
   - Click "Publish" after completing

### 2. Age Ratings (`/distribution/info` → scroll to Age Ratings)

Click "Set Up Age Ratings" and complete 7 steps:
- **Step 1: Features** - Parental Controls, Age Assurance, Web Access, User Content, Messaging, Advertising (select NO for simple apps)
- **Step 2: Mature Themes** - Profanity, Horror, Alcohol/Drugs (select NONE)
- **Step 3: Medical/Wellness** - Medical content, Health topics (select NONE/NO)

Select from dropdown (common choices):
- **Productivity** - Document editors, task managers, utilities
- **Developer Tools** - IDEs, debugging tools
- **Utilities** - System tools, file managers
- **Graphics & Design** - Image editors, design tools

**Note:** The category dropdown may appear empty visually but have a value set. Use JavaScript if needed:
```javascript
document.querySelector('select[name*="primary"]').value = 'PRODUCTIVITY';
document.querySelector('select[name*="primary"]').dispatchEvent(new Event('change', { bubbles: true }));
```

### 4. Pricing (`/distribution/pricing`)

1. Click "Add Pricing"
2. Select Base Country (default: United States USD)
3. Choose Price tier ($0.00 for free apps)
4. Click Next → Next → Confirm

### 5. Content Rights (`/distribution/info`)

Click "Set Up Content Rights Information":
- **For original content apps:** Select "No, it does not contain, show, or access third-party content"
- **For apps with licensed content:** Select "Yes" and confirm you have rights

## Version Page Metadata (`/distribution/macos/version/inflight`)

- **Screenshot** - At least 1 screenshot (1280x800 or 1440x900 for Mac)
- **Promotional Text** - Short marketing text (optional but recommended)
- **Description** - Full app description
- **Keywords** - Comma-separated search terms
- **Support URL** - Link to support page or GitHub issues

## Common Errors & Fixes

| Error | Solution |

| Section | Path |
|---------|------|
| Version Page | `macos/version/inflight` |
| App Information | `info` |
| App Privacy | `privacy` |

| App Review | `reviewsubmissions` |

## Timeline

- **Review time:** Typically 24-48 hours
- **Email notification:** Sent when review complete
- **If rejected:** You'll receive specific feedback to address

## Build Upload (Automatable)

After archiving in Xcode, upload via command line:
```bash
xcrun altool --upload-app -f /path/to/App.pkg -t macos -u "apple-id@example.com" -p "@keychain:AC_PASSWORD"
```

Or use `xcrun notarytool` for newer workflows:
```bash
xcrun notarytool submit App.zip --apple-id "apple-id@example.com" --team-id TEAMID --password "@keychain:AC_PASSWORD" --wait
```

**Note:** Store App Store Connect password in keychain: `xcrun altool --store-password-in-keychain-item AC_PASSWORD -u "apple-id@example.com" -p "app-specific-password"`

## Chrome DevTools MCP Automation

The entire App Store Connect UI can be automated using Chrome DevTools MCP:

1. **Navigate directly** to sections using URL patterns (see App Store Connect URLs table)
2. **Click buttons** using `mcp__chrome-devtools__click` with element refs from snapshots
3. **Fill forms** using `mcp__chrome-devtools__fill` or `mcp__chrome-devtools__form_input`
4. **Upload screenshots** by clicking the upload area and using file input
5. **Handle stubborn dropdowns** with JavaScript execution (see Category dropdown workaround)

**Workflow:**
1. Take snapshot with `mcp__chrome-devtools__take_snapshot`
2. Find element refs for buttons/inputs
3. Click/fill as needed
4. Repeat until submission complete

## Tips

1. **Save frequently** - App Store Connect can lose unsaved changes
2. **Check for yellow warning banners** - They indicate missing required items
3. **Export Compliance** - Usually just needs one checkbox for standard encryption
4. **Test before submitting** - Use TestFlight to verify the build works
5. **Use direct URLs** - Navigate directly to sections rather than clicking through menus
