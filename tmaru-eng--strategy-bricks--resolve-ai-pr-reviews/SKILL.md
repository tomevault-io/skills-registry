# Resolve AI PR Reviews

## Overview

Triage AI PR feedback, fix code, close Gemini threads, and re-request review.

## Workflow

### 1) Gather context

- Identify repo owner/name and PR number.
- Ask for direction when a comment conflicts with current policy or implementation.

### 2) Collect AI comments

- Fetch both review comments and issue comments.
- Filter authors matching `coderabbitai` or `gemini` (case-insensitive).
- Track unresolved items only.

```bash
OWNER=$(gh repo view --json owner --jq .owner.login)
REPO=$(gh repo view --json name --jq .name)
PR=$(gh pr view --json number --jq .number) # or set PR explicitly

gh api repos/$OWNER/$REPO/pulls/$PR/comments --paginate --jq \
  '.[] | select(.user.login | test("coderabbitai|gemini"; "i")) |
   {id, user: .user.login, path, line, body, url: .html_url}'

gh api repos/$OWNER/$REPO/issues/$PR/comments --paginate --jq \
  '.[] | select(.user.login | test("coderabbitai|gemini"; "i")) |
   {id, user: .user.login, body, url: .html_url}'
```

### 3) Summarize and confirm decisions

- Respond in Japanese.
- Provide a concise update with these sections:
  - Current status (AI comments scanned + unresolved count)
  - Unresolved list (file/path + action)
  - Commands executed
  - Decision request (if policy choice is needed)

### 4) Apply fixes and validate

- Implement changes with minimal diffs and follow project conventions.
- Run relevant tests/lint when feasible; state if skipped.

### 5) Resolve Gemini review threads

**Note:** This script handles up to 250 review threads with up to 100 comments each. For PRs with more extensive review activity, manual resolution may be required.

- Do not resolve CodeRabbit threads (it auto-closes).
- Resolve Gemini review threads manually after fixes are complete.
- Before resolving a Gemini thread, add a short reply comment noting what was fixed
  (e.g., "対応しました。: <summary>").
- For Gemini feedback, always leave a reply comment and then resolve the thread.

```bash
THREAD_IDS=$(gh api graphql -f query='
query($owner:String!, $repo:String!, $number:Int!) {
  repository(owner:$owner, name:$repo) {
    pullRequest(number:$number) {
      reviewThreads(first:250) {
        nodes {
          id
          isResolved
          comments(first:100) {
            nodes { author { login } }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}' -F owner=$OWNER -F repo=$REPO -F number=$PR --jq \
  '.data.repository.pullRequest.reviewThreads.nodes[] |
   select(.isResolved == false) |
   select([.comments.nodes[].author.login] | any(test("gemini"; "i"))) |
   .id')

for id in $THREAD_IDS; do
  gh api graphql -f query='
mutation($id:ID!) {
  resolveReviewThread(input: {threadId: $id}) {
    thread { isResolved }
  }
}' -F id=$id
done
```

### 6) Push and request re-review

- Commit and push if appropriate for the repo workflow.
- Post `/gemini review` on the PR after push.
- After posting `/gemini review`, it takes time to process, so run the skill again after the user confirms completion.

```bash
gh pr comment $PR --body "/gemini review"
```

### 7) Report back

- Confirm fixes applied, tests run, Gemini threads resolved, and re-review requested.
- List any remaining unresolved items or decisions.
