# Mist Network & WLAN Configuration

Inspect DHCP, RF templates, WLAN features, authentication server settings, bonjour gateway, and track configuration changes across the Mist network.

## Workflow

### Step 0 — Resolve org_id and sites

1. `get_mist_self` → `org_id`.
2. If user names a site, resolve it by name: `search_mist_data(scope='org', search_type='sites', org_id=..., filters={name:'<site_name>'})` → `site_id`. Only fetch the full site list (`get_mist_config(resource_type='sites', scope='org', org_id=..., limit=200)`) when you need a complete site map (e.g., org-wide queries).

### Step 1 — Route by question type

| User intent | Go to |
|---|---|
| DHCP servers on a network/site | Step 2 |
| DHCP bindings | Step 3 |
| RF configuration at a site | Step 4 |
| WLANs with specific feature (802.11r, etc) | Step 5 |
| Auth server timeout settings | Step 6 |
| Bonjour gateway config | Step 7 |
| Recent config changes at a site | Step 8 |
| WLANs changed/added/removed recently | Step 9 |
| Config diff (today vs last week) | Step 10 |

### Step 2 — DHCP servers

DHCP config can live in multiple places:

1. **Networks:** `get_mist_config(resource_type='networks', scope='org', org_id=..., limit=100)`. Paginate. Look for `dhcp` field with server settings, `dhcpd_config`, or `gateway` fields.
2. **Device configs (switches/gateways):** `get_mist_config(resource_type='devices', scope='site', site_id=...)`. Look for `dhcp_config`, `dhcpd_config`, or `ip_config` fields referencing DHCP relay.
3. **WLANs:** Some WLANs may have DHCP relay settings.
4. Aggregate all DHCP sources. Present: source (network/device/WLAN) | DHCP server IPs | network/VLAN.

### Step 3 — DHCP bindings

The Mist API does not expose live DHCP binding tables directly. Workaround:

1. Search for DHCP-related events: `search_mist_data(scope='site', search_type='device_events', site_id=..., duration='1d')`. Filter `text` containing "DHCP" if possible.
2. Alternatively, check client data — `search_mist_data(search_type='wireless_clients')` shows `ip` and `vlan` which reflect DHCP assignments.
3. Report the limitation: "Live DHCP bindings are not directly available via the API. Showing DHCP-assigned client IPs instead."

### Step 4 — RF configuration

1. Get the site config to find the assigned RF template: `get_mist_config(resource_type='sites', scope='org', org_id=..., resource_id='<site_id>')`. Look for `rftemplate_id`.
2. Fetch the full RF template: `get_mist_config(resource_type='rftemplates', scope='org', org_id=..., resource_id='<rftemplate_id>')`.
3. Extract band settings: `band_24` (power, channels, bandwidth), `band_5` (power, channels, bandwidth, DFS), `band_6` (power, channels, bandwidth).
4. Also check for site-level RF overrides in the site config.
5. Present: band | power range | channels | bandwidth | DFS | other settings.

Note: listing RF templates returns minimal fields. You must fetch with `resource_id` for full details.

### Step 5 — WLANs with specific features

1. Get all WLANs:
   - Org-level: `get_mist_config(resource_type='wlans', scope='org', org_id=..., limit=100)`. Paginate.
   - Site-level: only query if user specified a site or if org-level returned no matches. Iterate specific sites, not all sites in large orgs.
2. Filter by the requested feature:
   - **802.11r:** `roam_mode == "11r"` or `fast_dot1x_roaming == true` (these are independent — `roam_mode` sets the roaming protocol, `fast_dot1x_roaming` enables OKC; either indicates fast roaming is configured)
   - **Bands:** check `bands` array (e.g., ["24","5","6"])
   - **Auth type:** check `auth.type` ("psk", "eap", "open")
   - **Multi-PSK:** `auth.multi_psk_only == true`
   - **MAC auth:** `auth.enable_mac_auth == true`
   - **Tunnel to MxEdge:** `mxtunnel_id` or `mxtunnel_ids` is set
3. Present: SSID | feature value | bands | auth type | enabled | scope (org/site).

### Step 6 — Auth server timeout settings

1. Get WLANs (org + site level as in Step 5).
2. For each WLAN with `auth.type == "eap"`, look for `auth_servers` and `acct_servers` arrays.
3. Each server entry contains: `host`, `port`, `secret` (masked), `timeout`, `retries`.
4. Also check `radsec` settings if present.
5. Present: SSID | server host | port | timeout | retries.

### Step 7 — Bonjour gateway

Bonjour gateway config can be at multiple levels:

1. **WLAN level:** check `bonjour` field in WLAN configs.
2. **Site level:** `get_mist_config(resource_type='sites', scope='org', resource_id='<site_id>')` — look for `bonjour` or `mdns` settings.
3. **Network level:** check network configs for mDNS/bonjour relay settings.
4. **Device level:** check switch/gateway configs for bonjour proxy settings.
5. Report what's configured and at which level.

### Step 8 — Recent config changes

1. Search device events at the site: `search_mist_data(scope='site', search_type='device_events', site_id=..., duration='24h', limit=100)`. Paginate.
2. Filter for config change events: types containing "CONFIG_CHANGED" — specifically `AP_CONFIG_CHANGED`, `SW_CONFIG_CHANGED`, `GW_CONFIG_CHANGED`.
3. Extract: timestamp, device name (from MAC), device_type, text (change description).
4. Present chronologically: time | device | type | description.

### Step 9 — WLAN changes in time range

1. Get all WLANs (org + site level).
2. Filter by `modified_time`: compare against the requested time range. For "last 24h": `current_epoch - 86400`.
3. WLANs with `modified_time` in range were recently changed.
4. For removals: search device events for WLAN-related changes, or note that deletions aren't directly trackable.
5. Present: SSID | last modified | scope | change type (modified/new).

### Step 10 — Config diff

**Limitation:** The Mist API does not store historical config snapshots. A true config diff is not possible.

Workaround:
1. Get current config for the site/devices.
2. Search device events for config changes over both time ranges (today and last week).
3. List all config change events to show what was modified.
4. Be transparent: "Historical config snapshots are not available via the API. Showing config change events instead."

## Output

Use canvas for WLAN feature matrices or RF config visualizations when comparing multiple items. Markdown tables for focused lookups.

## Error handling

| Situation | Action |
|---|---|
| RF template ID not found on site | Site may use default RF settings — report "No RF template assigned" |
| No auth_servers on WLAN | WLAN may use PSK auth — no RADIUS servers to show |
| DHCP bindings unavailable | Report limitation, show client IP assignments instead |
| Config diff not possible | Show change event log as substitute |
| WLAN scope ambiguous | Check both org-level and site-level WLANs |
