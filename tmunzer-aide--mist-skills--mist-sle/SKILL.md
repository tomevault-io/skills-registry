# Mist SLE Analyser

Unified SLE workflow for wireless, wired, and WAN: org-level site ranking, site drill-down, classifier breakdown, and impacted entity analysis.

## SLE Domains

| Domain | sle param | Metric prefix | Entity queries |
|---|---|---|---|
| Wireless | `wifi` | coverage, capacity, time-to-connect, roaming, throughput, ap-health, ap-availability, successful-connect, failed-to-connect | impacted_aps, impacted_wireless_clients |
| Wired | `wired` | switch-health-v2, switch-throughput, switch-bandwidth-v2, switch-stc-v4 | impacted_switches, impacted_wired_clients |
| WAN | `wan` | gateway-health, wan-link-health-v2, application-health, gateway-bandwidth | impacted_gateways, impacted_interfaces |

See [references/metrics.md](references/metrics.md) for full metric details, classifiers, and interpretation guides.

## Score thresholds

| Score | Status |
|---|---|
| >= 95% | Excellent (green) |
| 80–94% | Warning (yellow) |
| < 80% | Poor — action required (red) |
| 0 / No data | No devices or SLE unlicensed |

## Workflow

### Step 0 — Resolve org_id and sites

1. `get_mist_self` → `org_id`.
2. If user names a site, resolve it by name: `search_mist_data(scope='org', search_type='sites', org_id=..., filters={name:'<site_name>'})` → `site_id`. For the org-level SLE overview (Step 2), you'll need the full site list for the name map: `get_mist_config(resource_type='sites', scope='org', org_id=..., limit=200)`. Paginate if `has_more`.

### Step 1 — Determine the SLE domain

From the user's question, identify the domain:
- Wireless: mentions coverage, capacity, roaming, throughput, AP health, Wi-Fi SLE, wireless assurance
- Wired: mentions switch health, switch SLE, wired assurance, switch throughput
- WAN: mentions gateway health, WAN link, application health, WAN SLE, SD-WAN

Set `sle_domain` to `"wifi"`, `"wired"`, or `"wan"`.

### Step 2 — Org-level SLE overview

```
get_mist_insights(
  insight_type="sle",
  org_id=...,
  params={"query_type": "sites_sle", "sle": "<sle_domain>"}
)
```

Returns an array of site objects. Sites with no data return only `{"site_id": "..."}` — skip these.

Sites with data contain metric scores as decimal values (0.83 = 83%), plus `num_aps` / `num_switches` / `num_gateways` and `num_clients`.

Build a ranked scorecard sorted by lowest composite SLE. Composite = arithmetic mean of all numeric metric scores present for that site (e.g., if a site has coverage=0.83, capacity=0.75, throughput=0.99, composite = (0.83+0.75+0.99)/3 = 85.7%). Use site name map for display.

### Step 3 — Select site(s) to drill into

- If user named a site → resolve its site_id.
- If not specified → drill into the worst-ranked site automatically.
- If multiple sites are red (< 80%) → drill into all of them.

### Step 4 — Get enabled metrics for the site

```
get_mist_insights(
  insight_type="sle",
  site_id=...,
  params={"query_type": "metrics", "scope": "site", "scope_id": "<site_id>"}
)
```

Returns `{"enabled": [...], "supported": [...]}`. Only proceed with metrics in `enabled` that belong to the current domain. Prefer versioned metrics (e.g., `switch-health-v2` over `switch-health`, `wan-link-health-v2` over `wan-link-health`).

### Step 5 — Per-metric summary and classifiers

For each enabled metric (skip if score >= 95% unless user asked for full breakdown):

```
get_mist_insights(
  insight_type="sle",
  site_id=...,
  duration="1d",
  params={
    "query_type": "summary",
    "scope": "site",
    "scope_id": "<site_id>",
    "metric": "<metric_name>"
  }
)
```

Extract:
- `data.impact.num_users` / `total_users` → % users/clients impacted
- `data.impact.num_aps` / `total_aps` → % entities impacted (APs, switches, or gateways depending on domain — the field name is always `num_aps`/`total_aps` regardless of domain)
- `data.classifiers[]` → each with `name`, `impact.num_users`, `impact.num_aps`

Compute classifier contribution: `classifier.impact.num_users / metric.impact.total_users * 100`.

### Step 6 — Impacted entities (for metrics < 90%)

The query_type depends on the domain:

| Domain | Entity query | Client query |
|---|---|---|
| Wireless | `impacted_aps` | `impacted_wireless_clients` |
| Wired | `impacted_switches` | `impacted_wired_clients` |
| WAN | `impacted_gateways` | `impacted_interfaces` |

```
get_mist_insights(
  insight_type="sle",
  site_id=...,
  duration="1d",
  params={
    "query_type": "<entity_query>",
    "scope": "site",
    "scope_id": "<site_id>",
    "metric": "<metric_name>"
  }
)
```

Returns array: `{mac|name, degraded, total}` per entity.
Compute per-entity SLE%: `(1 - degraded/total) * 100`. Rank worst-first, show top 5.

For "list APs/switches with SLE below X%": paginate fully and filter entities where computed SLE% < threshold.

### Step 7 — Org-wide entity ranking (optional)

If user asks "list all APs in the org with coverage SLE < 40%":
1. Get the org scorecard (Step 2) to find all sites with data.
2. For each site, run Step 6 with `impacted_aps` and the requested metric.
3. Aggregate all entities across sites. Filter by threshold.
4. Present with site name for context.

## WAN-specific notes

- `wan-link-health-v2 = 0` often means "no WAN paths monitored" — not an outage. Cross-check with v1 and `gateway-health`.
- `gateway-health = 0` usually means the gateway is offline.
- Use `impacted_interfaces` for per-interface breakdown on WAN link metrics.

## Output

Use canvas (`web-artifacts-builder`) for multi-metric dashboards with score rings, classifier bars, and entity tables. The dashboard should use CSS variables for theming (see `web-artifacts-builder` skill). Use markdown for simple single-metric answers.

After any visual dashboard, write a brief prose summary (2-4 sentences) covering only the critical issues and recommended actions. Don't repeat what the dashboard shows.

## Error handling

| Situation | Action |
|---|---|
| Site has no SLE data | Skip, note "No [domain] SLE data — no devices or unlicensed" |
| Metric not in enabled list | Skip — not enabled for this site |
| summary returns 400 | Try `duration="7d"` — short windows sometimes have no data |
| impacted_* returns empty | Note "No entity-level breakdown available" |
| Site name not found | Use `search_mist_data(search_type='sites', filters={name: '...'})` |
