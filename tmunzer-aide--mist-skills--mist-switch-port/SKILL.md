# Mist Switch & Port Operations

Inspect switch ports, compare configs, map stacks to connected APs, find port speeds, profiles, PoE usage, and DNS settings across Mist-managed switches.

## Workflow

### Step 0 — Resolve org_id and sites

1. `get_mist_self` → `org_id`.
2. If user names a site, resolve it by name: `search_mist_data(scope='org', search_type='sites', org_id=..., filters={name:'<site_name>'})` → `site_id`. Only fetch the full site list (`get_mist_config(resource_type='sites', scope='org', org_id=..., limit=200)`) when you need a complete site map (e.g., org-wide queries).
3. If a specific switch is named, resolve it: `find_mist_entity(org_id=..., query='<switch_name>', entity_types=['device'])`.

### Step 1 — Route by question type

| User intent | Go to |
|---|---|
| Switchport config comparison (working vs non-working AP) | Step 2 |
| Switch stacks with connected APs | Step 3 |
| Active / inactive ports at a site | Step 4 |
| Ports at 100Mb / APs at 100Mbps | Step 5 |
| PoE power draw | Step 5b |
| Switch overrides | Step 6 |
| DNS servers on switches | Step 7 |
| MAC auth enabled ports | Step 8 |
| Port profiles at a site | Step 9 |
| Devices connected to a specific switch | Step 10 |

### Step 2 — Switchport config comparison

Goal: compare the port config for the ports where a working AP and a non-working AP are connected.

1. Resolve both APs by name/MAC: `find_mist_entity(org_id=..., query='<ap_name>')`.
2. Find which switch ports they connect to: `get_mist_stats(stats_type='site_ports', site_id=..., limit=100)`. Paginate. Look for ports where `neighbor_system_name` matches the AP hostname.
3. Note the switch MAC (`mac` field) and `port_id` for each AP.
4. Get the switch device config: `get_mist_config(resource_type='devices', scope='site', site_id=..., resource_id='<switch_device_id>')`.
5. Compare the `port_config` entries for the two port_ids. Highlight any differences (VLAN, PoE, profile, speed settings).

### Step 3 — Switch stacks with connected APs

1. Get port stats: `get_mist_stats(stats_type='site_ports', site_id=..., limit=100)`. Paginate fully.
2. **Detect virtual chassis**: ports with `vcp-` prefix (e.g., `vcp-0/1/3`, `vcp-1/1/3`) are virtual chassis inter-member links. Multiple `vcp-` ports sharing the same `mac` = a stack. The FPC number in `ge-X/0/Y` identifies the stack member.
3. Filter user-facing ports only (exclude internal ports — see Port field reference below).
4. Identify AP connections: ports where `neighbor_system_name` is set and matches AP hostnames. Cross-reference with `get_mist_stats(stats_type='site_devices', site_id=...)` to classify neighbors as APs.
5. Present: stack name | member switches (by FPC number) | connected APs (with port, speed, PoE status) | disconnected APs (with last_seen from device stats).

### Step 4 — Active / inactive ports

1. Get port stats: `get_mist_stats(stats_type='site_ports', site_id=..., limit=100)`. Paginate fully.
2. For a specific switch, filter by `mac` (switch MAC). For all switches at site, include all.
3. Filter out internal ports (see Port field reference below).
4. **Active ports:** `up=true` (link up). **Inactive:** `up=false`.
5. The `active` field indicates recent traffic — `up=true` but `active=false` means link is up but no traffic.
6. Present: switch name | port_id | up | active | speed | duplex | neighbor | poe_on | power_draw.

### Step 5 — Ports at 100Mb / APs at 100Mbps

1. Get port stats. If no site specified, use org-level: `get_mist_stats(stats_type='org_ports', org_id=..., limit=100)`. For a specific site: `get_mist_stats(stats_type='site_ports', site_id=..., limit=100)`. Paginate fully.
2. Filter where `speed=100` and `up=true`. Exclude internal ports.
3. Build AP hostname list: `get_mist_stats(stats_type='org_devices', org_id=..., filters={type:'ap'})`. Collect all AP hostnames.
4. Cross-reference each port's `neighbor_system_name` against the AP hostname list. Mark as "AP" if matched, "other" otherwise.
5. Present: switch | port_id | speed | neighbor device | type (AP/other).

### Step 5b — PoE power draw

1. Get port stats (site or org level). Paginate fully.
2. Filter ports where `poe_on=true`. These ports have a `power_draw` field (in watts).
3. Summarize: total PoE draw per switch, per-port breakdown.
4. Present: switch | port_id | neighbor | speed | power_draw (W).

### Step 6 — Switch overrides

Overrides are device-level configurations that differ from the assigned template/profile.

1. Get switch configs: `get_mist_config(resource_type='devices', scope='site', site_id=...)`. Filter `type='switch'`.
2. For each switch, look for fields that override the template: `port_config`, `ip_config`, `dns_servers`, `additional_config_cmds`, `networks`, `port_mirroring`, `ntp_servers`, `mist_nac`, etc.
3. Any non-empty field on the device config that would normally come from the device profile is an override.
4. Present: switch name | overridden fields | values.

### Step 7 — DNS servers on switches

1. Get all switch configs: `get_mist_config(resource_type='devices', scope='site', site_id=...)` or org-wide.
2. Extract `dns_servers` field from each switch config. Also check `ip_config.dns` and `oob_ip_config.dns`.
3. Group switches by DNS server set.
4. Present: DNS servers | switches using them.

### Step 8 — MAC auth enabled ports

1. Get switch configs at site: `get_mist_config(resource_type='devices', scope='site', site_id=...)`.
2. For each switch, inspect `port_config`. Look for ports where `port_auth.type` is `"dot1x"` or `"mac_auth"`, or `port_auth.enable_mac_auth` is true.
3. Present: switch | port_id | auth type | profile/usage.

### Step 9 — Port profiles at site

1. Get switch configs at site. Inspect `port_config` for each switch.
2. Each port entry has a `usage` field (e.g., "ap", "default", "uplink", custom names).
3. Also check `get_mist_config(resource_type='deviceprofiles', scope='org', org_id=...)` for org-level port profile definitions.
4. Present: profile name/usage | port count | description/settings.

### Step 10 — Devices connected to a switch

1. Resolve the switch: `find_mist_entity(org_id=..., query='<switch_name>')`.
2. Get its port stats: `get_mist_stats(stats_type='site_ports', site_id=..., filters={mac:'<switch_mac>'}, limit=100)`. Paginate.
3. Filter out internal ports. Extract `neighbor_system_name` and `neighbor_port_desc` from each port.
4. Cross-reference with device inventory to classify neighbors (AP, switch, gateway, unknown).
5. Present: port_id | neighbor name | neighbor type | speed | poe_on | power_draw | rx_bps/tx_bps.

## Port field reference

Fields returned by `site_ports` / `org_ports` stats:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `mac` | Switch MAC address |
| `port_id` | Port name (e.g., `ge-0/0/1`, `mge-0/0/0`, `xe-0/2/0`) |
| `up` | Link state: true = up, false = down |
| `active` | Recent traffic detected (up + no traffic = `active=false`) |
| `speed` | Link speed in Mbps: 100, 1000, 2500, 5000, 10000 |
| `full_duplex` | true/false |
| `poe_on` | PoE enabled on this port |
| `power_draw` | PoE power draw in watts (only present when `poe_on=true`) |
| `neighbor_system_name` | LLDP neighbor hostname (only present if LLDP neighbor detected) |
| `neighbor_port_desc` | LLDP neighbor port description |
| `rx_bps` / `tx_bps` | Current throughput in bits per second |
| `rx_bytes` / `tx_bytes` | Total bytes transferred |

**Port type prefixes:**

| Prefix | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `ge-` | Gigabit Ethernet (1G copper) |
| `mge-` | Multi-Gig Ethernet (2.5G/5G/10G copper) |
| `xe-` | 10 Gigabit Ethernet (SFP+) |
| `et-` | 25G/40G/100G Ethernet |
| `vcp-` | Virtual Chassis Port (inter-member link) |

**Internal ports to exclude from user-facing queries:** `bme0`, `cbp0`, `irb`, `jsrv`, `pip0`, `vme`, `me0`, `inband-management`. These are system/management interfaces — filter them out unless specifically asked.

## Pagination

Port stats can be large (646+ ports in an org). Always paginate `has_more` → `next_cursor`.

## Output

Use canvas for port grid visualizations or stack topology diagrams when data is substantial. Markdown tables for focused queries.

## Error handling

| Situation | Action |
|---|---|
| Switch not found | Try `search_mist_data(search_type='devices', filters={hostname:'...'})` |
| No port stats | Switch may be disconnected — check device status first |
| Port has no neighbor info | LLDP not enabled or no device connected on that port |
| Virtual chassis not detected | Look for `vcp-` ports in port stats (definitive signal) |
