# Web Search

This repository exposes web search as a built-in **integration** in the Excel add-in.

## Mapping

- Agent Skill name: `web-search`
- Excel integration ID: `web_search`
- Tools: `web_search`, `fetch_page`

## Providers

| Provider | API key | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Jina** (default) | Optional (for higher limits) | Works out of the box — no signup needed |
| Serper.dev | Required | Google SERP API, free tier available |
| Tavily | Required | AI-native search, free monthly credits |
| Brave Search | Required | Direct Brave Search API |

If a keyed provider fails (auth/rate-limit/server error), search automatically retries with Jina and surfaces a warning.

## Usage notes

- Prefer workbook data first.
- Use web search only when external facts are required.
- Cite sources from tool results (`[1]`, `[2]`, ...).

## Excel-specific setup

1. Open `/tools` (or `/extensions` → Connections tab).
2. Enable external tools.
3. Enable **Web Search** for session and/or workbook scope.
4. (Optional) Choose a different provider and set its API key — Jina works by default with no configuration.
