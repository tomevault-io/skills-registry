# Family Menu Generator

This skill creates beautiful, research-backed weekly dinner menus designed for families, with a focus on high-protein meals, seasonal ingredients, and practical leftover planning.

## Key Features

- **Protein-focused meals**: Every meal emphasizes protein sources
- **Leftover detection**: Automatically identifies opportunities to use leftovers
- **Local restaurant suggestions**: Searches for restaurants within 25 miles of user's location
- **Homemade Pizza Fridays**: Periodically includes fun pizza nights
- **Seasonal ingredients**: Researches and incorporates seasonal produce
- **Random beautiful designs**: 5 different design styles (fun & colorful, clean & modern, rustic, elegant, bold & playful)
- **Print-ready PDFs**: Optimized for 8.5x11 paper to post on refrigerator

## Workflow

### 1. Gather Information

When a user requests a menu, first determine what ingredients or preferences they have:

**Ask the user:**
- "Do you have any ingredients on hand that you'd like me to incorporate into this week's menu?"
- "Any dietary restrictions or preferences I should know about?"
- "Any meals you're craving this week?"

**If the user doesn't provide specific ingredients:** Assume all ingredients will be purchased from the grocery store and proceed with planning.

### 2. Research Phase

Use web search to gather information:

**Seasonal Ingredients:**
- Search for current seasonal produce and proteins (consider the current month)
- Example: "seasonal vegetables October" or "fall produce in season"

**Recipe Ideas:**
- Search for high-protein recipes incorporating seasonal ingredients
- Example: "high protein chicken recipes with butternut squash"
- Look for recipes with prep times and protein content

**Restaurant Options:**
- Search for restaurants near the user's zip code (20136 for this user)
- Use local search: "restaurants near 20136" or "best dinner restaurants Centreville VA"
- Select one interesting option within 25 miles for restaurant night

**Leftover Assessment:**
- When planning, identify meals that will likely produce leftovers based on:
  - Large batch recipes (roasts, casseroles, soups)
  - Recipes that serve 4-6+ people
  - Meals that reheat well
- Schedule a "leftovers" meal 1-2 days after these large meals

### 3. Menu Planning

Create a 7-day dinner menu following these guidelines:

**Monday-Thursday:**
- Focus on variety of proteins (chicken, beef, fish, pork, turkey)
- Include prep times
- Note the primary protein source
- Consider cooking methods variety

**Friday:**
- Every 2-3 weeks: "Homemade Pizza Friday 🍕"
- Other Fridays: Regular protein-focused meals

**Saturday:**
- Restaurant night approximately once per week
- Include the restaurant name and a brief note
- Example: "Restaurant Night - Try the new Thai place on Main Street"

**Sunday:**
- Often a good day for slow-cooker meals or batch cooking
- Meals that can provide leftovers for the week ahead

**Leftover Days:**
- Explicitly mark 1-2 days as using leftovers from specific previous meals
- Example: "Monday Leftovers - Use remaining pot roast and vegetables"

### 4. Generate the PDF

Use the `scripts/generate_menu.py` script to create the PDF:

```python
from scripts.generate_menu import create_menu_pdf
import datetime

menu_data = {
    'title': 'Family Dinner Menu',
    'subtitle': f'Week of {datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%B %d, %Y")}',
    'meals': [
        {
            'day': 'Monday',
            'name': 'Grilled Salmon with Roasted Brussels Sprouts',
            'protein': 'Salmon fillet (6oz)',
            'prep_time': '30 min',
            'notes': 'Seasonal fall vegetables'
        },
        {
            'day': 'Tuesday',
            'name': 'Monday Leftovers',
            'notes': 'Use remaining salmon and veggies'
        },
        # ... continue for all 7 days
    ]
}

# The function will randomly select a design style
design_used = create_menu_pdf(menu_data, output_path)
```

**Menu Data Structure:**
- `title`: Menu title (usually "Family Dinner Menu" or similar)
- `subtitle`: Date range for the week
- `meals`: List of meal objects with:
  - `day`: Day of the week (required)
  - `name`: Meal name (required)
  - `protein`: Primary protein source (optional but recommended)
  - `prep_time`: Estimated cooking time (optional)
  - `notes`: Special notes like "leftover", "seasonal", "restaurant info" (optional)

### 5. Present to User

After generating the menu:

1. Show the user a text summary of the week's meals
2. Provide the PDF link for download
3. Mention which design style was randomly selected
4. Offer to regenerate if they want a different design style

## Tips for Great Menus

- **Balance cooking complexity**: Mix quick meals with more involved ones
- **Protein variety**: Try to avoid repeating the same protein more than twice
- **Leftover strategic placement**: Place leftover days 1-2 days after big meals
- **Seasonal excitement**: Highlight when you're using seasonal ingredients
- **Restaurant selection**: Choose restaurants with good reviews and variety
- **Pizza frequency**: Aim for 1-2 pizza nights per month
- **Batch cooking**: Sunday is often ideal for slow cooker or big batch meals

## Available Design Styles

The script randomly selects from these designs:
1. **Fun and Colorful**: Bright, playful colors perfect for families with kids
2. **Clean and Modern**: Minimalist with bold typography
3. **Rustic**: Warm earth tones with serif fonts
4. **Elegant**: Sophisticated with gold accents
5. **Bold and Playful**: Vibrant colors with fun fonts

All designs are optimized for 8.5x11 inch paper and include the meal details in an easy-to-read format.
