# App Listing Skill

Generate complete, high-quality Shopify App Store listing content that follows [Shopify's official best practices](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/launch/shopify-app-store/best-practices#5-app-listing).

## Workflow

### 1. Understand the App

Before writing any listing content, gather deep understanding of the app:

- Read README.md, package.json, CHANGELOG.md
- Explore core source files to understand features and functionality
- Identify the target audience (merchants, developers, agencies)
- Note key differentiators vs competitors

### 2. Generate All Listing Sections

Produce content for each section below. Provide **2-3 options** for short-form sections (Introduction, Subtitle) so the user can choose.

See [references/shopify-listing-guide.md](references/shopify-listing-guide.md) for detailed character limits, formatting rules, DOs/DON'Ts, and examples for each section.

#### Sections to generate:

| # | Section | Limit |
|---|---------|-------|
| 1 | App Introduction | 100 chars |
| 2 | App Details | 500 chars |
| 3 | Features | 80 chars each, up to 8 |
| 4 | App Card Subtitle | ~80 chars |
| 5 | App Store Search Terms | 5 terms, one idea per term |
| 6 | Web Search Content (SEO) | Title <60 chars, Meta <155 chars |
| 7 | Testing Instructions | Step-by-step, bullet points |

### 3. Quality Checklist

Before delivering, verify:

- [ ] All character limits respected (use [count-characters.sh](count-characters.sh))
- [ ] Review [Prohibited Words & Phrases](references/shopify-listing-guide.md#prohibited-words--phrases-) - NO outcome guarantees, superlatives, or unverifiable claims
- [ ] No keyword stuffing
- [ ] Benefits-focused language (not feature-focused)
- [ ] Testing instructions are clear, step-by-step, and include prerequisites
- [ ] SEO title follows Google's title tag best practices
- [ ] Search terms use complete words, one idea per term

### 3.1. Character Counting

Use the provided script to verify character counts:

```bash
# Count characters for a specific section
./count-characters.sh introduction "Your app introduction text"
./count-characters.sh details "Your app details description"
./count-characters.sh feature "Real-time sales analytics"
./count-characters.sh subtitle "Better order management tools"
./count-characters.sh seo_title "My App - Order Management"
./count-characters.sh seo_meta "Description for search results"

# Show help for all options
./count-characters.sh --help
```

### 4. Output Format

Present the final listing as a structured markdown document with clear section headers, character counts, and multiple options where applicable. Use blockquotes for the actual copy.
