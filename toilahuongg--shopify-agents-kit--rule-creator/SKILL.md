# Rule Creator

Create effective user rules that customize AI behavior for projects and personal preferences.

## What Are User Rules?

User rules are custom instructions that modify how the AI assistant behaves. They can define:

- **Coding standards** - Style, patterns, and conventions
- **Language preferences** - Response language, terminology
- **Project configuration** - Framework choices, file structure
- **Workflow guidelines** - Git, testing, documentation practices

## Rule Creation Workflow

### Step 1: Identify Rule Purpose

Ask the user:
1. What behavior do you want to modify?
2. Is this a project rule (shared) or personal preference?
3. Are there exceptions to this rule?

### Step 2: Choose Rule Category

Common categories:
- `coding-style` - Code formatting, syntax preferences
- `language` - Response language, communication style
- `project` - Framework-specific, architecture decisions
- `git` - Commit messages, branching, PR guidelines
- `naming` - Variable, function, file naming conventions
- `security` - Authentication, secrets, input validation
- `testing` - Test coverage, naming, mocking practices
- `documentation` - Comments, README, JSDoc requirements

For templates and examples, see [references/rule-patterns.md](references/rule-patterns.md).

### Step 3: Write the Rule

Follow these principles:

1. **Be specific** - Use concrete examples
2. **Be actionable** - Clear instructions, not vague guidance
3. **Include examples** - Show correct usage
4. **Define exceptions** - When the rule doesn't apply

For detailed writing guidelines, see [references/best-practices.md](references/best-practices.md).

### Step 4: Format the Rule

Use this format:

```
## [Category]: [Short Title]

[Clear instruction in imperative form]

Example:
[Code or text example showing correct usage]

Exception: [When this rule doesn't apply, if any]
```

### Step 5: Validate the Rule

Check against this list:
- [ ] Clear and unambiguous?
- [ ] Specific context defined?
- [ ] Actionable instruction?
- [ ] Example included (if complex)?
- [ ] Exceptions documented?
- [ ] No conflicts with existing rules?

## Quick Templates

### Coding Style Rule

```
## Coding: [Title]

[What to do and how to do it]

✅ Correct:
[good example]

❌ Avoid:
[bad example]
```

### Project Configuration Rule

```
## Project: [Title]

Use [technology/pattern] for [purpose].

Configuration:
[relevant settings or file structure]
```

### Workflow Rule

```
## Workflow: [Title]

[Step-by-step process or checklist]

1. [First step]
2. [Second step]
3. [Third step]
```

## Managing Rules

### Adding Rules

Create or append to the user's rules file. Group related rules under clear headers.

### Updating Rules

When updating, preserve existing rules unless explicitly asked to replace them.

### Organizing Rules

Suggest organizing rules by:
1. Priority (security > performance > style)
2. Category (coding, git, testing, etc.)
3. Scope (project-wide vs file-specific)

## Output Location

Rules must be saved in the `.agent/rules/` directory with one file per rule category:

```
.agent/rules/
├── git-commit.md          # Git commit format rules
├── coding-style.md        # Coding style rules
├── naming-conventions.md  # Naming rules
├── security.md            # Security rules
└── testing.md             # Testing rules
```

### File Naming

- Use kebab-case: `{rule-name}.md`
- Name should reflect the rule category or purpose
- Examples: `git-commit.md`, `coding-style.md`, `api-design.md`

### File Structure

Each rule file should include YAML frontmatter with activation mode, followed by the rule content:

```markdown
---
activation: always_on  # or: manual, model_decision, glob
description: Brief description for model decision mode
globs: ["*.ts", "src/**/*.tsx"]  # only for glob activation
---

# [Rule Category Title]

Brief description of what this rule covers.

## Rule 1: [Title]

[Rule content with examples]

## Rule 2: [Title]

[Rule content with examples]
```

### Activation Modes

Rules can be activated in different ways:

| Mode | Frontmatter | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Manual** | `activation: manual` | Activated via @mention in input (e.g., `@git-commit`) |
| **Always On** | `activation: always_on` | Always applied to all conversations |
| **Model Decision** | `activation: model_decision` | Model decides based on `description` field |
| **Glob** | `activation: glob` | Applied to files matching `globs` patterns |

#### Examples

**Always On** (recommended for general rules):
```yaml
---
activation: always_on
---
```

**Manual** (for specific workflows):
```yaml
---
activation: manual
---
```

**Model Decision** (context-dependent):
```yaml
---
activation: model_decision
description: Apply when working with git commits or version control
---
```

**Glob** (file-type specific):
```yaml
---
activation: glob
globs: ["*.ts", "*.tsx", "src/**/*.js"]
---
```

### @Mentions (File References)

Reference other files in rules using `@filename`:

| Path Type | Example | Resolution |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| Relative | `@../shared/common.md` | Relative to rule file location |
| Absolute | `@/docs/api.md` | First tries true absolute path, then workspace-relative |
| Workspace | `@app/types.ts` | Relative to workspace/repository root |

#### Use Cases

**Referencing shared documentation:**
```markdown
For API conventions, see @/docs/api-guidelines.md
```

**Including type definitions:**
```markdown
All API responses must follow the types in @app/types/api.types.ts
```

**Linking related rules:**
```markdown
See also: @coding-style.md for naming conventions
```

### Creating Rules

1. Check if `.agent/rules/` directory exists, create if not
2. Check if a file for this category already exists
3. If exists: append new rules to the file
4. If not: create new file with proper structure
