# Obsidian Internal Links

## Overview

This skill enables navigation and exploration of Obsidian's internal link structure by resolving `[[link]]` references to read connected notes. Use this skill when understanding relationships between notes, following references, or building a comprehensive view of interconnected ideas within an Obsidian vault.

## When to Use This Skill

Invoke this skill when:
- User asks to "follow links" in an Obsidian note
- User wants to "explore connected notes" or "see what this links to"
- User requests to "read linked pages" or "show me related notes"
- User wants to understand the "knowledge graph" or "note relationships"
- User asks to "trace references" or "find all related content"
- Working with Obsidian markdown files that contain `[[internal links]]`

## Core Workflow

### 1. Identify the Starting Note

Determine which Obsidian note to start from. This could be:
- A file path provided by the user
- The current file being discussed
- A note referenced by name or ID

### 2. Execute the Link Resolver

Use the `scripts/resolve_links.py` script to analyze the note and follow its links.

**Dependencies**: The script requires PyYAML. If using UV: `uv pip install PyYAML`. Otherwise: `pip install PyYAML` or `pip3 install --break-system-packages PyYAML` on systems with externally managed Python.

```bash
python scripts/resolve_links.py <file-path> --vault <vault-path> --depth <depth> --pretty
```

**Parameters:**
- `<file-path>` (required): Path to the markdown file to analyze
- `--vault` (optional): Path to the Obsidian vault (defaults to `/Users/tolga/src/tolgaio/brain`)
- `--depth` (optional): Maximum recursion depth for following links (default: 1)
  - `0` = Extract links but don't follow them
  - `1` = Follow direct links and identify their outgoing links
  - `2+` = Follow links recursively to the specified depth
- `--pretty` (optional): Format JSON output for readability

**Example:**
```bash
# Follow links one level deep from inbox.md
python scripts/resolve_links.py /Users/tolga/src/tolgaio/brain/0_inbox/inbox.md --depth 1 --pretty

# Just extract links without following them
python scripts/resolve_links.py /path/to/note.md --depth 0
```

### 3. Interpret the Results

The script returns a JSON structure containing:

```json
{
  "file": "/path/to/source.md",
  "links": [
    {
      "link_text": "digital-garden",
      "display_text": "Digital Garden",
      "resolved": true,
      "target_file": "/path/to/digital-garden.md",
      "content": "# Digital Garden\n\n...",
      "nested_links": [...]  // If depth > 0
    }
  ],
  "broken_links": ["nonexistent-note"]
}
```

**Key fields:**
- `links`: Array of resolved link objects
  - `link_text`: The target from `[[link_text]]` or `[[link_text|display]]`
  - `display_text`: What's shown to the user (after `|` or same as link_text)
  - `resolved`: Whether the link target was found
  - `target_file`: Absolute path to the linked file (if found)
  - `content`: Full text content of the linked file
  - `nested_links`: Recursively resolved links (if depth allows)
- `broken_links`: Array of link targets that couldn't be resolved

### 4. Present the Information

Structure the results for the user based on their request:

**For link exploration:**
- List all linked notes with their titles
- Show the hierarchy if depth > 0
- Highlight any broken links that need attention

**For content synthesis:**
- Read and summarize the linked notes
- Extract relevant sections
- Connect ideas across multiple notes

**For knowledge mapping:**
- Describe the relationship structure
- Identify central hub notes
- Show connection patterns

## Link Resolution Strategy

The script resolves links using this priority order:

1. **Frontmatter ID**: Checks if the link target matches any note's `id:` field in YAML frontmatter
2. **Filename**: Matches against the filename (without `.md` extension)
3. **Path-based**: For links like `[[folder/note]]`, tries path resolution

**Example:**
```yaml
---
id: digital-garden
aliases:
  - My Garden
  - Knowledge Base
---
```

A link `[[digital-garden]]` or `[[digital-garden|Digital Garden]]` will resolve to this note.

## Handling Different Link Types

### Basic Links
```markdown
[[note-name]]
```
Resolves to a note with `id: note-name` or filename `note-name.md`

### Links with Aliases
```markdown
[[note-id|Display Text]]
```
The script extracts `note-id` as the target and `Display Text` as what's shown

### Heading Links
```markdown
[[note-name#Heading]]
```
Currently resolves to the note itself (heading navigation is future enhancement)

### Path-Based Links
```markdown
[[folder/subfolder/note]]
```
Tries to resolve using the full path, or falls back to just the note name

### Embedded Files
```markdown
![[image.png]]
```
These are automatically skipped as they're not navigable note links

## Managing Recursion

**Depth 0** - Extract only:
- Lists all links in the starting document
- No content loading from linked files
- Fast, minimal context usage
- Use when you only need to know what's linked

**Depth 1** - One level deep (recommended default):
- Reads content of directly linked notes
- Identifies what those notes link to
- Balanced between context and insight
- Use for most exploration tasks

**Depth 2+** - Deep traversal:
- Follows links within linked notes
- Can quickly expand to many files
- Higher context usage
- Use when building comprehensive knowledge maps

**Cycle detection:** The script tracks visited files to prevent infinite loops when notes link to each other.

## Broken Link Handling

When links cannot be resolved:
- They're collected in the `broken_links` array
- Processing continues with other links
- Report broken links to the user so they can:
  - Fix the link
  - Create the missing note
  - Update references

## Example Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Following References
User: "What does my inbox note link to?"

```bash
python scripts/resolve_links.py /Users/tolga/src/tolgaio/brain/0_inbox/inbox.md --depth 1 --pretty
```

Present: "Your inbox links to 5 notes: [list them]. Here's a summary of each linked note..."

### Scenario 2: Building a Knowledge Graph
User: "Show me how my digital garden notes are connected"

```bash
python scripts/resolve_links.py /Users/tolga/src/tolgaio/brain/2_Resources/digital-garden.md --depth 2 --pretty
```

Present: "Your digital garden connects to [X] notes. The main clusters are... [describe the network]"

### Scenario 3: Finding Broken Links
User: "Check if all my project notes have valid links"

```bash
python scripts/resolve_links.py /Users/tolga/src/tolgaio/brain/1_Projects/project-x.md --depth 0
```

Present: "Found 3 broken links: [list them]. These need to be fixed or the target notes created."

## Advanced Considerations

### Performance
- Large vaults (hundreds of files) may take a few seconds to index
- Deep recursion (depth 3+) can process many files
- Consider using `--depth 0` first to see link count before deep traversal

### Context Management
- Each linked file's content is included in the JSON output
- Deep traversal can generate large JSON responses
- Be mindful of context window limits when following many links

### Vault Configuration
- Default vault path: `/Users/tolga/src/tolgaio/brain`
- Override with `--vault` parameter for different vaults
- The script builds an index of all `.md` files in the vault
