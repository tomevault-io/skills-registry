# Capturing Claude Code

Capture Claude Code terminal output and interactive UI screens via tmux.
Launches a single Claude Code pane, sends commands/keystrokes, captures screen output,
and saves results to markdown files.

## Goal

$ARGUMENTS

## Skill Structure

```
capturing-claudecode/
├── SKILL.md          # This file (workflow)
├── reference.md      # Troubleshooting, special keys, idle detection
└── scripts/
    ├── setup.sh      # Session + pane + Claude launch + idle wait
    └── cleanup.sh    # Exit Claude + kill session
```

## Capture Types

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Simple output** | Send text command, wait, capture | "Hello" -> capture greeting |
| **Interactive UI** | Navigate menus with arrow/Tab keys | /permissions menu tabs |
| **Multi-step** | Sequential send-capture cycles | Record a conversation flow |

## Execution Workflow

### Step 1: Setup

```bash
bash ~/.claude/skills/capturing-claudecode/scripts/setup.sh
```

Creates tmux session `claude-capture`, launches Claude Code, waits for idle.

### Step 2: Send Command (2-call protocol)

```bash
# Call 1: Send text
tmux send-keys -t claude-capture:0.0 'Hello'
```

```bash
# Call 2: Press Enter (SEPARATE bash call)
tmux send-keys -t claude-capture:0.0 C-m
```

### Step 3: Wait for Idle

```bash
BUSY_RE="Thinking|Esc to interrupt|Boogieing|Mulling|Churning|Implementing|Writing|Reading|Searching|Running|✽|✶|✢|✳|✻"
IDLE_RE="❯ |bypass permissions on|to cycle\)"

MAX_RETRIES=12
for attempt in $(seq 1 $MAX_RETRIES); do
    OUTPUT=$(tmux capture-pane -t claude-capture:0.0 -p | tail -15)
    if echo "$OUTPUT" | grep -qE "$IDLE_RE" && ! echo "$OUTPUT" | grep -qE "$BUSY_RE"; then
        break
    fi
    sleep 10
done
```

### Step 4: Capture Output

```bash
tmux capture-pane -t claude-capture:0.0 -p
```

### Step 5: Save to Markdown

Default save location: `~/Desktop/` with descriptive filename.
If a path is specified in the task arguments, use that instead.

### Step 6: (Optional) Repeat Steps 2-5

For multi-step captures, repeat the send/wait/capture cycle.

### Step 7: Cleanup

```bash
bash ~/.claude/skills/capturing-claudecode/scripts/cleanup.sh
```

## Sending Special Keys (Interactive UI)

Special keys are single send-keys calls. No C-m needed.

```bash
# Arrow keys
tmux send-keys -t claude-capture:0.0 Right
tmux send-keys -t claude-capture:0.0 Left
tmux send-keys -t claude-capture:0.0 Up
tmux send-keys -t claude-capture:0.0 Down

# Tab / Shift-Tab
tmux send-keys -t claude-capture:0.0 Tab
tmux send-keys -t claude-capture:0.0 BTab

# Escape (cancel / go back)
tmux send-keys -t claude-capture:0.0 Escape

# Ctrl-C (interrupt)
tmux send-keys -t claude-capture:0.0 C-c
```

## Important Rules

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **2-call protocol** | Text and C-m must be separate bash calls |
| **Idle before capture** | Always wait for idle before running capture-pane |
| **Idle before send** | Verify pane is idle before sending next command |
| **Special keys: single call** | Arrow, Tab, Escape are sent as single calls (no C-m) |
| **Capture timing** | Wait 1-2s after idle/key before capture for UI to stabilize |
| **No silent decisions** | If unclear what to capture or where to save, ask the user |

For detailed reference: [reference.md](reference.md)

## AI Instructions

When this skill is invoked:

1. **Analyze $ARGUMENTS** to understand what needs to be captured
   - What command(s) or keys to send
   - Whether this is simple output or interactive UI capture
   - Where to save (default: `~/Desktop/` with descriptive filename)

2. **Run setup.sh** to create the tmux session and launch Claude

3. **Execute the capture sequence**:
   - **Simple output**: send command -> wait idle -> capture -> save
   - **Interactive UI**: send command -> wait idle -> send navigation keys -> sleep 1-2s -> capture -> save
   - **Multi-step**: repeat send/wait/capture cycle

4. **Save output** to markdown file
   - Use descriptive filename based on content
   - Include raw terminal output in code blocks
   - If user specified a save path, use that exactly

5. **Report** the capture results and file location to the user

6. **Cleanup** (ask user first if they want to keep the session)

### Always

- Use full script paths: `~/.claude/skills/capturing-claudecode/scripts/setup.sh`
- Use 2-call protocol for text + Enter
- Wait for idle before capturing
- Add sleep 1-2s after idle detection / key press before capture
- Use descriptive filenames based on captured content

### When Claude Code Operations Fail

If a Claude Code command, slash command, or UI interaction does not behave as expected
(e.g., unknown command, unexpected menu structure, changed key bindings):

- Use the `claude-code-guide` sub-agent (Task tool, subagent_type=claude-code-guide) to look up official documentation
- Official docs may not cover every edge case, but often clarify correct command syntax, available options, and UI behavior

### Never

- Capture while pane is busy (output will be incomplete)
- Combine text and C-m in a single send-keys call
- Forget to wait for idle between sequential commands
- Overwrite existing capture files without asking
- Skip cleanup without user confirmation
