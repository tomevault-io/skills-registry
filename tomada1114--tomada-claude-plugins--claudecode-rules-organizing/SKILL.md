Use PROACTIVELY when CLAUDE.md has file-specific rules (API, frontend, testing) that can benefit from on-demand loading, when context optimization is needed for large projects, or when user mentions rules organization.

# Claude Rules Organizer

Extract file-type specific rules from CLAUDE.md into `.claude/rules/` with dynamic loading via `paths` frontmatter for context optimization.

## When to Use This Skill

- CLAUDE.md has **file-type specific rules** that can use dynamic loading
- Context optimization needed (large projects with many rules)
- Want to load API/frontend/testing rules only when relevant files are accessed
- Migrating from monolithic CLAUDE.md to dynamic rule loading

**Note**: If rules are universal (code style, git, build commands), keep them in CLAUDE.md. Only use `.claude/rules/` for rules with `paths` for dynamic loading.

## Core Concepts

### Three Rule Methods (Priority Order)

| Method | Location | Loading | Use Case |
|--------|----------|---------|----------|
| **CLAUDE.md** | `./CLAUDE.md` or `./.claude/CLAUDE.md` | Always at startup | Core project overview, universal rules |
| **.claude/rules/** (with paths) | `.claude/rules/*.md` | On file access | File-type specific rules |
| **@import** | Within CLAUDE.md | At startup | External file references |

### Important: Context Consumption

**Rules without `paths` consume context at startup, same as CLAUDE.md.**

| Location | paths | Context Impact |
|----------|-------|----------------|
| CLAUDE.md | N/A | Always consumed |
| rules/*.md | None | Always consumed (same as CLAUDE.md) |
| rules/*.md | Specified | On-demand only |

**Key insight**: Splitting rules into `.claude/rules/` without `paths` provides **no context savings**. Only use rules/ for dynamic loading.

### Dynamic Loading with paths

Rules with `paths` frontmatter load **only when matching files are accessed**:

```markdown
---
paths: src/api/**/*.ts
---

# API Rules
- Input validation required
- Use standard error format
```

| paths | Loading | Context |
|-------|---------|---------|
| None | Startup | Always consumed |
| Specified | On file access | On-demand only |

## Reorganization Workflow

### Step 1: Analyze Current CLAUDE.md

Categorize content:

**Keep in CLAUDE.md** (universal, always needed):
- Project overview
- Coding standards
- Git conventions
- Build commands

**Move to rules/** (file-type specific, use `paths`):
- API conventions → `rules/api.md` (paths: src/api/**)
- Frontend rules → `rules/frontend.md` (paths: **/*.tsx)
- Testing rules → `rules/testing.md` (paths: **/*.test.ts)

### Step 2: Create Modular Structure

```
.claude/
├── CLAUDE.md              # Overview + universal rules (code style, git, etc.)
└── rules/
    ├── api.md             # paths: src/api/**/* → dynamic
    ├── frontend/
    │   ├── react.md       # paths: **/*.tsx → dynamic
    │   └── styles.md      # paths: **/*.css → dynamic
    ├── testing.md         # paths: **/*.test.ts → dynamic
    └── backend/
        └── database.md    # paths: src/db/**/* → dynamic
```

**Note**: Universal rules (code style, git conventions) stay in CLAUDE.md. Only file-type specific rules go to rules/.

### Step 3: Determine Where to Place Rules

| Rule Type | Recommendation | Reason |
|-----------|----------------|--------|
| Universal (code style, git) | **Keep in CLAUDE.md** | No context benefit from splitting |
| Language-specific | rules/ with `paths: **/*.{ext}` | Dynamic loading saves context |
| Directory-specific | rules/ with `paths: src/api/**/*` | Dynamic loading saves context |
| Test-specific | rules/ with `paths: **/*.test.ts` | Dynamic loading saves context |

**Principle**: Only move to `.claude/rules/` if you can specify `paths` for dynamic loading.

### Step 4: Migrate Content

For each topic:

1. Create new rule file with frontmatter
2. Move relevant content from CLAUDE.md
3. Add paths if file-type specific

**Note**: Do NOT add rule file references to CLAUDE.md. Dynamic rules with `paths` load automatically when matching files are accessed. Listing them in CLAUDE.md is redundant and wastes context.

## Output Templates

### Minimal CLAUDE.md Template

```markdown
# Project Name

Brief project description.

## Quick Reference

- Build: `npm run build`
- Test: `npm test`
- Lint: `npm run lint`

## Key Files

| Purpose | Path |
|---------|------|
| Entry | src/index.ts |
| Config | config/ |
```

**Important**: Do NOT list `.claude/rules/` files in CLAUDE.md. They load automatically via `paths` frontmatter. Adding references wastes startup context.

### Rule File Template (Always use paths)

```markdown
---
paths: src/api/**/*.ts
---

# API Development Rules

## Overview
Rules for API endpoint development.

## Standards

### Request Handling
- Validate all inputs
- Use typed request/response

### Error Handling
- Use standard error format
- Include error codes
```

## Best Practices

### DO

1. **Keep universal rules in CLAUDE.md** - Code style, git, build commands
2. **Only use rules/ for dynamic loading** - Always specify `paths`
3. **One topic per rule file** - `api.md`, `react.md`, not generic `rules.md`
4. **Use descriptive filenames** - Content should be obvious from name
5. **Use subdirectories** - Group related rules (`frontend/`, `backend/`)

### DON'T

1. **Don't split without `paths`** - No context benefit, adds complexity
2. **Don't over-fragment** - 3-10 rule files is ideal
3. **Don't duplicate** - Reference shared rules, don't copy
4. **Don't nest too deep** - Max 2 levels of subdirectories

## Verification

After reorganization:

1. **Check startup load**: Run `claude` and use `/memory` to verify only intended rules load
2. **Test dynamic load**: Read a file matching a paths pattern, confirm rule loads
3. **Verify no duplicates**: Second read of same file type should not reload rules
4. **Check context**: Use `/context` before and after to measure improvement

## AI Assistant Instructions

When this skill is activated:

### Analysis Phase

1. **Read current CLAUDE.md** completely
2. **Identify topics**: List distinct sections/concerns
3. **Measure size**: Count lines, estimate tokens
4. **Check for @imports**: Note external references
5. **Present analysis** to user with recommendations

### Planning Phase

1. **Propose structure**: Show target file tree
2. **Categorize rules**:
   - Universal → Keep in CLAUDE.md
   - File-type specific → rules/ with `paths`
   - Directory-specific → rules/ with `paths`
3. **Estimate impact**: Context savings from dynamic loading
4. **Get user approval** before proceeding

### Execution Phase

1. **Create directories**: `.claude/rules/` and subdirs
2. **Create rule files**: One topic at a time
3. **Update CLAUDE.md**: Strip moved content only (do NOT add rule references)
4. **Preserve @imports**: Keep external references working
5. **Show diff summary**: What moved where

### Verification Phase

1. **List created files** with line counts
2. **Show new CLAUDE.md** content
3. **Provide test commands** for verification
4. **Suggest next steps** if further optimization possible

### Always

- Preserve all existing rules (no content loss)
- Maintain team compatibility (git-friendly)
- Use English for file contents
- Follow glob pattern standards
- Create backup recommendation before major changes

### Never

- Delete rules without user confirmation
- Change rule semantics during migration
- Create circular @imports
- Create rule files without `paths` (use CLAUDE.md instead)
- Over-fragment into too many small files
