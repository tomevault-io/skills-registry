# Agile Ticket Planner

Plan and create GitHub Issues with agile/scrum methodology, focusing on parallel work identification, dependency management, and git worktree optimization.

## When to Use This Skill

- Breaking down requirements into GitHub Issues
- Planning sprints with parallel workstreams
- Identifying which tasks can be done independently
- Setting up git worktree strategies for parallel development
- Creating tickets with clear dependency relationships
- Organizing work for multiple developers

## Core Principles

### 1. Small, Completable Units
Each ticket should be:
- Completable in 1-3 hours (ideal)
- Testable independently
- Deliverable as a shippable increment

### 2. Independence Over Granularity
- Prioritize independence over small size
- Merge related tasks if splitting creates dependencies
- A larger independent ticket > multiple dependent small tickets

### 3. Parallel Work First
- Identify what can be done simultaneously
- Design tickets to minimize blocking relationships
- Enable multiple developers to work concurrently

## Ticket Title Format

```
【並列可】Feature description - Specific scope
【依存あり】Feature description - Specific scope
【基盤】Infrastructure - Must complete first
【並列可/worktree:feature-xxx】Feature with worktree suggestion
```

### Title Prefixes

| Prefix | Meaning | When to Use |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| 【並列可】 | Parallel OK | Can work independently |
| 【依存あり】 | Has Dependencies | Must wait for other tickets |
| 【基盤】 | Foundation | Required before parallel work |
| 【並列可/worktree:name】 | Parallel + Worktree | Suggests worktree branch name |
| 【順次】 | Sequential | Must follow specific order |

## Ticket Body Principles

**Goal**: "誰が実装しても要件は絶対に満たせる" (Anyone can implement and definitely satisfy requirements)

### EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax)

Use EARS format for unambiguous, testable requirements:

| Pattern | Template | Example |
|---------|----------|---------|
| **Ubiquitous** | The [system] shall [action] | The button shall have 44pt minimum touch target. |
| **Event-driven** | **When** [trigger], the [system] shall [action] | **When** user taps "Coffee", the system shall display size selection sheet. |
| **State-driven** | **While** [state], the [system] shall [action] | **While** loading, the system shall display spinner. |
| **Unwanted** | **If** [condition], **then** the [system] shall [action] | **If** save fails, **then** the system shall show error toast. |
| **Optional** | **Where** [feature], the [system] shall [action] | **Where** Pro subscription is active, the system shall allow unlimited custom drinks. |
| **Complex** | Combine patterns | **While** after cutoff time, **when** user selects caffeine drink, the system shall show warning alert. |

### Key Sections for Requirement Clarity

1. **User Story** - Why this feature exists
   - As a [user type], I want [goal], So that [benefit]

2. **Functional Requirements (EARS Format)** - What exactly should happen
   - Core Requirements (Event-driven)
   - State-Dependent Requirements
   - Error Handling Requirements (Unwanted behavior)
   - Optional Requirements (Pro features)

3. **Boundary Conditions** - Edge cases with EARS format
   - Minimum/Maximum values
   - Empty/null handling
   - Over-limit behavior

4. **Concrete Examples** - Specific scenarios with numbers
   - Trigger → State → Result → Verification

5. **Not In Scope** - What this ticket does NOT include
   - Prevents scope creep
   - Clarifies boundaries

6. **Acceptance Criteria** - Tied to requirement IDs
   - REQ-001: [Testable condition]
   - Each EARS requirement maps to acceptance criterion

### Template Quick Reference

```markdown
## User Story
**As a** [user type]
**I want** [goal/desire]
**So that** [benefit/value]

## Background & Context
Reference: PROJECT_IDEA.md Section X.X

## Functional Requirements (EARS Format)

### Core Requirements
| ID | Requirement |
|----|-------------|
| REQ-001 | **When** user taps "Coffee" button, the system shall display size selection bottom sheet. |
| REQ-002 | **When** user selects 250ml, the system shall record drink with calculated caffeine (250ml × 60mg/100ml = 150mg). |

### State-Dependent Requirements
| ID | Requirement |
|----|-------------|
| REQ-010 | **While** current caffeine ≥ daily limit, the system shall display progress bar at 100%. |

### Error Handling Requirements
| ID | Requirement |
|----|-------------|
| REQ-020 | **If** database save fails, **then** the system shall display error toast "保存に失敗しました". |

### Boundary Conditions
| Condition | Value | EARS Requirement |
|-----------|-------|------------------|
| Minimum | 0ml | **When** calculated amount is 0, the system shall still record the entry. |
| Daily limit exceeded | >300mg | **While** over limit, the system shall show exceeded amount in text (e.g., "350mg / 300mg"). |

## Concrete Examples
### Example 1: Record Coffee
- **Trigger**: User taps "Coffee" → selects "250ml"
- **State**: Current caffeine: 100mg, Limit: 300mg
- **Result**: Toast "☕ +150mg recorded", Progress shows 250mg/300mg
- **Verification**: Check DB has new record, UI updated

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] REQ-001: Bottom sheet appears with 150/250/350ml options
- [ ] REQ-002: Caffeine calculated correctly and saved
- [ ] REQ-020: Error toast shown on save failure
- [ ] Unit tests cover all REQ-* requirements

## Not In Scope
- NOT implementing: Custom drink creation (Pro feature, separate ticket)
- NOT handling: Undo functionality (future enhancement)

## Dependencies
- Depends on: #XX - Drink types, #YY - Database schema
- Blocks: #ZZ - History screen
```

See [templates/issue-template.md](templates/issue-template.md) for complete templates.

## Dependency Analysis Process

### Step 1: Identify Foundation Tasks
Foundation tasks that others depend on:
- Database schema definitions
- Core type definitions
- Base component creation
- Configuration setup

### Step 2: Map Dependencies
```
[Foundation Tasks]
      ↓
[Layer 1 Tasks] ← Can parallel within layer
      ↓
[Layer 2 Tasks] ← Can parallel within layer
      ↓
[Integration Tasks]
```

### Step 3: Group by Parallel Streams

Example parallel streams:
```
Stream A (UI):     Stream B (Data):    Stream C (Logic):
[基盤] Schema ─────────────────────────────────────────
     ↓                  ↓                    ↓
[並列可] Home UI   [並列可] DB Repo    [並列可] Service
     ↓                  ↓                    ↓
[並列可] List UI   [並列可] Hooks      [並列可] Validation
     ↓                  ↓                    ↓
────────────────── Integration ──────────────────────
```

## Git Worktree Strategy

### When to Suggest Worktree
- Parallel tickets touching different areas
- Long-running features that shouldn't block
- Multiple developers on same project

### Worktree Naming Convention
```
../project-{feature-category}/
Examples:
  ../hydro-caffeine-ui-home/
  ../hydro-caffeine-db-schema/
  ../hydro-caffeine-settings/
```

### Worktree Setup Template
```bash
# Create worktree for parallel work
git worktree add ../project-feature-name feature/issue-XX-description

# After completion
git worktree remove ../project-feature-name
```

## Ticket Categories

### 1. Foundation Tickets 【基盤】
Must complete before parallel work begins:
- Schema definitions
- Type definitions
- Core utilities
- Theme/constants

### 2. Parallel UI Tickets 【並列可】
Can work simultaneously:
- Different screens
- Independent components
- Isolated features

### 3. Parallel Data Tickets 【並列可】
Can work simultaneously:
- Different repository functions
- Independent hooks
- Separate API endpoints

### 4. Integration Tickets 【依存あり】
Require prior tickets:
- Connecting UI to data
- Cross-feature functionality
- E2E testing

## GitHub Issue Creation

### Using gh CLI
```bash
# Create issue with all metadata
gh issue create \
  --title "【並列可】Home Screen - Progress bars component" \
  --body "$(cat issue-body.md)" \
  --label "enhancement,parallel"

# Create linked issues
gh issue create \
  --title "【依存あり】Home Screen - Integration with data layer" \
  --body "Depends on #1, #2" \
  --label "enhancement,blocked"
```

### Labels to Use
| Label | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `parallel` | Can work in parallel |
| `blocked` | Waiting on dependencies |
| `foundation` | Must complete first |
| `ui` | User interface work |
| `data` | Data layer work |
| `integration` | Connects multiple parts |

## Analysis Workflow

### Phase 1: Requirement Analysis
1. Read requirements document thoroughly
2. Identify major feature areas
3. List all discrete functionality

### Phase 2: Dependency Mapping
1. Draw dependency graph mentally
2. Identify foundation requirements
3. Group independent work streams

### Phase 3: Ticket Creation Order
1. Create foundation tickets first
2. Create parallel tickets with worktree suggestions
3. Create integration tickets last
4. Add cross-references

### Phase 4: Validation
- Each ticket is independently testable
- Dependencies are explicit
- Parallel work is maximized
- Worktree names are consistent

## AI Assistant Instructions

When this skill is activated:

**Goal**: "誰が実装しても要件は絶対に満たせる" (Anyone can implement and definitely satisfy requirements)

### Analysis Phase

1. **Read Requirements First**: Thoroughly analyze the requirements document (PROJECT_IDEA.md)
   - Extract ALL specific values (numbers, colors, sizes, text)
   - Note section references for traceability
   - Identify implicit requirements that need clarification

2. **Create Source Requirements Table**: For each ticket, extract exact specs
   ```
   | Section | Reference | Specification |
   |---------|-----------|---------------|
   | プログレスバー | 4.3 | 現在量 / 目標量（例: 1.2L / 2.0L） |
   | カフェイン上限 | 4.2 | デフォルト300mg |
   ```

3. **Extract Key Values**: All numbers from requirements
   ```
   | Item | Value | Unit | Source |
   |------|-------|------|--------|
   | 水分目標デフォルト | 2,000 | ml | 4.9 |
   | カフェイン上限デフォルト | 300 | mg | 4.9 |
   | コーヒーのカフェイン | 60 | mg/100ml | 4.2 |
   | サイズオプション | 150, 250, 350 | ml | 4.11 |
   ```

4. **Identify Domains & Dependencies**: Split into logical domains (UI, Data, Logic, etc.)

5. **Maximize Parallel Work**: Group independent tasks

### Ticket Creation Phase - EARS Format Required

1. **Write EARS Requirements**: Every ticket MUST have requirements in EARS format
   - Use **When** for user interactions (Event-driven)
   - Use **While** for state-dependent behavior (State-driven)
   - Use **If/then** for error handling (Unwanted behavior)
   - Use **Where** for Pro/optional features (Optional)
   - The [system] shall... for universal constraints (Ubiquitous)

2. **Assign Requirement IDs**:
   - REQ-001, REQ-002... for core requirements
   - REQ-010, REQ-011... for state requirements
   - REQ-020, REQ-021... for error handling
   - UI-001, UI-002... for UI requirements
   - A11Y-001... for accessibility

3. **Map Requirements to Acceptance Criteria**:
   - Each REQ-XXX must have corresponding acceptance criterion
   - Criteria must be testable: "REQ-001: [specific verifiable condition]"

4. **Include Concrete Examples** (CRITICAL - at least 4 per ticket):

   **Example Format**:
   ```
   ### Example 1: Happy Path - Record Coffee
   Trigger:    User taps "コーヒー" button, selects 250ml
   Pre-state:  Today's caffeine = 100mg, Limit = 300mg
   Calculation: 250ml × (60mg/100ml) = 150mg
   Post-state: Today's caffeine = 250mg
   UI Result:
     - Toast: "☕ +150mg recorded"
     - Progress bar: 250mg / 300mg (83%)
     - Today's log: New entry "コーヒー 250ml (150mg) - 10:30"
   Verification: Check DB has record with { type: 'coffee', amount_ml: 250, caffeine_mg: 150 }
   ```

   **Required Examples**:
   - Happy path: Normal successful flow with specific values
   - Boundary case: Edge values (0, max, 100% exceeded, empty list)
   - Error case: What happens when things fail
   - Edge case: First use, empty state, etc.

5. **Boundary Conditions Table** (MANDATORY):
   ```
   | Condition | Value | EARS Requirement | Example |
   |-----------|-------|------------------|---------|
   | Minimum | 0ml | **When** value is 0, the system shall display "0ml / 2,000ml". | 0 → "0ml / 2,000ml" |
   | Over 100% | >2000ml | **While** value > target, the system shall show bar at 100% and text as "2,500ml / 2,000ml". | 2500/2000 → bar 100%, text "2,500ml" |
   | Empty list | 0 records | **While** no records exist, the system shall show "💧 まだ記録がありません". | Empty → placeholder |
   ```

6. **UI Specifications Table**:
   ```
   | ID | Property | Value | Source |
   |----|----------|-------|--------|
   | UI-001 | Touch target | 44pt × 44pt minimum | HIG |
   | UI-002 | Water color | iOS Blue (#007AFF) | PROJECT_IDEA.md 9.2 |
   | UI-003 | Caffeine color | iOS Brown (#A2845E) | PROJECT_IDEA.md 9.2 |
   ```

7. **Not In Scope** (MANDATORY):
   - Explicitly state what this ticket does NOT include
   - Prevents scope creep
   - Reference other tickets for excluded items

8. **Verification Checklist**:
   - Step-by-step manual test procedure
   - Each step maps to a requirement

### Output Format

1. **Summary Table**: Show all tickets in a table first
2. **Dependency Graph**: Visual representation if complex
3. **Phase Breakdown**: Group by implementation phase
4. **Worktree Plan**: List suggested worktrees

### Quality Checks

**Requirements Quality**:
- [ ] Every ticket has EARS-formatted requirements with IDs
- [ ] Requirements include specific values from PROJECT_IDEA.md
- [ ] Source Requirements table references PROJECT_IDEA.md sections
- [ ] Key Values table lists ALL numbers from requirements

**Examples Quality**:
- [ ] At least 4 concrete examples per ticket
- [ ] Examples include specific values (250ml, 150mg, 16:00)
- [ ] Happy path, Boundary, Error, Edge cases covered
- [ ] Each example has: Trigger → Pre-state → Action → Post-state → UI Result → Verification

**Boundary Conditions**:
- [ ] Minimum value defined (0, empty, null)
- [ ] Maximum value defined (limit, overflow)
- [ ] 100% exceeded behavior defined
- [ ] Empty state behavior defined

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Criteria reference requirement IDs (REQ-XXX)
- [ ] Each criterion is testable with specific values
- [ ] Boundary conditions have acceptance criteria

**Dependencies**:
- [ ] Dependencies are bidirectional (depends on / blocks)
- [ ] Parallel work is maximized
- [ ] Worktree names are descriptive and consistent

### Never

- Write vague requirements like "properly displays" without specific values
- Create tickets without Source Requirements table
- Skip the Key Values table
- Use placeholder values like "XX" or "[value]" - always use real values
- Write examples without specific numbers (250ml, not "some amount")
- Skip boundary condition definitions
- Omit the Not In Scope section
- Create acceptance criteria that don't map to requirements
- Assume dependencies without marking them
- Miss opportunities for parallel work
- Forget worktree suggestions for parallel work

### Example: Good vs Bad Ticket

**❌ BAD (vague, no one can implement confidently)**:
```markdown
## 概要
プログレスバーコンポーネント

## 受け入れ条件
- [ ] 進捗を表示する
- [ ] 100%超過時の処理
- [ ] アクセシビリティ対応
```

**✅ GOOD (anyone can implement exactly)**:
```markdown
## User Story
**As a** user
**I want** to see my daily water and caffeine progress at a glance
**So that** I can track my consumption goals

## Source Requirements

| Section | Reference | Specification |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| プログレスバー | 4.3 | 現在量 / 目標量（例: 1.2L / 2.0L） |
| 100%超過 | 4.3 | バーは100%で停止、数値のみ超過表示（例: 2.5L / 2.0L ✓達成） |

## Functional Requirements (EARS Format)

| ID | Requirement | Verification |
|----|-------------|--------------|
| REQ-001 | The progress bar shall display current value and target as "X.X L / Y.Y L" format. | Text matches format |
| REQ-002 | **While** current ≥ target, the system shall display bar at 100% width. | Bar does not exceed container |
| REQ-003 | **While** current ≥ target, the system shall display text as "X.X L / Y.Y L ✓達成". | Checkmark visible |

## Boundary Conditions

| Condition | Value | EARS Requirement | Example |
|-----------|-------|------------------|---------|
| Zero | 0ml | **When** value is 0, the system shall display "0ml / 2,000ml" with 0% bar. | 0 → empty bar |
| 100% exactly | 2000ml | **When** value equals target, the system shall display bar at 100% and "2,000ml / 2,000ml ✓達成". | 2000/2000 → full bar + ✓ |
| Over 100% | 2500ml | **While** value > target, the system shall show bar at 100% (not overflow) and "2,500ml / 2,000ml ✓達成". | 2500/2000 → bar stays 100%, text shows 2,500 |

## Concrete Examples

### Example 1: Happy Path - 60% Progress
Trigger:    Component renders with currentValue=1200, targetValue=2000
Pre-state:  n/a (initial render)
UI Result:
  - Bar width: 60% of container
  - Text: "1.2 L / 2.0 L"
  - No checkmark
Verification: Visual inspection, snapshot test

### Example 2: Boundary - Exactly 100%
Trigger:    Component renders with currentValue=2000, targetValue=2000
UI Result:
  - Bar width: 100% of container
  - Text: "2.0 L / 2.0 L ✓達成"
  - Checkmark visible
Verification: Visual inspection, unit test

### Example 3: Over 100%
Trigger:    Component renders with currentValue=2500, targetValue=2000
UI Result:
  - Bar width: 100% (not 125%)
  - Text: "2.5 L / 2.0 L ✓達成"
Verification: Bar does not overflow, text shows exceeded value

### Example 4: Empty/Zero
Trigger:    Component renders with currentValue=0, targetValue=2000
UI Result:
  - Bar width: 0%
  - Text: "0 L / 2.0 L"
Verification: Bar is visible but empty

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] REQ-001: Format "X.X L / Y.Y L" displayed correctly
- [ ] REQ-002: Bar at 100% when current ≥ target
- [ ] REQ-003: "✓達成" shown when current ≥ target
- [ ] Boundary: 0% displays correctly (Example 4)
- [ ] Boundary: 100% displays correctly (Example 2)
- [ ] Boundary: >100% bar does not overflow (Example 3)
- [ ] A11Y: VoiceOver announces "60% complete, 1.2 liters of 2.0 liters"
```
