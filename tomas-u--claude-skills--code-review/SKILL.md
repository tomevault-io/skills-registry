# Code Review Skill

Provide thorough, constructive code reviews that ensure quality, security, and alignment with requirements.

## Review Process Overview

Every code review follows this structured approach:

1. **Story/Task Alignment** - Verify implementation matches requirements
2. **Code Quality** - Check naming, structure, and clean code principles
3. **Security Analysis** - Identify vulnerabilities using OWASP guidelines
4. **Maintainability** - Assess readability, complexity, and long-term sustainability
5. **Testing & Coverage** - Evaluate test quality and coverage
6. **Performance** - Identify potential performance issues
7. **Architecture Fit** - Ensure consistency with existing patterns
8. **Constructive Feedback** - Provide actionable improvements with reasoning

## Pre-Review Checklist

Before starting a code review, gather:

- [ ] PR/commit description and linked issues/stories
- [ ] Code changes (diff or full files)
- [ ] Related test files
- [ ] Project context (tech stack, architecture patterns)
- [ ] Existing linting/style configurations

## 1. Story/Task Alignment

### What to Check

**Requirements Coverage:**
- Does the code implement all acceptance criteria from the story?
- Are edge cases mentioned in the story handled?
- Does the implementation match the story's scope (not over/under-engineered)?

**Story References:**
- Is the story/issue referenced in commit messages?
- Does the PR description explain what's being solved?
- Are there any implemented features NOT in the story (scope creep)?

### Questions to Ask

- "What was the original requirement?"
- "Does this code solve that requirement completely?"
- "Are there parts of the story not addressed?"
- "Is there functionality beyond the story scope?"

### Feedback Template

```
✅ Story Alignment: [Pass/Partial/Fail]

Requirement Coverage:
- ✅ Implements user authentication (Story #123)
- ⚠️ Missing password reset flow mentioned in AC3
- ❌ Added email notification feature not in story scope

Recommendation: [Specific action needed]
```

## 2. Code Quality

### Naming Conventions

**Variables & Functions:**
- Descriptive, intention-revealing names
- Consistent with project conventions (camelCase, snake_case, etc.)
- Appropriate length (not too short, not unnecessarily long)
- Avoid abbreviations unless standard (e.g., `id`, `url`)

**Classes & Components:**
- Clear, singular nouns for classes
- Verb phrases for functions (e.g., `getUserById`, `calculateTotal`)
- Boolean variables start with `is`, `has`, `should` (e.g., `isActive`, `hasPermission`)

**Constants:**
- ALL_CAPS for true constants
- Descriptive names for magic numbers/strings

**Examples:**

❌ Bad:
```javascript
function calc(u, p) {
  const x = u * p;
  return x;
}
const MAX = 10; // Max what?
```

✅ Good:
```javascript
function calculateOrderTotal(unitPrice, quantity) {
  const totalPrice = unitPrice * quantity;
  return totalPrice;
}
const MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS = 10;
```

### Clean Code Principles

**Single Responsibility:**
- Each function/class does ONE thing well
- Easy to name (if hard to name, probably doing too much)

**DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):**
- No code duplication
- Extract common logic into reusable functions
- Use abstractions appropriately

**Function Size:**
- Keep functions small (< 20 lines ideally)
- One level of abstraction per function
- Extract complex logic into named helper functions

**Readability:**
- Code reads like prose
- Self-documenting (minimal comments needed)
- Clear flow and structure
- Appropriate whitespace and formatting

**Complexity:**
- Avoid deep nesting (> 3 levels)
- Limit function parameters (< 4 ideally)
- Cyclomatic complexity under control
- Extract complex conditions into named variables/functions

### Code Smells to Flag

Common issues to identify:

- **Long functions** (> 50 lines)
- **God objects** (classes doing too much)
- **Deep nesting** (if/else > 3 levels)
- **Magic numbers** (unexplained constants)
- **Dead code** (commented out, unreachable)
- **Inconsistent style** (mixed conventions)
- **Inappropriate intimacy** (too much coupling)
- **Feature envy** (method uses another class's data heavily)

### Feedback Template

```
📝 Code Quality: [Good/Needs Improvement]

Naming:
- ✅ Functions well-named and descriptive
- ⚠️ Variable 'x' on line 45 unclear - suggest 'totalRevenue'

Structure:
- ⚠️ Function `processUser` (lines 120-180) is 60 lines long
  → Recommend: Extract validation logic into `validateUserData`
  → Recommend: Extract DB operations into `saveUserToDatabase`
  
Clean Code:
- ❌ Code duplication in lines 45-52 and 78-85
  → Recommend: Extract into `formatCurrency(amount)` helper

Complexity:
- ⚠️ Deep nesting in `calculateDiscount` (4 levels)
  → Recommend: Use early returns or guard clauses

Why: These changes will make the code easier to understand, test, and maintain.
```

## 3. Security Analysis (OWASP)

Review code against OWASP Top 10 and common vulnerabilities. Reference `references/owasp-checklist.md` for comprehensive security checks.

### Key Security Checks

- Session timeout configured?
- CSRF tokens implemented?

### Feedback Template

```
🔒 Security Analysis: [Secure/Issues Found]

Critical Issues (Fix Immediately):
- 🚨 SQL Injection vulnerability in `getUserByEmail` (line 67)
  → Current: Direct string concatenation in query
  → Fix: Use parameterized query: `SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?`
  → Why: Attackers can inject malicious SQL and access all database data

High Priority:
- ⚠️ Password stored in plaintext (line 134)
  → Fix: Use bcrypt.hash() before storing
  → Why: If database is breached, all passwords are compromised

Medium Priority:
- ⚠️ Missing rate limiting on login endpoint
  → Recommend: Implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
  → Why: Prevents credential stuffing and account takeover attempts

Good Practices Found:
- ✅ HTTPS enforced for all endpoints
- ✅ Input validation on user registration
- ✅ CSRF tokens implemented

OWASP Alignment: [List specific OWASP categories addressed/violated]
```

### Technical Debt Assessment

Identify and categorize technical debt:

**Type 1 - Quick Fixes (< 1 hour):**
- Rename unclear variables
- Add missing comments
- Extract magic numbers to constants

**Type 2 - Refactoring (1-4 hours):**
- Extract long functions
- Remove code duplication
- Improve error handling

**Type 3 - Restructuring (> 4 hours):**
- Redesign module structure
- Refactor architecture
- Add missing abstractions

### Feedback Template

```
🔧 Maintainability: [Excellent/Good/Needs Work]

Readability:
- ✅ Code flows naturally and is easy to follow
- ⚠️ Function `processPayment` (line 89) has high cognitive complexity
  → Multiple nested conditions make logic hard to follow
  → Recommend: Extract validation into separate functions with clear names

Testability:
- ❌ `UserService` directly instantiates `DatabaseConnection`
  → Hard to test without real database
  → Recommend: Inject dependency via constructor
  → Why: Enables unit testing with mocked database

Documentation:
- ⚠️ Complex algorithm in `calculateShippingCost` (line 234) lacks explanation
  → Add comment explaining the business rules
  → Why: Future developers need to understand the logic without reverse-engineering

Technical Debt:
- Type 1: Rename `tmp` to `temporaryUserData` (line 45) - 5 min
- Type 2: Extract duplicate validation logic (lines 67-78, 123-134) - 30 min
  → Impact: Reduces maintenance burden and potential for inconsistencies

Long-term Maintenance Score: 7/10
→ Small improvements would significantly boost maintainability
```

## 5. Testing & Coverage

### Test Quality Assessment

**Test Coverage:**
- Are critical paths tested?
- Are edge cases covered?
- Are error conditions tested?
- What's the coverage percentage (if available)?

**Test Quality:**
- Are tests meaningful (not just for coverage)?
- Do tests verify behavior, not implementation?
- Are tests independent and isolated?
- Are test names descriptive?

**Test Types:**
- Unit tests for business logic?
- Integration tests for API endpoints?
- End-to-end tests for critical flows?
- Security tests for vulnerabilities?

**Missing Tests:**
- What scenarios aren't tested?
- Which error paths are untested?
- Are there untested branches?

### Feedback Template

```
🧪 Testing: [Well Tested/Partially Tested/Needs Tests]

Coverage:
- ✅ Happy path tested for user registration
- ⚠️ Missing tests for:
  → Duplicate email registration (should return 409)
  → Invalid email format (should return 400)
  → Database connection failure (should return 500)

Test Quality:
- ✅ Tests are isolated and independent
- ⚠️ Test `test_user_creation` on line 234 tests implementation details
  → Currently: Checks internal method calls
  → Should: Verify user exists in database after creation
  → Why: Implementation can change, behavior shouldn't

Recommended Tests:
1. Edge case: Maximum password length (security)
2. Error case: Network timeout during email sending
3. Integration: Full registration flow with email verification

Priority: Add error case tests (high priority for production readiness)
```

## 6. Performance Considerations

### Common Performance Issues

**Database:**
- N+1 query problems?
- Missing indexes?
- Inefficient queries (SELECT *)?
- Unnecessary joins?
- Missing pagination for large datasets?

**API Calls:**
- Redundant API requests?
- Missing caching?
- Synchronous calls that could be async?
- No timeout handling?

**Frontend:**
- Unnecessary re-renders (React)?
- Large bundle sizes?
- Unoptimized images?
- Missing code splitting?
- Blocking operations on main thread?

**Algorithms:**
- Inefficient algorithm choice (O(n²) when O(n log n) possible)?
- Unnecessary iterations?
- Memory leaks?
- Large object allocations in loops?

### Feedback Template

```
⚡ Performance: [Optimized/Acceptable/Issues Found]

Issues:
- ⚠️ N+1 query in `getUserWithPosts` (line 89)
  → Current: Loops through users, queries posts for each (1 + N queries)
  → Fix: Use JOIN or eager loading to fetch in single query
  → Impact: For 100 users, reduces from 101 queries to 1 query
  → Why: Critical for scalability as user base grows

- ⚠️ Synchronous file read in request handler (line 134)
  → Fix: Use async file read or cache file contents
  → Impact: Blocks other requests, reduces throughput
  → Why: Each request should be non-blocking

Optimizations:
- ✅ Proper indexing on frequently queried fields
- ✅ Caching implemented for expensive operations

Recommendations:
- Consider: Add pagination to `getAllUsers` endpoint
  → Why: Will be slow when user count exceeds 1000
```

## 7. Architecture Fit

### Pattern Consistency

**Existing Patterns:**
- Does code follow established patterns in codebase?
- Are similar problems solved similarly?
- Is the architecture style respected (MVC, Clean Architecture, etc.)?

**Project Structure:**
- Are files in correct directories?
- Does naming follow project conventions?
- Are imports organized consistently?

**Technology Choices:**
- Are the right tools used for the job?
- Are dependencies appropriate?
- Is the tech stack consistent?

### Feedback Template

```
🏗️ Architecture Fit: [Aligned/Minor Issues/Concerns]

Pattern Consistency:
- ✅ Follows existing service layer pattern
- ⚠️ Error handling inconsistent with other controllers
  → Other controllers use try/catch with centralized error handler
  → This controller returns inline error responses
  → Recommend: Use consistent error handling pattern

Structure:
- ❌ Business logic in controller (line 67-89)
  → Should be: Extracted to service layer
  → Why: Controllers should only handle HTTP concerns
  → Example: Move to `UserService.validateAndCreateUser()`

Technology:
- ⚠️ Introduced new date library (date-fns) when moment.js already in use
  → Question: Is there a reason for the new dependency?
  → Recommend: Use existing library for consistency unless justified

Impact: Inconsistencies make codebase harder to navigate and maintain
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Full PR Review

**Context:** PR adds user authentication endpoint

**Review:**

```
## Code Review: User Authentication Endpoint (#234)

**Overall Assessment:** Approve with Changes (Security issues must be fixed)

---

### ✅ Strengths
- Clean separation of concerns (controller → service → repository)
- Comprehensive unit tests for service layer
- Good error handling with appropriate status codes
- Clear, descriptive function names

---

### 🚨 Critical Issues (Must Fix Before Merge)

1. **Password Storage - Line 67** (OWASP A02: Cryptographic Failures)
   - Current: Passwords stored in plaintext
   ```javascript
   user.password = req.body.password; // ❌
   ```
   - Fix: Hash password before storing
   ```javascript
   user.password = await bcrypt.hash(req.body.password, 10);
   ```
   - Why: If database is compromised, all user passwords are exposed. This is a critical security vulnerability.

2. **SQL Injection - Line 89** (OWASP A03: Injection)
   - Current: String concatenation in query
   ```javascript
   db.query(`SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '${email}'`); // ❌
   ```
   - Fix: Use parameterized query
   ```javascript
   db.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?', [email]);
   ```
   - Why: Attackers can inject SQL commands to access or modify any data in the database.

---

### ⚠️ Important Issues (Should Fix)

1. **Missing Rate Limiting - auth.controller.js**
   - Current: No rate limiting on login endpoint
   - Recommendation: Add rate limiting middleware
   ```javascript
   router.post('/login', rateLimiter({ max: 5, windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000 }), login);
   ```
   - Why: Prevents brute force attacks on user accounts

2. **Incomplete Story Implementation - Issue #234**
   - Story AC3: "User receives email confirmation after registration"
   - Current: Email confirmation not implemented
   - Recommendation: Either implement or create follow-up ticket and note in PR

---

### 💡 Suggestions (Nice to Have)

1. **Extract Validation Logic - Line 45-62**
   - Current: Validation inline in controller (18 lines)
   - Suggestion: Extract to separate validator
   ```javascript
   const errors = validateUserRegistration(req.body);
   if (errors.length > 0) return res.status(400).json({ errors });
   ```
   - Benefit: Reusable validation, easier to test, controller stays focused

2. **Add JSDoc Comments - user.service.js**
   - Functions would benefit from parameter and return type documentation
   - Example:
   ```javascript
   /**
    * Registers a new user with the provided credentials
    * @param {Object} userData - User registration data
    * @param {string} userData.email - User's email address
    * @param {string} userData.password - User's password (will be hashed)
    * @returns {Promise<User>} Newly created user object
    * @throws {ValidationError} If email already exists
    */
   ```

---

### 📊 Metrics
- Story Alignment: ⚠️ Partial (missing AC3)
- Code Quality: 8/10 (clean structure, minor improvements possible)
- Security: 🚨 Critical Issues (2 must fix)
- Maintainability: 8/10 (well-organized, good naming)
