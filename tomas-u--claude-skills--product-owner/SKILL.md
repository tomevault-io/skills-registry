Provides comprehensive product management guidance from vision setting through execution, including backlog management, market research, competitive analysis, feature prioritization, and metrics definition.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill for:
- **Backlog management** - Writing stories, prioritizing work, grooming backlog
- **Market research** - Understanding users, competitors, and market opportunities
- **Product strategy** - Defining vision, positioning, roadmap, and growth strategy
- **Feature prioritization** - Deciding what to build next and why

## Product Owner Workflow

When working on product tasks, follow this process:

### 1. Understand Context
Before making any product decision:
- What's the product vision and strategy?
- Who are the target users?
- What stage is the product at (PMF, growth, scale)?
- What are the current goals and metrics?

### 2. Consult Relevant Reference
Load the appropriate reference based on the task:

**For Backlog Tasks:**
- Read `references/backlog-management.md` for:
  - Story writing templates and best practices
  - Prioritization frameworks (RICE, Value vs Effort)
  - Story splitting techniques
  - Refinement processes
  - Dependency management
  - Sprint planning guidance

**For Market Research:**
- Read `references/market-research.md` for:
  - User research methods (interviews, surveys)
  - Competitive analysis frameworks
  - Market sizing (TAM/SAM/SOM)
  - Trend analysis
  - Jobs-to-be-Done framework
  - Opportunity scoring

**For Strategic Planning:**
- Read `references/product-strategy.md` for:
  - Vision and positioning
  - North Star metrics
  - Roadmap horizons
  - OKR frameworks
  - Feature prioritization
  - Product-led growth strategies
  - Product lifecycle stages

### 3. Apply Product Principles

When making product decisions, consider:

**User Value First:**
- Does this solve a real user problem?
- How do we know users want this?
- What's the user's job-to-be-done?

**Strategic Alignment:**
- Does this support our product vision?
- Does it move our North Star metric?
- Is this the right thing for this stage?

**Evidence-Based:**
- What data supports this decision?
- Have we validated with users?
- What are the assumptions we're making?

**Opportunity Cost:**
- What are we NOT doing by doing this?
- Is this the highest-value use of resources?
- What's the ROI?

## Common Product Owner Tasks

### Task: Write User Stories

## Product Owner Best Practices

### Writing Effective User Stories

**Good Story Characteristics:**
- ✅ Focused on user value (not technical tasks)
- ✅ Testable (clear done criteria)
- ✅ Small enough to complete in sprint
- ✅ Independent (minimal dependencies)
- ✅ Negotiable (details can be discussed)

**Story Template:**
```
Title: [User action in plain language]

As a [specific user type]
I want to [specific action]
So that [specific benefit]

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Specific, testable criterion
- [ ] Another specific criterion
- [ ] Edge case handled

Technical Notes:
[Architecture considerations, API endpoints, data model]

Story Points: [1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
Priority: [P0-P3]
```

### Effective Prioritization

**Multi-Factor Approach:**
1. **User Value:** How much does this help users?
2. **Business Value:** Impact on key metrics?
3. **Effort:** How long to build?
4. **Risk:** What could go wrong?
5. **Dependencies:** What needs to happen first?
6. **Strategic Fit:** Aligns with vision?

**Red Flags:**
- 🚩 "Everything is P0/high priority"
- 🚩 Building features because competitors have them
- 🚩 No user validation before building
- 🚩 Ignoring technical debt indefinitely
- 🚩 Feature requests from 1 loud user

### Conducting User Research

**Interview Best Practices:**
- ✅ Ask open-ended questions
- ✅ Listen more than talk (80/20 rule)
- ✅ Probe for specifics ("Tell me more about that")
- ✅ Ask about past behavior, not hypotheticals
- ✅ Look for patterns across 5+ interviews

**Survey Best Practices:**
- ✅ Keep it short (<10 questions)
- ✅ Mix question types
- ✅ Avoid leading questions
- ✅ Test before sending widely
- ✅ Offer incentive for completion

### Managing Stakeholders

**When stakeholders request features:**
1. Understand the underlying problem
2. Ask: "What user need does this serve?"
3. Propose alternatives if needed
4. Explain prioritization transparently
5. Loop back with decisions and rationale

**When stakeholders say everything is urgent:**
1. Acknowledge their needs
2. Show capacity constraints
3. Force-rank together
4. Explain opportunity cost
5. Commit to revisiting priorities regularly

## Product Stage-Specific Guidance

### Stage 2: PMF (Product-Market Fit)

**Focus:** Build something people love
**Activities:**
- Launch MVP to early adopters
- Measure engagement and retention
- Find repeatable acquisition
- Iterate based on data

**Success Metric:** 40%+ retention, organic growth
**Avoid:** Premature scaling

### Stage 3: Growth

**Focus:** Scale efficiently
**Activities:**
- Optimize conversion funnel
- Expand to adjacent markets

- Platform strategy
- Innovation pipeline

**Success Metric:** Market leadership, healthy margins
**Avoid:** Complacency, ignoring disruption

## Decision-Making Framework

When making product decisions, ask:

**1. User Impact**
- How many users does this affect?
- How significantly does it improve their experience?
- Have we validated this with users?

**2. Business Impact**
- Does this move our North Star metric?
- What's the expected ROI?
- Does it help with acquisition, retention, or monetization?

**3. Strategic Fit**
- Aligns with product vision?
- Supports our differentiation?
- Right for our current stage?

**4. Feasibility**
- Do we have the capability?
- What's the effort required?
- What are the risks?

**5. Timing**
- Is now the right time?
- What's the opportunity cost?
- Can this wait?

**Make the call when:**
- 4/5 factors are positive, or
- Strategic fit + user impact are very strong
