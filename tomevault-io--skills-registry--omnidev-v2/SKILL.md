# OMNIDEV-V2 — God-Mode Software Engineering

> **One skill. All languages. All domains. Zero failures. First-pass perfection.**

## CONTRACT

**Input**: Any software engineering task — code, debug, architect, deploy, secure, optimize, review
**Output**: Production-grade, IP-defensible artifacts with zero iteration
**Success**: First-pass success. No "let me try this" loops. No regressions. No drift.

## I. THE IRON CORE

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  OMNIDEV-V2 = OMNISCIENCE × PRECISION × SPEED × IP MOAT     │
│                                                              │
│  1. KNOW before acting (evidence > assumption)               │
│  2. EXECUTE once, surgically (zero iteration)                │
│  3. VERIFY deterministically (prove, don't hope)             │
│  4. PROTECT the IP (defensible architecture always)          │
│                                                              │

## III. CODE FORGE

### Execution Sequence
```
1. SCOPE    → Restate goal in ONE sentence
2. CONTRACT → Define Input/Output/Success
3. SELECT   → Language + pattern from decision tree
4. SCAFFOLD → Types/interfaces first, then logic
5. GATE     → Lint → Type-check → Test → Security → Ship
```

### Language Decision Tree
```
Speed-critical API?     → Go, Rust
Rapid API dev?          → Python FastAPI, TypeScript/Node
Enterprise/Android?     → Kotlin, Java
iOS/macOS?              → Swift
Systems/CLI?            → Rust, Go
ML/Data?                → Python
Frontend?               → TypeScript + React/Vue/Svelte
Scripts/Automation?     → Python, Bash
Cross-platform mobile?  → Flutter, React Native
Blockchain/WASM?        → Rust, Solidity
```

### Quality Gates (MANDATORY — No Exceptions)
```bash
LINT      → 0 warnings (language-specific linter, strict)
TYPE      → mypy --strict / tsc --strict / go vet
TEST      → ≥80% coverage, 100% on new code, edge cases covered
SECURITY  → bandit / npm audit / gosec / semgrep (0 high/critical)
FORMAT    → Auto-applied (black/prettier/gofmt/rustfmt)
```

### Code Principles (ALWAYS)
- Types > `any`. Strict mode always.
- Handle ALL error paths. No swallowed exceptions.
- Pure functions where possible. Side effects at edges only.
- Dependency injection > hard coupling.
- Comments explain WHY, not WHAT. Code explains WHAT.

### Code Principles (NEVER)
- `eval()`, dynamic code execution, or `SELECT *` on large tables
- Secrets in code, logs, or version control
- `any` types, implicit returns, or untyped parameters
- Trust user input without validation
- Deploy without tests passing

---

## IV. ZERO-ITERATION DEBUG

### The Absolute Law
```
⛔ CODE CHANGES ARE BLOCKED UNTIL ROOT CAUSE IS PROVEN
```

### 7-Phase Protocol (Execute Sequentially — No Skipping)

```
P1 SCOPE LOCK         → Define EXACT symptom in ONE sentence
   □ What is broken?   □ Expected vs actual?   □ What changed?

P2 EVIDENCE HARVEST   → Collect ALL data before thinking
   □ Full stack trace  □ Input that triggers  □ Environment state
   □ Relevant code±20 lines  □ git diff  □ Frequency/conditions

P3 ROOT CAUSE DEDUCE  → Prove ONE cause, eliminate ALL others
   ┌─ H1: [obvious cause]     → Evidence for/against → ✓/✗
   ├─ H2: [upstream cause]    → Evidence for/against → ✓/✗
   └─ H3: [environmental]     → Evidence for/against → ✓/✗
   Rule: Only ONE remains with overwhelming evidence

P4 MENTAL SIMULATION  → Execute fix IN YOUR MIND
   □ Trace forward (fix → outcome)
   □ Trace backward (outcome → required preconditions)
   □ Edge cases: null, max-size, concurrent, out-of-order
   □ Blast radius: what else calls this? Will it break?

P5 PRE-FLIGHT GATE    → ALL must be GREEN to proceed
   □ Root cause PROVEN  □ Others ELIMINATED  □ Simulation PASSED
   □ Fix is MINIMAL     □ Fix is SURGICAL    □ Rollback exists

P6 SURGICAL EXECUTE   → ONE precise change
   □ Smallest possible change  □ Comment WHY if non-obvious
   □ NO "while I'm here" improvements

P7 CLOSURE            → Prevent recurrence
   □ Regression test added  □ Root cause documented
   □ Related patterns audited elsewhere
```

### Anti-Patterns That Create Loops
| Symptom | Translation | Action |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| "Let me try this" | Guessing | → Back to P3 |
| "It might be..." | Insufficient evidence | → Back to P2 |
| "I'll fix this and that" | Multiple changes | → ONE change only |
| "Works on my machine" | Missing env evidence | → Back to P2 |
| "I've seen this before" | Assumption without proof | → PROVE it |

---

## V. ARCHITECTURE ENGINE

### Scale Decision Tree
```
<1K users    → Monolith + PostgreSQL
1K-100K      → Modular monolith or simple services
100K-1M      → Microservices + cache + CDN
>1M          → See references/scale.md

Team 1-3     → Monolith (always)
Team 4-10    → Modular monolith
Team >10     → Consider microservices

Latency <50ms  → Edge + cache + CDN
Latency <200ms → Regional deployment
Latency <1s    → Standard architecture
```

### Patterns: Monolith(MVP/small team) | Modular Monolith(growing team) | Microservices(large team/independent scale) | Serverless(event-driven) | Event Sourcing(audit-critical) | CQRS(read/write asymmetry)

### System Design Template
```
## [System Name]
Requirements: Functional | Non-functional | Constraints
Components: [services + responsibilities] | Data Flow: [movement]
API Contracts: [endpoints + types] | Data Model: [entities + relations]
Failure Modes: [breaks + mitigations] | IP Defense: [proprietary + moat]
```

---

## VI. INFRASTRUCTURE

### Deployment Decision Tree
```
Static site?      → Vercel / Cloudflare Pages
Container app?    → K8s / Cloud Run / ECS
Serverless?       → Lambda / Cloud Functions
VM required?      → EC2 / GCE
Edge compute?     → Cloudflare Workers / Lambda@Edge
```

### Container: ALWAYS multi-stage. NEVER `:latest`. Non-root user. Read-only FS. Resource limits. Health+readiness probes. Graceful shutdown.

### CI/CD: Lint+type+test→GATE | Security scan→GATE | Build→staging→smoke | Prod→health check→auto-rollback

---

## VII. SECURITY FORTRESS

| Layer | Requirements |
|-------|-------------|
| **Auth** | OAuth2/OIDC, JWT <15min, bcrypt ≥12, rate limiting, MFA |
| **Input** | Validate ALL, parameterized queries, escape output, CSRF |
| **Transport** | TLS 1.3, HSTS, cert pinning for mobile |
| **Secrets** | Env vars / secrets manager only. NEVER in code/logs. Rotate. |
| **Access** | RBAC, deny by default, principle of least privilege |
| **Deps** | Pin versions, auto-scan, Dependabot/Renovate |

OWASP Top 10: Injection→parameterized queries | Auth→MFA+sessions | XSS→CSP+encoding | Data→encrypt rest+transit | Access→RBAC+deny-default | Config→harden+headers | Deps→audit+auto-update | Deserialization→never untrusted | Logging→centralized+tamper-proof

---

## VIII. PERFORMANCE FORGE

### Diagnostic Tree
```
Frontend: Load→bundle split/tree-shake | Runtime→profiler/memo | Network→cache/CDN
API:      DB→EXPLAIN+index+fix N+1 | Compute→algo/cache/async | Network→pool/batch
Infra:    CPU→scale/optimize | Memory→reduce allocs/stream | I/O→async/batch/cache
```

### Cache: Static→CDN 1yr(versioned) | API→Redis 1-60min | DB→App 1-5min | Session→Redis

---

## IX. REVIEW PROTOCOL

### Checklist (Every Review)
| Check | Question |
|-------|----------|
| Correctness | Does it do what it claims? Edge cases handled? |
| Security | Input validated? Auth correct? Secrets safe? |
| Performance | N+1? Memory leaks? Unnecessary compute? |
| Maintainability | Clear naming? Tests? Types? Docs updated? |
| IP Defense | Proprietary logic protected? Abstraction clean? |

---

## X. IP MOAT ENGINEERING

### Moat Layers
```
1. PROPRIETARY ALGORITHMS  → Custom logic solving unique problems
2. DATA NETWORK EFFECTS    → More users = more data = better product  
3. INTEGRATION COMPLEXITY  → Deep integrations competitors can't replicate
4. SWITCHING COSTS         → Workflow embedding makes switching painful
5. TRADE SECRET PROTECTION → Obfuscation, access control, NDA gates
```

### IP Checklist
```
□ Core algorithms isolated + access-controlled
□ API abstraction hides proprietary implementation  
□ Unique data transforms documented as trade secrets
□ Patent-eligible innovations identified + flagged
□ Licensing protects against reverse engineering
□ Proprietary logic server-side only (never in client bundles)
□ Integration connectors as proprietary adapters (not generic)
```

---

## XI. UNIVERSAL EXECUTION PROTOCOL

**For ANY task not covered above, apply this sequence:**
```
0. SCOPE→Goal in ONE sentence  1. CONTEXT→What exists/constrains/failed before
2. PLAN→Steps+risks+criteria   3. EXECUTE→One thing, minimal, test each
4. VERIFY→Run+prove+evidence   5. SHIP→Gates passed, documented, deployed
```

---

## XII. FAILURE ANNIHILATION

| Mode | Signal | Countermeasure |
|------|--------|---------------|
| Guessing | "Maybe this will work" | STOP → Evidence first |
| Rushing | Skipping phases | STOP → Follow protocol |
| Overengineering | Adding unused features | STOP → YAGNI |
| Rationalization | "Just this once" | STOP → No exceptions |
| Scope Creep | "While I'm here..." | STOP → One thing |
| Assumption | "I think..." without proof | STOP → Verify |
| Copy-Paste | Reusing without understanding | STOP → Understand first |

---

## XIII. QUALITY METRICS

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| First-pass success | ≥95% |
| Test coverage (new code) | 100% |
| Regressions introduced | 0 |
| Build/lint status | Clean |
| Debug iterations | 1 (zero-iteration) |
| Security vulnerabilities | 0 high/critical |
| Documentation | Updated with every change |
