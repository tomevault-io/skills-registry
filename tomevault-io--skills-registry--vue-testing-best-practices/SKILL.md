Vue.js testing best practices, patterns, and common gotchas.

### E2E Selector Stability
- Prefer `data-testid` selectors for critical flows instead of visible-text selectors that depend on locale or UI copy.
- Add markers in Vue components as part of feature work when a flow lacks stable hooks for Playwright.
- Keep selector ids semantic and consistent across specs; centralize reused ids in a shared selector map (for this repo: `e2e/support/selectors.ts`).

### Testing
- Setting up test infrastructure for Vue 3 projects -> See [testing-vitest-recommended-for-vue](reference/testing-vitest-recommended-for-vue.md)
- Tests keep breaking when refactoring component internals -> See [testing-component-blackbox-approach](reference/testing-component-blackbox-approach.md)
- Tests fail intermittently with race conditions -> See [testing-async-await-flushpromises](reference/testing-async-await-flushpromises.md)
- Composables using lifecycle hooks or inject fail to test -> See [testing-composables-helper-wrapper](reference/testing-composables-helper-wrapper.md)
- Getting "injection Symbol(pinia) not found" errors in tests -> See [testing-pinia-store-setup](reference/testing-pinia-store-setup.md)
- Components with async setup won't render in tests -> See [testing-suspense-async-components](reference/testing-suspense-async-components.md)
- Snapshot tests keep passing despite broken functionality -> See [testing-no-snapshot-only](reference/testing-no-snapshot-only.md)
- Choosing end-to-end testing framework for Vue apps -> See [testing-e2e-playwright-recommended](reference/testing-e2e-playwright-recommended.md)
- Tests need to verify computed styles or real DOM events -> See [testing-browser-vs-node-runners](reference/testing-browser-vs-node-runners.md)
- Testing components created with defineAsyncComponent fails -> See [async-component-testing](reference/async-component-testing.md)
- Teleported modal content can't be found in wrapper queries -> See [teleport-testing-complexity](reference/teleport-testing-complexity.md)
