# UI/UX Research Skill

Research UI patterns, design systems, and user experience across codebases.

## When to Use

- Analyzing UI patterns across large codebases
- Comparing design system implementations
- Auditing UI consistency
- Understanding existing patterns before implementation

## Research Patterns

### Find All UI Components

```
Analyze the components directory.
List all UI components with their props interfaces.
```

### Audit Design System Consistency

```
Check design token usage consistency:
- Colors
- Spacing
- Typography

Identify inconsistencies and suggest consolidation.
```

### Compare UI Implementations

```
Compare layout patterns across pages.
Identify inconsistencies and recommend standardization.
```

### Accessibility Audit

```
Audit components for WCAG compliance:
- Color contrast
- ARIA labels
- Keyboard navigation

Prioritize issues by severity.
```

### Responsive Design Review

```
Find all responsive breakpoints and media queries.
Assess mobile-first compliance.
Identify missing responsive considerations.
```

## Pattern Search Template

```
Has [PATTERN] been implemented?

Show:
1. Files containing the pattern
2. Implementation approach
3. Consistency across usages
4. Potential improvements
```

**Common patterns to search:**

- Dark mode toggle
- Form validation
- Loading states
- Error boundaries
- Toast notifications
- Modal dialogs
- Data tables

## Integration with Beads

For task-constrained research:

1. Check bead spec constraints
2. Research within those constraints
3. Save findings to bead artifacts

## Storage

Save research findings to `.opencode/memory/design/research/`

## Output Format

```markdown
## Research: [Topic]

### Findings

[Key discoveries]

### Current Implementation

[What exists]

### Recommendations

[What to improve]

### Next Steps

[Actionable items]
```
