# Skill: Web Search (Tavily)

Search the public internet via Tavily API and return structured results for synthesis.

**Applicable scenarios:**
- Current events, breaking news, recent announcements
- Real-time data: weather, stock prices, sports scores, exchange rates
- Product research, technical documentation, third-party references
- Any fact that may be outdated in the model's training data

---

## Execution

**Command format (strictly follow — do not modify):**
```bash
python <DEEPAGENTFORCE_ROOT>/src/services/skills/web-search/scripts/web_search.py "<搜索词>" [--max-results N] [--output file.json]
```

**How to determine `<DEEPAGENTFORCE_ROOT>`:**

`<DEEPAGENTFORCE_ROOT>` is the **absolute path to the DeepAgentForce project root** on the current host.
Resolve it at runtime before executing:
```bash
find / -type d -name "DeepAgentForce" 2>/dev/null | head -1
# Example result: /home/user/projects/DeepAgentForce
```

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `query` | ✅ | — | Search query, wrapped in double quotes |
| `--max-results` | ❌ | 5 | Number of results to return (suggested: 5–10) |
| `--output` | ❌ | — | Save full JSON response to a file |

**Examples:**

✅ Basic search:
```bash
python /home/user/projects/DeepAgentForce/src/services/skills/web-search/scripts/web_search.py "2024年诺贝尔奖得主"
```

✅ More results:
```bash
python /home/user/projects/DeepAgentForce/src/services/skills/web-search/scripts/web_search.py "latest React 19 features" --max-results 10
```

✅ Save to file:
```bash
python /home/user/projects/DeepAgentForce/src/services/skills/web-search/scripts/web_search.py "machine learning trends 2025" --output results.json
```

❌ Relative path (`src/services/...`) → execution will fail  
❌ Missing quotes around query with spaces → argument parsing error  
❌ Using this skill for internal HR/policy questions → use `rag-query` instead

## Output Format

The script outputs structured JSON to stdout:
```json
{
  "query": "搜索词",
  "total_results": 5,
  "results": [
    {
      "title": "页面标题",
      "url": "https://...",
      "snippet": "摘要内容（最多500字符）"
    }
  ]
}
```

Parse this output to synthesize a final answer for the user. Do not return raw JSON directly.
