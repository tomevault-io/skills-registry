# CLAUDE.md Doctor

Diagnose, evaluate, and repair CLAUDE.md files and `.claude/rules/` across a codebase to ensure optimal Claude Code project context.

## Capabilities

- **Audit** CLAUDE.md files for quality, staleness, and anti-patterns
- **Evaluate** `.claude/rules/` for modularity, frontmatter correctness, and focus
- **Diagnose** common issues: verbosity, staleness, broken commands, vague instructions
- **Recommend** targeted fixes with severity ratings
- **Apply** approved changes to improve project instructions

---

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Discovery

Scan for all project instruction files:

```bash
# Find CLAUDE.md files
find . -name "CLAUDE.md" -o -name ".claude.md" -o -name ".claude.local.md" 2>/dev/null | head -50

# Find rule files
find .claude/rules -name "*.md" 2>/dev/null | head -50

# Check for global files
ls -la ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md ~/.claude/rules/*.md 2>/dev/null
```

**File Locations & Purpose:**

| Type | Location | Scope | Git |
|------|----------|-------|-----|
| Project root | `./CLAUDE.md` | Primary project context | ✓ Shared |
| Local overrides | `./.claude.local.md` | Personal settings | ✗ Gitignored |
| Global defaults | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | User-wide defaults | N/A |
| Modular rules | `./.claude/rules/*.md` | Topic-specific rules | ✓ Shared |
| Package-specific | `./packages/*/CLAUDE.md` | Module context | ✓ Shared |

### Phase 2: Quality Assessment

For each file, evaluate against criteria. See:
- [references/quality-criteria.md](references/quality-criteria.md) for CLAUDE.md scoring
- [references/rules-criteria.md](references/rules-criteria.md) for .claude/rules/ scoring

**Quick Diagnostic Checklist:**

| Check | Severity | What to Look For |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| Commands documented | High | Build/test/lint commands with exact syntax |
| Architecture clarity | High | Directory structure, key files, entry points |
| Token efficiency | High | File under 300 lines, no verbose explanations |
| Actionability | High | Copy-paste ready commands, no vague language |
| Currency | High | Commands work, paths exist, tech stack current |
| Gotchas captured | Medium | Non-obvious patterns, quirks, warnings |
| Rule modularity | Medium | Rules split by topic, not one monolithic file |
| Frontmatter correct | Medium | Only `paths` in rules, no Cursor-specific fields |

### Phase 3: Diagnostic Report

**ALWAYS output a diagnostic report BEFORE making any changes.**

Format:

```
## CLAUDE.md Health Report

### Summary
- Files scanned: X CLAUDE.md, Y rules
- Overall health: Good/Fair/Poor
- Critical issues: X
- Warnings: X
- Files needing attention: X

### Critical Issues (Fix Now)

#### 1. [Issue Name] — Severity: Critical
**File:** `./CLAUDE.md`
**Problem:** [What's wrong]
**Evidence:** [Specific example from the file]
**Fix:** [Exact change to make]

### Warnings (Should Fix)

#### 2. [Issue Name] — Severity: Warning
...

### Suggestions (Nice to Have)

#### 3. [Issue Name] — Severity: Low
...

### File-by-File Scores

| File | Score | Grade | Status |
|------|-------|-------|--------|
| ./CLAUDE.md | 75/100 | B | Needs work |
| .claude/rules/security.md | 90/100 | A | Good |
```

### Phase 4: Interactive Triage

After the report, ask user how to proceed:

```
header: "Action"
question: "How should I proceed with the diagnosed issues?"
options:
  - label: "Fix All (Recommended)"
    description: "Apply all recommended fixes automatically"
  - label: "Fix Critical Only"
    description: "Only fix critical issues, skip warnings"
  - label: "Review Each"
    description: "Show each fix for individual approval"
  - label: "Report Only"
    description: "Don't make any changes"
```

### Phase 5: Apply Fixes

For each approved fix:

1. **Show the diff** before applying
2. **Explain why** this helps future Claude sessions
3. **Apply with Edit tool**, preserving existing structure
4. **Verify** the file is still valid markdown

---

## Severity Classification

| Severity | Criteria | Examples |
|----------|----------|----------|
| **Critical** | Actively harms Claude sessions | Broken commands, wrong paths, missing essential context |
| **Warning** | Reduces effectiveness | Verbose explanations, outdated info, missing gotchas |
| **Low** | Minor improvement | Formatting, organization, optional sections |

---

## Common Issues Detected

### Critical Issues

1. **Broken Commands** — Commands that would fail if run
2. **Missing Essential Commands** — No build/test/lint documented
3. **Non-existent Paths** — References to files/dirs that don't exist
4. **Wrong Frontmatter** — Using `alwaysApply`, `description` in rules (Cursor-only)
5. **Severely Outdated** — Major tech stack changes not reflected

### Warnings

1. **Verbose Explanations** — More than 2-3 lines explaining a concept
2. **Generic Advice** — Best practices not specific to this project
3. **Token Bloat** — CLAUDE.md over 300 lines
4. **Stale Commands** — Commands work but options/flags outdated
5. **Missing Gotchas** — Non-obvious patterns not documented
6. **Monolithic Rules** — All rules in one file instead of split by topic
7. **Duplicate Content** — Same info in CLAUDE.md and rules

### Low Priority

1. **Formatting Inconsistency** — Mixed heading styles, tables vs lists
2. **Missing Optional Sections** — Environment, testing patterns
3. **Suboptimal Organization** — Sections in non-logical order

---

## Anti-Patterns Reference

See [references/anti-patterns.md](references/anti-patterns.md) for detailed examples of what to avoid.

---

## Templates Reference

See [references/templates.md](references/templates.md) for CLAUDE.md and rules templates by project type.

---

## Rules-Specific Guidance

### Valid Rules Frontmatter

Rules support ONLY the `paths` field:

```yaml
---
paths: src/**/*.ts
---
```

or multiple patterns:

```yaml
---
paths:
  - src/**/*.ts
  - lib/**/*.ts
---
```

**Invalid (Cursor-specific, will be ignored):**
- `alwaysApply`
- `description`
- `name`
- `tools`

Rules without `paths` frontmatter apply to ALL files.

### Ideal Rule File

- Focus on ONE topic (security, testing, code-style, etc.)
- 50-150 lines
- Clear heading describing the topic
- Bullet points for easy scanning
- Actionable, not vague

---

## Validation Commands

After making changes, suggest verification:

```bash
# Check CLAUDE.md syntax
cat ./CLAUDE.md | head -100

# Verify commands work
npm run build --help 2>&1 | head -5
npm test --help 2>&1 | head -5

# Check paths exist
ls -la src/ tests/ 2>/dev/null

# Count lines (target: under 300)
wc -l ./CLAUDE.md
```

---

## User Tips to Share

When presenting recommendations:

- **Keep it concise**: CLAUDE.md is injected into every prompt; brevity matters
- **Use `.claude/rules/`**: Split large CLAUDE.md into topic-specific rules
- **Use `@imports`**: Reference detailed docs with `@path/to/file` instead of inlining
- **Use `.claude.local.md`**: For personal preferences not shared with team
- **Global defaults**: Put user-wide preferences in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`
- **Emphasis sparingly**: IMPORTANT, NEVER, ALWAYS only for critical rules
- **Verification criteria**: Include commands/tests so Claude can check its own work
