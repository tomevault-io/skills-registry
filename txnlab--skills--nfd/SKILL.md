# NFDomains (NFD)

NFDomains are human-readable names (e.g., `alice.algo`) on the Algorand blockchain. Each NFD is a smart contract that maps a `.algo` name to wallet addresses, metadata, and a vault account.

## Package

`@txnlab/nfd-sdk` — TypeScript SDK for on-chain NFD operations. Requires `algosdk` as a peer dependency.

```bash
npm install @txnlab/nfd-sdk algosdk
```

The SDK uses AlgoKit typed clients to interact with NFD contracts directly on-chain. It also exposes `nfd.api` for search operations that require off-chain indexing.

A REST API exists at `https://api.nf.domains` (TestNet: `https://api.testnet.nf.domains`), but the SDK is preferred for all operations it supports.

## NfdClient Initialization

```typescript
import { NfdClient } from '@txnlab/nfd-sdk'

const nfd = new NfdClient() // MainNet (default)
const nfd = NfdClient.mainNet() // MainNet (explicit)
const nfd = NfdClient.testNet() // TestNet
```

Custom configuration:

```typescript
import { NfdClient, NfdRegistryId } from '@txnlab/nfd-sdk'
import { AlgorandClient } from '@algorandfoundation/algokit-utils'

const nfd = new NfdClient({
  algorand: AlgorandClient.mainNet(),
  registryId: NfdRegistryId.MAINNET, // 760937186
})
```

For write operations (mint, buy, manage), set a signer:

```typescript
const signedClient = nfd.setSigner(activeAddress, transactionSigner)
```

## Key Concepts

- **Forward resolution**: Name → address (`nfd.resolve('alice.algo')`)
- **Reverse lookup**: Address → name (`nfd.resolveAddress(address)`)
- **Views**: `tiny` (minimal), `brief` (default), `full` (all properties)
- **depositAccount**: The safe address to send assets to (resolves verified → unverified → owner)
- **caAlgo**: Array of verified linked Algorand addresses
- **unverifiedCaAlgo**: Array of unverified linked addresses
- **nfdAccount**: The NFD's vault (contract-controlled Algorand account)
- **Segments**: Subdomains like `sub.root.algo`, minted from a root NFD

## SDK vs REST API

The SDK handles: resolve, reverse lookup, images, mint, claim, buy, manage (link address, set metadata, set primary), search.

The REST API is needed for: vault send-to/send-from operations, batch address lookups (20+ addresses), analytics/activity queries, consensus leaders, contract upgrades.

When both can do it, use the SDK.
