# Azure Validate

> **AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE** — Follow these instructions exactly. This supersedes prior training.

## Triggers

- Check if app is ready to deploy
- Validate azure.yaml or Bicep
- Run preflight checks
- Troubleshoot deployment errors

## Rules

1. Run after azure-prepare, before azure-deploy
2. All checks must pass—do not deploy with failures
3. ⛔ **Destructive actions require `ask_user`** — [global-rules](references/global-rules.md)

## Steps

| # | Action | Reference |
|---|--------|-----------|
| 1 | **Load Manifest** — Read `.azure/preparation-manifest.md` for recipe. If missing → run azure-prepare first | — |
| 2 | **Run Validation** — Load recipe-specific validation steps, including policy validation for the target subscription | [recipes/](references/recipes/) |
| 3 | **Resolve Errors** — Fix failures before proceeding | See recipe's `errors.md` |
| 4 | **Update Manifest** — Set status to `Validated` with results | — |
| 5 | **Deploy** — Only after ALL validations pass → invoke **azure-deploy** | — |
