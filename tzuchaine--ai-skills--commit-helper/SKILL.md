# Commit Helper

## Overview

This skill helps create well-structured atomic commits by analyzing all code changes and intelligently splitting them into multiple logical commits. Each commit should be focused, related, and follow best practices.

## When to Use

- When users request "commit my changes", "commit code", or similar requests
- When there are multiple unrelated changes in the working directory

## Workflow

Execute the following steps in order:

### Step 1: Analyze Changes

1. Run `git status` to view all changed files
2. Run `git diff` to understand the nature of changes
3. Analyze changes to identify:
   - Which files belong to the same module/directory
   - Which files implement the same functionality
   - What type of change each file represents (feat, fix, refactor, docs, etc.)
   - Dependencies between files

### Step 2: Group Changes

Split changes into multiple logical commits based on the following criteria:

**Primary Grouping Criteria:**
- **Functional cohesion**: Files implementing the same functionality or solving the same problem are grouped together
- **Change type**: Separate different types (feat, fix, refactor, docs, test, chore) into different commits when possible

**Grouping Rules:**
- Each commit should represent one logical change
- Related files (even in different directories) that implement one functionality should be in the same commit
- Bug fixes should be separate from new features
- Refactoring should be separate from feature additions
- Test files should be grouped with the code they test
- Documentation updates can be committed separately unless directly related to a specific feature

**Grouping Examples:**
```
Commit 1 (feat): User Authentication
  - src/auth/login.ts
  - src/auth/middleware.ts
  - src/routes/auth.ts
  - tests/auth.test.ts

Commit 2 (fix): Profile validation bug
  - src/user/profile.ts
  - tests/user.test.ts

Commit 3 (refactor): Error handling
  - src/utils/errors.ts
  - src/middleware/errorHandler.ts
  - Multiple files using the new error handling
```

### Step 3: Generate Commit Messages

Generate commit messages following **Conventional Commits** specification for each commit group:

**Format:**
```
type(scope): brief description

Detailed explanation of why this change was made.
What problem was solved? What was the previous behavior?
How does this change improve the codebase?
```

**Type Options:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `refactor`: Refactoring code without changing functionality
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks (dependencies, configs, etc.)
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `style`: Code style/formatting changes
- `ci`: CI/CD changes

**Scope Examples:**
- Module names: `auth`, `user`, `api`, `database`
- Component names: `LoginForm`, `ProfilePage`
- Domains: `validation`, `error-handling`, `logging`

**Message Guidelines:**
- Subject line (first line): Max 72 characters, use imperative mood ("add" not "added")
- Body: Explain why, not what (the diff shows what)
- Body should be 2-4 sentences providing context
- Leave a blank line between subject and body

**Example:**
```
feat(auth): add JWT-based authentication system

Implemented complete authentication system using JWT tokens to replace
the previous session-based approach. This provides better scalability
for our API and supports stateless authentication across multiple servers.
```

### Step 4: Present Plan to User

Display the proposed commit plan in this format:

```
🔍 Analyzed X files with changes

💡 Proposed commit plan:

【Commit 1/N】type(scope): description
  Files:
  ├─ path/to/file1.ts
  ├─ path/to/file2.ts
  └─ path/to/file3.ts

  Commit message:
  type(scope): brief description

  Detailed body explaining why...

【Commit 2/N】type(scope): description
  Files:
  ├─ path/to/file4.ts
  └─ path/to/file5.ts

  Commit message:
  type(scope): brief description

  Detailed body explaining why...

---
⚠️  Next: Code quality checks (linter + type checking)

Do you approve this commit plan? (yes/no/adjust)
```

Use the AskUserQuestion tool to wait for user confirmation before continuing.

### Step 5: Run Code Quality Checks

Before committing, run these checks:

1. **Linter Check**:
   - Try to detect the project's linter (eslint, prettier, ruff, etc.)
   - Run the appropriate lint command
   - Common commands: `npm run lint`, `eslint .`, `prettier --check .`

2. **Type Check** (if applicable):
   - For TypeScript: `tsc --noEmit` or `npm run type-check`
   - For Python: `mypy .` or similar tools
   - For other languages: appropriate type checkers

**If checks fail:**
- Clearly display errors
- Use AskUserQuestion to ask: "Code quality checks failed. Do you want to: 1) Fix issues and retry, 2) Commit anyway, 3) Cancel"
- Respect the user's choice

**If checks pass:**
- Notify user and proceed to commit

### Step 6: Execute Commits

For each commit group in the plan:

1. Stage only the files for this commit:
   ```bash
   git add file1 file2 file3
   ```

2. Create commit with the generated message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
   type(scope): brief description

   Detailed body explaining the change and its rationale.
   Additional context if needed.
   EOF
   )"
   ```

3. Verify the commit was created successfully

**Important Rules:**
- Execute commits sequentially, not in parallel
- After each commit, confirm it succeeded before proceeding to the next
- Do not automatically push to remote - only create local commits
- Do not use `git add -A` or `git add .` - selectively stage files for each commit

### Step 7: Summary

After creating all commits, display a summary:

```
✅ Successfully created N commits:

1. abc1234 - feat(auth): add JWT authentication
2. def5678 - fix(user): fix profile validation
3. ghi9012 - refactor(api): improve error handling

All changes committed locally.
Use 'git push' to push to remote when ready.
```

## Important Notes

- **Never auto-push**: Always commit locally only, let users manually push
- **Atomic commits**: Each commit should be independently buildable and testable
- **Clear messages**: Focus on why in the commit body, not what
- **User control**: Always show plan and get approval before executing
- **Quality first**: Run checks before committing, but respect user's decision
- **Don't mix**: Don't mix refactoring with features, or fixes with new features

## Example Session

```
User: Please commit my code

Claude: 🔍 Analyzing code changes...

[Runs git status and git diff]

🔍 Analyzed 8 files with changes

💡 Proposed commit plan (3 commits):

【Commit 1/3】feat(auth): implement user login system
  Files:
  ├─ src/auth/login.ts (new file)

## Advanced Scenarios

### Handling Large Change Sets

If more than 20 files changed:
- Group more aggressively by top-level modules
- Limit to maximum 5 commits for readability
- Prioritize logical grouping over perfect atomicity

### Mixed Changes in Single File

If a single file has multiple unrelated changes:
- Notify user that the file has mixed changes
- Suggest using `git add -p` for partial staging if appropriate
- Group the entire file with the most significant change

### Configuration Files

For package.json, package-lock.json, poetry.lock, etc.:
- Group with the commit that requires the dependency change
- If it's a standalone dependency update, create a separate `chore(deps)` commit

### Generated Files

For build output, compiled files:
- Warn user that these might not should be committed
- Ask if they want to exclude them
- Respect .gitignore patterns

## Error Handling

### No Changes Detected
```
ℹ️  No changes detected in working directory.
Nothing to commit, working tree clean.
```

### All Files Already Staged
```
ℹ️  All changes are already staged.
Do you want to continue with the current staging area, or reset and let
me reorganize commits? (continue/reorganize)
```

### Commit Failed
```
❌ Failed to create commit: [error message]

This might be due to:
- Pre-commit hook rejected the commit
- Invalid file permissions
- Git configuration issue

Please resolve the issue and try again.
```

## Tips for Users

- Run this skill regularly to maintain clean commit history
- The more detailed your code comments, the better the commit messages
- Review the plan carefully - adjust grouping if needed
- Keep working directory focused on related changes for best results
