# Developer Meeting Followup Skill

This skill helps you systematically work through developer meeting notes from the UCEAP/.github-private wiki to identify and resolve unresolved followup items.

## Overview

Work through meeting notes listed on the wiki Home page in chronological order (oldest to newest), checking for unresolved action items and helping resolve them.

## Important Criteria

**Only consider unchecked checkboxes as followup items.** Do not treat general discussion topics or questions without explicit checkbox action items as followup items.

## Prerequisites

1. Clone the wiki repository if not already available:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/UCEAP/.github-private.wiki.git /tmp/github-private-wiki
   ```

2. If the repository is already cloned, ensure it is up to date:
   ```bash
   cd /tmp/github-private-wiki
   git pull
   ```

3. Ensure you have access to:
   - GitHub CLI (authenticated)
   - Jira API credentials (check environment variables: JIRA_BASE_URL, JIRA_EMAIL, JIRA_API_TOKEN, JIRA_PROJECT_KEY)

## Workflow

For each meeting listed on the wiki Home page (starting with the oldest):

### 1. Read the Meeting Notes

Read the meeting agenda file to identify any unchecked checkboxes (`- [ ]`).

### 2. Review Each Unchecked Item

For each unchecked checkbox:
1. Present the item to the user
2. Ask if it has been resolved externally
3. If not resolved, help resolve it:
   - If it requires creating Jira tickets, create them using the Jira REST API
   - If it requires other actions, work with the user to complete them

### 3. Create Jira Tickets (if needed)

When creating Jira tickets:
- **Project**: Use WEBP4 for website issues, or ask user which project to use
- **Issue Type**: Task (unless specified otherwise)
- **Labels/Components**: DO NOT use labels or components
- **Linking**: Link related tickets using the "Relates" link type
- **Description**: Include context and link back to the meeting notes

Example API call:
```bash
curl -s -X POST "${JIRA_BASE_URL}/rest/api/3/issue" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -u "${JIRA_EMAIL}:${JIRA_API_TOKEN}" \
  -d '{
    "fields": {
      "project": {"key": "WEBP4"},
      "summary": "Task summary",
      "description": {
        "type": "doc",
        "version": 1,
        "content": [{"type": "paragraph", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Description here"}]}]
      },
      "issuetype": {"name": "Task"}
    }
  }'
```

### 4. Update the Meeting Notes

After resolving an item:
1. Mark the checkbox as complete: `- [x]`
2. Add ticket references if applicable: `([WEBP4-123](https://uceapit.atlassian.net/browse/WEBP4-123))`

### 5. Update the Home Page

Once all unchecked items in a meeting are resolved:
1. Remove that meeting's link from the Home page
2. The oldest unresolved meeting should remain at the bottom of the list (just above "Previous meetings")

### 6. Commit and Push Changes

Make **separate commits** for:
1. Meeting agenda updates (e.g., "Mark excessive revisions action items as complete (WEBP4-988, WEBP4-989)")
2. Home page updates (e.g., "Remove resolved Developer Meeting Agenda 2025-09-16 from home page")

Then push all commits to GitHub:
```bash
cd /tmp/github-private-wiki
git add <files>
git commit -m "message"
git push
```

### 7. Move to Next Meeting

Repeat the process for the next oldest meeting on the Home page.

### 8. Create New Meeting Agenda (when all meetings are resolved)

When there are no meetings remaining with open action items:

1. **Determine the next meeting date**: Find the next Tuesday or Thursday from today's date, whichever is sooner
2. **Read the template**: Get the template content from the markdown code block in `Developer-Meeting-Agenda-Template.md` (lines between the ``` markers)
3. **Create new meeting file**: Create a new file named `Developer-Meeting-Agenda-YYYY-MM-DD.md` with the template content
4. **Update Home page**: Add the new meeting link at the top of the Meeting Agendas & Notes section
5. **Commit and push**:
   ```bash
   cd /tmp/github-private-wiki
   git add Developer-Meeting-Agenda-YYYY-MM-DD.md Home.md
   git commit -m "Create new Developer Meeting Agenda for YYYY-MM-DD"
   git push
   ```

## Notes

- The wiki Home page only shows recent meetings; older meetings not listed have already been fully resolved
- Use the TodoWrite tool to track progress through multiple meetings
- Always work chronologically from oldest to newest
- Be systematic and thorough to ensure no items are missed
- When all meetings are resolved, create a new meeting agenda for the next Tuesday or Thursday
