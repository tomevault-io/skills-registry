# Quality Finisher

Post-PR test coverage audit. Confirm the kill is real before verify-sprint merges it.

## Execution Mode

**Pattern A (Standalone)**: Present findings and proposed test plan for user
approval before pushing any test code.

**Pattern B (Team Member)**: Send findings and proposed test plan to the Team
Lead for approval before pushing. Cleanup requires Lead instruction.

Detection: see [ENV.md](ENV.md) for how to detect team context in your tool.

## Inputs

One or more PR numbers provided by the user.

## Workflow

For each PR:

1. Read the PR diff (`gh pr diff <N>`)
2. Identify changed source files and their existing test coverage
3. Diagnose coverage gaps
4. Apply the [Decision Matrix](#decision-matrix)
5. **Always** post a `## Quality Finisher Report` comment (all outcomes)
6. Report outcome to user

## Decision Matrix

| Situation | Action |
|---|---|
| Writable tests exist | Checkout PR branch in a worktree, implement tests, push, then post report |
| Tests not writable yet (missing infra, etc.) | Post structured comment — gap, blocker, unblock path |
| Coverage already sufficient | Post short confirmation comment, done |
| Blocker requires a source-level change | Open a new `agent:proposed` issue, post link on PR |

> **Every outcome requires a `## Quality Finisher Report` PR comment.**
> `verify-sprint` uses this comment as the signal that auditing is complete.

## Writing Tests

When tests are writable, check out the PR branch in an isolated worktree.
Use a distinct local branch name (`qf/pr-<N>`) so the temporary checkout is
never confused with the actual PR branch:

```bash
git fetch origin
git worktree add -B "qf/pr-<N>" .agent-worktrees/quality-finisher-pr-<N> "origin/<branch-name>"
```

Write tests following the project's existing test conventions.

**Before committing**, run the project's test suite to confirm the new tests
pass. Refer to the project's `CLAUDE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, or CI
configuration for the exact test command. If the new tests fail, fix them
before proceeding — do not push failing tests.

Commit and push with the co-authorship trailer format defined in `../reading-guild-rules/SKILL.md`.

**If `git push` fails** (e.g., branch protection, diverged history):

1. Try `git fetch origin <branch-name> && git rebase origin/<branch-name>` then push again.
2. If push still fails due to branch protection, post a report comment
   explaining the blocker and ask the user to push manually or adjust
   branch protection settings.
3. Do NOT force-push unless the user explicitly instructs you to.

Remove the worktree after pushing (Pattern B: wait for Lead instruction):

```bash
git worktree remove .agent-worktrees/quality-finisher-pr-<N>
git branch -D "qf/pr-<N>"
```

Then post a report comment.

## Report Comment Templates

Write all report comments to a temp file first, then post via
`gh pr comment <N> --body-file`.

### Tests Pushed

```markdown
## Quality Finisher Report

**Status**: Tests pushed

**Added**: <N> test cases covering <what was covered>
```

### Tests Not Writable

```markdown
## Quality Finisher Report

**Status**: Coverage gap — tests not yet writable

**Gap**: <what is not covered>

**Blocker**: <reason — e.g., requires a test harness that does not exist yet>

**Unblock path**: <what needs to happen first>

**Recommended next step**: <specific action>
```

### Coverage Sufficient

```markdown
## Quality Finisher Report

**Status**: Coverage sufficient — no additional tests needed.
```

### Prerequisite Required

```markdown
## Quality Finisher Report

**Status**: Prerequisite required

A source-level change is needed before tests can be written for this PR.
New issue opened: #<new-issue-number>
```

## Opening a Prerequisite Issue

When a source-level change is required before tests can be written,
open a new issue with the `agent:proposed` label. Do not add `agent:ready`.

## Summary Report

After all PRs are processed, output a summary to the user:

```
Quality Finisher — Summary
PR #A: tests pushed (N new test cases)
PR #B: comment posted (gap: X, blocker: Y)
PR #C: coverage sufficient
```
