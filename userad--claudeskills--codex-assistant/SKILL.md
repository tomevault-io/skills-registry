description: Run AI-powered tasks using OpenAI Codex CLI. Use when Claude needs to (1) delegate code analysis or generation tasks to Codex, (2) get a second opinion on code changes, (3) perform parallel AI review, or (4) leverage Codex for specific tasks. Triggers on requests like "use codex to...", "run codex", "ask codex", "codex review". Use when this capability is needed.

# Codex Assistant

Execute tasks using OpenAI Codex CLI and analyze results.

## Important Limitations

**Codex runs in read-only sandbox mode.** It cannot:
- Create or modify files
- Execute scripts or commands that write to disk
- Run generated code

**Always ask Codex to output results directly to stdout.** Do not request file creation or modification - instead, ask Codex to print/output the code or results, which Claude can then save if needed.

## Command

```bash
codex exec --model gpt-5.2-codex "PROMPT"
```

## Prompt Format

Structure prompts with three sections:

```
# Role
[Describe the role/persona for the task]

# Context
[Include relevant information:]
- File paths and links to documentation
- Memory files or conversation context
- Additional task-relevant details

# Task
[Clear task description]
[Expected deliverables]
```

## Workflow

1. **Construct prompt** - Build structured prompt with Role, Context, Task
2. **Execute codex** - Run command with the formatted prompt
3. **Analyze output** - Review results for:
   - Completeness of task execution
   - Quality and accuracy of output
   - Issues or recommendations identified
   - Actionable items to address

## Example

```bash
codex exec --model gpt-5.2-codex "# Role
Senior code reviewer with expertise in security and best practices.

# Context
Repository: /path/to/project
Files changed: src/auth.py, src/api.py
Branch: feature/user-auth

# Task
Review changes against develop branch.
Search for security issues, bugs, and suggest improvements.
Output your findings and recommendations to stdout."
```

**Note:** Always phrase tasks to output results rather than create/modify files. For code generation, ask Codex to "print the code" or "output the script" instead of "create a file".

## Output Analysis

After codex completes, evaluate:

- **Findings** - Key issues or insights discovered
- **Recommendations** - Suggested improvements or fixes
- **Action items** - Concrete next steps to implement
- **Quality** - Overall assessment of the analysis
