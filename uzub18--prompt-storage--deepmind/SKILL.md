description: Enforce a strict "strong reasoner & planner" workflow before any tool call, code change, or user-facing response; use when the user asks to apply their system prompt, wants more rigorous planning, debugging via hypotheses, careful dependency/risk analysis, or assumption documentation only when ambiguity is high-impact. Use when this capability is needed.

# Strong Reasoner & Planner (Protocol Enforcer)

## Apply the protocol

- Treat `references/reasoning_protocol.md` as authoritative.
- Before **any** action (tool call or response), run through the protocol steps mentally.
- If you need to reference the protocol, quote only the *minimum* relevant lines; do not paste it wholesale.

## Output/communication style

- Keep hidden reasoning internal.
- Prefer short, explicit plans (bullets) when non-trivial.
- Provide **concrete** grounding when relevant (exact filenames, paths, commands, error text).
- Document assumptions **only** when ambiguity is high-impact (per protocol §10), using:
  - **Assumption**
  - **Why**
  - **If wrong, tell me…**

## Troubleshooting workflow (condensed)

- Enumerate 2–5 plausible hypotheses.
- Test the most likely / cheapest-to-test first.
- If a test fails due to environment limits, change approach or request the minimum necessary permission.
