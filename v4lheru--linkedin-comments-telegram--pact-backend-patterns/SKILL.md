# PACT Backend Patterns Skill

## Overview

This skill provides backend implementation patterns and best practices for the CODE phase of the PACT framework. It focuses on server-side development including service layers, API design, error handling, data validation, middleware, and security.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Implementing RESTful or GraphQL APIs
- Creating service layers and business logic
- Designing error handling strategies
- Implementing data validation and sanitization
- Building middleware and interceptors
- Implementing authentication and authorization
- Optimizing database queries and data access
- Creating background jobs and async processing

## Quick Reference: Service Layer Patterns

### Repository Pattern
```
Repository: Data access abstraction layer
├── Interface defines contract (findById, findAll, create, update, delete)
├── Implementation handles DB-specific logic
└── Service layer depends on repository interface, not implementation

Benefits: Testability, swappable data sources, separation of concerns
```

### Service Pattern
```
Service: Business logic layer
├── Orchestrates repositories and other services
├── Implements business rules and validation
├── Handles transactions and error recovery
└── Returns domain models or DTOs

Benefits: Reusable business logic, testable without DB, clear boundaries
```

### Controller Pattern
```
Controller: HTTP request/response layer
├── Validates request format (using middleware)
├── Calls service layer with extracted data
├── Maps service responses to HTTP responses
└── Handles HTTP-specific concerns (status codes, headers)

Benefits: Thin controllers, framework-agnostic services, clear responsibilities
```

## Quick Reference: Error Handling

### Error Categories

**Validation Errors** (400)
- Invalid input format
- Missing required fields
- Business rule violations
- Use: Immediate client feedback

**Authorization Errors** (401/403)
- Invalid credentials (401)
- Insufficient permissions (403)
- Use: Security enforcement

**Not Found Errors** (404)
- Resource doesn't exist
- Use: Clear user feedback

**Conflict Errors** (409)
- Duplicate resources
- Concurrent modification
- Use: Business constraint enforcement

**Server Errors** (500)
- Unhandled exceptions
- Infrastructure failures
- Use: Graceful degradation, logging

### Error Handling Strategy

```
1. Define custom error classes (ValidationError, AuthError, etc.)
2. Throw semantic errors in services
3. Catch and transform in middleware/controllers
4. Log with context (request ID, user ID, timestamp)
5. Return consistent error format to client
```

## Quick Reference: Data Validation

### Input Validation Layers

**Schema Validation** (First line of defense)
- Validate request structure
- Check data types
- Enforce required fields
- Use: JSON Schema, Joi, Zod, class-validator

**Business Validation** (Second line of defense)
- Check business rules
- Verify relationships
- Validate state transitions
- Use: Service layer logic

**Database Constraints** (Last line of defense)
- Unique constraints
- Foreign key constraints
- Check constraints
- Use: Database schema definitions

## API Implementation Checklist

### Before Writing Code
- [ ] Review architectural specification in `docs/architecture/`

## When to Use Sequential Thinking

Use the `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` tool when:

1. **Complex Business Logic Design**
   - Multiple interacting business rules
   - State machine implementations
   - Transaction boundary decisions
   - Example: "Design order fulfillment workflow with inventory, payment, shipping"

2. **Error Handling Strategy**
   - Cascade error handling across layers
   - Error recovery mechanisms
   - Partial failure scenarios
   - Example: "Handle payment failure during checkout with rollback strategy"

3. **Security Implementation**
   - Authentication/authorization flow
   - Permission checking logic
   - Data access control
   - Example: "Design multi-tenant data isolation strategy"

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Query optimization decisions
   - Caching strategy design
   - Async processing patterns
   - Example: "Optimize user feed generation with 10k+ items"

5. **Integration Design**
   - External API integration patterns
   - Retry and circuit breaker logic
   - Data synchronization strategies
   - Example: "Integrate payment gateway with retry and idempotency"

## Common Backend Patterns

### Middleware Pattern

**Purpose**: Cross-cutting concerns applied to requests/responses

**Use cases**:
- Authentication verification
- Request logging
- Rate limiting
- Request validation
- Error transformation

**Example structure**:
```
Middleware chain: Request → Auth → Logging → Validation → Controller → Response
```

### DTO Pattern

**Purpose**: Decouple API contracts from domain models

**Benefits**:
- API versioning flexibility
- Hide internal structure
- Controlled data exposure
- Input validation boundary

**When to use**:
- Public APIs
- Service boundaries
- Complex domain models
- Version management

### Transaction Pattern

**Purpose**: Ensure data consistency across multiple operations

**Key principles**:
- Start transaction at service layer
- Commit on success
- Rollback on error
- Keep transactions short
- Avoid nested transactions

**When to use**:
- Multiple database operations
- Data consistency requirements
- Financial operations
- Inventory management

## Security Best Practices

### Input Security
- Validate all inputs against schemas
- Sanitize user-provided data
- Use parameterized queries (prevent SQL injection)
- Validate file uploads (type, size, content)
- Implement rate limiting

### Authentication & Authorization
- Use established libraries (Passport, JWT, OAuth)
- Store passwords with strong hashing (bcrypt, argon2)
- Implement token expiration and refresh
- Use HTTPS for all authentication endpoints
- Check permissions at service layer, not just controller

### Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Use TLS for data in transit
- Implement proper CORS policies
- Avoid logging sensitive information
- Implement data retention policies

### API Security
- Rate limiting per endpoint/user
- Request size limits
- Timeout configurations
- CSRF protection for state-changing operations
- Input validation at API boundary

## Performance Patterns

### Caching Strategy

**Levels of caching**:
1. Application cache (in-memory)
2. Distributed cache (Redis, Memcached)
3. Database query cache
4. HTTP cache (CDN, reverse proxy)

**Cache invalidation patterns**:
- Time-based expiration (TTL)
- Event-based invalidation
- Cache-aside pattern
- Write-through cache

### Database Optimization

**Query optimization**:
- Use indexes for frequent queries
- Avoid N+1 query problems
- Use connection pooling
- Implement query result pagination
- Use database-specific optimizations

**Data access patterns**:
- Lazy loading for optional data
- Eager loading for required relationships
- Batch operations for bulk updates
- Read replicas for read-heavy workloads

### Async Processing

**When to use**:
- Long-running operations
- Email/notification sending
- Report generation
- Data imports/exports
- Third-party API calls

**Patterns**:
- Job queues (Bull, BullMQ, Sidekiq)
- Pub/sub messaging
- Event-driven architecture
- Background workers

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test service layer in isolation
- Mock repository dependencies
- Test business logic edge cases
- Test error conditions
- Aim for 80%+ coverage of critical paths

### Integration Tests
- Test API endpoints end-to-end
- Use test database
- Test authentication/authorization
- Test error responses
- Test data validation

### Performance Tests
- Load testing for expected traffic
- Stress testing for peak loads
- Endurance testing for memory leaks
- Spike testing for traffic bursts

## File Organization

### Recommended Structure
```
src/
├── controllers/       # HTTP request/response handlers
├── services/         # Business logic layer
├── repositories/     # Data access layer
├── models/           # Domain models
├── dto/              # Data transfer objects
├── middleware/       # Cross-cutting concerns
├── validators/       # Input validation schemas
├── errors/           # Custom error classes
├── config/           # Configuration management
└── utils/            # Shared utilities
```

### File Size Guidelines
- Controllers: < 200 lines (thin controllers)
- Services: < 400 lines (split complex services)
- Repositories: < 300 lines (one per domain model)
- Keep related functionality together
- Extract reusable logic to utilities

## Documentation Standards

### Code Comments
