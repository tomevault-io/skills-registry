# PACT Prepare Research

## Overview

The Prepare phase is the foundation of principled software development. This skill provides systematic methodologies for conducting thorough research, evaluating information sources, documenting findings, and gathering requirements before moving to architecture and implementation.

**Core Principle**: Good preparation prevents poor performance. Time invested in research saves exponentially more time in later phases.

This skill helps you:
- Conduct systematic technology research with credible sources
- Evaluate and compare framework/library options objectively
- Document APIs, dependencies, and integration requirements
- Capture security, performance, and compatibility requirements
- Create comprehensive preparation documentation for the Architect phase

## Quick Reference

### Research Workflow Overview

```
1. DEFINE SCOPE
   └─> What problem are we solving?
   └─> What are the constraints and requirements?
   └─> What decisions need to be made?

2. GATHER SOURCES
   └─> Official documentation (highest priority)
   └─> Community resources (GitHub, Stack Overflow)
   └─> Blog posts and tutorials (lowest priority)

3. EVALUATE CREDIBILITY
   └─> Is the source authoritative?
   └─> Is the information current and maintained?
   └─> Does it match our version/context?

4. DOCUMENT FINDINGS
   └─> Use structured templates (see references/)
   └─> Capture version-specific information
   └─> Note security and performance implications

5. SYNTHESIZE DECISIONS
   └─> Compare options with objective criteria
   └─> Document trade-offs and rationale
   └─> Provide recommendations for Architect phase
```

### Source Credibility Hierarchy

**Tier 1 - Official Documentation (Highest Trust)**:
- Official project documentation sites
- Official GitHub repositories and READMEs
- Published API references from vendors
- Official migration guides and changelogs

**Tier 2 - Community Resources (Medium Trust)**:
- Well-maintained GitHub projects with active communities
- Stack Overflow answers from reputable users
- Official forum discussions and issue threads
- Community-maintained awesome-lists

**Tier 3 - Secondary Sources (Verify First)**:
- Technical blog posts (check date and author credibility)
- Tutorial sites (verify against official docs)
- Third-party documentation aggregators
- Social media discussions

**Red Flags - Avoid or Verify Heavily**:
- Outdated content (>2 years old for fast-moving tech)
- No version information provided
- Anonymous or unknown authors
- Contradicts official documentation
- No sources or references cited

### When to Use Sequential Thinking

The `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` tool is valuable for:

**Complex Technology Comparisons**:
- Evaluating 3+ framework options with multiple criteria
- Understanding trade-offs between architectural approaches
- Reasoning through version compatibility matrices

**Security Analysis**:
- Evaluating security implications of technology choices
- Understanding threat models for specific implementations
- Analyzing authentication/authorization patterns

**Dependency Chain Reasoning**:
- Understanding transitive dependencies
- Evaluating compatibility across multiple packages
- Reasoning through version constraint conflicts

**Example Sequential Thinking Trigger**:
```
When comparing React, Vue, and Svelte for a new project with these constraints:
- Team experience: Moderate JavaScript, no framework experience
- Performance: Critical (public-facing, high traffic)
- Ecosystem: Need robust component libraries
- Timeline: 3-month MVP

Use sequential-thinking to systematically evaluate:
1. Learning curve for team
2. Performance characteristics
3. Ecosystem maturity
4. Long-term maintainability
5. Final recommendation with rationale
```

### Version Compatibility Tracking

Critical for preventing integration issues:

**Package Matrix Template**:
```markdown
## Dependency Compatibility

| Package | Version | Compatible With | Incompatible With | Notes |
|---------|---------|----------------|-------------------|-------|
| React | 18.2.0 | Node ≥16 | React Router <6 | Concurrent features |
| TypeScript | 5.2.0 | React 18.x | ESLint <8.0 | Uses new decorators |
| Vite | 4.5.0 | React 18.x | Webpack - | Dev server only |
```

**Key Tracking Points**:
- Runtime version requirements (Node.js, Python, Ruby)
- Peer dependencies and version ranges
- Breaking changes in major version upgrades
- Deprecated features affecting our use cases
- Security vulnerabilities by version

### Security Research Guidance

During Prepare phase, identify and document:

**1. Known Vulnerabilities**
