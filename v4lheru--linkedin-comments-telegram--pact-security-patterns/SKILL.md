### When to Use Sequential Thinking for Security

Use `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` when:
- Designing authentication/authorization flows with multiple decision points
- Analyzing security vulnerabilities and their cascading impacts
- Planning defense-in-depth strategies across multiple layers
- Evaluating trade-offs between security and usability
- Designing incident response and recovery procedures

## OWASP Top 10 Quick Reference

### 2021 OWASP Top 10

1. **A01:2021 - Broken Access Control**
   - Risk: Users acting outside intended permissions
   - Prevention: Deny by default, enforce ownership checks, disable directory listing

2. **A02:2021 - Cryptographic Failures**
   - Risk: Exposure of sensitive data due to weak/missing encryption
   - Prevention: Encrypt data in transit (TLS) and at rest, use strong algorithms

3. **A03:2021 - Injection**
   - Risk: Untrusted data sent to interpreter as part of command/query
   - Prevention: Parameterized queries, input validation, ORMs with escaping

4. **A04:2021 - Insecure Design**
   - Risk: Missing or ineffective security controls by design
   - Prevention: Threat modeling, secure design patterns, defense in depth

5. **A05:2021 - Security Misconfiguration**

## Common Security Patterns

### Secure Password Handling

```
Password Storage:
1. NEVER store passwords in plaintext
2. Use adaptive hashing (bcrypt, Argon2, scrypt)
3. Include per-user salt (handled by algorithm)
4. Use high work factor (bcrypt: 12+, Argon2: depends)

Password Validation:
1. Minimum length: 12+ characters
2. Check against breached password database (HaveIBeenPwned)
3. No complexity requirements that reduce entropy
4. Allow passphrases and long passwords (64+ chars)
5. No password expiration without cause

Password Reset:
1. Send reset link, not password
2. Include time-limited token
3. Invalidate after single use
4. Require current password for change
5. Notify user of password changes
```

### Secure Session Management

```
Session Creation:
1. Generate cryptographically random session ID
2. Set HttpOnly flag (prevent XSS access)
3. Set Secure flag (HTTPS only)
4. Set SameSite flag (CSRF protection)
5. Regenerate session ID after login

Session Validation:
1. Check session ID on every request
2. Validate IP address (optional, breaks mobile)
3. Validate User-Agent (weak protection)
4. Implement absolute timeout (e.g., 24 hours)
5. Implement idle timeout (e.g., 30 minutes)

Session Termination:
1. Invalidate server-side session
2. Clear client-side cookies
3. Provide explicit logout endpoint
4. Log session termination event
```

### Secure API Design

```
Authentication:
├─ API Keys: Simple, limit to server-to-server
│   ├─ Include in header (not URL)
│   ├─ Rotate regularly
│   └─ Scope to minimum required permissions
│
├─ JWT: Stateless, good for distributed systems
│   ├─ Sign with strong secret (HMAC) or private key (RSA)
│   ├─ Include expiration (short-lived: 15-60 min)
│   ├─ Use refresh tokens for renewal
│   └─ Validate signature on every request
│
└─ OAuth 2.0: Third-party access
    ├─ Use authorization code flow (not implicit)
    ├─ Implement PKCE for public clients
    ├─ Validate redirect URIs
    └─ Use state parameter (CSRF protection)

Authorization:
1. Check permissions on every endpoint
2. Use scope-based access control
3. Implement rate limiting per user/IP
4. Validate all request parameters
5. Return 403 Forbidden (not 404) for unauthorized

Security Headers:
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- Content-Security-Policy: appropriate policy
- Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000
```

### Secrets Management

```
Storage:
├─ Development: .env files (gitignored)
├─ CI/CD: Environment variables or secrets manager
└─ Production: Dedicated secrets manager
    ├─ AWS Secrets Manager / Systems Manager
    ├─ HashiCorp Vault
    ├─ Azure Key Vault
    └─ GCP Secret Manager

Best Practices:
1. Never commit secrets to version control
2. Use different secrets per environment
3. Rotate secrets regularly (30-90 days)
4. Encrypt secrets at rest and in transit
5. Limit access to secrets (least privilege)
6. Audit secret access
7. Use short-lived credentials when possible
8. Invalidate secrets when no longer needed

Detection:
1. Use pre-commit hooks (detect-secrets, git-secrets)
2. Scan repositories for leaked secrets (GitHub Advanced Security)
3. Monitor for exposed credentials (leaked DB scans)
4. Implement secret scanning in CI/CD
```

### Input Validation Pattern

```
Three-Step Validation:
1. Syntactic validation (format, type, structure)
2. Semantic validation (business rules, ranges)
3. Context validation (authorization, state)

Implementation:
1. Validate on server-side (never trust client)
2. Validate early (before processing)
3. Allowlist over denylist
4. Use schema validation (JSON Schema, Joi, Yup)
5. Provide clear error messages (without leaking info)
6. Reject invalid input (don't try to fix)

Context-Specific Sanitization:
├─ SQL: Use parameterized queries (NEVER string concatenation)
├─ HTML: Escape <, >, &, ", ' or use DOMPurify
├─ JavaScript: JSON.stringify() or escape for context
├─ Shell: Avoid shell execution or use strict allowlist
├─ LDAP: Escape special chars or use library functions
└─ XPath/XML: Use parameterized queries or escape
```

## Security Testing Strategy
