description: End-of-session documentation updater. Updates DEVELOPMENT-PLAN.md checkboxes, adds PROGRESS.md session entries, updates GAME-DESIGN-DOCUMENT.md if design changed, syncs CLAUDE.md status, and keeps OS-specific versions (CLAUDE-Windows.md, mac-claude.md) in parity. Use when finishing a coding session or when the user says "update docs" or "end session". Use when this capability is needed.

# Update Skill

Perform an end-of-session assessment and update all project tracking documentation.

## When to Use

Invoke `/update` at the end of a coding session to:
- Record completed work
- Update task checkboxes
- Document decisions made
- Log any blockers or issues encountered

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Session Assessment

Before touching any files, assess what was accomplished in this session:
- What tasks were worked on?
- What was completed vs partially complete vs blocked?
- What decisions were made?
- What issues were encountered?
- What are the logical next steps?

### Step 2: Review DEVELOPMENT-PLAN.md

Read `docs/DEVELOPMENT-PLAN.md` and identify:
- Tasks that should be marked complete `[x]`
- Tasks that are partially complete `[~]` (add note)
- Tasks that are blocked `[!]` (add blocker reason)
- Any new tasks that need to be added based on discoveries

Apply checkbox updates accurately. Do not mark tasks complete unless they are fully done and verified.

### Step 3: Review GAME-DESIGN-DOCUMENT.md

Read `docs/GAME-DESIGN-DOCUMENT.md` and identify:
- Any game mechanics that were clarified or changed
- New features or systems that were designed
- Balance values that were adjusted
- Any specifications that need updating based on implementation decisions

Only update this document if actual game design changes occurred. Do not update for purely technical changes.

### Step 4: Review PROGRESS.md

**Important:** PROGRESS.md may exceed the Read tool's token limit. Handle this by:
1. First, read lines 1-100 to get the header with Total Sessions count and phase summary
2. Then, use Bash with `wc -l` to get total line count
3. Read the last 400 lines (offset = totalLines - 400) to see recent sessions and find where to append

Add a new session entry with:

```markdown
## Session [N] - [YYYY-MM-DD]

### Completed
- [List of completed tasks with brief descriptions]

### Decisions Made
- [Any decisions that were made, with rationale]

### Issues Encountered
- [Problems hit and how they were resolved, or if still open]

### Next Steps
- [What should be tackled in the next session]
```

### Step 5: Update CLAUDE.md Current Status

Update the "Current Status" section in `CLAUDE.md` (project root) with:
- Current Phase
- Phase Progress
- Current Task (next priority)
- Blockers
- Last Session number and date
- Last Updated date

Also add any new entries to the Key Decisions Log if decisions were made.

### Step 6: Sync OS-Specific CLAUDE Files

The project maintains two OS-specific versions of CLAUDE.md in the `docs/` folder:
- `docs/CLAUDE-Windows.md` - For Windows/WSL development
- `docs/mac-claude.md` - For macOS development

Both files should stay in parity with the main `CLAUDE.md` except for platform-specific sections.

#### Sections to keep in sync (MUST match CLAUDE.md exactly):
- Current Status table
- Key Decisions Log (all entries)
- Project Overview
- Critical Files table
- Quick Commands table
- Technical Standards (entire section)
- Code Style
- File Organization
- Commit Convention
- Testing Requirements
- Database Changes
- Database Safety section
- Checklist Discipline
- Session Start/End Protocol
- Progress Verification Checkpoints
- Game Specifications Quick Reference
- Asking for Clarification
- Phase Completion Checklist
- Emergency Procedures
- Remember section

#### Windows-specific sections (docs/CLAUDE-Windows.md):
These sections are UNIQUE to Windows and should NOT be overwritten:
- "WSL vs Windows Environment (CRITICAL)" section under Development Rules
- Prohibited Actions item #11: "Run `pnpm install` or delete `node_modules` from WSL"
- Any PowerShell-specific recovery instructions

#### macOS-specific sections (docs/mac-claude.md):
These sections are UNIQUE to macOS and should NOT be overwritten:
- "Development Environment (macOS)" section under Development Rules
- "Available Commands" table showing all pnpm commands work normally
- "Initial Setup" bash commands section
- Prohibited Actions list (10 items, no WSL warning)

#### Sync Process:
1. Read `docs/CLAUDE-Windows.md` and update:
   - Current Status table to match CLAUDE.md
   - Key Decisions Log to match CLAUDE.md (all entries)
   - Footer version number and date
   - Any other synced sections that changed

2. Read `docs/mac-claude.md` and update:
   - Current Status table to match CLAUDE.md
   - Key Decisions Log to match CLAUDE.md (all entries)
   - Footer version number and date
   - Any other synced sections that changed

**Version numbering convention:**
- Main CLAUDE.md: `X.Y.Z`
- CLAUDE-Windows.md: `X.Y.Z` (matches main version)
- mac-claude.md: `X.Y.Z (macOS)` (matches main version with platform suffix)

### Step 7: Summary Report

After all updates are complete, provide a summary to the user:

```
## Session Update Complete

**Session:** [N] - [Date]
**Phase:** [Current Phase]

### Changes Made:
- DEVELOPMENT-PLAN.md: [X tasks marked complete, Y tasks added/modified]
- GAME-DESIGN-DOCUMENT.md: [Changes made or "No changes needed"]
- PROGRESS.md: [Session entry added]
- CLAUDE.md: [Status updated, N decisions logged]
- CLAUDE-Windows.md: [Synced with CLAUDE.md]
- mac-claude.md: [Synced with CLAUDE.md]

### Current State:
- Phase Progress: [X/Y tasks complete]
- Next Priority: [Task description]
- Blockers: [None or list]
```

## Important Notes

- Always READ each document before making edits
- **Large file handling:** If any file exceeds the Read tool's 25000 token limit, use `offset` and `limit` parameters to read in chunks. For append-only files like PROGRESS.md, read the header (first ~100 lines) and tail (last ~400 lines).
- Be conservative with GAME-DESIGN-DOCUMENT.md - only update for actual design changes
- Be thorough with PROGRESS.md - this is the historical record
- Never mark a task complete if it wasn't fully finished and verified
- If uncertain about whether something should be logged, include it
- **Platform awareness:** When syncing OS-specific files, preserve their unique platform sections while updating shared content
