# Claude Code Configuration Optimizer

## Activation

- [ ] EVALUATE: Does this request involve optimizing Claude Code config, permissions, CLAUDE.md, or skills?
- [ ] DECIDE: "This task requires /claude because..."
- [ ] EXECUTE: Follow the workflow below

Audit and optimize all Claude Code configuration files for this project.

## Targets

| File | What to Audit |
|------|---------------|
| `.claude/settings.local.json` | Permission patterns |
| `.claude/settings.json` | Hooks configuration |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Project rules and conventions |
| `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` | Skill definitions |
| `.claude/agents/*.md` | Subagent instructions |

## Process

### Step 1: Read All Configuration

Read every file in `.claude/` and `CLAUDE.md`:

```
Glob: .claude/**/*
Read: CLAUDE.md
```

### Step 2: Audit Permissions (settings.local.json)

Analyze the `permissions.allow`, `permissions.deny`, and `permissions.ask` arrays:

**Redundancy**: Find patterns that are subsumed by broader patterns.
Example: `Bash(git -C /Users/.../Vantle log:*)` is redundant when `Bash(git -C *:*)` already exists.

**Consolidation**: Identify groups of specific entries that could be one wildcard.
Example: Multiple `Bash(git log:*)`, `Bash(git diff:*)`, `Bash(git show:*)` could potentially be consolidated if all git read commands should be allowed.

**Missing**: Identify tools or commands that are frequently prompted (the user keeps having to approve). Suggest adding them to `allow`.

**Misplaced**: Identify entries in `allow` that should be in `ask` (destructive commands) or entries in `ask` that could safely be in `allow`.

### Step 3: Audit CLAUDE.md

Read `CLAUDE.md` and check for:

**Staleness**: Rules that reference patterns, files, or conventions no longer present in the codebase.

**Contradictions**: Rules that conflict with each other or with actual codebase patterns.

**Vagueness**: Rules that are ambiguous and could be interpreted multiple ways. Suggest precise rewording.

**Gaps**: Patterns observed in the codebase that are not captured by any rule. Propose specific additions.

**Verbosity**: Sections that could be more concise without losing meaning.

Cross-reference against actual codebase:
- Do naming rules match actual identifiers?
- Do module rules match actual module structure?
- Do code quality rules match actual error handling patterns?

### Step 4: Audit Skills

For each skill in `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md`:

**allowed-tools**: Are all necessary tools listed? Are there tools listed that the skill never uses?

**Description**: Will the description trigger correctly? Does it cover all the phrases users would say?

**Workflow**: Are the steps complete and in the right order? Are there steps that reference nonexistent files, commands, or patterns?

**Activation**: Does the activation checklist match the description?

**Supporting files**: Does the skill have supporting files (like `security.md`, `performance.md`) that are stale or incomplete?

### Step 5: Audit Subagents

For each agent in `.claude/agents/*.md`:

**Scope**: Is the scope well-defined? Does it overlap with any skill?

**allowed-tools**: Are they sufficient for the agent's task?

**Instructions**: Are the violation categories comprehensive? Are there false positive patterns?

### Step 6: Audit Hooks

For each hook in `.claude/settings.json`:

**Correctness**: Does the command parse stdin correctly (jq for tool_input)?

**Coverage**: Are there missing hooks that would be valuable?

**Performance**: Are hooks fast enough not to slow down editing?

## Output Format

```markdown
## Claude Configuration Audit

### Permissions (settings.local.json)

| Issue | Type | Current | Suggestion |
|-------|------|---------|------------|
| Redundant git path entries | Redundancy | 3 specific entries | Remove, covered by `Bash(git -C *:*)` |

### CLAUDE.md

| Section | Issue | Suggestion |
|---------|-------|------------|
| Naming | Missing exception for... | Add exception clause |

### Skills

| Skill | Issue | Suggestion |
|-------|-------|------------|
| /commit | Missing `Bash(git stash:*)` in allowed-tools | Add it |

### Subagents

| Agent | Issue | Suggestion |
|-------|-------|------------|
| convention | Missing check for... | Add pattern |

### Hooks

| Hook | Issue | Suggestion |
|------|-------|------------|
| format | Could also format .bazel files | Add buildifier |

**Apply N optimizations?**
```

### Step 7: Apply (on user approval)

Edit each file with the approved optimizations. Make targeted edits, not wholesale rewrites.

## Arguments

The user may specify scope:

```
/claude                  # audit everything
/claude permissions      # audit only settings.local.json
/claude rules            # audit only CLAUDE.md
/claude skills           # audit only skills
/claude agents           # audit only subagents
/claude hooks            # audit only hooks
```
