# Deep Gemini - Deep Technical Documentation Generation

## Overview

This skill provides a two-stage deep analysis and documentation workflow:

**Stage 1 - Analysis (clink):** Launch gemini CLI in WSL to perform deep code/architecture/performance analysis
**Stage 2 - Documentation (docgen):** Generate structured technical documents with Big O complexity analysis

All operations leverage zen-mcp's workflow tools to ensure thorough analysis and professional documentation output.

**Technical Architecture:**
- **zen-mcp clink**: Bridge tool to launch gemini CLI in WSL environment for code analysis
- **zen-mcp docgen**: WorkflowTool for multi-step structured document generation with complexity analysis
- **gemini CLI session**: Opened via `gemini` command in WSL, where deep analysis is executed
- **Main Claude Model**: Context gathering, workflow orchestration, user interaction
- **User**: Provides analysis targets, reviews final documents

**Two-Stage Workflow:**
```
Main Claude → clink → Gemini CLI (Analysis) → docgen → Structured Doc → User
     ↑                                                                  ↓
     └──────────────────── User Approval ──────────────────────────────┘
```

**Division of Responsibilities:**

**Stage 1 (Analysis via clink):**
- **Gemini CLI Session** (in WSL): Deep code/architecture/performance analysis, pattern identification
- **clink tool**: Bridges Zen MCP requests to CLI-executable commands, captures CLI output and metadata

**Stage 2 (Documentation via docgen):**
- **docgen tool**: Receives analysis results, executes multi-step document generation workflow, adds Big O complexity analysis
- **Main Claude Model**: Orchestrates both stages, manages user approvals, saves final documents

## When to Use This Skill

Trigger this skill when the user requests:
- "Use gemini to deeply analyze code logic"
- "Generate architecture analysis document"
- "Analyze performance bottlenecks and generate report"
- "Deeply understand this code and generate documentation"
- "Generate model architecture analysis"
- "Use gemini for deep analysis"
- Any request requiring deep technical understanding and analysis documentation

**Distinction from simple-gemini:**
- **simple-gemini**: Standard documentation (PROJECTWIKI, README, CHANGELOG) and test code, uses clink only
- **deep-gemini**: Deep analysis documents with complexity analysis, uses clink + docgen two-stage workflow

## Operation Mode (automation_mode - READ FROM SSOT)

automation_mode definition and constraints: See CLAUDE.md「📚 共享概念速查」

**This skill's role**: Skill Layer (read-only), read from context `[AUTOMATION_MODE: true/false]`
- `false` → Interactive: Show document, ask for approval
- `true` → Automated: Auto-save document, log to auto_log.md

## Workflow: Two-Stage Deep Analysis Documentation Process

### Phase 1: Analysis Scope Definition

2. **Gather Target Code Context:**
   - Identify files/modules/functions to analyze
   - Read relevant source code using Read tool
   - Collect supporting documentation (if exists)
   - Gather performance data/logs (if applicable)

3. **Define Scope:**
   ```
   Analysis Target: [Specify analysis object]
   Analysis Type: [Code Logic/Architecture/Performance/Security]
   Key Questions: [Core questions to answer]
   Analysis Depth: [Surface/Medium/Deep]
   Complexity Analysis: [Yes/No]

4. Gemini CLI performs deep analysis inside WSL session environment
5. clink captures CLI output and metadata
6. Analysis results are returned to Main Claude
7. Session context is preserved via continuation_id

**Gemini CLI's Work (inside WSL session):**
- Read and comprehend all provided code/data
- Perform multi-dimensional analysis (logic, architecture, performance, security)
- Calculate algorithm complexity (time/space complexity in Big O notation)

## Best Practices

### For Effective Deep Analysis

1. **Scope Management:**
   - Start with narrow, focused scope
   - Expand gradually if needed
   - Clearly specify if complexity analysis is required
   - Avoid analyzing entire large codebases at once

2. **Context Quality:**
   - Provide relevant files only (not entire project)
   - Include documentation and comments
   - Add performance data/logs if analyzing performance
   - Ensure code is well-formatted for complexity analysis

3. **Analysis Depth:**
   - Match depth to user's actual needs
   - For complexity analysis, identify critical paths only
   - Don't over-analyze simple utility functions
   - Justify deep dives with clear objectives

4. **Complexity Analysis:**
   - Focus on algorithms and critical paths
   - Provide Big O notation for time and space complexity
   - Explain complexity in context (why it matters)
   - Compare with alternative approaches if relevant

### Document Quality Standards

**Must Include:**
- Executive summary (2-3 paragraphs with complexity highlights)
- Clear methodology description
- Evidence-based findings (not speculation)
- **Complexity analysis section:**
  - Time complexity (Big O)
  - Space complexity (Big O)
  - Bottleneck identification
  - Comparison with optimal complexity
- Actionable recommendations
- At least 2 Mermaid diagrams (for architecture/flow analysis)
- Code examples with proper syntax highlighting
- Conclusion with next steps

**Complexity Analysis Format:**

Use tables for clarity:

```markdown
## Algorithm Complexity Analysis

| Function/Algorithm | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Description |
|-------------------|----------------|------------------|-------------|
| train_model() | O(n²) | O(n) | Nested loops cause quadratic complexity |
| predict() | O(n log n) | O(1) | Sorting operations dominate |
| preprocess() | O(n) | O(n) | Linear scan, additional storage |
```

**Mermaid Diagram Types:**
- `flowchart TD/LR`: Control flow, decision trees, complexity paths
- `sequenceDiagram`: Interaction patterns, call sequences
- `classDiagram`: Class relationships, inheritance
- `graph TD/LR`: Dependency graphs, component relationships

**Formatting:**
- Use tables for complexity metrics and comparisons
- Use blockquotes for important complexity insights
- Use code blocks with language tags
- Use ordered lists for sequential steps
- Use unordered lists for features/findings

- Write the detailed analysis document directly (delegated to docgen)
- Generate complex Mermaid diagrams directly (delegated to docgen)

### clink Tool's Role

**Bridging Function:**
- Receive Zen MCP analysis requests
- Launch gemini CLI in WSL environment (via `gemini` command)
- Convert requests into CLI-executable commands
- Pass context files to CLI session
- Capture CLI output and metadata
- Return analysis results to Main Claude
- Maintain session continuity via continuation_id

**Does NOT:**
- Generate documents (docgen's responsibility)
- Format output (docgen's responsibility)
- Perform complexity calculations (Gemini CLI's responsibility)

### docgen Tool's Role

**Document Generation Workflow:**
- Receive analysis results from clink stage
- Execute multi-step document generation workflow:
  1. Structure outline
  2. Write executive summary
  3. Elaborate findings
  4. **Generate complexity analysis section (Big O notation)**
  5. Create Mermaid diagrams
  6. Format code examples
  7. Formulate recommendations

- Save files to disk (Main Claude's responsibility)

### Gemini CLI Session's Role (via clink)

**Inside the gemini CLI environment in WSL:**
- Read and deeply comprehend provided code/data
- Perform multi-dimensional analysis (logic, architecture, performance, security)
- **Calculate algorithm complexity (time/space complexity in Big O notation)**
- Identify patterns, anti-patterns, issues, opportunities
- Evaluate performance characteristics
- Generate structured analysis findings with complexity metrics
- Maintain context across multiple prompts via continuation_id
- Return comprehensive analysis results to clink

**Does NOT:**

### User's Role

**Provide:**
- Clear analysis objectives and questions
- Target code/modules/data for analysis
- **Specify if complexity analysis is required**
- Desired depth and scope of analysis
- Output format preference (if not .md)

**Review and Approve:**

## Notes

- **Two-Stage Architecture**: clink for analysis (Gemini CLI in WSL) → docgen for document generation (workflow tool)
- **Complexity Analysis**: Key differentiator - all documents include Big O complexity analysis where applicable
- **Session Continuity**: Both clink and docgen support continuation_id for multi-turn workflows
- **Context Loading**: Files are loaded into gemini CLI session (via clink), then passed to docgen for document generation
- **Output Quality**: Deep analysis documents are evidence-based, well-structured, actionable, and include complexity metrics
- **Mermaid Diagrams**: Strongly encouraged for architecture and flow analysis - docgen automates diagram generation
- **Scope Control**: Start narrow and expand as needed - complexity analysis is resource-intensive
- **Compatibility**: Works with CLAUDE.md standards for documentation quality
- **WSL Integration**: clink serves as the bridge between Main Claude and gemini CLI in WSL; docgen operates in Zen MCP environment
- **Tool Separation**: clink = analysis bridge, docgen = document generation workflow - each has distinct responsibilities
- **automation_mode & auto_log (READ FROM SSOT)**:
  - Definitions and constraints: See CLAUDE.md「📚 共享概念速查」
  - This skill: Skill Layer (read-only), outputs `[Automated Save Decision Record]` fragments when automation_mode=true
  - auto_log template: See `skills/shared/auto_log_template.md`
