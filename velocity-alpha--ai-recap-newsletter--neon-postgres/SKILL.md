# Neon Serverless Postgres

This skill focuses on three areas only:

1. **Neon CLI** (terminal workflows, automation)
2. **Node.js/TypeScript serverless driver** (`@neondatabase/serverless`)
3. **Neon MCP server** (AI assistant integration)

## Neon Documentation

Always reference the Neon documentation before making Neon-related claims. The documentation is the source of truth for all Neon-related information.

Below you'll find a list of resources organized by area of concern. This is meant to support you find the right documentation pages to fetch and add a bit of additonal context.

You can use the `curl` commands to fetch the documentation page as markdown:

**Documentation:**

```bash
# Get list of all Neon docs
curl https://neon.com/llms.txt

# Fetch any doc page as markdown
curl -H "Accept: text/markdown" https://neon.com/docs/<path>
```
