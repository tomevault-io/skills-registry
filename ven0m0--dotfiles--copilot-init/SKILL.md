description: Bootstrap Copilot guidance for any repository by creating or updating `.github/workflows/copilot-setup-steps.yml`, `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md`, and `.github/skills/*/SKILL.md`. Use when asked to initialize Copilot guidance, scaffold repo instructions or skills, or create or update `copilot-setup-steps`. Use when this capability is needed.

# Copilot init

Create or refresh Copilot bootstrap assets for the current repository. Derive
all guidance from the repository itself; do not paste generic templates without
adapting them.

## Goal

Produce a minimal, high-signal set of:

- `.github/workflows/copilot-setup-steps.yml`
- `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md`
- `.github/skills/*/SKILL.md`

Keep startup guidance short, keep detailed repo-wide guidance in a single
canonical place when the repository has one, and avoid duplicating large rule
blocks across files.

## Workflow

1. Audit the repository.
   - Identify languages, toolchains, package managers, entry points, and major
     workflows.
   - Collect setup, lint, test, type-check, build, and release commands.
   - Inspect existing workflows, instructions, skills, and agent guidance before
     adding files.
   - Note required system packages, services, or runtime prerequisites.
2. Design the guidance split.
   - `.github/copilot-instructions.md`: short startup bootstrap only.
   - Repo-wide guide, if present: canonical long-form guidance.
   - `.github/instructions/`: path- or topic-specific rules.
   - `.github/skills/`: reusable task workflows.
3. Create or update `.github/workflows/copilot-setup-steps.yml`.
   - Keep triggers minimal: `workflow_dispatch` plus `push` and
     `pull_request` scoped to the workflow file.
   - Set minimal `permissions:`.
   - Use pinned action versions.
   - Install only the repository's real system dependencies, toolchain, and
     project dependencies.
   - Match the repository's actual package manager, lockfiles, version pins,
     and setup flow.
4. Create or update `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md`.
   - Add files only when the repository has a real language, workflow, review,
     or platform need.
   - Keep each file focused, reusable, and narrow in scope.
   - Avoid duplicating repo-wide guidance that belongs in the canonical guide.
5. Create or update `.github/skills/*/SKILL.md`.
   - Add only reusable skills tied to real repository workflows.
   - Give each skill a clear trigger, narrow scope, and concrete steps.
   - Call out generated files, unsafe areas, validation requirements, and any
     repo-specific invariants.
6. Validate the result.
   - Verify every referenced path, file, and command exists.
   - Run the repository's existing validation for changed workflows and tracked
     files.
   - Do not claim runtime or end-to-end validation you did not perform.

## Portability requirements

- Tailor versions, dependencies, and commands to the current repository.
- Preserve good existing guidance files instead of replacing them wholesale.
- Respect the repository's chosen canonical guidance file names and structure.
- Prefer the smallest file set that still gives high-signal guidance.
- Keep the output useful even when a repository does not use `AGENTS.md` or
  `CLAUDE.md`.

## Guardrails

- Never invent commands, paths, dependencies, or workflows.
- Do not hand-edit generated artifacts when the repository provides a script or
  generator.
- Keep guidance concise, actionable, and repository-specific.
- Update good existing files instead of creating duplicates.
- Use this split when deciding where guidance belongs:
  - Startup bootstrap: `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
  - Canonical repo-wide guide: whichever existing file the repository uses
  - Path- or topic-specific rules: `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md`
  - Reusable task workflow: `.github/skills/*/SKILL.md`

## Deliverables checklist

- `copilot-setup-steps` matches the repository's real setup path.
- Instructions reflect the real stack, commands, and hotspots.
- Skills reflect recurring repository workflows.
- Large rule blocks are not duplicated across files.
- All changed files are internally consistent.
