# Brainstorming Ideas Into Designs

## Overview

Turn rough ideas into validated designs stored as epic Tasks with immutable requirements. Tasks are created iteratively as you learn, not upfront.

**Core principle:** Ask questions to understand, research before proposing, document decisions for future reference.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using gambit:brainstorming to refine your idea into a design."

## Rigidity Level

HIGH FREEDOM - Adapt questioning to context. But always:
- Create immutable epic before code
- Create only first task (not full tree)
- Use AskUserQuestion tool for questions
- Apply task refinement before handoff

## Quick Reference

| Step | Action | Deliverable |
|------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Ask clarifying questions | Understanding of requirements |
| 2 | Research codebase and patterns | Existing approaches |
| 3 | Propose 2-3 approaches | Recommended option |
| 4 | Present design in sections | Validated architecture |
| 5 | Create epic Task | Immutable requirements + anti-patterns |
| 6 | Create ONLY first subtask | Ready for execution |
| 7 | Apply task refinement | Corner cases covered |
| 8 | Ask next step, invoke skill | Chain continues automatically |

**Key:** Epic = contract (immutable), Tasks = adaptive (created as you learn)

<HARD-GATE>
Do NOT write any code, invoke any implementation skill, or take any implementation action until you have presented a design and the user has approved it. This applies to EVERY idea regardless of perceived simplicity. No exceptions.
</HARD-GATE>

## When to Use

- User describes a new feature to implement
- User has a rough idea that needs refinement
- About to write code without clear requirements
- Need to explore approaches before committing

**Don't use for:**
- Executing existing plans (use `gambit:executing-plans`)
- Fixing bugs (use `gambit:debugging`)
- Refactoring (use `gambit:refactoring`)
- Requirements already crystal clear and epic exists

## The Process

### 1. Understand the Idea

**Research existing context first:**

```
Task
  subagent_type: "Explore"
  prompt: "Find existing [relevant] implementation patterns in this codebase"
```

**Then ask clarifying questions using AskUserQuestion tool.**

Aim for 2-4 questions per round, 2-4 rounds total. Use multiple choice with recommended defaults. Stop when you understand scope, constraints, existing patterns, and scale.

```
AskUserQuestion
  questions:
    - question: "Where should OAuth tokens be stored?"
      header: "Token storage"
      options:
        - label: "httpOnly cookies (Recommended)"
          description: "Prevents XSS token theft, industry standard"
        - label: "sessionStorage"
          description: "Cleared on tab close, less persistent"
      multiSelect: false
```

**Do NOT print questions as text and wait** — always use the AskUserQuestion tool.

---

### 2. Explore Approaches

**Research before proposing:**
- Existing pattern in codebase → Explore agent
- New integration → WebSearch or WebFetch
- No results → Ask user for direction

**Propose 2-3 approaches:**
- Lead with your recommendation and why
- Include pros/cons for each
- Reference codebase consistency as a factor

```
Based on [research findings], I recommend:

1. **[Approach A]** (recommended)
   - Pros: [benefits, especially "matches existing pattern"]
   - Cons: [drawbacks]

2. **[Approach B]**
   - Pros: [benefits]
   - Cons: [drawbacks]

I recommend option 1 because [specific reason].
```

---

### 3. Present the Design

Once approach is chosen, present in digestible sections. Ask "Does this look right?" after each. Cover: architecture, components, data flow, error handling, testing.

---

### 4. Create the Epic Task

After design is validated, create epic as immutable contract. See [TEMPLATES.md](TEMPLATES.md) for the full template with all sections.

**Required epic sections:**

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Requirements (IMMUTABLE) | Specific, testable conditions that must be true |
| Success Criteria | Objective, checkable items including "all tests passing" |
| Anti-Patterns (FORBIDDEN) | Explicitly forbidden patterns with reasoning |
| Approach | 2-3 paragraph summary of chosen approach |
| Approaches Considered | Rejected alternatives with DO NOT REVISIT conditions |

```
TaskCreate
  subject: "Epic: [Feature Name]"
  description: |
    ## Requirements (IMMUTABLE)
    - Requirement 1: [concrete, testable]

    ## Success Criteria (MUST ALL BE TRUE)
    - [ ] [objective criterion]
    - [ ] All tests passing

    ## Anti-Patterns (FORBIDDEN)
    - NO [pattern] (reason: [why])

    ## Approach
    [2-3 paragraph summary]

    ## Approaches Considered
    ### [Rejected Approach] - REJECTED
    REJECTED BECAUSE: [reason]
    DO NOT REVISIT UNLESS: [condition]
  activeForm: "Planning [feature name]"
```

**Anti-patterns prevent requirement erosion.** When implementation gets hard, there's pressure to water down requirements. Explicit forbidden patterns with reasoning prevent this.

---

### 5. Create ONLY First Task

One task, not a full tree. Subsequent tasks are created by executing-plans as you learn.

```
TaskCreate
  subject: "Add [specific deliverable]"
  description: |
    ## Goal
    [One clear outcome]

    ## Implementation
    1. Study existing code: [file.ts:line]
    2. Write tests first (TDD)
    3. Implementation:
       - [ ] file.ts - function() - [what it does]

    ## Success Criteria
    - [ ] [specific measurable outcome]
    - [ ] Tests passing
    - [ ] Pre-commit hooks passing
  activeForm: "Adding [deliverable]"
```

**Why only one?** Each subsequent task reflects learnings from the previous one. Upfront task trees become brittle when assumptions change.

---

### 6. Apply Task Refinement

Before handoff, verify the first task passes these checks:

1. **Scoped:** 2-5 minutes of work (if longer, break down)
2. **Self-contained:** Can execute without asking questions
3. **Explicit:** All file paths specified
4. **Testable:** At least 3 success criteria

**Corner cases to check:**
- What if the happy path fails?
- Edge case inputs? Empty/null/missing data?
- Network/IO failures? Concurrent access?
- Security implications? Boundary conditions?

Update the task with any missing details before proceeding.

---

### 7. Handoff

**REQUIRED: Use AskUserQuestion to offer next steps, then invoke the chosen skill directly.**

```
AskUserQuestion
  questions:
    - question: "Epic and first task ready. How should we proceed?"
      header: "Next step"
      options:
        - label: "Start executing (Recommended)"
          description: "Begin implementing with gambit:executing-plans"
        - label: "Set up worktree first"
          description: "Create isolated workspace with gambit:using-worktrees"
        - label: "Refine tasks first"
          description: "Strengthen task quality with gambit:task-refinement"
      multiSelect: false
```

**After user responds, invoke the chosen skill directly using the Skill tool.** Do not just tell the user to run it — load and follow the skill immediately.

- "Start executing" → `Skill skill="gambit:executing-plans"`
- "Set up worktree first" → `Skill skill="gambit:using-worktrees"` (then executing-plans after)
- "Refine tasks first" → `Skill skill="gambit:task-refinement"` (then executing-plans after)

## Examples

### Bad: Full Task Tree Upfront

```
TaskCreate "Epic: Add OAuth"
TaskCreate "Task 1: Configure OAuth"
TaskCreate "Task 2: Implement token exchange"
TaskCreate "Task 3: Add refresh logic"
# Execute Task 1 → discover library handles refresh
# Task 3 is now wrong. Task tree is brittle.
```

### Good: Iterative Task Creation

```
TaskCreate "Epic: Add OAuth" [immutable requirements + anti-patterns]
TaskCreate "Task 1: Configure OAuth provider"
# Execute → learn library handles refresh automatically
TaskCreate "Task 2: Integrate with existing middleware"
# Created AFTER learning from Task 1 — reflects reality
```

### Bad: Epic Without Anti-Patterns

```
TaskCreate subject: "Epic: OAuth"
  ## Requirements
  - Users authenticate via Google OAuth2
  - Tokens stored securely
# "Tokens stored securely" is vague
# No forbidden patterns → agent rationalizes localStorage when blocked
```

### Good: Epic With Anti-Patterns

```
TaskCreate subject: "Epic: OAuth"
  ## Requirements (IMMUTABLE)
  - Tokens stored in httpOnly cookies with Secure flag
  ## Anti-Patterns (FORBIDDEN)
  - NO localStorage tokens (reason: XSS vulnerability)
  - NO mocking OAuth in integration tests (reason: defeats purpose)
# Explicit reasoning prevents watering down under pressure
```

## Critical Rules

1. **Use AskUserQuestion tool** — don't print questions as text
2. **Research BEFORE proposing** — use Explore agent for codebase context
3. **Propose 2-3 approaches** — don't jump to a single solution
4. **Epic requirements IMMUTABLE** — tasks adapt, requirements don't
5. **Include anti-patterns** — prevents watering down under pressure
6. **Create ONLY first task** — subsequent tasks created iteratively
7. **Apply task refinement** — before handoff
8. **Invoke next skill directly** — don't tell user to run it manually

**Common rationalizations (all mean STOP, follow the process):**
- "Requirements obvious" → Questions reveal hidden complexity
- "I know this pattern" → Research might show a better way
- "Can plan all tasks upfront" → Plans become brittle as you learn

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Used AskUserQuestion tool (not printed text)
- [ ] Researched codebase patterns (Explore agent)
- [ ] Proposed 2-3 approaches with trade-offs
- [ ] Created epic with all required sections
- [ ] Anti-patterns include reasoning
- [ ] Rejected approaches have DO NOT REVISIT UNLESS
- [ ] Created ONLY first task (not full tree)
- [ ] Task refined: scoped, self-contained, explicit, testable
- [ ] Asked user next step via AskUserQuestion (execute/worktree/refine)
- [ ] Invoked chosen skill directly via Skill tool

## Integration

**Calls:** Explore agent → AskUserQuestion → invokes one of:
- `gambit:executing-plans` (default)
- `gambit:using-worktrees` (optional, before execution)
- `gambit:task-refinement` (optional, before execution)
