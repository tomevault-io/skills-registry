# Parallel Agent Dispatch

## Overview

When facing 3+ independent failures, dispatch one agent per problem domain concurrently. Verify independence first, dispatch all in single message, wait for all agents, check conflicts, verify integration.

**Core principle:** Independence verification BEFORE dispatch. Single message dispatch for true parallelism.

**Iron Law:** NO dispatch without verifying independence first. ALL agents dispatched in a SINGLE message or they run sequentially. No exceptions.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using gambit:parallel-agents to investigate these independent failures concurrently."

## Rigidity Level

MEDIUM FREEDOM — Follow the 6-step process strictly. Independence verification mandatory. Parallel dispatch in single message required. Adapt agent prompt content to problem domain.

## Quick Reference

| Step | Action | STOP If |
|------|--------|---------|
| 1 | Identify domains | < 3 independent domains |
| 2 | Create agent prompts | Prompts incomplete |
| 3 | Dispatch in SINGLE message | - |
| 4 | Wait for all agents | Agent stuck > 5 min |
| 5 | Review results | Conflicts found |
| 6 | Verify integration | Tests fail |

**Why 3+?** With only 2 failures, coordination overhead often exceeds sequential time.

**Critical:** Dispatch all agents in a single message with multiple Task() calls, or they run sequentially.

## When to Use

**Use when:**
- 3+ test files failing with different root causes
- Multiple subsystems broken independently
- Each problem can be understood without context from others
- No shared state between investigations
- You've verified failures are truly independent
- Each domain has clear boundaries (different files, modules, features)

**Don't use when:**
- Failures are related (fix one might fix others)
- Need to understand full system state first
- Agents would interfere (editing same files)
- Haven't verified independence yet (exploratory phase)
- Failures share root cause (one bug, multiple symptoms)
- Need to preserve investigation order (cascading failures)
- Only 2 failures (overhead exceeds benefit)

## The Process

### Step 1: Identify Independent Domains

**Test for independence with 3 questions:**

1. **"If I fix failure A, does it affect failure B?"**
   - NO → Independent
   - YES → Related, investigate together

2. **"Do failures touch same code/files?"**
   - NO → Likely independent
   - YES → Check if different functions/areas

3. **"Do failures share error patterns?"**
   - NO → Independent
   - YES → Might be same root cause

**If < 3 independent domains: STOP.** Investigate sequentially instead.

**Create coordination Task:**

```
TaskCreate
  subject: "Parallel Investigation: [N] independent failures"
  description: |
    ## Independent Domains
    1. [Domain 1]: [files/tests]
    2. [Domain 2]: [files/tests]
    3. [Domain 3]: [files/tests]

    ## Independence Verification
    - Domain 1 vs 2: [why independent]
    - Domain 2 vs 3: [why independent]
    - Domain 1 vs 3: [why independent]

    ## Agent Status
    - [ ] Agent 1 ([Domain 1]): dispatched / returned / result
    - [ ] Agent 2 ([Domain 2]): dispatched / returned / result
    - [ ] Agent 3 ([Domain 3]): dispatched / returned / result

    ## Progress
    - [ ] All agents dispatched (single message)
    - [ ] All agents returned
    - [ ] No conflicts found
    - [ ] Integration verified (full test suite)
  activeForm: "Coordinating parallel investigation"
```

Then: `TaskUpdate taskId: "[id]" status: "in_progress"`

### Step 2: Create Focused Agent Prompts

Each agent prompt must have:

1. **Specific scope** — one test file or subsystem
2. **Clear goal** — make these tests pass
3. **Constraints** — don't change code outside scope
4. **Expected output** — summary of findings and fixes

**Good prompt structure:**

```markdown
Fix the 3 failing tests in src/agents/tool_abort_test.go:

1. "TestAbortWithPartialOutput" - expects 'interrupted at' in message
2. "TestMixedCompletedAndAborted" - fast tool aborted instead of completed
3. "TestPendingToolCount" - expects 3 results but gets 0

These are timing/race condition issues. Your task:

1. Read the test file and understand what each test verifies
2. Identify root cause - timing issues or actual bugs?
3. Fix by:
   - Replacing arbitrary timeouts with event-based waiting
   - Fixing bugs in abort implementation if found
   - Adjusting test expectations if testing changed behavior

Constraints:
- Do NOT just increase timeouts - find the real issue
- Do NOT modify files outside src/agents/
- Do NOT change behavior, only fix tests or bugs

Return: Summary of root cause and what you fixed.
```

**Bad prompts:** Too broad ("Fix all the tests"), no context ("Fix the race condition"), no constraints (agent might refactor everything).

---

### Step 3: Dispatch All Agents in SINGLE Message

**CRITICAL:** All agents in ONE message with multiple Task() calls.

```
// CORRECT - Single message, parallel execution
Task
  subagent_type: "general-purpose"
  description: "Fix tool_abort_test.go failures"
  prompt: "[prompt 1]"

Task
  subagent_type: "general-purpose"
  description: "Fix batch_completion_test.go failures"
  prompt: "[prompt 2]"

Task
  subagent_type: "general-purpose"
  description: "Fix tool_approval_test.go failures"
  prompt: "[prompt 3]"
```

```
// WRONG - Sequential messages
Task prompt1
[Wait for response]
Task prompt2  // Sequential, not parallel!
```

---

### Step 4: Wait for All Agents

- Don't start integration until ALL agents complete
- Check progress with `TaskOutput task_id: "[id]" block: false`
- If agent stuck > 5 minutes: check TaskOutput, retry with clearer prompt
- If agent needs context from another domain: wait for that agent, then restart with context

---

### Step 5: Review Results and Check Conflicts

**When all agents return:**

1. **Read each summary** — root cause, changes made, uncertainties
2. **Check for conflicts:**
   - Did multiple agents edit same files?
   - Did agents make contradictory assumptions?
   - Are there integration points between domains?
3. **Integration strategy:**
   - No conflicts → apply all changes
   - Conflicts → resolve manually before applying
   - Contradictory assumptions → verify with user

---

### Step 6: Verify Integration

Run full test suite (not just the fixed tests):

```
Task
  subagent_type: "general-purpose"
  description: "Run full test suite"
  prompt: "Run: [test command]. Report pass/fail counts and any failures."
```

**Decision tree:**
- All pass → mark coordination Task complete
- Failures → identify which agent's change caused regression

**Update coordination Task:**

```
TaskUpdate
  taskId: "[coordination-task-id]"
  description: |
    ## Results
    - Agent 1: Fixed [X] in [files]
    - Agent 2: Fixed [Y] in [files]
    - Agent 3: Fixed [Z] in [files]

    ## Conflicts
    [None / Description and resolution]

    ## Integration
    All tests pass. Changes integrated successfully.
  status: "completed"
```

---

## Critical Rules

### Rules That Have No Exceptions

1. **Verify independence first** — 3 questions before dispatching
2. **3+ domains required** — 2 failures: do sequentially
3. **Single message dispatch** — all agents in one message with multiple Task() calls
4. **Wait for ALL agents** — don't integrate until all complete
5. **Check conflicts manually** — read summaries, verify no contradictions
6. **Verify integration** — run full suite yourself, don't trust agents

### Common Excuses

All mean: **STOP. Follow the process.**

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Just 2 failures, can still parallelize" | Overhead exceeds benefit, do sequentially |
| "Probably independent, will dispatch and see" | Verify independence FIRST |
| "Can dispatch sequentially to save syntax" | Must dispatch in single message |
| "Agent failed, but others succeeded" | All agents must succeed or re-investigate |
| "Conflicts are minor, can ignore" | Resolve all conflicts explicitly |
| "Can skip verification, agents ran tests" | Agents can make mistakes, YOU verify |

## Examples

See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for detailed good/bad examples including:
- Independence verification (correct rejection vs false assumption)
- Sequential vs parallel dispatch
- Conflict detection and resolution
- Integration verification

## Verification Checklist

Before completing parallel agent work:

- [ ] Verified independence with 3 questions (fix A affects B? same code? same error?)
- [ ] 3+ independent domains identified
- [ ] Created focused agent prompts (scope, goal, constraints, output)
- [ ] Dispatched all agents in single message
- [ ] Waited for ALL agents to complete
- [ ] Read all agent summaries
- [ ] Checked for conflicts (same files, contradictory assumptions)
- [ ] Resolved any conflicts manually
- [ ] Ran full test suite
- [ ] Documented which agents fixed what
- [ ] Coordination Task marked complete

**Can't check all boxes?** Return to process.

## Integration

**This skill calls:**
- `gambit:debugging` (how to investigate individual failures)
- `gambit:verification` (verify integration)
- general-purpose agents (`subagent_type: "general-purpose"`) for parallel investigation and test running

**Called by:**
- When multiple independent test failures detected
- When multiple subsystems broken independently

**Workflow:**
```
Multiple failures detected
    ↓
Step 1: Verify independence (3+ domains)
    ↓
Step 2: Create agent prompts
    ↓
Step 3: Dispatch in SINGLE message
    ↓
Step 4: Wait for all agents
    ↓
Step 5: Review results, check conflicts
    ↓
Step 6: Verify integration
    ↓
All failures resolved
```
