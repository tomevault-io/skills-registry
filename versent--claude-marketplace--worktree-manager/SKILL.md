description: Task management using isolated git worktrees for parallel development. This skill should be used when starting new tasks, returning to in-progress work, switching between tasks, working on multiple tasks simultaneously, before executing implementation plans, or when workspace isolation is needed. Creates worktrees with safety verification. Use when this capability is needed.

# Worktree Manager - Task Assignment & Parallel Development

Automate task setup using git worktrees for parallel development workflows. Creates isolated environments for assigned tasks without disrupting current work.

## Use Cases

**Why use this skill:**

- **Parallel work** - Open 3 terminals, work on 3 tickets simultaneously without context switching
- **Human-agent collaboration** - Review code in one worktree while Claude implements in another
- **No stashing** - Each worktree preserves uncommitted changes; switch terminals, not branches
- **Team unblocking** - Push WIP, let teammates review, continue in a different worktree
- **Preserved state** - Return to exact build/test/WIP state days later

**When to invoke:**

- Starting new tickets from Jira
- Urgent task arrives mid-implementation
- Before multi-session implementation plans
- When tasks require different dependencies/builds

## Instructions

When invoked with $ARGUMENTS:

### Phase 0: Check for Existing Worktree

```bash
git worktree list
```

**If worktree exists:**

- Navigate to existing worktree: `cd <path>`
- Show current state: `git status` and `git log -1 --oneline`
- Report status and skip to Phase 6

**If worktree does not exist:**

- Proceed to Phase 1

### Phase 1: Pre-Flight Checks

1. **Check current state:** `git status`, `git worktree list`, `pwd`
2. **Parse task from $ARGUMENTS:**
   - Extract ticket number (PROJ-123, JIRA-456, etc.)
   - Determine task type (feature, fix, refactor)
   - Extract brief description
3. **Verify:** main is up-to-date, target location available

### Phase 2: Retrieve Ticket Information

If $ARGUMENTS contains a ticket ID, attempt to retrieve from Atlassian MCP:

1. Use `getAccessibleAtlassianResources` to get cloudId
2. Use `getJiraIssue` to retrieve ticket details
3. Extract issue type → branch type (Bug→fix/, Story/Task→feature/)
4. Extract summary → branch description

Fall back to manual parsing from Phase 1 if unavailable.

### Phase 3: Create Worktree with Branch

Determine worktree path: `../{repo-name}-{ticket-number}-{short-description}`

- Short description should be 1-2 words from ticket summary or task title

Determine branch name using git-branching skill conventions:

- **If Phase 2 retrieved ticket data:** Use issue type and summary from Jira
- **Otherwise:** Use task type and description from manual parsing (Phase 1)

**Create worktree with new branch in one command:**

```bash
# Fetch latest (if remote exists)
git fetch origin main 2>/dev/null || true

# Create worktree with new branch from main
# Use -b flag to avoid "branch already used" error
git worktree add -b <branch-name> <path> main

# Navigate and verify
cd <path>
git worktree list
git branch --show-current
```

### Phase 4: Verify Branch Setup

Confirm branch was created using git-branching skill conventions.

### Phase 5: Environment Setup

Check for README.md in the worktree and follow any setup instructions. The worktree is a clean copy - perform project-specific environment setup according to documentation.

### Phase 6: Confirm Ready

**For new worktree:**

```
✅ Worktree created: <path>
✅ Branch: <branch-name>
✅ Ready for implementation

Next steps:
  1. Implement task in isolated workspace
  2. Commit iteratively
```

**For existing worktree:**

```
✅ Found existing worktree: <path>
✅ Branch: <branch-name>
✅ Last commit: [message]
✅ Ready to continue
```

## Example

```bash
# With Atlassian MCP: /worktree-manager PROJ-123
# Retrieves ticket (Bug: "Fix login validation") from Jira
git worktree add -b fix/PROJ-123-login-validation ../myapp-PROJ-123-login main
cd ../myapp-PROJ-123-login

# Manual workflow: /worktree-manager feature PROJ-456 add user dashboard
git worktree add -b feature/PROJ-456-add-user-dashboard ../myapp-PROJ-456-dashboard main
cd ../myapp-PROJ-456-dashboard

# Result:
# /Users/dev/myapp/                    (main) - coordination hub
# /Users/dev/myapp-PROJ-123-login/     - isolated workspace
```

## Error Handling

**Directory exists:** Check with Phase 0, navigate to existing or use different name

**Branch checked out elsewhere:** Use `git worktree list` to find location

**Uncommitted changes in main:** No problem - worktrees isolate changes, WIP stays intact
