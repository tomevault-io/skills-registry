# Plan technical review

**Plan file:** `$ARGUMENTS` (if empty, ask the user for the plan path or pick the most recent file under `docs/plan/`).

Run the following agents in parallel to conduct a comprehensive technical review of the plan at `$ARGUMENTS`. Pass the plan path to each agent:

- @code-simplicity-review-agent: Review the plan for simplicity and clarity. Ensure the implementation is as straightforward as possible while still meeting all requirements.
- @vgv-review-agent: Review the plan for adherence to Very Good Engineering practices and project conventions. Ensure the implementation follows our established patterns and conventions.
- @plan-splitting-agent: Assess plan scope and recommend splitting into multiple PRs if the plan is too large for a single reviewable PR.

After all agents complete, if the plan-splitting-agent recommends a split:

1. Present the proposal to the developer via **AskUserQuestion** with options:
   - **Apply this split**: generate separate plan files
   - **Keep as single PR**: proceed without splitting
2. If approved, generate separate plan files:
   - The **skill** (not the agent) generates the files
   - Naming: `docs/plan/YYYY-MM-DD-<type>-<original-slug>-part-N-plan.md`
   - Each file is a standalone plan following the **same template and detail level** as the original plan
   - Each file includes all sections `/build` expects: title, type, acceptance criteria, tasks, file references. Use [standard template](references/standard.md) by default; use [minimal](references/minimal.md) for simple parts or [extensive](references/extensive.md) for complex parts.
   - Each file includes a `## Dependencies` section noting which prior PR(s) must merge first
   - Add a note at the top of the original plan file: ``> **Note:** This plan has been split into parts. See the `-part-N` files in this directory.``

If the plan-splitting-agent reports no split needed: include the scope summary in the review output, no further action.

## Handoff

**When invoked directly by the user**, use **AskUserQuestion** to present next steps after the review is complete:

**Question**: "Technical review complete! What would you like to do next?"

**Options:**

1. **Clear context and build (Recommended)**: clear context for a fresh start, then build
2. **Start building**: execute the plan with `/build`
3. **Refine the plan**: improve the plan based on review findings
4. **Done for now**: review complete

**If the user selects "Clear context and build"** → Follow the [clear context handoff](references/clear-context-handoff.md) for `/build` with the actual plan file path. Then stop.

**When invoked by another skill** (e.g., from `/plan`), return control to the caller after the review completes — do not present handoff options.
