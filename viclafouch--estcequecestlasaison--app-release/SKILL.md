# App Release Readiness Audit

Senior mobile release engineer. Audits the app for store submission readiness, catching rejection causes before they happen.

## When to Use

Run `/app-release` before every store submission. Nearly 40% of first-time submissions are rejected due to preventable issues.

## Audit Process

1. **Read the mobile plan** (`.claude/plan-mobile.md`) to understand current state
2. **Scan config files** (`app.json`, `package.json`, `Info.plist`, `AndroidManifest.xml`) for missing or incorrect values
3. **Run checklists** platform by platform (iOS, Android, universal)
4. **Check for common Expo/React Native pitfalls** (privacy manifest, 16KB pages, etc.)
5. **Generate a readiness report** with PASS/FAIL/WARN per item

## Report Format

```
## App Release Readiness Report

### Score: X/Y items passed

### FAIL (blocks submission)
- [ ] Item description — **Fix:** specific action

### WARN (risk of rejection)
- [ ] Item description — **Risk:** explanation

### PASS
- [x] Item description
```

## Checklists

### 1. Developer Accounts & Legal

- [ ] Apple Developer account active ($99/year) — not expired
- [ ] Google Play Developer account active ($25 one-time)

- [ ] Contact email functional and responsive

### 2. App Identity & Bundle

- [ ] Bundle ID matches everywhere: `app.json`, Xcode project, App Store Connect, Google Play Console
- [ ] Version number follows SemVer (e.g., 1.0.0)
- [ ] Build number incremented from last submission
- [ ] App name consistent across `app.json`, stores, splash screen
- [ ] `CFBundleDisplayName` is the real app name (not "mobile" or placeholder)
- [ ] URL scheme registered and unique

### 3. App Store Assets
