# Backend MVP Guardrails

## Overview

Minimize irreversible decisions. Every write must be idempotent, every aggregate must be replayable, and every incident must be attributable with minimal evidence.

## When to Use

- MVP backend with single-digit USD/month budget or strict capacity limits
- Fast schema evolution or new data sources with unknown fields
- Third-party backend dependency (e.g., InsForge) with no status page or DB metrics
- Repeated ambiguity about whether failures are vendor or application issues

When NOT to use: throwaway prototypes where data loss and misattribution are acceptable.

## Core Pattern (Two Layers)

### Layer 1: Principle Guardrails (platform-agnostic)

1. **Source of truth is immutable or append-only.** Avoid online recomputation on read paths.
2. **Idempotent writes.** Deterministic keys + upsert or unique constraint.
3. **Replayable aggregates.** Derived tables can be rebuilt from the source of truth.
4. **Evidence-first attribution.** No structured evidence, no blame, no destructive fix.
5. **Cost-first queries.** Pre-aggregate, cap ranges, enforce limits, avoid full scans.
6. **Schema evolution is additive.** New fields are optional and versioned; unknown fields are rejected by allowlist.

### Layer 2: Platform Mapping (InsForge example)

- **Fact table:** half-hour buckets (e.g., `vibescore_tracker_hourly`)
- **Idempotency key:** `user_id + device_id + source + model + hour_start`
- **Aggregates:** derived from buckets; do not read raw event tables for dashboards
- **Retention:** keep aggregates longer; cap any event-level tables
- **Backfill:** limited window + upsert; must be replayable
- **Observability:** M1 structured logs (see below)

## Responsibility Attribution Protocol (M1)

**Required fields:** `request_id`, `function`, `stage`, `status`, `latency_ms`, `error_code`, `upstream_status`, `upstream_latency_ms`

**Attribution rules:**

- Missing `upstream_status` => **UNKNOWN** (do not change data semantics)
- `upstream_status` is 5xx/timeout and function status is 5xx => likely vendor/backbone issue
- `upstream_status` is 2xx and function status is 4xx/5xx => likely application validation/logic issue
- `latency_ms` high and `upstream_latency_ms` low => likely application-side bottleneck

**Stop rule:** no data rewrite, schema change, or semantic patch without a replay plan and rollback.

## Quick Reference

| Guardrail             | Why                     | Minimum Implementation               |
| --------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Idempotent writes     | Prevent double-counting | Unique key + upsert                  |
| Replayable aggregates | Safe fixes              | Source-of-truth table + backfill job |
| Cost caps             | Fit low budget          | Range limits + pre-aggregates        |
| Evidence-first        | Avoid misfix            | M1 structured logs                   |
| Schema allowlist      | Avoid data bloat        | Reject unknown fields                |

## Implementation Example (Structured Log)

```js
const start = Date.now();
const requestId = crypto.randomUUID();
const log = (entry) =>
  console.log(
    JSON.stringify({
      request_id: requestId,
      function: "example-function",
      ...entry,
    }),
  );

try {
  const upstreamStart = Date.now();
  const res = await fetch(upstreamUrl);
  const upstreamLatency = Date.now() - upstreamStart;

  log({
    stage: "upstream",
    status: res.status,
    upstream_status: res.status,
    upstream_latency_ms: upstreamLatency,
    latency_ms: Date.now() - start,
    error_code: res.ok ? null : "UPSTREAM_ERROR",
  });
} catch (err) {
  log({
    stage: "exception",
    status: 500,
    upstream_status: null,
    upstream_latency_ms: null,
    latency_ms: Date.now() - start,
    error_code: "UPSTREAM_TIMEOUT",
  });
  throw err;
}
```

## Common Mistakes

- Online aggregation in dashboard endpoints under low budget
- Adding new data sources without updating idempotency keys
- Blame without `upstream_status` evidence
- Storing full payloads "just in case" (privacy and cost risk)
- Changing data semantics without replay/backfill plan

## Rationalization Table

| Excuse                                  | Reality                                         |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| "We are a tiny team, logs are overkill" | Small teams need stronger evidence, not weaker. |
| "Vendor is unstable, we cannot know"    | You still need M1 logs to avoid misfixes.       |
| "Budget is low so scans are fine"       | Low budget means scans fail sooner.             |
| "We can patch the numbers"              | Patches without replay create permanent drift.  |

## Red Flags - STOP

- No structured logs but attempting responsibility attribution
- Data rewrite without replay/backfill plan
- Dashboard reads from raw event tables
- Unknown fields stored without allowlist
- Idempotency key not updated when adding dimensions
