# Retrofitting Codebases

## Quick Start

```
Retrofit Progress:
- [ ] Discovery: survey codebase, map features
- [ ] Archaeology: trace behavior per feature
- [ ] Gaps: compare actual vs intended behavior
- [ ] Assumptions: surface hidden dependencies
- [ ] Specs: generate from findings
```

All outputs go in `.retrofit/` directory.

## Phase Navigation

Brownfield work is iterative. Use this decision tree after any phase:

```
After any phase:
├─ Found new entry points? → Update discovery.md, continue
├─ Archaeology reveals missed assumptions? → Add to assumptions.md
├─ Gap analysis shows incomplete findings? → Return to archaeology
├─ Need human decision? → STOP, ask user, wait for answer
└─ Phase complete and validated? → Proceed to next phase
```

**IMPORTANT**: Do not proceed to spec generation without explicit user confirmation of:

1. Discovery feature map is complete
2. Archaeology findings are accurate
3. Gap classifications are correct
4. Assumptions have been reviewed

See: [checkpoints.md](checkpoints.md) - Human validation gates

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Discovery

Survey before diving deep. Create `.retrofit/discovery.md`:

```
Entry Points:
- [ ] API endpoints (grep: Route, MapGet, HttpPost)
- [ ] CLI commands (grep: Command, ArgParser)
- [ ] Background jobs (grep: Cron, Schedule, BackgroundService)
- [ ] Event handlers (grep: Subscribe, Handler, Consumer)

Feature Map:
| Feature | Entry Points | Core Files | Test Coverage |
|---------|--------------|------------|---------------|
| {name}  | {endpoints}  | {files}    | {low/med/high}|

Priority: (security-critical, customer-facing, low-coverage first)
```

### Phase 2: Archaeology (per feature)

Trace what code actually does. Create `.retrofit/features/{name}-findings.md`:

```
Happy Path:
1. {entry point} receives {input}
2. {what happens step by step}
3. {what gets returned/stored}

Branches:
| Condition | Location | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|----------|

Business Rules Found:
- {rule}: {file:line} - explicit|implicit

Assumptions:
| Assumption | Location | Validated? | Risk |
|------------|----------|------------|------|
```

See: [archaeology-checklist.md](archaeology-checklist.md)

### Phase 3: Gap Analysis

Compare actual vs intended. Create `.retrofit/gaps.md`:

```
| ID | Expected (from docs/tests) | Actual (from code) | Type |
|----|----------------------------|--------------------|------|
| G1 | {expected behavior}        | {actual behavior}  | bug|intentional|unclear |
```

Types:
- **bug**: Code wrong, docs right → fix code
- **intentional**: Changed on purpose → update docs  
- **unclear**: No source of truth → get decision

### Phase 4: Assumptions

Surface hidden dependencies. Create `.retrofit/assumptions.md`:

```
| Category | Assumption | Location | Validated? | Risk |
|----------|------------|----------|------------|------|
| data     | email not null | User.cs:34 | no null check | high |
| env      | server is UTC | Token.cs:12 | DateTime.Now | high |
| timing   | API responds <1s | Client.cs:45 | no timeout | med |
| security | input trusted | Import.cs:23 | no sanitize | critical |
```

### Phase 5: Spec Generation

Create `.retrofit/features/{name}-spec.md` using findings:

```markdown
# Spec: {Feature}

## Status

- Implementation: Exists (retrofitted)
- Spec Status: Draft

## Versions

| Version | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| v1 | Current behavior (from archaeology) | Documented |
| v2 | Target behavior (after gap fixes) | Pending approval |

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC-1: {description}

**v1 (Current)**:
Given {current precondition from archaeology}
When {action}
Then {current outcome}

**v2 (Target)** [Gap: G-{N}]:
Given {intended precondition}
When {action}
Then {intended outcome}

**Migration**: {what changes between v1 and v2}

## Known Issues

| Issue | Type | Gap | Action |
|-------|------|-----|--------|
| {description} | bug/drift/missing | G-{N} | fix code/update docs |

## Assumptions

{from assumptions phase - mark validated vs unvalidated}
```

## Resuming Work

When continuing from a previous session:

1. **Check for drift**:

   ```bash
   git status                    # Any changes not in session log?
   git diff .retrofit/           # Were findings modified?
   ```

2. **Validate current state**:
   - Read last session log
   - Verify .retrofit/ files match session log state
   - If mismatch: reconcile before proceeding

3. **Re-orient**:

   ```text
   Current phase: {from session log}
   Completed: {features/phases done}
   In progress: {current work}
   Blocked on: {any blockers}
   ```
