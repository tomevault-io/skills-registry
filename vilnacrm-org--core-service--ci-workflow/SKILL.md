# CI Workflow Skill

This skill guides you through running comprehensive CI quality checks before committing code changes.

## When to Use This Skill

Activate this skill when:

- User explicitly asks to "run CI" or "run quality checks"
- Before finishing any task that involves code changes
- After making significant code modifications
- Before creating a pull request
- When validating code quality

## Workflow Steps

### 0. Preserve CI entrypoints through the Makefile

When you touch GitHub Actions workflows, call the project through Makefile entrypoints instead of re-encoding raw `docker compose` or `vendor/bin/*` commands inside the workflow.

- Prefer `make start` / `make up` for service startup
- Prefer `make psalm`, `make deptrac`, `CI=1 make phpinsights`, etc. for quality jobs
- Keep environment-specific command wiring centralized in `Makefile`

This avoids workflow drift when the Makefile grows prerequisites like `phpmd`, service setup, or shared CI flags.

### 1. Run Comprehensive CI Command

Execute the primary CI command that runs all quality checks:

```bash
make ci
```

**Expected Outcome**: The command MUST output "✅ CI checks successfully passed!" at the end.

### 2. Monitor CI Execution

The `make ci` command runs these checks in sequence:

1. Composer validation
2. Security vulnerability analysis
3. Code style fixes (PHP CS Fixer)
4. Static analysis (Psalm)
   - Includes repository source-pattern guardrails for hardcoded `new` in `src/` and native `array` type declarations in `src/`
5. Security taint analysis (Psalm)
6. Code quality analysis (PHPInsights)
7. Architecture validation (Deptrac)
8. Unit tests
9. Integration tests
10. End-to-end tests (Behat)
11. Mutation testing (Infection)

### 3. Handle Failures

**If CI fails** (output shows "❌ CI checks failed:"):

1. **Identify the failing check** from the error output
2. **Fix the specific issue**:
   - Code style: Review PHP CS Fixer suggestions
   - Static analysis: Fix Psalm type errors
   - Quality issues: Address PHPInsights warnings (reduce complexity, fix architecture)
   - Test failures: Debug and fix failing tests
   - Mutation testing: Add missing test cases or refactor for testability

3. **Run individual check** to verify fix:

   ```bash
   make phpcsfixer    # For code style issues
   make psalm         # For static analysis errors
   make phpinsights   # For quality issues
   make unit-tests    # For unit test failures
   make infection     # For mutation testing issues
   ```

4. **Re-run full CI** after fixes:
   ```bash
   make ci
   ```

### 4. Iterate Until Success

**CRITICAL**: Keep fixing issues and re-running `make ci` until you see:

```text
✅ CI checks successfully passed!
```

**DO NOT finish the task** until this success message appears.

### 5. Quality Standards Protection

**NEVER decrease these quality thresholds**:

- PHPInsights min-quality: 100% (src/), 95% (tests/)
- PHPInsights min-complexity: 93% (src/), 95% (tests/)
- PHPInsights min-architecture: 100% (src/), 90% (tests/)
- PHPInsights min-style: 100% (src/), 95% (tests/)
- Mutation testing MSI: 100%
- Test coverage: 100%

If quality checks fail, **fix the code**, don't lower the standards.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### High Cyclomatic Complexity

**Problem**: PHPInsights reports complexity score too low
**Solution**:

1. Run `make phpmd` to identify complex methods
2. Refactor by extracting methods or using strategy pattern
3. Keep methods under 5 complexity score

### Escaped Mutants

**Problem**: Infection finds untested code mutations
**Solution**:

1. Review the mutation diff in infection output
2. Add specific test cases for edge cases
3. Consider refactoring for better testability (injectable time, extracted methods)

### Architecture Violations

**Problem**: Deptrac reports layer violations
**Solution**:

1. Review the dependency rule violation
2. Move code to appropriate layer
3. Follow hexagonal architecture principles

## Success Criteria

- Command outputs "✅ CI checks successfully passed!"
- All quality metrics meet or exceed thresholds
- Zero test failures
- Zero escaped mutants
- Zero architecture violations
