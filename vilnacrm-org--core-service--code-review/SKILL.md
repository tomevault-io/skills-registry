# Code Review Workflow Skill

## Context (Input)

- PR has unresolved code review comments
- Need systematic approach to address feedback
- Ready to implement reviewer suggestions
- Need to verify DDD architecture compliance
- Need to ensure code organization best practices
- Need to maintain quality standards

## Task (Function)

Retrieve PR comments, categorize by type, verify architecture compliance, enforce code organization principles, and implement all changes systematically while maintaining 100% quality standards.

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Get PR Comments

```bash
make pr-comments              # Auto-detect from current branch
make pr-comments PR=62       # Specify PR number
make pr-comments FORMAT=json  # JSON output
```

**Output**: All unresolved comments with file/line, author, timestamp, URL

### Step 2: Categorize Comments

| Type                   | Identifier                  | Priority | Action                               |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Committable Suggestion | Code block, "```suggestion" | Highest  | Apply immediately, commit separately |
| LLM Prompt             | "🤖 Prompt for AI Agents"   | High     | Execute prompt, implement changes    |
| Architecture Concern   | Class naming, file location | High     | Verify DDD compliance (see Step 2.1) |
| Question               | Ends with "?"               | Medium   | Answer inline or via code change     |
| General Feedback       | Discussion, recommendation  | Low      | Consider and improve                 |

#### Step 2.1: Architecture & Code Organization Verification

For any code changes (suggestions, prompts, or new files), **MANDATORY** verification:

**A. Code Organization Principle** (see `code-organization` skill):

> **Directory X contains ONLY class type X**

Verify class is in the correct directory for its type:

- `Converter/` → ONLY converters (type conversion)
- `Transformer/` → ONLY transformers (data transformation for DB/serialization)
- `Validator/` → ONLY validators (validation logic)
- `Builder/` → ONLY builders (object construction)
- `Fixer/` → ONLY fixers (modify/correct data)
- `Cleaner/` → ONLY cleaners (filter/clean data)
- `Factory/` → ONLY factories (create complex objects)
- `Resolver/` → ONLY resolvers (resolve/determine values)
- `Serializer/` → ONLY serializers/normalizers

**B. Class Naming Compliance** (see `implementing-ddd-architecture` skill):

| Layer              | Class Type         | Naming Pattern                       | Example                           |
| ------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| **Domain**         | Entity             | `{EntityName}.php`                   | `Customer.php`                    |
|                    | Value Object       | `{ConceptName}.php`                  | `Email.php`, `Money.php`          |
|                    | Domain Event       | `{Entity}{PastTenseAction}.php`      | `CustomerCreated.php`             |
|                    | Repository Iface   | `{Entity}RepositoryInterface.php`    | `CustomerRepositoryInterface.php` |
|                    | Exception          | `{SpecificError}Exception.php`       | `InvalidEmailException.php`       |
| **Application**    | Command            | `{Action}{Entity}Command.php`        | `CreateCustomerCommand.php`       |
|                    | Command Handler    | `{Action}{Entity}Handler.php`        | `CreateCustomerHandler.php`       |
|                    | Event Subscriber   | `{Action}On{Event}.php`              | `SendEmailOnCustomerCreated.php`  |
|                    | DTO                | `{Entity}{Type}.php`                 | `CustomerInput.php`               |
|                    | Processor          | `{Action}{Entity}Processor.php`      | `CreateCustomerProcessor.php`     |
|                    | Transformer        | `{From}To{To}Transformer.php`        | `CustomerToArrayTransformer.php`  |
| **Infrastructure** | Repository         | `{Technology}{Entity}Repository.php` | `MongoDBCustomerRepository.php`   |
|                    | Doctrine Type      | `{ConceptName}Type.php`              | `UlidType.php`                    |
|                    | Bus Implementation | `{Framework}{Type}Bus.php`           | `SymfonyCommandBus.php`           |

**Directory Location Compliance**:

```

```

**Verification Questions**:

1. ✅ Is the class following **"Directory X contains ONLY class type X"** principle?
   - Example: `UlidValidator` must be in `Validator/`, NOT in `Transformer/` or `Converter/`
2. ✅ Is the class name following the DDD naming pattern for its type?
3. ✅ Is the class in the correct directory according to its responsibility?
4. ✅ Does the class name reflect what it actually does?
5. ✅ Is the class in the correct layer (Domain/Application/Infrastructure)?
6. ✅ Does Domain layer have NO framework imports (Symfony/Doctrine/API Platform)?
7. ✅ Are variable names specific (not vague)?
   - ✅ `$typeConverter`, `$scalarResolver` (specific)
   - ❌ `$converter`, `$resolver` (too vague)
8. ✅ Are parameter names accurate (match actual types)?
   - ✅ `mixed $value` when accepts any type
   - ❌ `string $binary` when accepts mixed

**C. Namespace Consistency**:

Namespace **MUST** match directory structure exactly:

```php
✅ CORRECT:
// File: src/Shared/Infrastructure/Validator/UlidValidator.php
namespace App\Shared\Infrastructure\Validator;

❌ WRONG:
// File: src/Shared/Infrastructure/Validator/UlidValidator.php
namespace App\Shared\Infrastructure\Transformer;  // Mismatch!
```

**D. PHP Best Practices**:

- ✅ Use constructor property promotion
- ✅ Inject ALL dependencies (no default instantiation)
- ✅ Use `readonly` when appropriate
- ✅ Use `final` for classes that shouldn't be extended
- ✅ In `src/`, prefer factories/DI over hardcoded `new` expressions; if an exception is unavoidable, document it and keep it rare
- ✅ In `src/`, prefer typed collections/value objects over native `array` type declarations in method/property signatures
- ❌ NO "Helper" or "Util" classes (code smell - extract specific responsibilities)

**E. Factory Pattern (Maintainability & Flexibility)**:

> **Use factories when creating typed classes with dependencies or configuration**

Factories provide maintainability, flexibility, and testability for object creation:

| Scenario                         | Direct Instantiation | Factory              |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| Simple value objects             | ✅ Acceptable        | Optional             |
| Objects with config/dependencies | ❌ Avoid             | ✅ Required          |
| Objects created in production    | ❌ Avoid             | ✅ Required          |
| Objects created in tests         | ✅ Acceptable        | Optional (for speed) |

**Benefits of factories**:

- ✅ Centralized object creation logic
- ✅ Easy to inject different implementations (testing, staging, prod)
- ✅ Configuration changes don't affect consumers
- ✅ Single place to add validation/transformation
- ✅ Enables dependency injection for complex objects

**Example**:

```php
// ❌ BAD: Direct instantiation with configuration
public function emit(BusinessMetric $metric): void
{
    $timestamp = (int)(microtime(true) * 1000);
    $payload = new EmfPayload(
        new EmfAwsMetadata($timestamp, new EmfCloudWatchMetricConfig(...)),
        new EmfDimensionValueCollection(...),
        new EmfMetricValueCollection(...)
    );
    $this->logger->info($payload);
}

// ✅ GOOD: Factory handles complexity
public function emit(BusinessMetric $metric): void
{
    $payload = $this->payloadFactory->createFromMetric($metric);
    $this->logger->info($payload);
}
```

**Factory naming convention**:

- `{ObjectName}Factory` - creates `{ObjectName}` instances
- Location: Same namespace as the object being created
- Example: `EmfPayloadFactory` creates `EmfPayload`

**When factories are REQUIRED** (in production code):

1. Objects with injected dependencies (timestamp providers, config, etc.)
2. Objects that require complex construction logic
3. Objects that might need different implementations per environment
4. Objects created from external input (DTOs, metrics, etc.)

**When factories are OPTIONAL** (in tests):

- Tests can instantiate objects directly for simplicity
- Test-specific factories can be created for reusable test fixtures

**F. Classes Over Arrays (Type Safety)**:

> **Prefer typed classes and collections over arrays for structured data**

Arrays lack type safety and self-documentation. Use concrete classes instead:

| Pattern       | Bad (Array)                               | Good (Class)                                |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Configuration | `['endpoint' => 'X', 'operation' => 'Y']` | `new EndpointOperationDimensions('X', 'Y')` |
| Return data   | `return ['name' => $n, 'value' => $v]`    | `return new MetricData($n, $v)`             |
| Method params | `function emit(array $metrics)`           | `function emit(MetricCollection $metrics)`  |
| Events data   | `['type' => 'created', 'id' => $id]`      | `new CustomerCreatedEvent($id)`             |

**Benefits of typed classes**:

- ✅ IDE autocompletion and refactoring support
- ✅ Static analysis catches type errors
- ✅ Self-documenting code (class name describes purpose)
- ✅ Encapsulation (validation in constructor)
- ✅ Single Responsibility (each class has clear purpose)
- ✅ Open/Closed (extend via new classes, not array key changes)

**Collection Pattern**:

```php
// ❌ BAD: Array of arrays
$metrics = [
    ['name' => 'OrdersPlaced', 'value' => 1],
    ['name' => 'OrderValue', 'value' => 99.99],
];

// ✅ GOOD: Typed collection of objects
$metrics = new MetricCollection(
    new OrdersPlacedMetric(value: 1),
    new OrderValueMetric(value: 99.99)
);
```

**When arrays ARE acceptable**:

- Simple key-value maps for serialization output (`toArray()` methods)
- Framework integration points requiring arrays
- Temporary internal data within a single method

**Action on Violations**:

1. **Class in Wrong Directory**:

   ```bash
   # Move file to correct directory
   mv src/Path/WrongDir/ClassName.php src/Path/CorrectDir/ClassName.php

   # Update namespace in file
   # Update all imports across codebase
   grep -r "use.*WrongDir\\ClassName" src/ tests/
   ```

2. **Wrong Class Name**:
   - Rename class to follow naming conventions
   - Update all references to renamed class
   - Ensure name reflects actual functionality

3. **Vague Variable/Parameter Names**:

   ```php
   ❌ BEFORE: private UlidTypeConverter $converter;
   ✅ AFTER:  private UlidTypeConverter $typeConverter;

   ❌ BEFORE: private CustomerUpdateScalarResolver $resolver;
   ✅ AFTER:  private CustomerUpdateScalarResolver $scalarResolver;
   ```

4. **Quality Verification**:
   ```bash
   make phpcsfixer    # Fix code style
   make psalm         # Static analysis
   make deptrac       # Verify no layer violations
   make unit-tests    # Run tests
   ```

### Step 3: Apply Changes Systematically

#### For Committable Suggestions

1. Apply code change exactly as suggested
2. Commit with reference:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Apply review suggestion: [brief description]

   Ref: [comment URL]"
   ```

#### For LLM Prompts

1. Copy prompt from comment
2. Execute as instructed
3. Verify output meets requirements
4. Commit with reference

#### For Questions

1. Determine if code change or reply needed
2. If code: implement + commit
3. If reply: respond on GitHub

#### For Feedback

1. Evaluate suggestion merit
2. Implement if beneficial
3. Document reasoning if declined

### Step 4: Verify All Addressed

```bash
make pr-comments  # Should show zero unresolved comments
```

### Step 5: Run Quality Checks

**MANDATORY**: Run comprehensive CI checks after implementing all changes:

```bash
make ci  # Must output "✅ CI checks successfully passed!"
```

**If CI fails**, address issues systematically:

1. **Code Style Issues**: `make phpcsfixer`
2. **Static Analysis Errors**: `make psalm`
3. **Architecture Violations**: `make deptrac`
4. **Test Failures**: `make unit-tests` / `make integration-tests`
5. **Mutation Testing**: `make infection` (must maintain 100% MSI)
6. **Complexity Issues**:
   - Run `make phpmd` first to identify specific hotspots
   - Refactor complex methods (keep complexity < 5 per method)
   - Re-run `make phpinsights`

**Quality Standards Protection** (see `quality-standards` skill):

- **PHPInsights**: 100% quality, 93% src / 95% tests complexity, 100% architecture, 100% style
- **Test Coverage**: 100% (no decrease allowed)
- **Mutation Testing**: 100% MSI, 0 escaped mutants
- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: < 5 per class/method

**DO NOT** finish the task until `make ci` shows: `✅ CI checks successfully passed!`

## Comment Resolution Workflow

```mermaid
PR Comments → Categorize → Apply by Priority → Verify → Run CI → Done
```

## Constraints (Parameters)

**NEVER**:

- Skip committable suggestions
- Batch unrelated changes in one commit
- Ignore LLM prompts from reviewers
- Commit without running `make ci`
- Leave questions unanswered
- Accept class names that don't follow DDD naming patterns
- Place files in wrong directories (violates layer architecture)
- Allow Domain layer to import framework code (Symfony/Doctrine/API Platform)
- Put class in wrong type directory (e.g., Validator in Transformer/)
- Use vague variable names like `$converter`, `$resolver` (be specific!)
- Create "Helper" or "Util" classes (extract specific responsibilities)
- Allow namespace to mismatch directory structure
- Decrease quality thresholds (PHPInsights, test coverage, mutation score)
- Allow cyclomatic complexity > 5 per method
- Finish task before `make ci` shows success message
- Use arrays for structured data when typed classes would be more appropriate
- Inject cross-cutting concerns (metrics, logging) directly into command handlers - use event subscribers instead
- Create complex objects directly without factories in production code (use factories for maintainability)
- Put OpenAPI schema-correctness logic in post-export patchers (fix the generation/runtime path instead)
- Add suppression lines like `@infection-ignore-all` (write strict/good code instead)
- Use the `+=` trick for arrays (use explicit code for readability)
- Use short-circuit evaluation for imperative flow where readability suffers

**ALWAYS**:

- Apply suggestions exactly as provided
- Commit each suggestion separately with URL reference
- Verify **"Directory X contains ONLY class type X"** principle
- Verify architecture compliance for any new/modified classes
- Check class naming follows DDD patterns (see Step 2.1)
- Verify files are in correct directories according to layer AND type
- Ensure namespace matches directory structure exactly
- Use specific variable names (`$typeConverter`, not `$converter`)
- Use accurate parameter names (match actual types)
- Run `make deptrac` to ensure no layer violations
- Run `make ci` after implementing changes
- Address ALL quality standard violations before finishing
- Maintain 100% test coverage and 100% MSI (0 escaped mutants)
- Keep cyclomatic complexity < 5 per method
- Mark conversations resolved after addressing
- Prefer typed classes over arrays for structured data (configuration, DTOs, events)
- Use collections (`MetricCollection`, `EntityCollection`) instead of arrays of objects
- Add new features via new classes following Open/Closed principle (don't modify existing classes)
- Use factories for creating objects with dependencies or complex construction (required in production, optional in tests)
- Fix OpenAPI generation/runtime code for spec correctness; keep any export-time normalizer thin, idempotent, and parity-safe (for example, trimming stable timestamps or ordering keys without changing schema semantics)
- Write strict, testable code instead of adding suppression annotations
- Use explicit, readable code instead of array tricks like `+=`
- Prefer explicit control flow over short-circuit evaluation for imperative operations

## Common Code Organization Issues in Reviews

### Issue 1: Class in Wrong Type Directory

**Scenario**: `UlidValidator` placed in `Transformer/` directory

```bash
❌ WRONG:
src/Shared/Infrastructure/Transformer/UlidValidator.php

✅ CORRECT:
src/Shared/Infrastructure/Validator/UlidValidator.php
```

**Fix**:

```bash
mv src/Shared/Infrastructure/Transformer/UlidValidator.php \
   src/Shared/Infrastructure/Validator/UlidValidator.php
# Update namespace and all imports
```

### Issue 2: Vague Variable Names

**Scenario**: Generic variable names in constructor

```php
❌ WRONG:
public function __construct(
    private UlidTypeConverter $converter,  // Converter of what?
) {}

✅ CORRECT:
public function __construct(
    private UlidTypeConverter $typeConverter,  // Specific!
) {}
```

### Issue 3: Misleading Parameter Names

**Scenario**: Parameter name doesn't match actual type

```php
❌ WRONG:
public function fromBinary(mixed $binary): Ulid  // Accepts mixed, not just binary

✅ CORRECT:
public function fromBinary(mixed $value): Ulid  // Accurate!
```

### Issue 4: Helper/Util Classes

**Scenario**: Code review flags `CustomerHelper` class

```php
❌ WRONG:
class CustomerHelper {
    public function validateEmail() {}
    public function formatName() {}
    public function convertData() {}
}

✅ CORRECT: Extract specific responsibilities
- CustomerEmailValidator (Validator/)
- CustomerNameFormatter (Formatter/)
- CustomerDataConverter (Converter/)
```

### Issue 5: Arrays Instead of Typed Classes

**Scenario**: Method returns/accepts arrays for structured data

```php
❌ WRONG: Array for configuration/data
public function emit(array $metrics): void
{
    foreach ($metrics as $metric) {
        $name = $metric['name'];     // No type safety
        $value = $metric['value'];   // No IDE support
    }
}

✅ CORRECT: Typed collection of objects
public function emit(MetricCollection $metrics): void
{
    foreach ($metrics as $metric) {
        $name = $metric->name();     // Type-safe
        $value = $metric->value();   // IDE autocomplete
    }
}
```

### Issue 6: Missing Factory for Complex Object Creation

**Scenario**: Complex objects created directly in production code

```php
❌ WRONG: Direct instantiation with configuration
final class AwsEmfBusinessMetricsEmitter
{
    public function emit(BusinessMetric $metric): void
    {
        $timestamp = (int)(microtime(true) * 1000);
        $dimensionValues = [];
        foreach ($metric->dimensions()->toArray() as $key => $value) {
            $dimensionValues[] = new EmfDimensionValue($key, $value);
        }
        $payload = new EmfPayload(
            new EmfAwsMetadata($timestamp, new EmfCloudWatchMetricConfig(...)),
            new EmfDimensionValueCollection(...$dimensionValues),
            new EmfMetricValueCollection(new EmfMetricValue($metric->name(), $metric->value()))
        );
        // Complex construction logic mixed with business logic
    }
}

✅ CORRECT: Factory encapsulates complexity
final class AwsEmfBusinessMetricsEmitter
{
    public function __construct(
        private EmfPayloadFactory $payloadFactory  // Factory injected
    ) {}

    public function emit(BusinessMetric $metric): void
    {
        $payload = $this->payloadFactory->createFromMetric($metric);
        // Clean separation - emitter only handles emission
    }
}
```

**Note**: In tests, direct instantiation is acceptable for simplicity and speed.

### Issue 7: Cross-Cutting Concerns in Handlers

**Scenario**: Metrics/logging injected directly into command handlers

```php
❌ WRONG: Metrics in command handler
final class CreateCustomerHandler
{
    public function __construct(
        private CustomerRepository $repository,
        private BusinessMetricsEmitterInterface $metrics  // Wrong place!
    ) {}

    public function __invoke(CreateCustomerCommand $cmd): void
    {
        $customer = Customer::create(...);
        $this->repository->save($customer);
        $this->metrics->emit(new CustomersCreatedMetric());  // Violates SRP
    }
}

✅ CORRECT: Metrics in dedicated event subscriber
final class CreateCustomerHandler
{
    public function __construct(
        private CustomerRepository $repository,
        private EventBusInterface $eventBus
    ) {}

    public function __invoke(CreateCustomerCommand $cmd): void
    {
        $customer = Customer::create(...);
        $this->repository->save($customer);
        $this->eventBus->publish(...$customer->pullDomainEvents());
        // Metrics subscriber handles emission
    }
}

final class CustomerCreatedMetricsSubscriber implements DomainEventSubscriberInterface
{
    public function __invoke(CustomerCreatedEvent $event): void
    {
        // Error handling is automatic via DomainEventMessageHandler.
        // Subscribers are executed in async workers - failures are logged + emit metrics.
        // This ensures observability never breaks the main request (AP from CAP).
        $this->metricsEmitter->emit($this->metricFactory->create());
    }
}
```
