# Documentation Sync

## When To Update Docs

Update docs in the same change when you modify:

- Makefile targets or command behavior.
- Test strategy, mock behavior, or CI expectations.
- Feature/module structure.
- Agent skill layout or guidance.
- User-visible flows that existing docs describe.

## Places To Check

- `CLAUDE.md`
- `agents.md`
- `.claude/skills/`
- README files near changed features
- Test or workflow docs under `tests/`, `scripts/`, or `docs/`

## Sync Rules

- Keep `.agents/skills` as the BMAD location.
- Keep `.claude/skills` for non-BMAD frontend project skills.
- When `make format` changes behavior, mention that it includes Prettier and
  `qlty fmt`.
- Do not copy backend-only user-service instructions into frontend docs.

## Verification

```bash
make format
make lint-md
make lint
```

## Related Guides

Before applying this skill, confirm the active task against
[../AI-AGENT-GUIDE.md](../AI-AGENT-GUIDE.md) and
[../SKILL-DECISION-GUIDE.md](../SKILL-DECISION-GUIDE.md) so every relevant
skill is consulted.

## Line Length Disclosure

Before presenting changes, check changed text files for lines longer than 100 characters.
If any exist, tell the user each `path:line` and measured character count.
Treat this as disclosure, not failure, unless a project gate fails.
