# Release Production

Merge master (staging) into published (production) with proper changelog documentation.

## Usage

```
/release-production
```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Pre-Flight Checks

Verify we're ready to release:

```bash
# Ensure we're in the main repo (not a worktree)
MAIN_REPO="$HOME/Development/VIPER/CoreApps/viper-metrics-v2-0"
cd "$MAIN_REPO"

# Fetch latest from remote
git fetch origin

# Check current branch
git branch --show-current

# Check for uncommitted changes
git status --porcelain

# Verify master and published are up to date
git log origin/master..master --oneline
git log origin/published..published --oneline
```

**Validations:**
- Must be in the main repo (not a worktree)
- No uncommitted changes
- Local branches in sync with remote

### Step 2: Identify Changes for Release

Get all changes that will be released:

```bash
# Get commits on master that aren't in published
git log origin/published..origin/master --oneline

# Get the list of merged PRs
git log origin/published..origin/master --merges --oneline

# Get detailed info on PRs included
gh pr list --state merged --base master --json number,title,mergedAt,labels,author --jq '.[] | select(.mergedAt > "LAST_RELEASE_DATE")'
```

Create a summary of what's being released:

```bash
# Find all PRs merged since last release
# Look at the published branch's last commit date
LAST_RELEASE=$(git log origin/published -1 --format="%cI")

# Get PRs merged to master after that date
gh pr list --state merged --base master --json number,title,mergedAt,labels --jq "[.[] | select(.mergedAt > \"$LAST_RELEASE\")]"
```

**Output a summary:**
> ## Changes Ready for Release
>
> **Commits:** {count} commits
>
> **PRs included:**
> | PR | Title | Type |
> |----|-------|------|
> | #123 | Fix login error | Bug Fix |
> | #456 | Add bulk export | Feature |

### Step 3: Check Documentation Status

For each PR being released, check if it needs documentation:

```bash
MAIN_REPO="$HOME/Development/VIPER/CoreApps/viper-metrics-v2-0"

# For each PR in the release
for PR in $PR_LIST; do
    # Get PR labels
    LABELS=$(gh pr view $PR --json labels --jq '.labels[].name')

    # Features (enhancement label) need documentation
    if echo "$LABELS" | grep -q "enhancement"; then
        # Check if documentation exists
        FEATURE_NAME=$(gh pr view $PR --json title --jq '.title' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | tr ' ' '-')

        if [[ ! -f "$MAIN_REPO/wiki/features/$FEATURE_NAME.md" ]]; then
            echo "UNDOCUMENTED: PR #$PR needs documentation"
        fi
    fi
done
```

**Three scenarios:**

1. **All features documented** → Continue to Step 4
2. **Features need documentation** → Stop and prompt user
3. **Bug fixes only** → Continue (bugs don't need feature docs)

**If undocumented features exist:**

> ## Documentation Required
>
> The following features need documentation before release:
>
> | PR | Title | Status |
> |----|-------|--------|
> | #456 | Add bulk export | Needs documentation |
> | #789 | Dark mode support | Needs documentation |
>
> **Options:**
> - Run `/document-feature {pr_number}` for each feature
> - Or provide documentation manually
>
> Re-run `/release-production` after documentation is complete.

**Stop here if documentation is missing.**

### Step 4: Generate Changelog Entry

Create the changelog file:

```bash
MAIN_REPO="$HOME/Development/VIPER/CoreApps/viper-metrics-v2-0"
TODAY=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
MONTH_YEAR=$(date +"%B %Y")

# Create changelog file
CHANGELOG_FILE="$MAIN_REPO/wiki/changelog/$TODAY-release.md"
```

**Changelog content structure:**

```markdown
---
title: {Month Year} Release
date: {YYYY-MM-DD}
author: Jarred
status: published
tags:
  - changelog
---

# {Month Year} Release

**Release Date**: {Full Date}

## Summary

{2-3 sentence overview of what's in this release}

## New Features

- **Feature Name** ([#{pr_number}]({pr_url})): Description of the new feature and how to use it. See [[features/{feature-name}|documentation]].

## Improvements

- **Area improved** ([#{pr_number}]({pr_url})): What was improved and why it matters.

## Bug Fixes

| Issue | PR | Description |
|-------|-----|-------------|
| [#{issue}]({issue_url}) | [#{pr}]({pr_url}) | Brief description of what was fixed |

## Breaking Changes

{List any breaking changes, or "None" if none}

## Migration Notes

{Any steps users need to take, or "No user action required."}

---

[[changelog/README|Back to Changelog]]
```

**Guidelines for changelog:**
- Group PRs by type (Feature, Improvement, Bug Fix)
- Link to feature documentation for new features
- Include both issue and PR links for bug fixes
- Note any breaking changes prominently

### Step 5: Review Changelog

Present the generated changelog to the user:

> ## Changelog Preview
>
> I've generated the following changelog for this release:
>
> {Show full changelog content}
>
> **Options:**
> - [Approve and continue] - Save changelog and proceed with merge
> - [Edit changelog] - Make changes before saving
> - [Cancel] - Don't release yet

**If "Edit changelog":**
Allow user to provide edits, then regenerate.

### Step 6: Save Changelog and Commit

```bash
MAIN_REPO="$HOME/Development/VIPER/CoreApps/viper-metrics-v2-0"
cd "$MAIN_REPO"

# Checkout master
git checkout master
git pull origin master

# Write changelog file
# (Use Write tool to create the file)

# Commit changelog
git add "wiki/changelog/$TODAY-release.md"
git commit -m "Add changelog for $TODAY release"
git push origin master
```

### Step 7: Merge Master into Published

Perform the production merge:

```bash
MAIN_REPO="$HOME/Development/VIPER/CoreApps/viper-metrics-v2-0"
cd "$MAIN_REPO"

# Checkout published
git checkout published
git pull origin published

# Merge master into published
git merge origin/master --no-edit

# Push to remote
git push origin published
```

**If merge conflicts:**
> ## Merge Conflict
>
> There are conflicts between master and published:
>
> ```
> {list of conflicting files}
> ```
>
> This usually shouldn't happen. Please resolve manually or investigate why the branches diverged.

### Step 8: Tag the Release (Optional)

Ask user if they want to create a release tag:

> Would you like to create a Git tag for this release?
>
> - [Yes, create tag] - Create tag `release-{date}`
> - [No, skip tag] - Continue without tagging

If yes:
```bash
TAG_NAME="release-$(date +%Y-%m-%d)"
git tag -a "$TAG_NAME" -m "Production release $(date +%Y-%m-%d)"
git push origin "$TAG_NAME"
```

### Step 9: Session Complete

Output:
> ## Production Release Complete
>
> **Release Date:** {date}
>
> **Changes Released:**
> - {X} commits
> - {Y} bug fixes
> - {Z} features
>
> **Changelog:** `wiki/changelog/{date}-release.md`
>
> **Branches:**
> - `master` (staging) merged into `published` (production)
>
> **Tag:** `release-{date}` (if created)
>
> ---
>
> ### What's Next
>
> 1. Verify production deployment in Anvil
> 2. Smoke test critical features
> 3. Monitor for errors
>
> ### Release Notes URL
> {If you publish changelogs externally, include link}

## Documentation Check Logic

Features require documentation; bug fixes don't:

| PR Label | Documentation Required |
|----------|----------------------|
| `enhancement` | Yes - must have wiki/features/{name}.md |
| `feature` | Yes - must have wiki/features/{name}.md |
| `bug` | No - changelog entry sufficient |
| `fix` | No - changelog entry sufficient |
| Other | Evaluate based on PR title/content |

---

## Error Handling

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Uncommitted changes | "Commit or stash changes before releasing" |
| Master behind remote | "Pull latest master first: `git pull origin master`" |
| Published behind remote | "Pull latest published first" |
| Undocumented features | List them and stop - require /document-feature first |
| Merge conflicts | Show conflicts and stop - require manual resolution |
| No changes to release | "No new changes on master since last release" |
| Push fails | "Push failed. Check permissions and try manually" |

---

## Changelog Naming Convention

Files are named by release date:
```
wiki/changelog/
├── 2026-01-28-release.md
├── 2026-02-15-release.md
├── 2026-03-01-release.md
└── README.md
```

For multiple releases on the same day (rare):
```
wiki/changelog/
├── 2026-01-28-release.md
├── 2026-01-28-release-2.md  # Hotfix same day
```

---

## Integration Points

| Skill | Relationship |
|-------|--------------|
| `/document-feature` | **Prerequisite** - Must run for undocumented features |
| `/close-pr` | **Predecessor** - Issues should be closed before release |
| `/create-pr` | **Earlier in cycle** - PRs merged to master |

---

## Complete Release Workflow

```
[PRs merged to master]
    ↓
[Test in staging]
    ↓
/close-pr {numbers}        ← Close all issues for this release
    ↓
/release-production        ← This skill
    ↓
    ├── Check documentation status
    │   ├── If undocumented → /document-feature {pr}
    │   └── If documented → Continue
    ↓
    ├── Generate changelog
    ├── Merge master → published
    └── Push to production
    ↓
[Verify production deployment]
```

---

## Guidelines

### Always Document Features
- Features without documentation create confusion
- Documentation helps users understand new capabilities
- Changelog can reference feature docs for details

### Write Clear Changelogs
- Summarize the "why" not just the "what"
- Group related changes together
- Highlight breaking changes prominently

### Test Before Release
- All changes should be tested in staging
- Issues should be closed (verified working) before release
- Don't release untested changes

### Keep Changelog History
- Never delete old changelog entries
- They serve as historical record
- Useful for tracking when changes were deployed
