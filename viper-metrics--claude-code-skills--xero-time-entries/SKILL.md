# Xero Time Entry Generator

Generate time entry JSON files from git commit history, organized by client, ready for upload to Xero Projects via the VIPER Admin app.

## Usage

```
/xero-time-entries
/xero-time-entries february 2026
```

## Context

- **Upload app:** VIPER Admin (`~/GitHub/VIPER-Admin`)
- **Upload form:** `client_code/UploadTimeEntries/` - accepts JSON files
- **Output directory:** `~/GitHub/xero-time-entries/`
- **Repos to scan:** `~/GitHub/viper-metrics-v2-0`, `~/GitHub/viper-operator`, `~/GitHub/viper-inspect`

### JSON Schema (accepted by upload form)

```json
{
  "project": "Partial match against Xero project name (auto-selects dropdown)",
  "task": "Exact match against task name within the project (auto-selects dropdown)",
  "entries": [
    {
      "developer": "First name (Rick, Jarred, Divyesh)",
      "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "hours": 8.5,
      "description": "What was worked on"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Git Author to Developer Mapping

| Git Authors | Developer Name |
|-------------|---------------|
| `Rick-VIPER`, `rick@vipermetrics.com` | Rick |
| `Jarred-Viper`, `jarred@vipermetrics.com` | Jarred |
| `Divyesh`, `divyesh-vipermetrics`, `divyesh@vipermetrics.com` | Divyesh |

## Workflow

### Step 1: Determine Time Period

If `$ARGUMENTS` contains a month/date range, use it. Otherwise ask:

> What billing period should I generate time entries for?

Options:
- Last month (most common)
- Current month so far
- Custom date range

Determine the `--since` and `--until` dates for git log.

### Step 2: Identify Clients

Ask the user:

> Which clients are we generating time entries for?

Show these known clients as options (allow multiple selection):
- **Paramount** - Custom development
- **David Campbell Transport (Campbells)** - Implementation/support hours
- **EG (Energy Group)** - Training/support
- **Central OOTH (Centrals)** - Support hours
- Other (specify)

### Step 3: Fetch Git Commits

For each VIPER repo, fetch commits for the billing period:

```bash
# For each repo in: viper-metrics-v2-0, viper-operator, viper-inspect
cd ~/GitHub/{repo}
git log --format="%ad | %an | %s" --date=short --since="{start}" --until="{end}" --no-merges
```

### Step 4: Organize by Developer and Date

Group all commits by:
1. **Developer** (map git authors to first names)
2. **Date** (YYYY-MM-DD)

Present a summary table to the user:

```
Developer | Date       | Commits | Repos
----------|------------|---------|------
Rick      | 2026-02-03 | 5       | viper-metrics-v2-0
Rick      | 2026-02-04 | 3       | viper-metrics-v2-0, viper-inspect
Jarred    | 2026-02-03 | 4       | viper-metrics-v2-0
...
```

### Step 5: Assign Work to Clients

For each developer-date combination, show the commit messages and ask the user to assign them to a client. Group consecutive days where possible.

> **Rick - 2026-02-03** (5 commits):
> - Fix defect sync duplicate detection
> - Add pagination to service board
> - Update asset hire header calculation
>
> Which client should this day be assigned to?

Provide the client list from Step 2 as options. Allow splitting a day across clients if needed (rare).

### Step 6: Determine Hours

For each developer-date, ask about hours or use defaults:

> What are the standard daily hours?

Typical values:
- Rick: 8.5 - 9.0 hours
- Jarred: 8.5 - 9.0 hours
- Divyesh: 8.5 - 9.0 hours

Ask if the user wants to set hours per-day or use a default for each developer.

### Step 7: Generate Descriptions

For each developer-date entry, synthesize a concise description from the commit messages:
- Combine related commits into a single description
- Keep descriptions under 80 characters
- Focus on the feature/fix, not implementation details
- Use comma separation for multiple topics

**Good:** "Defect sync: duplicate detection, cascade errors"
**Bad:** "Fix merge optimization edge case when version_ts == edited_ts"

### Step 8: Ask About Project and Task Names

For each client, ask:

> What Xero project and task name should I use for **{client}**?
>
> Previous month used:
> - Project: `{previous project name if available}`
> - Task: `{previous task name if available}`
>
> Keep the same project and update the month in the task name?

Check `~/GitHub/xero-time-entries/` for previous month's files to suggest defaults.

### Step 9: Generate JSON Files

Write one JSON file per client to `~/GitHub/xero-time-entries/`:

**Filename pattern:** `{month}_{year}_{client_short}.json`
Example: `february_2026_paramount.json`

```json
{
  "project": "Custom Development - PO: maintenancesoftwareMF",
  "task": "Paramount Custom Development February 2026",
  "entries": [
    {
      "developer": "Rick",
      "date": "2026-02-03",
      "hours": 9.0,
      "description": "Defect sync: duplicate detection, cascade errors"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 10: Summary and Next Steps

Present a summary:

> ## Time Entries Generated
>
> | Client | File | Entries | Total Hours |
> |--------|------|---------|-------------|
> | Paramount | `february_2026_paramount.json` | 7 | 61.0 |
> | Campbells | `february_2026_campbells.json` | 6 | 52.5 |
> | ... | ... | ... | ... |
>
> **Total:** {n} entries, {h} hours across {c} clients
>
> ### To upload:
> 1. Open VIPER Admin at https://admin.vipermetrics.com
> 2. Go to **Upload Time Entries**
> 3. Upload each JSON file - project and task will auto-select
> 4. Verify staff mappings and click **Upload to Xero**

## Guidelines

### Handling Ambiguous Commits
- If a commit could apply to multiple clients, ask the user
- General platform fixes (error handling, CI) - ask which client to bill to
- If a branch name references an issue number, check which client it relates to

### Splitting Days
- A developer usually works for one client per day
- If commits clearly span two clients on the same day, split the hours
- Ask the user when unsure

### Weekends and Non-Working Days
- Flag any commits on weekends for user confirmation
- Some developers may work weekends - don't assume they don't

### Previous Month Reference
- Always check `~/GitHub/xero-time-entries/` for last month's files
- Use previous project names and patterns as defaults
- The task name typically follows: `{Client} {Type} {Month} {Year}`

---

## Error Handling

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| No commits found for a developer | Note it and ask if they were on leave |
| Very few commits on a day | Ask if it was a short day or commits were squashed |
| Commits only in one repo | Normal - most work is in viper-metrics-v2-0 |
| Unknown git author | Ask user to identify the developer |
| No previous month files | Ask user for project/task names from scratch |
