description: Guidelines for efficient browser screenshot usage. Use when performing browser automation tasks involving screenshots, especially in UI testing sessions. Provides strategies to avoid redundant screenshot captures (which waste 14-22% of calls in affected sessions), intelligent wait strategies for page loads, and alternatives when screenshots fail repeatedly. Use when this capability is needed.

# Smart Screenshot

## Snapshot vs Screenshot: Choose the Right Tool

- **browser_snapshot()** → for finding elements, reading page structure, taking actions. Fast, reliable, text-based.
- **browser_take_screenshot()** → ONLY for visual verification (layout, styling, images). Expensive, slow.

Rule: If you need to click, type, or read text → use snapshot. If you need to SEE the page → use screenshot.

## Rules

1. Never take 2 screenshots within 3 seconds unless a user-initiated action occurred between them
2. After click/navigation, use browser_wait_for() or browser_snapshot() before screenshotting
3. Never use screenshot to find an element's ref — that's what snapshot is for
4. If you need to verify visual changes, one screenshot is enough. Don't take 3 to "make sure"

## When Screenshots Fail

Escalating response (do NOT just retry):
1. First failure: wait 3s, retry once
2. Second failure: check browser_console_messages(level="error")
3. Third failure: check browser_network_requests() for HTTP 4xx/5xx
4. Fourth failure: STOP. Report to user: "Page not loading. Console shows: [X]. Network shows: [Y]. Suggested action: [Z]."

Common causes: dev server not started, backend crashed (503), hot reload in progress, wrong port.

## Anti-Patterns

- "screenshot → zoom → screenshot → zoom → screenshot" — take ONE screenshot, zoom the region you need
- "screenshot to check if page loaded" — use browser_wait_for(text="expected text") instead
- "screenshot after every click" — only screenshot when visual verification is specifically needed
