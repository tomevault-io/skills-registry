# App Store Optimisation (Codex)

## Overview

Provide end-to-end ASO support for App Store and Play Store listings, from research to execution. Use bundled Python modules for structured analysis and planning, and use browsing or user-provided inputs for live data.

## Quick Start

1. Identify the task: keyword research, metadata optimization, competitor analysis, review analysis, ASO scoring, A/B testing, localization, or launch planning.
2. Request required inputs (platforms, markets, current metadata, target keywords, metrics).
3. Use the matching script from `scripts/` to generate analysis or plans.
4. Validate character limits and platform rules, then deliver actionable recommendations.

## Core Tasks

### Keyword research

Use `scripts/keyword_analyzer.py`.

Request:
- Candidate keywords
- Estimated search volume and competition (user-provided or inferred)
- Relevance score per keyword

Deliver:
- Ranked keywords (primary, secondary, long-tail)
- Difficulty and potential scores

### Metadata optimisation

Use `scripts/metadata_optimizer.py`.

Request:
- Current metadata (title, subtitle, descriptions)
- Target keywords and value proposition
- Platform(s) and markets

Deliver:
- Optimized titles and descriptions with character counts
- Keyword density guidance

Default character limits (verify current limits before final output):
- Apple App Store: title 30, subtitle 30, promo text 170, description 4000, keywords 100
- Google Play: title 50, short description 80, full description 4000

### Competitor analysis

Use `scripts/competitor_analyzer.py`.

Request:
- Competitor names or IDs
- Platform and market

Optional data collection:
- Use `scripts/itunes_api.py` for Apple metadata
- Use browsing with prompt templates from `scripts/scraper.py`

Deliver:
- Keyword overlap, metadata patterns, visual asset notes, and gaps

### Review analysis

Use `scripts/review_analyzer.py`.

Request:
- Review text, ratings, and date range

Deliver:
- Sentiment split, top issues, feature requests, response templates

### ASO scoring

Use `scripts/aso_scorer.py`.

Request:
- Metadata quality inputs, ratings data, keyword ranking counts, conversion metrics

Deliver:
- Overall score with category breakdown and prioritized recommendations

### A/B testing

Use `scripts/ab_test_planner.py`.

Request:
- Baseline conversion rate and traffic
- Variants and test goal

Deliver:
- Sample size, duration guidance, and success metrics

### Localization planning

Use `scripts/localization_helper.py`.

Request:
- Current markets and target locales
- Budget and priority markets

Deliver:
- Localization priority order and draft localized metadata

### Launch and update checklists

Use `scripts/launch_checklist.py`.

Request:
- Platform(s), launch date, category, and key features

Deliver:
- Pre-launch checklist and post-launch monitoring plan
