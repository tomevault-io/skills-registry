# Swarm MCP

Use this skill when the `swarm` MCP server is available and coordination with other agents is useful.

If swarm tools are not mounted, say so clearly. Normal workers should fall back to local work only when safe. Gateway/lead sessions should restore swarm tools, use a spawner surface, or ask the operator before doing medium/large implementation locally.

Role argument: `$role`.

If the user invoked this skill with a role argument, follow the matching role reference. If no role was provided, use the generalist flow and load role references only when choosing collaborators or accepting delegated work.

## Default Flow

1. Call `register`, unless a hook already did it.
2. Call `bootstrap` for `{instance, peers, unread_messages, tasks}`. Use `swarm_status` when you need a compact next-action summary with task/lock warnings.
3. Handle unread messages before claiming work. If your live interface was woken by a peer prompt, call `bootstrap` or `poll_messages` first; the durable instruction is in swarm messages.
4. Use `claim_next_task` for the highest-priority compatible task unless you already know a specific `task_id` for `claim_task`.
5. Edit normally — plugin-supported runtimes (Hermes, Claude Code, Codex) check write tools against peer-held locks. Call `lock_file` only when you need a wider critical section (see Locking below).
6. Coordinate through `request_task`, `dispatch` (gateway only), `send_message`, `prompt_peer`, `peek_peer`, `broadcast`, and KV.
7. Finish with `complete_task` when you can provide structured handoff details; use terminal `update_task` as a plain-string fallback.

## Locking

`lock_file` is a deliberate tool for declaring a critical section wider than a single write tool call. It is not ordinary per-edit safety; plugin hooks only enforce existing peer-held locks at write time.

**Reach for `lock_file` when:**
- You will do a Read → multiple Edits sequence and a stale peer write between them would break your `old_string` anchors.
- You are refactoring across several files and want peers to wait.
- You are reserving files (e.g. as a planner) so an assigned implementer can claim them without a race.

**Do not call `lock_file` for an ordinary single Edit/Write.** In plugin-supported runtimes, the `PreToolUse`/equivalent hook checks write tools against existing peer-held locks and denies on real conflict. It does not acquire a lock for you; solo sessions and no-conflict writes proceed normally.

**Runtimes without a swarm plugin** (e.g. ad-hoc OpenCode sessions) need to call `lock_file` / `unlock_file` themselves. Even then, prefer locking critical sections over per-edit ceremony — the per-edit race window is too narrow to be the real failure mode; the actual hazard is stale-read → edit, which only a wider lock protects.

When you do hold a lock, include a `note` describing the scope and expected duration so peers know what they're waiting on. Release with `unlock_file` as soon as the critical section ends; terminal `update_task` releases any remaining edit locks automatically.

If `bootstrap` returns `work_tracker`, use only that configured tracker for this repo/scope and identity. Do not pick a tracker just because an MCP happens to be loaded; load `references/work-trackers.md` when tracker linkage matters.

For planner sessions, the server maintains `owner/planner` automatically. Check it with `kv_get` to see whether you currently own planner duties.

## Role Routing

- `planner`: load `references/planner.md` and register with `identity:<work|personal> role:planner`
- `implementer`: load `references/implementer.md` and register with `identity:<work|personal> role:implementer`
- `reviewer`: load `references/reviewer.md` and register with `identity:<work|personal> role:reviewer`
- `researcher`: load `references/researcher.md` and register with `identity:<work|personal> role:researcher`
- `generalist` or no role: register without a `role:` token unless the user specified one, then handle mixed work using the core workflow

When the role is unclear, do not invent one. Ask one short question or proceed as a generalist if the task is already actionable.

## Core Rules

- **Priority**: Tasks have an integer `priority` field (higher = more urgent). `list_tasks` returns tasks sorted by priority. Claim the highest-priority open task first.
- **Unread-message guard**: `claim_task` and `claim_next_task` refuse to claim new open work while you have unread direct messages. Call `poll_messages` and handle corrections before retrying. Override only when intentionally ignoring those messages.
- **Dependencies**: Tasks can have a `depends_on` field (array of task IDs). A task with unmet dependencies starts as `blocked` and auto-transitions to `open` when all deps complete. If a dependency fails, downstream tasks are auto-cancelled.
- **Approval gates**: Tasks can be set to `approval_required` status. They remain gated until approved (transitions to `open`) or explicitly cancelled. Use this for true approval checkpoints, not routine code review.
- **Idempotency**: Tasks can have an `idempotency_key` field that prevents duplicate creation on retry.

## Yield, Wait, Or Idle

Use swarm as an event-driven coordination fabric, not a token-burning poll loop.

- **Working**: you own a task, review, investigation, edit, lock, dependency, or delegated result to monitor.
- **Yield checkpoint**: at natural boundaries, call `bootstrap` or `poll_messages` before claiming more work, after `update_task`, after a peer handoff, and before your final response.
- **Monitoring**: call `wait_for_activity` only while you still own an active coordination obligation, such as a dependency, review, lock release, peer response, or gateway/planner delegation.
- **Idle**: if you have no active task, no delegated work to monitor, no pending dependency, and no instruction to stay warm, do not call `wait_for_activity` in a loop. Finish the turn and remain promptable if the runtime/workspace keeps the session alive.

Use `send_message` for durable notes to busy peers. Use `prompt_peer` when a specific peer's live agent interface should be nudged, not only when you want to leave inbox mail; it records the full swarm message first, then best-effort injects a short wake prompt telling the peer to check messages. Use `peek_peer` when you need a read-only look at a peer's published workspace handle. Do not use `force=true` unless the update is urgent, corrective, or blocking.

Deregister only when you are actually exiting, ending a one-shot session, or otherwise will not remain available. Plugin-managed sessions usually handle deregistration at runtime finalization.

## Do Not

- Assume other sessions share your exact working directory unless `scope` and `file_root` make that true
- Invent role-routing behavior that is not visible from labels, messages, tasks, or instructions
- Hold file locks longer than the critical section they were taken for
- Call `lock_file` reflexively before every edit — that's the plugin hook's job in plugin-supported runtimes
- Use `assignee` for a stale or unknown instance
- Confuse direct messages with task handoff; use `request_task` for structured delegated work
- Try to claim `blocked` tasks — they will become `open` automatically
- Use whatever tracker MCP is available when the configured same-identity tracker is missing or ambiguous
- Shell out to the `swarm-mcp` CLI for normal coordination primitives from inside your agent loop — use the MCP tools, including `dispatch` for gateway task/spawn routing. Use the CLI bridge only from operator scripts, hooks, or gateway sessions where the MCP tools are unavailable.

## Collaboration Heuristics

- Prefer `request_task` when the work should be tracked and completed
- Prefer explicit `review` tasks over passive review scans
- Prefer `send_message` for durable targeted notes that do not need task state
- Prefer `prompt_peer` when a specific peer should get a live-interface nudge; it records the swarm message first, then best-effort wakes the workspace handle to make the peer check messages
- Prefer `peek_peer` when inspecting a peer's recent workspace output is enough and no durable message or nudge is needed
- Prefer `broadcast` for short status updates that help everyone
- Prefer `request_task` or tracker comments for findings that must survive the current swarm session
- Prefer a matching `role:` token when choosing a specialist
- Prefer a matching `team:` token when the swarm uses soft teams
- Fall back to any matching specialist, then to a generalist, when the ideal collaborator is unavailable
- Use `wait_for_activity` as a blocking monitor while you are responsible for a result, not as idle availability. Peers may wake you with a short prompt to call `poll_messages` or `bootstrap`.
- If you are acting as a planner, watch `owner/planner` on `kv_updates` so you can resume from `plan/latest` after failover
- For long-running concrete tasks, use `report_progress` so others can inspect task-local progress without interrupting; include `blocked_reason` and `expected_next_update_at` only when useful
- Messages prefixed with `[auto]` are system notifications (task assignments, completions, stale-agent recovery) — treat them like any other actionable message
- When you receive a `[signal:complete]` broadcast, the planner is signaling all planned work is done. Finish current work, publish final status, then idle or deregister if you are exiting.
- In gateway/lead mode, no live worker is a spawn problem, not a native-subagent fallback. Load `references/gateway.md` before dispatching, spawning, setting `placement`, or using `completion_wait_seconds`. Worker/generalist sessions do not spawn new workers; they request tracked work, message the planner/gateway, or continue locally when safe.

## CLI Fallback

Swarm coordination inside an agent loop should use MCP tools. The `dispatch` MCP tool is the first-class gateway path: it creates/reuses a task, wakes a live worker when one exists, or spawns through the configured Spawner backend when no worker is live. It is enforced server-side and restricted to gateway authority.

The CLI bridge remains for hooks, operator shells, and rare gateway fallback cases where the MCP tools are not mounted. When you must use it, resolve the command prefix in this order:

1. Use the exact `SWARM_MCP_BIN` value if set by the launcher.
2. Otherwise use `swarm-mcp` from `PATH`.
3. If neither works, use herdr directly if available, or ask the operator to start the worker.

Do not ask ordinary worker sessions to run `dispatch`, `ui spawn`, or raw workspace-backend pane/node creation. Spawn authority belongs to `mode:gateway` sessions and operator surfaces; non-gateway MCP callers should expect `dispatch` to reject them.

For synchronous CLI wrappers, `swarm-mcp dispatch --wait-for-completion <seconds>` mirrors MCP `completion_wait_seconds`: it still reports the normal dispatch handoff/spawn status, plus a `completion` object when the task reaches `done`, `failed`, or `cancelled`, or a timeout snapshot when it does not.

## Structured Results Convention

When completing a task, prefer `complete_task`:

```json
{
  "task_id": "<task-id>",
  "status": "done",
  "summary": "What was done and why.",
  "files_changed": ["src/foo.ts"],
  "tests": [{ "command": "bun test", "status": "passed" }],
  "followups": []
}
```

Fall back to terminal `update_task` with a plain string when structured handoff is not useful.
