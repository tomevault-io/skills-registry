description: Set up or extend a "Hub-and-Spoke" agent documentation system in a repository — AGENTS.md as a table of contents pointing to spoke files (docs, agent instructions, runbooks, anything). Use this skill whenever the user wants to create or update AGENTS.md, add or restructure agent rules, migrate inline rules out of CLAUDE.md / .cursorrules into a shared hub, write a doc or runbook that agents should follow, or reconcile tool-specific files (CLAUDE.md, .cursorrules, .windsurfrules, .clinerules, .github/copilot-instructions.md, GEMINI.md) so they don't drift. Trigger this even when the user does not say "hub-and-spoke" — phrases like "rules for agents in this repo", "make Claude follow X in the API folder", "I'm starting to use Cursor too", or "give me a workflow for scaffolding a route" all qualify. Use when this capability is needed.

# Buckle

Help the user build and extend a Hub-and-Spoke agent documentation system through clarifying-question dialogue. The hub is `AGENTS.md` at the repo root — a table of contents. Spokes are any markdown files the hub points at: docs, agent instructions, runbooks, ADRs, whatever the user needs.

<HARD-GATE>
Do NOT write or modify any file until the user has approved both the spoke draft and the AGENTS.md routing entry. This applies even when the user's request seems fully specified — they may not have realized the request had ambiguity until they see your draft.
</HARD-GATE>

## The architecture

- **Hub** — `AGENTS.md` at the repo root. A table of contents that routes agents to spokes. Each entry says *when* an agent should read *which* file. Keep it short; if it grows long, push content out to a spoke and leave a one-line entry behind.
- **Spokes** — Any markdown files in the repo. Doesn't matter what kind: agent instructions, ADRs, runbooks, prose docs. The hub treats them uniformly.
- **Pointer files** — Tool-specific files like `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursorrules`, `.windsurfrules`, `.clinerules`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `GEMINI.md`. When present, they MUST contain only:

  ```
  Read AGENTS.md for all instructions.
  ```

  Nothing else. The whole deduplication win depends on this — if rules live in three tool-specific files they will silently disagree.

## Checklist

Create a TodoWrite todo for each item and complete them in order:

1. **Explore project context** — check whether `AGENTS.md` exists, what pointer files exist, their contents, and the rough folder layout
2. **Confirm the goal** — what spoke does the user want to add, or what existing state do they want to restructure?
3. **Ask clarifying questions, one at a time** — extract specifics (file paths, version numbers, what NOT to do); prefer multiple-choice over open-ended
4. **Present the spoke draft + hub entry for approval** — show both exactly as they will be written; do not write yet
5. **Write the spoke** at the agreed path
6. **Update `AGENTS.md`** — add the routing entry; create `AGENTS.md` if it didn't exist
7. **Reconcile pointer files** — if any have inline content, offer to migrate it into a spoke first, then rewrite the pointer file as one line; if a pointer file is missing and the user uses that tool, offer to create it

    "Ask one clarifying question\n(MCQ preferred)" [shape=box];
    "Enough specifics?" [shape=diamond];

    "Explore project context" -> "Confirm goal";
    "Confirm goal" -> "Ask one clarifying question\n(MCQ preferred)";
    "Ask one clarifying question\n(MCQ preferred)" -> "Enough specifics?";
    "Enough specifics?" -> "Ask one clarifying question\n(MCQ preferred)" [label="no"];

    "User approves?" -> "Ask one clarifying question\n(MCQ preferred)" [label="no, revise"];
    "User approves?" -> "Write spoke" [label="yes"];
    "Write spoke" -> "Update AGENTS.md";
    "Update AGENTS.md" -> "Pointer files OK?";
    "Pointer files OK?" -> "Reconcile pointer files" [label="no"];
    "Pointer files OK?" -> "Done" [label="yes"];
    "Reconcile pointer files" -> "Done";
}
```

## How to ask questions

- **One question per message.** Stacking questions makes users skim — they pick the easiest one and skip the rest. This is the single most important interview rule.
- **Multiple choice preferred.** Faster for the user and forces concrete options. Open-ended is fine when no obvious choices fit, but lean MCQ.
- **Push back on generics.** If the user says "just use standard React," follow up with a specific: "Are we enforcing Server Components by default? What's the rule for client-side state — Zustand, Context, something else?" Lazy answers produce useless rules.
- **Stop once you have specifics.** Threshold: could a reviewer read your draft and judge it as concrete (file paths, version numbers, explicit no-go's)? If yes, stop interrogating and present the draft.

## How to write the spoke

The spoke can be anything the user needs. Format follows the content:

- **Agent instructions / rules** — Imperative voice ("Run a dry-run before committing"). State negative constraints explicitly *with the reason* ("NEVER use the `any` type in Prisma queries — schema drift won't surface at compile time"). Backticks for paths, versions, variables. `**bold**` for non-negotiable boundaries.
- **Decisions / ADRs / prose docs** — Whatever voice fits the content. *Context → Decision → Consequences* is a common shape but not required.

The point: impose imperative voice on files the agent reads as instructions; don't impose it on files the agent reads as background.

## How to write the hub entry

`AGENTS.md` is a table of contents — keep entries terse. There's no required syntax; these all work:

- **Glob-based**: When editing files matching `frontend/**/*.tsx`, read `frontend/AGENT.md`.
- **Topic-based**: For database migrations, see `docs/migrations.md`.
- **Mixed**: whichever is clearer per entry.

If `AGENTS.md` itself starts accumulating rules instead of pointers, that's a smell — extract the rules into a spoke and leave a one-line entry.

## Pointer-file rule (non-negotiable)

When a pointer file exists, it contains exactly one instruction: `Read AGENTS.md for all instructions.` Nothing else.

If a pointer file already has inline content, do not silently overwrite it — that content is the user's work. Offer to migrate it into a spoke first, then rewrite the pointer file. Always confirm before overwriting.

## Guardrails

- One question per turn. Always.
- Never write core logic into pointer files.
- If a user's requested rule violates basic security practice (commit secrets, disable auth checks, suppress all errors), refuse and ask for clarification rather than encoding the bad rule.
- Don't invent constraints the user didn't give you. If information is missing, ask in the questions phase rather than guessing in the draft.
- When you elaborate on something the user said — adding a reason ("NEVER use `any` — use `unknown` and narrow it instead"), a scoping clarification ("only at component leaves"), or an example — surface the elaboration explicitly. Either ask before drafting ("I'd add X as the reason — OK?") or flag it in the draft you present ("Note: I added X — keep or drop?"). Never elaborate silently. The user gets to decide whether the elaboration is welcome or paternalistic.
