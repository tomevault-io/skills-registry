# Clip Extraction

Extract and catalog best moments from raw footage.

## Process

### Step 1: Transcribe with Timestamps

**Transcription Methods:**
- AI transcription (Claude, Whisper, Descript)
- Manual review for accuracy
- Include timestamps every 10-30 seconds

**Format:**
```
[00:00] Opening small talk
[00:45] "The reason I started this company was..."
[01:23] Gets emotional about customer story
[02:15] Explains unique mechanism
...
```

### Step 2: Identify High-Emotion Moments

**Emotion Markers:**
- Voice changes (gets louder, softer, cracks)
- Pauses before important statements
- Laughing or crying
- Passionate explanations
- Authentic frustration
- Surprise or excitement

**Flag These Moments:**
- Real reactions (not scripted)
- Vulnerable admissions
- Powerful stories
- "Aha" moments
- Customer impact stories

### Step 3: Tag by Content Type

**HOOK Clips**
- Attention-grabbing statements
- Provocative claims
- Curiosity-inducing openers
- Pattern interrupts

**SOCIAL PROOF Clips**
- Customer stories
- Results mentions
- Testimonial moments
- Endorsements

**NARRATIVE Clips**
- Origin story pieces
- Problem explanations
- Solution discoveries
- Transformation arcs

**CTA Clips**
- Direct calls to action
- Recommendation statements
- "You should try this" moments
- Risk reversal mentions

**OBJECTION HANDLING Clips**
- Skeptic responses
- Trust building
- "Why us" explanations
- Price justification

### Step 4: Score for Ad Potential

**Scoring Criteria (1-10):**

| Factor | Weight | Score |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Authenticity | 25% | X |
| Emotion | 25% | X |
| Clarity | 20% | X |
| Relevance | 20% | X |
| Technical Quality | 10% | X |

**Authenticity:** Does it feel real, unscripted?
**Emotion:** Does it evoke feeling?
**Clarity:** Is the message clear?
**Relevance:** Does it serve an ad purpose?
**Technical:** Is audio/video usable?
