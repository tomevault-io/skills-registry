# Funnel Map

Document and analyze complete conversion funnels.

## Process

### Step 1: Document Each Funnel Step

**Standard Funnel Elements:**
1. Ad (Creative)
2. Landing Page / Pre-sell
3. Quiz (if applicable)
4. Sales Page / VSL
5. Checkout / Lead Form
6. Upsells (if applicable)
7. Thank You / Confirmation

**For Each Step Document:**
- URL/asset name
- Purpose in funnel
- Key message
- Primary CTA
- Technical requirements

### Step 2: Identify Metrics at Each Stage

**Ad Level:**
- Impressions
- Clicks
- CTR
- CPC
- CPM

**Landing/Quiz Level:**
- Page views
- Time on page
- Scroll depth
- Quiz completion rate
- Exit rate

**Conversion Level:**
- Add to cart / Initiate checkout
- Form submissions
- Purchase/conversion
- Upsell acceptance rate

### Step 3: Calculate Stage-to-Stage Rates

**Conversion Rate Formula:**
Stage N Conversion = (Stage N Actions / Stage N-1 Actions) × 100

**Example Flow:**
```
1000 Ad Clicks
  → 800 Land on Page (80% click-to-land)
    → 400 Start Quiz (50% page-to-quiz)
      → 280 Complete Quiz (70% quiz completion)
        → 140 View Offer (50% quiz-to-offer)
          → 28 Purchase (20% offer-to-purchase)

Overall: 28/1000 = 2.8% click-to-purchase
```

### Step 4: Highlight Drop-off Points

**Identify Biggest Leaks:**
- Which stage has lowest conversion rate?
- Which stage loses most absolute volume?
- Which stage is below industry benchmark?

**Prioritize by Impact:**
Impact = Volume at stage × Potential improvement %

### Step 5: Output Funnel Visualization

## Funnel Optimization Principles

**Fix Biggest Leaks First:**
- Largest volume × lowest rate = priority
- Small improvements at scale = big impact

**Test One Variable at a Time:**
- Isolate changes
- Measure impact clearly
- Build on winners

**Metrics Hierarchy (Jason K):**
- Initiate checkout = 3x purchase data
- Use leading indicators for faster decisions
