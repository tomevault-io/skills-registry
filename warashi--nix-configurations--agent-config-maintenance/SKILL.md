# Agent Config Maintenance

## Scope

- Target files: `AGENTS.md`, project-doc sections, `skills/*/SKILL.md`, and any references under `skills/*/references/`.
- Focus on separation of concerns: global agent rules vs task-specific workflows.

## Workflow

1. Inventory instructions
   - Use `rg` to find duplicate or conflicting rules across AGENTS, project docs, and skills.
   - Note which rules are global constraints vs task-specific procedures.
2. Decide the split
   - Keep only global, always-on constraints in `AGENTS.md`.
   - Move task-specific procedures into the relevant skill `SKILL.md` or `references/`.
   - Remove duplicated bullets after moving.
3. Update skill metadata
   - Fill `SKILL.md` frontmatter with `name` and a trigger-ready `description`.
   - Keep the description explicit about when to use the skill.
4. Write the skill body
   - Use imperative form.
   - Keep core workflow in `SKILL.md`.
   - Move large checklists or detailed examples into `references/` and link them.
5. Validate consistency
   - Ensure AGENTS and skills do not contradict each other.
   - Verify naming conventions (lowercase + hyphen).
   - Confirm only necessary files exist; avoid extra docs.

## Quality gates

- Keep `SKILL.md` under 500 lines.
- Avoid duplication between `SKILL.md` and any reference files.
- If adding scripts, run them once to validate behavior.
