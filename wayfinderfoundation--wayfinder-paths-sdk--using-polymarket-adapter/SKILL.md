## When to use

Use this skill when you are:
- Discovering Polymarket markets/events, or doing fuzzy search by text
- Pulling orderbooks/prices and historic time series for analysis
- Computing “movers” (dark-horse → trending) across a set of markets
- Placing predictions (buy), cashing out (sell), or redeeming resolved positions
- Converting collateral: native Polygon USDC ↔ **USDC.e** (required for trading)
