# MDL2 Icon Picker

Help users select appropriate Segoe MDL2 Assets icons for WinUI Windows applications.

## Overview

The Segoe MDL2 Assets font provides hundreds of glyphs for Windows UI development. Icons are identified by:
- **Unicode point**: Hex code (e.g., E708) used in XAML as `&#xE708;`
- **Description/Name**: The official name (e.g., QuietHours)
- **Visual appearance**: What the icon actually looks like (often differs from the name!)

## Critical: Visual vs Name Mismatch

Icon names often don't describe what the icon looks like:
- **QuietHours** (E708) = Crescent moon shape (great for dark mode!)
- **Brightness** (E706) = Sun with rays (great for light mode!)
- **GlobalNavigationButton** (E700) = Hamburger menu (three lines)

Always consult `references/icon-catalog.md` for accurate visual descriptions.

## Workflow

1. Understand the user's need (what action/concept the icon represents)
2. Consult the icon catalog for visual matches
3. Think creatively about visual metaphors (moon=dark, sun=light, gear=settings)
4. Present 2-4 options in a table with reasoning
5. Suggest the top recommendation with explanation

## Response Format

Present recommendations in this table format:

| Icon | Unicode | Name | Visual | Why It Works |
|------|---------|------|--------|--------------|
| (glyph) | E708 | QuietHours | Crescent moon | Moon universally represents night/darkness |

Include:
- Primary recommendation with reasoning
- 2-3 alternatives with explanations
- Note any creative interpretations (e.g., "Though named QuietHours, the moon shape works perfectly for dark mode")

## Creative Thinking

When no exact match exists, think about visual metaphors:

- **Night/Dark** → Moon (E708), filled circles
- **Day/Light** → Sun (E706), Lightbulb (EA80)
- **Ideas** → Lightbulb (EA80), ThoughtBubble (EA91)
- **Power/Energy** → LightningBolt (E945), PowerButton (E7E8)
- **Clean/Clear** → Broom (EA99), EraseTool (E75C)
- **Fast** → LightningBolt (E945), FastForward (EB9D)
- **Security** → Shield (EA18), Lock (E72E), Fingerprint (E928)
- **Social** → People (E716), ChatBubbles (E8F2), Heart (EB51)
- **Nature** → Leaf (E8BE), Cloud (E753), Drop (EB42)
- **Growth/Up** → StockUp (EB11), ChevronUp (E70E)
- **Decline/Down** → StockDown (EB0F), ChevronDown (E70D)

## XAML Usage (for reference)

```xml
<FontIcon FontFamily="Segoe MDL2 Assets" Glyph="&#xE708;"/>
```

The user only needs the Unicode point and name - they will write their own XAML.
