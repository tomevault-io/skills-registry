description: Initialise new or imported projects. New projects get a private git repo created in the website/app subfolder. Imported projects are cloned into that subfolder. Project root contains Claude config (CLAUDE.md, STYLE_GUIDE.md) - git repo lives in subfolder only. Triggers: new project, import project, clone project, take over project, setup project, initialise project. Use when this capability is needed.

# New and Imported Projects Skill

**Purpose**: Initialise new or imported projects with correct folder structure and UK standards.

## Two Workflows

| Type | What happens |
|------|--------------|
| **New project** | Create private git repo (`webSmartTeam/name`) IN the `website/` subfolder |
| **Imported project** | Clone existing repo INTO the `website/` subfolder |

**Key point**: Git repo lives in subfolder. Project root is Claude config only (not tracked by git).

## Project Structure Pattern

```
project-root/                    ← Claude config + workspace wrapper
├── .claude/settings.local.json  ← Permissions
├── CLAUDE.md                    ← Project identity + rules (MUST include ## Identity section)
├── STYLE_GUIDE.md               ← Brand colours, typography
├── DELETED_CODE.md              ← Track removed code
├── .env.local                   ← Secrets (gitignored)
├── .gitignore
└── website/                     ← Deployable (pushed to git)
    ├── package.json
    ├── vercel.json              ← regions: ["lhr1"]
    ├── src/
    └── public/
```

**Subfolder naming**: `website/`, `app/`, `platform/`, `dashboard/` depending on project type.

## Anti-Patterns (NEVER DO)

- ❌ CLAUDE.md inside website/ subfolder
- ❌ .claude/ inside website/ subfolder
- ❌ vercel.json in project root (goes WITH package.json)
- ❌ localhost testing - always Vercel preview URLs
- ❌ Creating public git repos without explicit permission

## What to Create

### 1. CLAUDE.md (project root)
Include:
- **## Identity section** (MANDATORY — first section after title):
  - Instance Name: short memorable name (e.g., "Boiler Builder", "ShopClaude")
  - Project: what this Claude works on
  - Boundary: the root directory
  - Purpose: one sentence role description
- Project name, client, type (website/app/platform)
- UK Standards block (UK English, lhr1, GBP, DD/MM/YYYY)
- SuperClaude capabilities note
- Workspace boundary (this folder only)
- Git: push to main unless told otherwise

### 2. STYLE_GUIDE.md (project root)
- Brand colours table (Primary, Secondary, Accent, Background, Text)
- Typography (headings, body)
- Change log table

### 3. DELETED_CODE.md (project root)
- Table: Date | File | Reason | Code Block
- Track before deleting

### 4. .claude/settings.local.json (project root)

Scoped permissions — Claude can build and deploy but can't go rogue:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Read",
      "Edit",
      "Write",
      "Glob",
      "Grep",
      "Bash(git:*)",
      "Bash(npm:*)",
      "Bash(npx:*)",
      "Bash(node:*)",
      "Bash(vercel:*)",
      "Bash(gh:*)",
      "Bash(curl:*)",
      "Bash(ls:*)",
      "Bash(cat:*)",
      "Bash(mkdir:*)",
      "Bash(cp:*)",
      "Bash(mv:*)",
      "Bash(head:*)",
      "Bash(tail:*)",
      "Bash(wc:*)",
      "Bash(sort:*)",
      "Bash(python3:*)",
      "Bash(chmod:*)",
      "WebFetch"
    ],
    "deny": [
      "Bash(rm -rf:*)",
      "Bash(sudo:*)",
      "Bash(kill:*)",
      "Bash(pkill:*)",
      "Bash(brew:*)",
      "Bash(pip install:*)",
      "Bash(npm install -g:*)",
      "Bash(cd /Users:*)",
      "Bash(cd ~:*)",
      "Bash(cd ..:*)"
    ]
  }
}
```

**What this allows**: File editing, git, npm/node, Vercel deploys, GitHub CLI, reading files, basic shell commands within the project.

**What this blocks**: Deleting directories, sudo, killing processes, installing global packages, brew installs, navigating outside the project. Claude stays in its lane.

### 5. vercel.json (inside website/app subfolder)
```json
{
  "regions": ["lhr1"]
}
```

### 6. .gitignore (project root)
```
.env
.env.local
.env*.local
node_modules/
.DS_Store
```

## UK Standards (Always Apply)

- UK English: colour, organisation, realise
- Region: London (lhr1)
- Currency: GBP (£)
- Date: DD/MM/YYYY
- Phone: +44 format

## Git Setup (New Projects)

```bash
# In website/app subfolder (where package.json lives)
git init
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Initial project setup

# Create private repo under webSmartTeam org
gh repo create webSmartTeam/{{PROJECT_NAME}} --private --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

## Import Workflow (Existing Projects)

When importing a project from git (taking over someone else's work):

```bash
# 1. Create project root folder with config
mkdir -p {{PROJECT_NAME}}
cd {{PROJECT_NAME}}

# 2. Create wrapper config files (CLAUDE.md, STYLE_GUIDE.md, DELETED_CODE.md, .gitignore)
# [Use templates from this skill]

# 3. Clone existing repo into website/app subfolder
git clone {{REPO_URL}} website/
# OR for other project types:
git clone {{REPO_URL}} app/
git clone {{REPO_URL}} platform/

# 4. Add .claude/settings.local.json in project root

# 5. Add vercel.json with regions: ["lhr1"] if missing
```

**Key difference**: Imported projects already have git history - don't re-init, just wrap with our config structure.

## After Setup

Tell user:
1. Config created in project root
2. Deployable code goes in website/ (or app/, platform/)
3. Update STYLE_GUIDE.md as design decisions made
4. Git repo created under webSmartTeam (private)
