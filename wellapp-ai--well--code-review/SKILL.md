# Code Review Skill

Systematically review code for quality, conventions, and potential issues.

## When to Use
- Before committing changes (auto-triggered)
- Reviewing others' PRs
- Self-review before pushing
- Pre-push validation (Phase 0)

---

## Phase 0: Pre-Push Validation

Before reviewing code, ensure build passes:

- [ ] `npm run typecheck` - No type errors
- [ ] `npm run lint` - No lint errors
- [ ] No console.log in changed files
- [ ] Tests pass (if applicable): `npm run test`

If any check fails, fix before proceeding to code review.

**Quick check command:**
```bash
npm run typecheck && npm run lint
```

**Check for console.log:**
```bash
git diff --cached --name-only | xargs grep -l "console.log" 2>/dev/null
```

## Review Checklist

### Hard Rules Check

- [ ] API follows 3-layer pattern

### Code Quality Check
- [ ] Clear variable/function names
- [ ] No duplicated code
- [ ] Proper error handling

- [ ] Imports organized correctly
- [ ] File in correct location (feature folder)

### Security Check

- [ ] No exposed sensitive data
- [ ] Proper input validation

## Output Format

Present findings as:
