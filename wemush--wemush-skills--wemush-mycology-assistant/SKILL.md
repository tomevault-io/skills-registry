# WeMush Mycology Assistant

## Overview

This skill helps researchers and cultivators interact with WeMush, a decentralized mycology platform for mushroom cultivation management, specimen tracking, and collaborative research.

Use this skill when users want to:

- Manage research projects (create, join, view progress)
- Track specimens and cultivation observations
- Analyze research outcomes and trends
- Search the mycology catalog (strains, species)
- Record and review cultivation data

## Prerequisites

Before using WeMush tools, users need:

1. A WeMush account at <https://wemush.com>
2. OAuth authorization via the WeMush MCP server
3. Appropriate scopes granted during authorization

### Available OAuth Scopes

| Scope | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `research:read` | View research projects and observations |
| `research:write` | Create projects, submit observations |
| `specimens:read` | View specimen data and lineage |
| `specimens:write` | Record specimen observations |
| `analytics:read` | Access research analytics |
| `catalog:read` | Search strains and species |

## Workflows

### 1. Research Project Management

**List available projects:**
Use `list_research_projects` to show public research projects the user can join.

**Join a project:**
Use `enroll_in_project` with the project ID to join a research initiative.

**View project details:**
Use `get_research_project` to see full project details, protocols, and progress.

**Create new research:**
Use `create_research_project` with title, description, target strain IDs, and protocol details.

### 2. Specimen Tracking

**View specimens:**
Use `list_my_specimens` to see all specimens the user has access to. Filter by status, strain, or date range.

**Get specimen details:**
Use `get_specimen_details` with specimen ID for full information including current status, lineage, and observation history.

**View lineage:**
Use `get_specimen_lineage` to see the specimen's ancestry and descendants. Helpful for tracking genetics and cultivation history.

**Record observations:**
Use `record_specimen_observation` to log cultivation data including growth measurements, environmental conditions, health assessments, and notes.

### 3. Analytics & Insights

**Project analytics:**
Use `get_project_analytics` for aggregate statistics including participant count, observation rates, and completion stats.

**Outcome analysis:**
Use `get_outcome_breakdown` to see success/failure rates broken down by strain, technique, or conditions.

**Equipment analysis:**
Use `get_equipment_analysis` to identify which equipment correlates with better cultivation outcomes.

**Research trends:**
Use `get_research_trends` to see patterns over time including seasonal variations and technique evolution.

### 4. Catalog Exploration

**Search strains:**
Use `search_strains` to find mushroom strains by name, species, cultivation difficulty, or characteristics.

**Search species:**
Use `search_species` to find species information by scientific name, common name, or genus.

**Get details:**
Use `get_strain_details` or `get_species_details` for comprehensive information including taxonomy, cultivation requirements, and images.

### 5. Profile & Activity

**View profile:**
Use `get_my_research_profile` to see the user's research contributions, project memberships, and observation statistics.

**Activity feed:**
Use `get_research_activity_feed` to see recent activity across projects the user participates in.

## Examples

### Starting a Research Project

User: "I want to start a research project comparing Lion's Mane growth on different substrates"

1. Search for Lion's Mane strains: `search_strains` with query "Lion's Mane"
2. Create the project: `create_research_project` with:
   - Title: "Lion's Mane Substrate Comparison Study"
   - Description: Research goals and methodology
   - Target strain IDs from the search results
   - Protocol: Data collection requirements

### Tracking Cultivation Progress

User: "I need to log today's observations for my Pink Oyster grow"

1. List specimens: `list_my_specimens` filtered by strain
2. Record observation: `record_specimen_observation` with:
   - Specimen ID
   - Growth measurements
   - Environmental readings (temp, humidity)
   - Health assessment
   - Any notes or photos

### Analyzing Research Results

User: "How are participants doing in the substrate comparison study?"

1. Get project details: `get_research_project` for context
2. Get analytics: `get_project_analytics` for aggregate stats
3. Get outcomes: `get_outcome_breakdown` by substrate type
4. Summarize findings and trends for the user

## Privacy & Security

WeMush protects user data with:

- **K-Anonymity (k=5)**: Analytics aggregate data from at least 5 participants before sharing
- **Scope-Based Access**: Tools only access data within approved OAuth scopes
- **Token Expiration**: Access tokens expire after 1 hour
- **Audit Logging**: All tool calls are logged for security

Users can revoke access anytime via WeMush Settings > Connected Apps.

## When to Use

Invoke this skill when users:

- Ask about mushroom cultivation or mycology research
- Want to track specimens or cultivation progress
- Need to analyze research data or outcomes
- Want to explore mushroom strains or species
- Ask about WeMush features or workflows
- Mention research projects, observations, or analytics

Do NOT use this skill for:

- General mushroom identification without catalog search
- Medical or consumption advice
- Topics unrelated to mycology research
