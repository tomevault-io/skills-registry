# Glossary & Definition Generator

## When to use this skill

- User asks to create a glossary
- User needs term definitions
- User wants to explain jargon
- User mentions terminology documentation
- User needs a knowledge base of terms

## Workflow

- [ ] Identify terms to define
- [ ] Research accurate definitions
- [ ] Write SEO-optimized entries
- [ ] Link related terms
- [ ] Format for target output
- [ ] Validate completeness

## Instructions

### Step 1: Term Collection

Gather terms from these sources:

| Source                   | Method                      |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Product documentation    | Extract technical terms     |
| Customer support tickets | Find confusing jargon       |
| Competitor glossaries    | Identify industry standards |
| Search queries           | Check what users search     |
| Internal team            | Collect tribal knowledge    |

Create a term inventory:

```markdown
## Term Inventory

| Term   | Category   | Priority     | Status   |
| ------ | ---------- | ------------ | -------- |
| [Term] | [Category] | High/Med/Low | To write |
| [Term] | [Category] | High/Med/Low | Draft    |
```

**Prioritization criteria:**

- High: Core product/industry terms users must understand
- Medium: Common terms that appear frequently
- Low: Advanced/niche terms for power users

### Step 2: Definition Structure

Each glossary entry should include:

```markdown
## [Term]

**Definition:** [Clear, concise explanation in 1-2 sentences]

**Example:** [Real-world usage or context]

**Related terms:** [Link to connected entries]

**Also known as:** [Synonyms or abbreviations]
```

### Step 3: Writing Definitions

**Definition formulas:**

| Type       | Formula                                                   | Example                                                                                   |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Simple     | "[Term] is [category] that [function]."                   | "An API is a set of protocols that allows software applications to communicate."          |
| Technical  | "[Term] refers to [technical description]. It [purpose]." | "Latency refers to the delay between a request and response. It affects user experience." |
| Comparison | "[Term] is similar to [known concept], but [difference]." | "A CMS is similar to a word processor, but designed for web content."                     |

**Writing guidelines:**

- Lead with the simplest explanation
- Avoid circular definitions (don't use the term to define itself)
- Include the "why it matters" context
- Target 50-150 words per definition
- Write for the least technical reader

### Step 4: SEO Optimization

#### Featured Snippet Targeting

Structure definitions for position zero:

```markdown
## What is [Term]?

[Term] is [40-60 word definition that directly answers the question].
```

#### Keyword Integration

| Element          | Optimization                                                                                             |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| H1/H2            | "What is [Term]?" or "[Term] Definition"                                                                 |
| First sentence   | Include term within first 10 words                                                                       |
| Meta title       | "[Term]: Definition, Examples & Guide"                                                                   |
| Meta description | "Learn what [term] means, why it matters, and see examples. Simple explanation of [term] for beginners." |
| URL              | `/glossary/[term-slug]`                                                                                  |

#### Schema Markup

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "DefinedTerm",
  "name": "[Term]",
  "description": "[Definition]",
  "inDefinedTermSet": {
    "@type": "DefinedTermSet",
    "name": "[Company] Glossary"
  }
}
```

### Step 5: Related Term Linking

```markdown
## Term Relationships

```

**Linking rules:**

## Error Handling

- **Term already exists**: Check for duplicates; merge or differentiate entries.

- **Conflicting definitions**: Research authoritative sources; note if term has multiple meanings.
