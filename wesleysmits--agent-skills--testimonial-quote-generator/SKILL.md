- [ ] Gather source feedback
- [ ] Identify usable quotes
- [ ] Format for different uses
- [ ] Tag by use case

## Instructions

### Step 1: Identify Quote Sources

**Common feedback sources:**

| Source          | Where to Find                     | Quote Quality               |
| --------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Reviews         | Google, G2, Capterra, Trustpilot  | High - public, verified     |
| Emails          | Support inbox, thank-you messages | Medium - permission needed  |
| Surveys         | NPS, CSAT, post-purchase          | High - direct feedback      |
| Social          | Comments, DMs, mentions           | Medium - permission needed  |
| Interviews      | Customer calls, case study chats  | High - detailed context     |
| Slack/Discord   | Community channels                | Medium - permission needed  |
| Support tickets | Resolved positive tickets         | Medium - ask for permission |

**Permission requirements:**

```markdown
## Before Using a Quote

- [ ] Quote is from public review (Google, G2, etc.) - no permission needed
- [ ] Quote is from private communication - written permission required
- [ ] Customer name and company approved for use
- [ ] Photo usage approved (if applicable)
- [ ] Quote has not been materially altered (minor edits OK)
```

### Step 2: Quote Identification Criteria

**What makes a strong testimonial:**

| Criteria            | Weak Example     | Strong Example                             |
| ------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Specific results    | "Great product!" | "Increased our revenue 47% in 3 months"    |
| Emotional impact    | "Happy customer" | "Finally, I can sleep at night knowing..." |
| Addresses objection | "Works well"     | "I was skeptical at first, but..."         |
| Relatable problem   | "Helpful tool"   | "We struggled with X for years until..."   |
| Credible source     | "John D."        | "Sarah Chen, VP Marketing, Acme Corp"      |

**Quote scoring rubric:**

| Element                           | Points |
| --------------------------------- | ------ |
| Contains specific metric/result   | +3     |
| Names specific feature/benefit    | +2     |
| Includes emotional language       | +2     |
| Overcomes common objection        | +2     |
| From recognizable company/title   | +2     |
| Mentions competitor comparison    | +1     |
| Short and punchy (under 50 words) | +1     |

**Score interpretation:**

- 8-13: A-tier (hero testimonials, landing pages)
- 5-7: B-tier (feature sections, emails)
- 2-4: C-tier (social proof bars, volume displays)

### Step 3: Quote Extraction Patterns

**Look for these phrases:**

```markdown
## High-Value Phrase Patterns

**Result indicators:**

- "We increased/decreased..."
- "Saved us X hours/dollars..."
- "Within X weeks/months..."
- "X% improvement in..."

**Emotional indicators:**

- "Finally..."
- "Game-changer..."
- "Can't imagine going back to..."
- "Wish I had found this sooner..."

**Objection overcomers:**

- "I was skeptical, but..."
- "At first I thought..., but then..."
- "Worth every penny..."
- "Even though [price/concern], we still..."

**Comparison indicators:**

- "Unlike [competitor]..."
- "We tried X before, but..."
- "The only solution that..."
- "Better than..."
```

### Step 4: Quote Formatting

**Raw quote to polished testimonial:**

**Before (raw):**

```
"yeah so we had been using spreadsheets for like 2 years and
it was a total mess, then we found your tool and honestly
within like 3 weeks everything was organized and we saved
probably 10 hours a week on reporting alone, my boss was
super impressed lol"
```

**After (formatted):**

```
"We'd been using spreadsheets for 2 years and it was a mess.
Within 3 weeks of switching to [Product], everything was
organized and we saved 10 hours a week on reporting alone."

— Jamie Torres, Operations Manager, TechStart Inc.
```

**Editing guidelines:**

| Allowed                                  | Not Allowed                  |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Remove filler words (um, like, you know) | Change meaning               |
| Fix grammar/spelling                     | Add claims they didn't make  |
| Shorten for clarity                      | Combine separate quotes      |
| Add context in brackets                  | Invent attribution           |
| Clean up transcript artifacts            | Remove qualifying statements |

### Step 5: Quote Templates by Use Case

```markdown

"[Specific result] + [Emotional impact] + [Recommendation]"

— [Full Name], [Title], [Company]

**Example:**

```markdown

we actually finish sprints on time. Every team needs this."

```

**Feature section proof:**

```markdown
### [Feature Name]

[Feature description]

> "[Quote specifically about this feature - 20-40 words]"

```

**Social proof bar (short quotes):**

```markdown
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ "[5-10 word snippet]" — [Name, Company]

```

│ and impactful]" │
│ │
│ ───────────────── │
│ │

```

### Step 9: Video Testimonial Framework

```markdown

**Questions to ask:**

1. What problem were you trying to solve before [Product]?
2. What made you choose [Product] over alternatives?
3. What specific results have you achieved?
4. What would you tell someone considering [Product]?

**Ideal length:** 60-90 seconds
**Format:** Horizontal, good lighting, quiet space
**Key soundbites needed:**

- Problem statement (10 sec)
- Solution discovery (10 sec)
- Specific result (15 sec)
- Recommendation (10 sec)
```

### Step 10: Permission Request Template

**Email template for requesting permission:**

```markdown
Subject: Quick permission request - using your feedback

Hi [Name],

Thank you for the kind words about [Product]! Your feedback
means a lot to our team.

We'd love to feature your quote on our website and marketing
materials. Here's what we'd like to use:

"[Quote]"
— [Name], [Title], [Company]

Would you be comfortable with us sharing this? We're happy to:

- Use your full name and title, OR
- Use just first name and company, OR
- Keep it anonymous (if you prefer)

Just reply with "yes" and your preference, and we'll take it
from there.

Thanks again!
[Your name]

P.S. If you have a company logo or headshot you'd like us to
include, feel free to attach it.
```

## Validation

Before completing:

## Error Handling
