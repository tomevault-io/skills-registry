# Modernizer

## Workflow
1. Analyze the current system (architecture, stack, dependencies, pain points, failure modes).
2. Document major features/modules and the required behaviors to preserve (what must not break).
3. Assess cross-cutting concerns:
   - Authn/z, config, logging/metrics/tracing, error handling, data modeling, testing.
   - Infra/CI/CD, deployment, observability, operational runbooks.
4. Checkpoint: summarize current state and confirm understanding and goals with the user.
5. Propose a target architecture and updated tech stack aligned to constraints (time, team, risk, compliance).
6. Produce a phased modernization plan with milestones, dependencies, risks, and validation gates.
7. Plan DevOps/testing improvements to support the target state (CI, IaC, release strategy, rollback).
8. Checkpoint: get user approval on scope and approach before implementation.
9. Scaffold a new structure and documentation for the target state (only when requested/approved).

## Quick Intake (Ask Early)
- What is driving modernization (security, velocity, cost, scale, maintainability)?
- Non-negotiables: timelines, budget, compliance, required uptime, migration constraints.
- What is acceptable change: API compatibility, UI changes, data model changes.
- Current pain points: outages, slow builds, brittle deploys, unowned modules.
- Deployment model: cloud/on-prem, containers, serverless, k8s, etc.

## Modernization Principles (Default Stance)
- Prefer incremental migration over rewrites.
- Preserve required behavior unless explicitly changing it.
- Use feature flags, parallel run, and backward compatibility when risk is high.
- Treat observability and testing as migration enablers, not afterthoughts.

## Deliverable Shapes

Current-state report:
- Architecture overview (components + dependencies).
- Dependency/runtime inventory (versions, EOL risks).
- Key workflows and failure modes.
- Pain points + suspected root causes.

Target-state proposal:
- Architecture diagram (textual is fine).
- Tech stack choices with rationale and trade-offs.
- Migration strategy (strangler, modular monolith, service extraction, etc.).

Phased plan:
- Phases with milestones and "exit criteria".
- Dependencies and parallelization opportunities.
- Rollout/rollback plan per phase.
- Risks with mitigations.

## Deliverables
- Current-state analysis summary.
- Target-state architecture proposal.
- Phased plan (tasks, dependencies, rollout, rollback).
- Updated docs covering setup, architecture, and feature-level changes.
- Optional scaffolded project structure for the modernized system.

## Constraints
- Preserve user-required behavior unless explicitly changing it.
- Avoid unrelated new features.
- Prefer incremental migration with feature flags/backward compatibility when possible.
- Keep changes safe: testing, observability, rollback plan.

## References
- `references/modernizer.md`

## Extended Guidance
Use this when the modernization spans multiple layers (frontend, backend, infra) or when de-risking
production changes.

## Modernization Archetypes
- Dependency refresh (security + compatibility).
- Platform upgrade (language/runtime/framework major versions).
- Architecture shift (monolith to services, service mesh, event-driven).
- Observability + reliability uplift (metrics, tracing, SLOs).
- Data layer refactor (schema changes, storage engine, caching).

## Decision Gates
- Can we isolate risk behind a feature flag or canary?
- Is there a rollback path for each major step?
- Can we ship incremental value every sprint?
- Do we need a compatibility layer or dual-write period?

## Migration Workstreams
- Code changes and refactors.
- Infrastructure and deployment changes.
- Data migrations and backfills.
- Test/quality improvements.
- Documentation and training.

## Compatibility Strategy Checklist
- Maintain backward-compatible APIs where possible.
- Introduce adapters for old interfaces when needed.
- Run dual writes/reads only for the minimum time required.
- Add migration metrics and dashboards.

## Validation and Rollback
- Define success metrics and rollback triggers before rollout.
- Test rollback procedures in staging.
- Keep an inventory of changes that are not easily reversible.

## Common Failure Modes
- Skipping baselines; no “before” metrics exist.
- Attempting a big-bang migration without canaries.
- Underestimating schema migration time or replication lag.
- Leaving compatibility layers permanently.

- Migration plan with rollback steps.
- Updated runbooks and monitoring dashboards.
