# React

## Workflow
1. Confirm React/runtime baseline and application architecture constraints.
2. Design component boundaries and prop APIs before implementation.
3. Choose state strategy by scope: local, shared client, and server state.
4. Implement effects and async flows with cancellation/error handling.
5. Optimize rendering and bundle behavior with measured evidence.
6. Validate user behavior with testing pyramid and accessibility checks.
7. Enforce lint/type/build gates in CI.
8. Document migration and operational risks for release.

## Preflight (Ask / Check First)
- React version and rendering mode constraints.
- TypeScript strictness and linting baseline.
- Data layer choice for server state and caching.
- Design system/component library conventions.
- Performance goals for key routes and devices.
- Accessibility and compliance requirements.

## Operating Principles
- Keep components pure and deterministic by default.
- Prefer composition and hooks over inheritance patterns.
- Keep state minimal and colocated to where it is used.
- Separate server-state concerns from local UI state.
- Treat effects as synchronization boundaries, not general logic buckets.
- Optimize after measuring real bottlenecks.

## Component Design and TypeScript
- Use function components and typed props by default.
- Prefer discriminated unions for mode-dependent props.
- Avoid prop surfaces with uncontrolled boolean explosion.
- Keep component responsibilities narrow and explicit.
- Use stable keys for list rendering; avoid index keys on mutable lists.

### Component API Checklist
- Props represent intent, not implementation detail.
- Controlled/uncontrolled behavior is explicit.
- Accessibility attributes and semantics are first-class.
- Error and loading states are modeled clearly.

## State Management
- Start with local state; lift only when necessary.
- Use context for ambient dependencies, not broad mutable state by default.
- Use reducer patterns when transitions are complex.
- Keep derived state computed, not duplicated.
- Escalate to dedicated state tools only when complexity demands.

### State Decision Heuristic
- Local UI concern: `useState`/`useReducer`.
- Cross-feature client concern: context or store.
- Remote data: dedicated server-state cache/query layer.

## Effects, Data Fetching, and Error Handling
- Keep effects idempotent and dependency-accurate.
- Always clean up subscriptions, timers, and abortable async work.
- Assume Strict Mode will re-run effects and initializers in dev; make side effects safe to replay.
- Use state updater functions in effects when deriving from previous state.
- Handle loading, empty, error, and retry paths explicitly.
- Keep side effects in handlers/effects, not render paths.
- Normalize error boundaries for recoverable UX.

### Effect Safety Pattern
```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  const controller = new AbortController();
  loadData({ signal: controller.signal });
  return () => controller.abort();
}, [loadData]);
```

## Performance and Scalability
- Profile before adding memoization.
- Use `memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback` only where measured benefit exists.
- Avoid creating unstable objects/functions in hot paths unnecessarily.
- Split large bundles and defer non-critical code.
- Keep list rendering virtualized for large datasets.

### Performance Validation Commands
```bash
npm run build
npm run test
```

```bash
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
```

## Testing Strategy
- Unit-test pure logic and component edge cases.
- Integration-test feature flows and data boundaries.
- E2E-test critical user journeys and regressions.
- Prefer user-centric assertions over implementation details.
- In React 19+, import `act` from `react`; avoid `react-dom/test-utils` helpers.
- Keep flaky tests out of required merge gates.

## Accessibility, Styling, and UX Consistency
- Use semantic HTML and roles before custom ARIA.
- Ensure visible focus states and keyboard operability.
- Validate color contrast and reduced-motion behavior.
- Keep form labels and error messaging accessible.
- Align styling patterns with design system tokens.

## Architecture and Code Organization
- Use feature-oriented folders and clear ownership boundaries.
- Keep business logic in hooks/services, not deeply nested UI trees.
- Avoid circular dependencies and utility sprawl.
- Keep route-level composition simple and discoverable.
- Document domain boundaries and extension points.

## Delivery, Security, and Operations
- Keep CI gates for lint, type checks, tests, and build.
- Prevent secrets from entering frontend bundles.
- Validate dependency risk and lockfile integrity.
- Use runtime monitoring for errors and performance web vitals.
- Keep rollback strategy for high-risk releases.

## Migration and Modernization
- Upgrade React and tooling incrementally.
- Validate strict mode behavior and deprecated API usage.
- Remove legacy patterns gradually with codemod/testing support.
- For React 19, upgrade to 18.3 first to surface deprecation warnings and remove legacy `render`/`hydrate`/`unmountComponentAtNode`/`findDOMNode` usage.
- Treat `ref` as a regular prop in new components and avoid `element.ref` access in migration work.
- Replace string refs and legacy context patterns in class components during migration work.
- Prefer `useActionState` and `useOptimistic` for form/action-driven pending and optimistic UX flows in React 19+ stacks.
- Re-baseline performance and bundle budgets after upgrades.

## Common Failure Modes
- Effects with stale dependencies causing subtle bugs.
- Over-centralized state creating coupling and re-render storms.
- Premature memoization increasing complexity with no gain.
- Tests asserting internals instead of user-visible behavior.
- Accessibility regressions from custom components without semantics.
- Feature delivery without route-level performance verification.

## Definition of Done
- Component and state boundaries are explicit and maintainable.
- Async/effect logic is safe and cancellation-aware.
- Performance, accessibility, and testing checks are passing.
- Delivery pipeline enforces quality and security gates.
- Upgrade and rollback implications are documented.

## Quick Questions (When Stuck)
- Is this state colocated at the lowest useful scope?
- Should this logic be a custom hook or remain local?
- Can we remove this effect and derive from state instead?
- Which user-facing metric justifies this optimization?
- Do tests and accessibility checks prove this behavior is safe?
