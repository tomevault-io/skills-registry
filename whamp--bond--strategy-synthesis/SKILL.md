# Strategy Synthesis

Apex2's critical "Strategy Synthesis" phase that connects parallel intelligence gathering to optimized execution.

## Instructions

When invoked (typically with structured findings from orchestrator), synthesize all intelligence sources into a unified, actionable execution plan.

### 1. Data Ingestion Process

### Method 1: Orchestrator Invocation (Primary)
The orchestrator should invoke this skill with structured findings:

```
Invoke strategy-synthesis to integrate these findings:

Prediction Analysis:
- Task Type: ML/DL training
- Complexity: Medium
- Risk Profile: Medium (resource intensive)
- Key Files: train.py, model.py, data.py
- Requirements: GPU, pytorch

Web Research Findings:
- Solution 1: Pytorch DataLoader batch_size=32 recommendation (stackoverflow)
- Solution 2: Mixed precision training code example (GitHub)
- Key insight: Training >5min, monitor validation loss

Deep Strategy Options:
- Approach A: Simple training with basic monitoring
- Approach B: Cross-validation with early stopping
- Approach C: Distributed training approach
- Common failures: GPU memory overflow, data loading bottlenecks

Environment State:
- PyTorch 2.1.0 installed, GPU available
- 16GB RAM, dataset 8GB fits
- CUDA working, can handle batch_size=64
- Current processes: none interfering

Previous Execution (Episode 1):
- Attempted: Simple training approach
- Result: Slow but working
- Issues: Training time > expected
```

### Method 2: Temporary File Access
If orchestrator writes findings to `/tmp/apex2-findings.txt`:

```bash
# Read structured findings file
cat /tmp/apex2-findings.json
```

### Method 3: Execute-based Data Retrieval
If orchestrator sets environment variables:

```bash
# Check for structured data
echo "Prediction: $APEX2_PREDICTION"
echo "Web: $APEX2_WEB"
echo "Strategy: $APEX2_STRATEGY"
echo "Environment: $APEX2_ENV"
```

### Method 4: Context Parsing (Fallback)
Parse conversation history for structured intelligence blocks.

### 2. Synthesis Process

### Step 1: Cross-Reference Analysis
- **Compare web solutions with environment capabilities**: Can we implement the GitHub solutions?
- **Match strategy options with task complexity**: Is Approach B appropriate for Medium complexity?
- **Validate requirements against state**: Are GPU resources sufficient for recommended approach?
- **Identify contradictions**: Web solution requires library not installed?

### Step 2: Prioritization Matrix
Rate each approach based on multiple criteria:

| Approach | Feasibility | Efficiency | Risk | Robustness | **Total** |
|-----------|-------------|------------|------|------------|----------|
| Approach A | High | Medium | Low | High | **8/12** |
| Approach B | Medium | High | Medium | High | **9/12** |
| Approach C | Low | Very High | High | Medium | **8/12** |

### Step 3: Risk-Adapted Selection
Based on task category and risk profile:

**For ML/DL tasks** (medium risk): Choose Approach B (cross-validation) with:
- Enhanced monitoring from web research
- Memory management from environment constraints
- Training parameters from prediction analysis

**For Security tasks** (high risk): Choose least destructive, most tested approach

**For Web Dev tasks** (low risk): Choose fastest implementation approach

### Step 4: Concrete Execution Planning
Generate step-by-step plan with specific adaptations:

```markdown
## Recommended Execution Plan: Enhanced Training (Approach B)

### Phase 1: Environment Preparation
1. Update configuration with batch_size=64 (web research + environment capability)
2. Set up mixed precision training (GitHub code adaptation)
3. Implement monitoring for training >5min (web research insight)

### Phase 2: Cross-Validation Setup
1. Split dataset into 5 folds (from strategy option B)
2. Configure early stopping parameters (adapt to environment constraints)
3. Set up GPU memory monitoring (address failure prediction)

### Phase 3: Training Execution
1. Run fold 1 training with enhanced monitoring
2. Validate results and adjust parameters
3. Continue with remaining folds if fold 1 succeeds

### Phase 4: Model Selection
1. Compare results across folds
2. Select best performing model
3. Validate on holdout dataset

### Risk Management:
- **Memory overflow**: Monitor GPU memory, reduce batch_size if needed
- **Training time**: Progress reporting every epoch, early stopping if no improvement
- **Data bottlenecks**: Pre-process data in batches to memory
```

### Step 5: Validation Criteria Definition
Define success metrics and validation steps:

```markdown
## Success Validation
- Training completes without memory errors
- All 5 folds execute without GPU overflow
- Cross-validation scores consistent (variance < 10%)
- Model performance meets baseline requirements

## Execution Validation
- Each phase completes successfully before proceeding
- Error recovery applied automatically if issues arise
- Training progress visible throughout >5min process
```

### 3. Output Structure

Provide structured output that orchestrator can parse:

```
[Strategy Synthesis Complete]
Recommended Approach: Enhanced Training (Approach B)
Confidence Level: High (compatible with environment, addresses risks)

Execution Plan:
Phase 1: Environment Preparation
  - Update config with batch_size=64
  - Implement mixed precision training
  - Set up enhanced monitoring

Phase 2: Cross-Validation Setup
  - Split data into 5 folds
  - Configure early stopping
  - Set up GPU memory monitoring

Phase 3: Training Execution
  - Run enhanced training with monitoring
  - Apply error recovery as needed
  - Progress reporting every epoch

Phase 4: Model Selection
  - Compare fold results
  - Select best model
  - Validate on holdout data

Risk Mitigations:
- Memory overflow: Adaptive batch sizing
- Training time: Early stopping + progress reporting  
- Data bottlenecks: Batch preprocessing

Validation Criteria:
- All folds complete without GPU errors
- Cross-validation consistency
- Model performance thresholds met

Backup Options:
- If memory issues: Fall back to Approach A (simpler training)
- If time constraints: Use subset of validation folds
- If GPU unavailable: Switch to CPU training (slower but works)
```

## Synthesis Patterns by Task Type

### Software Development
- **Combine environment constraints with web solutions**: Can we implement suggested libraries?
- **Match strategy options with codebase conventions**: Compatible with existing patterns?
- **Risk-adapt to production context**: Conservative approaches for production systems

### Data/ML Tasks  
- **Environment capability matching**: Hardware resources vs algorithm requirements
- **Research-based optimization**: Apply cutting-edge techniques if environment supports
- **Failure-prevention planning**: Memory, time, dependency issues addressed upfront

### Security Operations
- **Least-risk selection**: Choose most tested, least destructive approach
- **Environment verification**: Ensure backups and rollback capabilities
- **Validation-heavy planning**: Multiple checkpoints and verification steps

## When to Use

This skill is critical when:
- Multiple intelligence sources need integration before execution
- Task complexity requires strategic decision-making
- Environment constraints influence approach selection
- Risk management needs to inform execution planning
- You want to optimize success probability before execution

## Key Value

Strategy synthesis transforms disparate intelligence sources into a unified, optimized execution plan. Unlike simple "do this" approaches, it considers:

- **Real-world constraints** (environment limitations)
- **Proven solutions** (web research findings)  
- **Strategic alternatives** (deep strategy options)
- **Risk awareness** (prediction-based mitigation)

The result is an execution plan that's both intelligent and practical - the essence of Apex2's success.

## State Tracking

Skill should output synthesis completion for orchestrator to track:

```
[Apex2 State Update]
phase: synthesis
completed: true
output: unified-execution-plan
next: execution
```

This allows the orchestrator to maintain accurate state throughout the Apex2 workflow.
