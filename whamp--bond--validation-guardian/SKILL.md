Acts as final quality gate before declaring tasks complete. Use proactively after major operations or when task success needs verification. Use when this capability is needed.

# Validation Guardian

Apex2's final validation tuning implemented as a Claude Code skill. Prevents false completion signals through thorough verification.

## Instructions

When invoked (typically after claiming task completion), perform comprehensive validation to ensure the task is actually done correctly:

### 1. Parsing and Syntax Validation
Check that all generated/modified code is syntactically correct:

**Python Code:**
```bash
# Syntax check all Python files
find . -name "*.py" -exec python -m py_compile {} \;
# or more comprehensively
python -c "
import ast, sys
for file in ['file1.py', 'file2.py']:
    try:
        with open(file) as f:
            ast.parse(f.read())
        print(f"✓ {file}: Syntax OK")
    except SyntaxError as e:
        print(f"✗ {file}: Syntax Error - {e}")
"
```

**JavaScript/TypeScript:**
```bash
# Check syntax
find . -name "*.js" -exec node -c {} \;
# With ESLint if available
npx eslint . --ext .js,.ts
```

**Configuration Files:**
```bash
# JSON syntax
python -c "import json; [json.load(open(f)) for f in ['config1.json', 'config2.json']]"

# YAML syntax
python -c "import yaml; [yaml.safe_load(open(f)) for f in ['config.yaml', 'config.yml']]"
```

### 2. Execution Error Detection
Check for runtime errors and failed processes:

**Log Analysis:**
```bash
# Look for error indicators in common log patterns
grep -R -i "error\|exception\|failed\|traceback" . --include="*.log" --include="*.txt"

# Check for recent error exits
find . -name "*.py" -exec python {} \; 2>&1 | grep -i error
```

**Process Status:**
```bash
# Check if services are running that should be
ps aux | grep -E "(node|python|java)" | grep -v grep

# Check for crashed processes
journalctl -u service-name --since "5 minutes ago" | grep -i error
```

### 3. Test Result Validation
Ensure tests actually passed, not just were run:

**Test Output Verification:**
```bash
# Python pytest
pytest --tb=short -q | grep -E "(passed|failed|error)"

# JavaScript Jest
npm test 2>&1 | grep -E "(Tests:|✓|✗)"

# Look for failed assertions
grep -R "assert.*fail" test_results/
```

**Coverage Reports:**
```bash
# Check coverage meets minimum standards
pytest --cov --cov-report=term-missing | grep -E "TOTAL|missing"
```

### 4. Expected Output Verification
Confirm that required outputs, files, or results actually exist and match expectations:

**File Existence and Content:**
```bash
# Check required files exist
for file in expected_output.txt results.csv report.html; do
    if [[ -f "$file" ]]; then
        echo "✓ $file exists ($(wc -c < "$file") bytes)"
    else
        echo "✗ $file missing"
    fi
done

# Check file content is not empty (real validation)
find . -name "*.json" -exec sh -c 'if [ -s "$1" ]; then echo "✓ $1 has content"; else echo "✗ $1 empty"; done' _ {} \;
```

**Database/Service Validation:**
```bash
# Check database table creation
mysql -u user -ppassword database -e "SHOW TABLES LIKE 'expected_table';"

# Verify API endpoints respond
curl -f -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:3000/api/health

# Check service health status
curl -s http://localhost:8080/health | jq -r '.status'
```

### 5. Integration and System Validation
Verify the solution works in the larger context:

**Integration Points:**
```bash
# Check that modified code doesn't break existing functionality
python -m pytest tests/integration/ -v

# Verify package dependencies resolve
pip check

# Check imports work
python -c "
try:
    import new_module, existing_module
    print('✓ All imports successful')
except ImportError as e:
    print(f'✗ Import failed: {e}')
"
```

**Performance Validation (when applicable):**
```bash
# Check response times are reasonable
time curl http://localhost:3000/api/endpoint

# Verify memory usage is acceptable
free -h | head -4

# Check disk space usage is reasonable
du -sh ./
```

### 6. Documentation and Metadata Validation
Ensure supporting documentation is updated and consistent:

**Documentation Consistency:**
```bash
# Check README reflects current state
grep -E "(TODO|FIXME|placeholder)" README.md || echo "✓ No obvious placeholders"

# Verify API docs match implementation
# (specific to your documentation system)
```

**Version and Build Info:**
```bash
# Check version numbers consistent
grep -r "version=" package.json config.json requirements.txt
```

## Validation Categories

### Software Development Tasks
- All files compile without syntax errors
- Tests pass with expected coverage
- Documentation is updated
- Integration tests pass
- No obvious performance regressions

### Data Processing Tasks
- Output files exist and have reasonable size
- Data format is valid (JSON, CSV, etc.)
- Row counts or record counts match expectations
- No obvious data corruption or truncation

### System Administration Tasks
- Services are running with correct configuration
- Configuration files are valid
- Permissions are correctly set
- Backup or rollback capabilities exist
- Related services still function

### Installation/Deployment Tasks
- Application runs successfully
- Health checks pass
- Required ports are accessible
- Dependent services are reachable
- Load balancer/proxy configuration works

## Validation Process

1. **Define Expected Success Criteria**
   - What should exist when task is complete?
   - What should happen when tested?
   - What should NOT happen (errors, failures)?

2. **Execute Validation Checks**
   - Run syntax and parsing checks
   - Verify outputs and files
   - Test functionality
   - Check system/health status

3. **Analyze Results**
   - Identify any failures or issues
   - Determine root causes
   - Categorize severity (blocking, warning, cosmetic)

4. **Report Findings**
   - Clear pass/fail status
   - Specific issues found
   - Recommended fixes
   - Overall quality assessment

## Output Format

Provide comprehensive validation report:

```

  Warnings: [potential problems]
  Informational: [minor concerns]

Recommendations:
  Immediate: [actions to fix critical issues]
  Optional: [suggested improvements]
  Monitoring: [what to watch going forward]

Final Assessment:
  Task Complete: [YES/NO/CONDITIONAL]
  Confidence Level: [high/medium/low]
  Next Steps: [what happens next]
```

## When to Use

This validator should be invoked:
**After claiming task completion:**
- Always validate major code changes
- Verify installation/deployment success
- Confirm data processing completed correctly
- Check system administration changes

**Before declaring victory:**
- When dealing with complex, multi-step tasks
- When changes affect multiple components
- When success criteria are subjective
- When consequences of failure are significant

The goal is to build confidence that tasks are actually completed, not just appeared to complete. prevents false positives and ensures reliable deliverables.
