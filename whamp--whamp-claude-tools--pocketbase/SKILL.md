# PocketBase Skill - Comprehensive Reference

## Overview

This skill provides modular, searchable documentation for PocketBase development. Use the table of contents below to navigate to specific topics. The researcher-pocketbase agent can efficiently search and extract information from the reference files based on your query. PocketBase is an open source backend in 1 file. It provides a realtime database, authentication, file storage, an admin dashboard and is extendable to much more.

## Quick Navigation
