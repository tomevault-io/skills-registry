# Learn from Conversation

Analyze the conversation to extract lessons learned, then persist them to AI assistant configuration files or new skills.

## Arguments

Optional text to narrow what to learn (e.g. `sandbox workaround`, `that build fix`).

If `$ARGUMENTS` is `help`, `--help`, `-h`, or `?`, skip the workflow and read [references/options.md](references/options.md).

If `$ARGUMENTS` is a non-empty, non-help string, use it as a focus filter in Step 2: only surface learnings related to the specified topic, skip unrelated findings.

## Process

### 1. Detect Configurations and Existing Skills

```bash
for f in CLAUDE.md GEMINI.md AGENTS.md .cursorrules .github/copilot-instructions.md \
  .windsurf/rules/rules.md .continuerc.json; do
  [ -f "$f" ] && wc -l "$f"
done
find .cursor/rules -name "*.mdc" -exec wc -l {} \; 2>/dev/null
find . -name "SKILL.md" -type f 2>/dev/null | grep -v node_modules | \
  xargs grep -l "^name:" | while read -r f; do grep -m1 "^name:" "$f" | sed 's/name: //'; done
```

**Config detection:**
- Single config found → use it
- Multiple configs found → stop and ask before proceeding:
  ```
  Found multiple config files:
  1. CLAUDE.md (142 lines)
  2. .github/copilot-instructions.md (38 lines)

  Which should I update? (enter number, or "all")
  ```
- No configs found → **MANDATORY: read [`references/assistant-configs.md`](references/assistant-configs.md) in full** to show init commands, then exit. Do NOT load `refactoring.md` or `options.md` at this step.

**Size thresholds** for any config file:
- < 400 lines: healthy, add directly
- 400–500 lines: add carefully, note the file is getting large
- > 500 lines: **MANDATORY: read [`references/refactoring.md`](references/refactoring.md) in full** before proceeding, then offer to refactor. Do NOT load `assistant-configs.md` for this path unless also applying Route A changes.

### 2. Analyze Conversation

Before scanning, ask yourself:
- **Would I forget this?** If the lesson is obvious to any developer, skip it.
- **Is this already covered?** Check existing config entries — maybe the wording just needs tightening, not a new rule.
- **Is this universal or local?** Environment-specific workarounds must be labeled, not globalized.

Scan for learnings the user would want to carry forward:
- **Corrections**: commands retried with a flag or env change, wrong assumptions corrected
- **Discoveries**: undocumented behavior, integration quirks, environment requirements
- **Workflows**: multi-step patterns invented during the session that should be repeatable
- **Instruction violations**: if the user had to remind you of something already in the config, note it — the wording may need strengthening, not a new rule
- **Contradictions**: does this learning conflict with or supersede something already in the config? If so, flag for replacement, not addition

If no learnings pass the "Would I forget this?" filter, tell the user nothing non-obvious was found and exit — do not fabricate learnings to justify the invocation.

### 3. Route Each Learning

For each learning, ask: **would someone invoke this by name?** If you can imagine a user saying "run the [X] workflow," it's a skill. If not, it's a config entry.

1. **Is this a multi-step procedure someone would run as a workflow?** If the learning has 3+ numbered steps that execute in sequence — even if project-specific — it belongs in a new skill. Deploy checklists, release runbooks, "add an X" workflows are all skills. Single facts and gotchas are config. If yes → Route C (new skill).
2. **Does an existing skill cover this topic?** → Route B (update that skill)
3. **Is the config file oversized (>500 lines)?** → Route C or offer refactoring
4. Otherwise → Route A (config file)

The cleanest signal: **if it takes more than one command to execute, it probably belongs in a skill; if it's a single fact to remember, it belongs in the config.**

### 4. Present Plan and Wait for Confirmation

Show everything you plan to do before touching any files:

```
**[Category]**: [Brief description]
- Source: [what triggered this learning]
- Proposed change: [exact text to add]
- Destination: [file] ([current lines] → [projected lines])
```

If multiple learnings, list them all, then ask:
```
Ready to apply. Approve all, or review each one?
```

**Do not modify any files until the user responds to this step.**

### 5. Apply Changes

**Route A — Config file** (CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md, etc.): **MANDATORY: read [`references/assistant-configs.md`](references/assistant-configs.md) in full** for format and section conventions before writing. Do NOT load `refactoring.md` for this route unless the file is also over 500 lines. Before appending, search the existing config for related content — if found, propose an update-in-place rather than a duplicate entry. Then find the appropriate section, preserve existing structure, append or create a section.

**Route B — Existing skill**: read `skills/[name]/SKILL.md`, append to the relevant section, maintain existing structure.

**Route C — New skill**: create `skills/[name]/SKILL.md`. The description field determines whether the skill will ever be activated — it must state WHAT the skill does, WHEN to use it, and include trigger KEYWORDS (action verbs, file types, domain terms). A vague description like "helps with deployment" means the skill will never fire.

```markdown
---
name: [topic]
description: [WHAT it does + WHEN to use it + trigger keywords]
---

# [Topic]

## Process

### 1. [First Step]
[Details]
```

### 6. Summarize

List files modified with before/after line counts, sections updated or created, and any skills created with their names. If a contradiction was resolved, note which version was kept and why.

## NEVER

- **NEVER extract basics** — "npm install before running" or "save your work" are noise that dilutes the config; skip anything any developer already knows, because a bloated config trains agents to skim it
- **NEVER treat one-off emergency fixes as universal rules** — a workaround scoped to one repo's broken state will actively mislead future sessions where the state differs; always annotate environment-specific workarounds with the project or condition that triggered them
- **NEVER add a new config rule when an existing rule just needs stronger wording** — two entries covering the same topic create ambiguity; the agent will follow whichever it reads first, which may be the weaker version; re-read the existing entry and tighten it instead
- **NEVER create a skill just to keep the config file short** — skill fragmentation is harder to maintain than a 450-line CLAUDE.md; use the size thresholds in Step 1 to decide
- **NEVER create a skill for a 2-step workflow with no branching** — if it fits in 2 config lines, it belongs in the config; a skill requires a reason to invoke, which a 2-step note doesn't earn
- **NEVER silently duplicate a learning that contradicts existing content** — always surface the conflict to the user and propose which version to keep; silent contradictions cause agents to behave inconsistently depending on which rule they encounter first
- **NEVER write vague learnings** — "be careful with deployments" teaches nothing; "run smoke tests against staging before promoting to prod because the CDN cache masks broken assets" is actionable and explains why

## Guidelines

- **Prefer specificity**: `Run npm run dev before e2e tests` beats `ensure services are running` — vague rules train agents to interpret rather than follow
- **One learning, one location**: if it already exists anywhere in the config or a skill, update that entry rather than creating a second one
- **Strip obvious explanations from rule text**: include only the non-obvious directive; omit common-knowledge consequences. "Use `git fetch origin && git merge origin/main` when review comments exist" is enough — don't append "this creates a merge commit without rewriting history."
