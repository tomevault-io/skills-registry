# Avalonia Testing, Diagnostics, and Performance

Start with:

- `../../references/26-testing-stack-headless-render-and-ui-tests.md`
- `../../references/27-diagnostics-profiling-and-devtools.md`
- `../../references/08-performance-checklist.md`
- `../../references/07-troubleshooting.md`

Load this when an integrated sample helps:

- `../../references/09-end-to-end-examples.md`

## Workflow

1. Pick the right confidence level: unit, headless render, UI, or manual diagnostics.
2. Reproduce the issue before optimizing or broadening the fix.
3. Use diagnostics output to narrow the subsystem before rewriting code.
4. End with a concrete regression-safety plan.

## Rules

- Measure first when performance is the claimed problem.
- Keep troubleshooting steps tied to reproducible symptoms.
- Add tests for bug classes, not only the single observed path.
