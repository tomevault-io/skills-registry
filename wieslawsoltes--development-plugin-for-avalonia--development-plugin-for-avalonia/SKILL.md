description: Umbrella skill for building, reviewing, designing, porting, and migrating Avalonia applications with modern XAML/C# patterns on Avalonia 11.3.12. Use when the request is broad Avalonia work or when another specialist skill has not yet been selected; route quickly to focused skills for startup, bindings, styling, controls, layout, rendering, testing, design systems, or HTML/WinForms/WPF/WinUI/Avalonia 12 migration work. Use when this capability is needed.

# Development Plugin for Avalonia

Use this as the canonical umbrella workflow source for broad Avalonia work in this repository.

Discovery entrypoints:

- repo-local skill: `.agents/skills/development-plugin-for-avalonia/SKILL.md`
- plugin discovery: focused skills under `skills/` via `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`

Do not treat this root file as the repo-local discovery entrypoint. Keep it as the canonical routing workflow that the repo-local wrapper can load without duplicating the full guidance.

Resolve the task category, load the smallest specialist skill that fits, and keep the shared references as the single source of truth.

Primary shared indexes:

- `references/compendium.md`
- `references/00-api-map.md`
- `references/api-index-generated.md`

## Default Working Rules

- Keep default implementation guidance pinned to Avalonia `11.3.12`.
- Treat `references/68-avalonia-12-migration-guide.md` as an explicit migration lane, not the default.
- Prefer XAML-first examples unless the user explicitly asks for code-only UI construction.
- Prefer compiled bindings with `x:DataType`.
- Keep UI-thread work explicit and keep AOT/trimming tradeoffs visible.

## Routing Rules

Route to the first specialist skill that matches the request and do not keep broad orchestration in scope longer than needed.

- Startup, `AppBuilder`, platform entrypoints, lifetimes, build configuration:
  `skills/avalonia-bootstrap-and-lifetime/SKILL.md`
- Compiled bindings, runtime XAML, converters, dynamic resources, AOT-safe markup:
  `skills/avalonia-bindings-and-xaml/SKILL.md`
- Reactive flows, dispatcher usage, timers, UI-thread correctness:
  `skills/avalonia-threading-and-dispatcher/SKILL.md`
- Styles, themes, resources, property system, asset packaging:
  `skills/avalonia-styling-and-resources/SKILL.md`
- View location, templates, templated parents, tree traversal:
  `skills/avalonia-views-and-templating/SKILL.md`
- Input, commands, focus, gestures, drag/drop, text editing:
  `skills/avalonia-input-and-commands/SKILL.md`
- Controls, popups, menus, windows, tray, notifications:
  `skills/avalonia-controls-and-windowing/SKILL.md`
- Layout, panels, measure/arrange, virtualization, large item surfaces:
  `skills/avalonia-layout-and-virtualization/SKILL.md`
- Animation, compositor, drawing, Skia, rendering interop:
  `skills/avalonia-rendering-and-graphics/SKILL.md`
- File pickers, clipboard, launcher, screens, platform integration:
  `skills/avalonia-platform-services/SKILL.md`
- Validation, accessibility, automation semantics:
  `skills/avalonia-accessibility-and-validation/SKILL.md`
- Tests, diagnostics, profiling, troubleshooting, performance hardening:
  `skills/avalonia-testing-diagnostics-and-performance/SKILL.md`
- Professional design systems, tokens, motion, dense workflow UX:
  `skills/avalonia-design-systems/SKILL.md`
- Microsoft Fluent design, `FluentTheme`, palette and shell guidance:
  `skills/avalonia-fluent-design/SKILL.md`
- HTML/CSS to Avalonia migration:
  `skills/html-css-to-avalonia/SKILL.md`
- WinForms to Avalonia migration:
  `skills/winforms-to-avalonia/SKILL.md`
- WPF to Avalonia migration:
  `skills/wpf-to-avalonia/SKILL.md`
- WinUI to Avalonia migration:
  `skills/winui-to-avalonia/SKILL.md`
- Avalonia 12 migration planning and execution:
  `skills/avalonia-12-migration/SKILL.md`

## First Pass Workflow

1. Identify whether the user is building new UI, fixing an existing app, or porting from another stack.
2. Pick the narrowest specialist skill that fits the task.
3. Load only the reference documents that specialist skill points to.
4. Use `references/api-index-generated.md` only when signature-level lookup is required.
5. Escalate to the Avalonia 12 migration lane only when the request explicitly targets it.

## Output Expectations

- For broad requests, state which specialist path you are taking and why.
- For implementation work, keep architecture, view/viewmodel, and styling concerns separated.
- For migration work, anchor comparisons in the source framework's idioms and call out Avalonia equivalents explicitly.
