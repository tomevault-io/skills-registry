# Skill Judge

Evaluate Agent Skills against official specifications and best practices using an 8-dimensional scoring framework (120 points total).

## Decision Tree

Choose evaluation approach based on context:

| Evaluation Context | Primary Focus | When to Use |
|--------------------|---------------|-------------|
| Quick review (5-10 min) | Description + Knowledge Delta | Initial screening, triage |
| Full audit (20-30 min) | All 8 dimensions | Comprehensive quality assessment |
| Compliance check (5 min) | Frontmatter + Description | Format validation only |
| Improvement guidance (30+ min) | All dimensions + detailed feedback | Skill optimization |

## Workflow

### Step 1: Load Evaluation Framework

**MANDATORY - READ ENTIRE FILE**: Before proceeding, you MUST read [`evaluation-guide.md`](references/evaluation-guide.md) completely from start to finish. **NEVER set any range limits when reading this file.**

### Step 2: Quick Scan (5 minutes)

Read SKILL.md completely and identify:
- **Skill type**: Mindset (~50 lines), Navigation (~30 lines), Philosophy (~150 lines), Process (~200 lines), Tool (~300 lines)
- **Line count**: Is it appropriate for the type?
- **Description quality**: Does it have WHAT, WHEN, and keywords?
- **Knowledge delta**: Any obvious "explaining basics" sections?

### Step 3: Dimension Evaluation (15-20 minutes)

Evaluate each dimension in order:

| Priority | Dimension | Points | Why This Order |
|----------|-----------|--------|----------------|
| 1 | D4: Specification Compliance (Description) | 15 | Poor description = skill never used |
| 2 | D1: Knowledge Delta | 20 | Core dimension - determines value |
| 3 | D7: Pattern Recognition | 10 | Sets expectations for structure |
| 4 | D5: Progressive Disclosure | 15 | Checks if references are used properly |
| 5 | D2: Mindset + Procedures | 15 | Evaluates thinking patterns |
| 6 | D3: Anti-Pattern Quality | 15 | Checks for NEVER lists |
| 7 | D6: Freedom Calibration | 15 | Matches freedom to task fragility |
| 8 | D8: Practical Usability | 15 | Can Agent actually use it? |

### Step 4: Score Calculation

Sum all dimension scores (max 120 points). Calculate percentage and assign grade:

| Score Range | Grade | Interpretation |
|-------------|-------|----------------|
| 96-120 | A | Excellent - Production ready |
| 84-95 | B | Good - Minor improvements needed |
| 72-83 | C | Acceptable - Moderate improvements needed |
| 60-71 | D | Poor - Significant improvements needed |
| <60 | F | Fail - Major redesign required |

### Step 5: Generate Report

**MANDATORY - READ ENTIRE FILE**: Before generating report, you MUST read [`scoring-guide.md`](references/scoring-guide.md) completely.

Output structured report in this format:

```markdown
# Skill Evaluation Report

## Overview
- **Skill**: [skill-name]
- **Type**: [Mindset/Navigation/Philosophy/Process/Tool]
- **Total Score**: [X]/120 ([X]%)
- **Grade**: [A/B/C/D/F]

## Dimension Scores

| Dimension | Score | Max | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-----|-------|
| D1: Knowledge Delta | [X] | 20 | [brief notes] |
| D2: Mindset + Procedures | [X] | 15 | [brief notes] |
| D3: Anti-Pattern Quality | [X] | 15 | [brief notes] |
| D4: Specification Compliance | [X] | 15 | [brief notes] |
| D5: Progressive Disclosure | [X] | 15 | [brief notes] |
| D6: Freedom Calibration | [X] | 15 | [brief notes] |
| D7: Pattern Recognition | [X] | 10 | [brief notes] |
| D8: Practical Usability | [X] | 15 | [brief notes] |

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
1. [Issue 1]
2. [Issue 2]

## Improvement Suggestions (Should Fix)
1. [Suggestion 1]
2. [Suggestion 2]

## Strengths (Keep)
1. [Strength 1]
2. [Strength 2]
```

## NEVER Do When Evaluating

**Scoring Mistakes**
- NEVER give high scores for "professional formatting" alone - content matters most
- NEVER ignore token waste - every redundant paragraph = deduction
- NEVER let length impress you - 43-line skill can outperform 500-line skill
- NEVER assume all procedures are valuable - distinguish domain-specific from generic

**Evaluation Mistakes**
- NEVER skip mentally testing decision trees - do they lead to correct choices?
- NEVER forgive explaining basics with "but it provides helpful context"
- NEVER overlook missing anti-patterns - no NEVER list = significant gap
- NEVER undervalue description field - poor description = skill never used

**Reporting Mistakes**
- NEVER give vague feedback like "improve quality" - be specific
- NEVER suggest changes without explaining WHY
- NEVER provide scores without actionable improvement suggestions

## Quick Reference

### Knowledge Delta Red Flags (D1)
- "What is [basic concept]" sections
- Step-by-step tutorials for standard operations
- Explaining how to use common libraries
- Generic best practices ("write clean code")
- Definitions of industry-standard terms

### Knowledge Delta Green Flags (D1)
- Decision trees for non-obvious choices
- Trade-offs only experts know
- Edge cases from real-world experience
- "NEVER do X because [non-obvious reason]"
- Domain-specific thinking frameworks

### Anti-Pattern Quality (D3)
- Score 0-3: No anti-patterns mentioned
- Score 4-7: Generic warnings ("avoid errors")
- Score 8-11: Specific NEVER list with some reasoning
- Score 12-15: Expert-grade anti-patterns with WHY

### Description Quality (D4)
- Must answer: WHAT (functionality), WHEN (trigger scenarios), KEYWORDS (searchable terms)
- Poor: "处理文档相关功能" (vague, no triggers, no keywords)
- Excellent: "Comprehensive document creation, editing, and analysis. Use when Claude needs to work with professional documents (.docx files) for: (1) Creating new documents, (2) Modifying content, (3) Working with tracked changes"

### Pattern Recognition (D7)
| Pattern | ~Lines | When to Use |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| Mindset | ~50 | Creative tasks requiring taste |
| Navigation | ~30 | Multiple distinct sub-scenarios |
| Philosophy | ~150 | Art/creation requiring originality |
| Process | ~200 | Complex multi-step projects |
| Tool | ~300 | Precise operations on specific formats |

### Freedom Calibration (D6)
- High freedom: Creative/Design tasks (frontend-design)
- Medium freedom: Code review, judgment-based tasks
- Low freedom: File format operations (docx, pdf, xlsx)

## Output Format

Always output evaluation report in the structured format shown in Step 5. Include:
- Overview with total score and grade
- Dimension scores table with notes
- Critical issues (must fix)
- Improvement suggestions (should fix)
- Strengths (keep)

Do NOT output:
- Unstructured feedback
- Scores without explanations
- Generic comments without specific examples
