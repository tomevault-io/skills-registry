# FAF Docs - Documentation & Resources

## Purpose

Provide quick access to FAF documentation, guides, specifications, and learning resources. Answers common questions and explains FAF concepts without requiring users to leave their workflow.

**The Goal:** Instant answers. Zero context switching. Championship-grade documentation.

## When to Use

This skill activates automatically when the user:
- Asks "How does FAF work?"
- Says "Show me the docs"
- Says "Explain The Reading Order"
- Asks "What is IANA registration?"
- Says "How do I use Podium scoring?"
- Asks "Where are the FAF docs?"
- Needs format specification reference
- Wants to learn best practices
- Asks "What's the difference between project.faf and CLAUDE.md?"

**Trigger Words:** docs, documentation, guide, explain, how does, what is, show me, reference, spec, help

## How It Works

### Step 1: Identify Question Type

Determine what the user needs:

**Conceptual:**
- "What is FAF?" → Use **faf-teacher** skill for comprehensive overview
- "What is The Reading Order?" → Explain reading sequence
- "What is Podium scoring?" → Explain 0-100% AI-readiness system

**Reference:**
- "Show format spec" → Provide YAML structure reference
- "List all commands" → Show faf-cli command reference
- "Show IANA details" → Explain registration

**Practical:**
- "How do I improve my score?" → Use **faf-enhance** skill
- "How do I sync files?" → Use **faf-sync** skill
- "How do I validate?" → Use **faf-validate** skill

### Step 2: Provide Answer

**For conceptual questions:**
- Explain concept clearly
- Provide examples
- Link to related skills
- Suggest next steps

**For reference questions:**
- Show relevant specification
- Provide code examples
- Link to full documentation

**For practical questions:**
- Activate appropriate skill
- Guide through process
- Show command examples

### Step 3: Offer Additional Resources

After answering, provide:
- Related documentation links
- Relevant skills to use
- Next learning steps
- Official resources

## Key Concepts

### The Reading Order

**What it is:**
Optimal sequence for AI to read project files for complete context understanding.

**The Order:**
```
1. project.faf     → Project DNA (architecture, purpose, stack)
2. CLAUDE.md       → Workflow instructions (how to work here)
3. README.md       → User documentation (how humans use it)
4. package.json    → Dependencies (what it needs)
5. Config files    → Build settings (how to compile)
6. Code            → Implementation (what it does)
```

**Why this order:**
- Architecture BEFORE implementation
- Context BEFORE code
- Complete picture BEFORE details
- Persistent BEFORE temporary

**Analogy:**
Like reading blueprints before examining bricks. You understand WHAT you're building before diving into HOW it's built.

### IANA Registration

**What it is:**
FAF is officially registered with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority as a recognized media type.

**Details:**
- **Media Type:** `application/vnd.faf+yaml`
- **Registration Date:** October 31, 2025
- **Authority:** IANA (same authority that registered PDF, JSON, XML)
- **Status:** Official Internet standard

**Why it matters:**
- Universal recognition (browsers, email clients, APIs)
- Format authority (not a tool, foundational infrastructure)
- Same level as PDF, JSON, XML
- Professional legitimacy

**How to verify:**
```yaml
# In your project.faf
metadata:
  iana_media_type: application/vnd.faf+yaml
```

### Podium Scoring

**What it is:**
AI-readiness measurement system (0-100%) showing how well AI can understand your project.

**Tiers:**
- 🏆 **Trophy (85-100%)** - Elite AI-readiness
- 🥇 **Gold (70-84%)** - Excellent AI-readiness
- 🥈 **Silver (55-69%)** - Good AI-readiness
- 🥉 **Bronze (40-54%)** - Basic AI-readiness
- 🟢 **Green (35-39%)** - Minimal AI-readiness
- 🟡 **Yellow (20-34%)** - Very limited AI-readiness
- 🔴 **Red (10-19%)** - Critical gaps
- 🤍 **White (<10%)** - No effective AI-readiness

**What gets scored:**
- Project purpose clarity
- Architecture documentation
- Stack information completeness
- Testing approach detail
- Dependencies specification
- Format compliance

**How to check:**
```bash
faf score
```

**How to improve:**
```bash
faf enhance
```

### Context-Mirroring

**What it is:**
Bidirectional synchronization between project.faf and CLAUDE.md in <10ms (achieved: 8ms).

**How it works:**
- Changes in project.faf → auto-sync to CLAUDE.md
- Changes in CLAUDE.md → auto-sync to project.faf
- Architecture stays consistent
- Workflow stays separate
- Zero manual work

**When to use:**
```bash
# After editing either file
faf bi-sync
```

**Performance:**
- Target: <10ms
- Achieved: 8ms average
- F1-grade engineering
- Championship performance

## Common Questions

### "What's the difference between project.faf and CLAUDE.md?"

**project.faf (Project DNA):**
- **Purpose:** Architecture and project structure
- **Audience:** AI understanding "WHAT it is"
- **Changes:** Rarely (only when architecture changes)
- **Format:** YAML (machine-readable, human-friendly)
- **Contains:** Stack, framework, dependencies, testing, architecture

**CLAUDE.md (Workflow Instructions):**
- **Purpose:** How to work in this codebase
- **Audience:** AI understanding "HOW to work here"
- **Changes:** Frequently (as workflow evolves)
- **Format:** Markdown (human-readable)
- **Contains:** Git protocol, code style, development commands, team conventions

**Together:** Complete AI context (architecture + workflow)

### "Do I need both files?"

**Minimum:**
- project.faf alone = Good (architecture context)

**Recommended:**
- project.faf + CLAUDE.md = Excellent (architecture + workflow)

**Best:**
- project.faf + CLAUDE.md + bi-sync = Elite (perfect sync)

### "How often do I update project.faf?"

**Update when:**
- ✅ Major framework upgrade (Next.js 13 → 14)
- ✅ Runtime version change (Node 18 → 20)
- ✅ Architecture shift (REST → GraphQL)
- ✅ Testing framework change (Jest → Vitest)
- ✅ New major dependency added

**Don't update for:**
- ❌ New features (code shows that)
- ❌ Bug fixes (code shows that)
- ❌ Dependency version bumps (package.json shows that)

**Think:** "Would a new developer need to know this?" If yes, update project.faf.

### "Can I use FAF with [other AI tool]?"

**Yes. FAF works with ALL AI tools:**
- ✅ Claude Code (native support)
- ✅ Claude Desktop
- ✅ Cursor
- ✅ Gemini CLI
- ✅ OpenAI Codex CLI
- ✅ Windsurf
- ✅ Warp
- ✅ ANY AI tool (it's just text)

**Why:** FAF is a text file in YAML format. Any AI can read YAML. No special integration required. Universal by design.

### "What if my team doesn't use FAF?"

**You can still benefit personally:**

1. Create project.faf for YOUR understanding
2. Drop it into YOUR AI conversations
3. Save 10-30 min per session
4. Share with team when they see the value

**Team adoption is automatic:**
- Commit project.faf to repository
- Team members' AI tools read it automatically
- Everyone saves time
- No coordination required

## Related Skills

For specific tasks, use:
- **faf-teacher** - Comprehensive FAF overview
- **faf-init** - Create project.faf

## Examples

### Example 1: "What is The Reading Order?"

**Answer:**

"The Reading Order is the optimal sequence for AI to read your project files:

```
1. project.faf   → Project DNA (WHAT it is)
2. CLAUDE.md     → Workflow (HOW to work)
3. README.md     → Docs (HOW humans use it)
4. package.json  → Dependencies
5. Config files  → Build settings
6. Code          → Implementation
```

**Why this order matters:**
- Architecture BEFORE code = Better understanding
- Context BEFORE details = Fewer questions
- Complete picture FIRST = Correct suggestions

**Analogy:** Reading blueprints before examining bricks. You understand the building plan before diving into construction details.

**Result:** AI has complete context in <1 second vs 10-30 minutes of questions."

### Example 2: "Show me the format spec"

**Answer:**

"Here's the IANA-registered format specification:

**Minimal valid project.faf:**
```yaml
name: project-name
purpose: What it does
version: 1.0.0

metadata:
  format_version: 3.0.0
  iana_media_type: application/vnd.faf+yaml

architecture:
  type: web-app
  language: TypeScript
```

**Create yours:**
```bash
faf init  # Auto-generates valid format
```

**Full spec:** https://faf.one/docs/format"

### Example 3: "How do I improve my score?"

**Answer:**

"Use the **faf-enhance** skill for guided improvement:

```bash
faf enhance
```

This will:
1. Analyze your current project.faf
2. Identify missing or weak sections
3. Ask questions to gather information
4. Add improvements incrementally
5. Re-score after each change
6. Guide you to your target tier

**Typical progression:**
- Start: 58% (Silver)
- +6% add testing docs → 64%
- +4% add API docs → 68%
- +2% add architecture → 70% (Gold) ✨

Want me to activate the faf-enhance skill now?"
