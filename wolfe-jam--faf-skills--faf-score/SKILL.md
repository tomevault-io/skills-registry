# FAF Score - AI-Readiness Measurement

## Purpose

Calculate and explain the AI-readiness score for any project with a `project.faf` file. The score measures how well AI can understand your project from 0-100%, using the **Podium scoring system**.

**The Goal:** Give developers measurable, actionable feedback on project context quality with clear improvement paths.

## When to Use

This skill activates automatically when the user:
- Asks "What's my AI-readiness score?"
- Says "Check my FAF quality"
- Says "How AI-ready is this project?"
- Says "Score my project.faf"
- Asks "What tier am I at?"
- Wants to measure context completeness
- Just ran `faf init` and wants to see baseline score
- Asks "How can I improve my score?"

**Trigger Words:** score, AI-readiness, quality, tier, measure, check, rating, grade, Podium

## How It Works

### Step 1: Verify project.faf Exists

Check for `project.faf` in current directory:

```bash
ls -la project.faf
```

If not found, suggest running `faf init` first (use **faf-init** skill).

### Step 2: Execute faf score

Run the existing `faf score` command:

```bash
faf score
```

This command (from faf-cli v5.0.6):
- Analyzes project.faf completeness
- Calculates 0-100% score
- Assigns Podium tier
- Identifies strengths and gaps
- Suggests specific improvements

### Step 3: Interpret Results

Parse the output to identify:
- **Score percentage** (0-100%)
- **Podium tier** (Trophy/Gold/Silver/Bronze/etc.)
- **Strengths** (what's working well)
- **Gaps** (what's missing)
- **Next tier target** (what % needed)
- **Improvement suggestions**

### Step 4: Explain to User

Present results in clear, actionable format:

1. **Current Status:** "🥈 Silver (58%) - Good foundation"
2. **What This Means:** Explain their tier
3. **Strengths:** What they did well
4. **Gaps:** What's missing or incomplete
5. **Next Steps:** How to reach next tier
6. **Improvement Path:** Specific actions to take

### Step 5: Guide Next Actions

Based on score, suggest:
- **85%+ (Trophy):** Maintain quality, consider `faf bi-sync`
- **70-84% (Gold):** Minor enhancements, use `faf enhance`
- **55-69% (Silver):** Add missing sections, use `faf enhance`
- **40-54% (Bronze):** Significant gaps, use `faf enhance`
- **<40%:** Major work needed, consider starting over with `faf init`

- 700 min/week = **11.7 hours/week saved**
- 50 weeks/year = **585 hours/year saved**

**Gold (70-84%):**
- 5 AI sessions/day × 23 min saved = 115 min/day
- 575 min/week = **9.6 hours/week saved**
- 50 weeks/year = **480 hours/year saved**

**Silver (55-69%):**
- 5 AI sessions/day × 18 min saved = 90 min/day
- 450 min/week = **7.5 hours/week saved**
- 50 weeks/year = **375 hours/year saved**

**Bronze (40-54%):**
- 5 AI sessions/day × 12 min saved = 60 min/day
- 300 min/week = **5 hours/week saved**
- 50 weeks/year = **250 hours/year saved**

Even Bronze tier saves significant time. Trophy tier is transformational.
