# Code Reviewer Skill

Comprehensive code review skill implementing **2025 research-backed best practices** with automated security checks, performance analysis, and quality standards enforcement.

## Core Philosophy

**Balanced Quality + Security Approach:**
- 50% Security focus (OWASP Top 10, vulnerabilities, authentication)
- 30% Code quality (maintainability, standards, duplication)
- 20% Performance (N+1 queries, algorithm complexity, bundle size)

**Research Finding:** Teams with continuous code review fix vulnerabilities **92% faster** than traditional batch reviews.

---

## When to Use This Skill

**Auto-invoked when user mentions:**
- "review this code"
- "check for bugs"
- "security audit"
- "analyze this PR"
- "code review"
- "check code quality"
- "review my changes"
- "find vulnerabilities"
- "performance check"

**Manual invocation:**
- Before committing critical changes
- Pre-deployment validation
- After implementing security-sensitive features
- When integrating SAST tool results

---

## Core Review Workflow

**NEW TO CODE REVIEW?** See `EXAMPLES.md` for complete walkthrough examples showing good vs bad reviews.

### Phase 1: Automated Analysis (Run First)

**Step 1: Identify Code to Review**
- If reviewing specific files: Read those files
- If reviewing PR/changes: Use `git diff` to see changes
- If reviewing entire feature: Identify affected files via grep/glob

**Step 2: Run Automated SAST Tools (If Available)**

Use the scripts in `scripts/` directory:
```bash
# Quick security audit
bash scripts/quick-audit.sh

# Or run individual tools:
npm audit                    # Dependency vulnerabilities
npm run lint                 # ESLint code quality
npx prettier --check .       # Code formatting

# Advanced (if installed):
sonar-scanner               # SonarQube
codeql database analyze     # CodeQL
snyk test                   # Snyk security
```

**Step 3: Parse SAST Results**
- Categorize findings by severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- Filter false positives (document reasoning)
- Cross-reference with manual checks

### Phase 2: Manual Security Analysis

**Check OWASP Top 10 2021 (Current Standard):**

1. **A01:2021 – Broken Access Control**
   - Are authentication checks on all protected routes?
   - Is user input validated before authorization decisions?
   - Are direct object references protected (IDOR prevention)?

2. **A03:2021 – Injection (SQL, NoSQL, Command)**
   - Are parameterized queries used instead of string concatenation?
   - Is user input sanitized before database queries?
   - Are ORMs used correctly (no raw queries with user input)?

3. **A03:2021 – Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
   - Is user input escaped before rendering in HTML?
   - Are Content Security Policy headers configured?
   - Is `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` avoided or properly sanitized?

4. **A07:2021 – Identification and Authentication Failures**
   - Are passwords hashed with bcrypt/argon2 (not MD5/SHA1)?
   - Is session management secure (httpOnly cookies, CSRF tokens)?
   - Is rate limiting implemented on login endpoints?

5. **A02:2021 – Cryptographic Failures**
   - Is sensitive data encrypted at rest and in transit?
   - Are API keys/secrets stored in environment variables (not hardcoded)?
   - Is HTTPS enforced for all external communication?

**See REFERENCE.md for complete OWASP Top 10 checklist**

### Phase 3: Performance Pattern Detection

**Check for Common Performance Issues:**

1. **N+1 Query Problem**
   ```typescript
   // 🔴 BAD: N+1 queries
   users.forEach(user => {
     db.query("SELECT * FROM posts WHERE user_id = ?", user.id)
   })

   // ✅ GOOD: Single query with JOIN
   db.query("SELECT * FROM users LEFT JOIN posts ON users.id = posts.user_id")
   ```

2. **O(n²) or Worse Algorithms**
   - Nested loops over large datasets
   - Inefficient sorting/searching
   - Recursive functions without memoization

3. **Missing Database Indexes**
   - Queries on unindexed columns
   - WHERE clauses without supporting indexes
   - JOIN operations on unindexed foreign keys

4. **Memory Leaks**
   - Event listeners not cleaned up
   - Closures holding large objects
   - Unbounded caches

5. **Large Bundle Sizes**
   - Importing entire libraries instead of specific functions
   - Unoptimized images
   - Missing code splitting

**See REFERENCE.md for performance pattern catalog**

### Phase 4: Code Quality Standards

**Check TypeScript/JavaScript Standards:**
- [ ] No `any` types without justification comment
- [ ] Proper error handling (no empty catch blocks)
- [ ] No `console.log` statements (use proper logging)
- [ ] Functions < 50 lines (extract if larger)
- [ ] Cyclomatic complexity < 10
- [ ] No commented-out code
- [ ] Import order follows convention (React → Third-party → Internal → Relative)

**Check Naming Conventions:**
- Files: `kebab-case` (user-service.ts)
- Components: `PascalCase` (UserProfile.tsx)
- Functions/Variables: `camelCase` (getUserData)
- Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` (MAX_RETRIES)

**See REFERENCE.md for complete standards checklist**

### Phase 5: Generate Review Report

Use templates from `resources/templates/` to create structured output:
- **Comprehensive Review:** Use `resources/templates/code-review-report.md`
- **Security Audit:** Use `resources/templates/security-review-template.md`
- **Performance Review:** Use `resources/templates/performance-review-template.md`
- **Quick Check:** Use `resources/templates/quick-checklist.md`

**Example report format:**

```markdown

---

## Integration with SAST Tools

### SonarQube Integration

**If SonarQube results available:**
1. Read `sonar-report.json` or access SonarQube API
2. Focus manual review on issues SonarQube missed:
   - Business logic vulnerabilities
   - Context-specific security issues
   - Authorization logic
3. Validate SonarQube findings (check false positives)

**Key SonarQube Metrics to Review:**
- **Security Hotspots:** Require manual validation
- **Code Smells:** Maintainability issues (threshold: Grade A or B)
- **Duplications:** Keep < 3%
- **Coverage:** Target > 80%

### CodeQL Integration

**If CodeQL scan available:**
1. Review CodeQL alerts in GitHub Security tab
2. Prioritize alerts by severity:
   - **Critical/High:** Must fix before merge
   - **Medium:** Fix within sprint
   - **Low:** Backlog
3. Use CodeQL's suggested fixes when available
4. Manual review for:
   - Authentication flows
   - Authorization decisions
   - Cryptographic operations

**CodeQL Strengths (88% accuracy):**
- SQL injection detection
- Path traversal vulnerabilities
- Command injection
- Insecure deserialization

### Snyk Integration

**If Snyk results available:**
1. Run `snyk test` for dependency vulnerabilities
2. Run `snyk code test` for code-level issues
3. Prioritize by:
   - **Critical:** Fix immediately
   - **High:** Fix within 7 days
   - **Medium:** Fix within 30 days
4. Check for available patches: `snyk wizard`

**Snyk Strengths:**
- Dependency vulnerabilities (real-time CVE database)
- License compliance
- Container security
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) scanning

### ESLint + Prettier + npm audit

**Basic Security Stack (Always Run):**
```bash
# Run these three commands ALWAYS
npm audit --audit-level=high    # Dependency vulnerabilities
npm run lint                    # Code quality (ESLint)
npx prettier --check .          # Code formatting
```

**Interpretation:**
- **npm audit:** Fix all high/critical vulnerabilities
- **ESLint:** Must pass with 0 errors (warnings acceptable if documented)
- **Prettier:** Auto-fix with `npx prettier --write .`

---

## Severity Classification

Use this framework to categorize all findings:

### 🔴 Critical (Blocks Deployment)
- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- XSS vulnerabilities (unescaped user input)
- Authentication bypass
- Hardcoded secrets/API keys
- Remote code execution (RCE) risks
- Sensitive data logged in plain text

**Action:** STOP. Must fix immediately before proceeding.

### 🟠 High (Fix Within 48 Hours)
- Missing authentication checks
- Insecure session management
- CSRF vulnerabilities
- Missing rate limiting on sensitive endpoints
- Weak cryptography (MD5, SHA1)
- N+1 query problems in critical paths
- Memory leaks in production code

**Action:** Create blocker ticket. Fix before next deployment.

### 🟡 Medium (Fix This Sprint)
- Missing input validation (non-critical fields)
- Inefficient algorithms (O(n²) on small datasets)
- Missing database indexes (< 1000 rows)
- Code duplication (> 5 occurrences)
- Missing error handling
- Accessibility violations (WCAG AA)

**Action:** Create ticket. Fix within current sprint.

### 🔵 Low (Backlog / Nice-to-Have)
- Code style violations (if not enforced by linter)
- Missing comments on complex code
- Minor performance optimizations
- Refactoring opportunities
- Documentation improvements

**Action:** Optional. Add to backlog for future improvement.

## Key Metrics to Track

**From 2025 Research:**

1. **Mean Time to Remediate (MTTR)**
   - Target: < 7 days for high severity issues
   - Critical issues: < 24 hours

2. **Defect Density**
   - Formula: (# of bugs) / (1000 lines of code)
   - Target: < 1.0 defects per 1000 LOC

3. **Review Coverage**
   - Target: 100% of changed lines reviewed
   - Critical paths: 100% manual review (not just automated)

4. **False Positive Rate**
   - CodeQL: ~5% (best in class)
   - SonarQube: ~8-10%
   - Snyk: ~8%
   - Track your project's rate to calibrate trust

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Over-reliance on Automation**
   - Automated tools catch 60-70% of security issues
   - Manual review essential for business logic, authorization, context-specific issues

2. **Ignoring Performance for Security**
   - A secure but unusable app is not secure (DoS via performance)
   - Balance security checks with performance impact

3. **Blocking Every Minor Issue**
   - Use severity classification to prioritize
   - Don't let perfection block progress

4. **Missing the Forest for the Trees**
   - Step back and review overall architecture
   - Check if the approach is fundamentally sound

5. **Not Checking Test Coverage**
   - Untested code = unreviewed code
   - Require tests for all security-critical paths
