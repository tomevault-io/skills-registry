# Skill Contributor

Helps contributors add new skills to the claude-code-skills repository following the proper workflow with validation and documentation updates.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- User wants to contribute a new skill to the claude-code-skills repository
- User asks to submit a skill via PR or pull request
- User requests help adding their skill to the repository
- User mentions contributing to the skill collection

## Prerequisites Check

Before starting, verify:

1. **Current working directory**: Must be the claude-code-skills repository root
   - Run: `pwd` to confirm
   - Should see: `/path/to/claude-code-skills`

2. **Git repository status**: Check if fork or main repo
   - Run: `git remote -v`
   - If user's fork: ready to proceed
   - If main repo: guide user to fork first

3. **New skill exists**: The skill to contribute must already be created
   - Ask user for the skill directory path
   - Verify SKILL.md exists in that directory

## Contribution Workflow

Follow these steps to guide the contributor:

### Step 1: Fork Verification

Check if the user has forked the repository:

```bash
git remote -v
```

**If pointing to WomenDefiningAI/claude-code-skills**:
- Guide user to fork the repository at https://github.com/WomenDefiningAI/claude-code-skills
- Ask them to clone their fork and work from there

**If pointing to user's fork**: Proceed to next step

### Step 2: Copy Skill to Repository

If the skill is not already in the repository:

1. Ask user for the skill directory location
2. Verify the skill structure:
   ```bash
   ls -la /path/to/their/skill/
   ```
3. Copy skill to the skills/ directory:
   ```bash
   cp -r /path/to/their/skill/ ./skills/skill-name/
   ```

### Step 3: Run Validation

Validate the skill structure using the validation script:

```bash
python3 skills/skill-builder/scripts/validate-skill.py skills/skill-name/
```

**If validation fails**:
- Show the user the errors
- Offer to help fix issues
- Re-run validation after fixes

**If validation passes**: Proceed to next step

### Step 4: Update README.md

The skill must be added to the README.md in the "Available Skills" section.

1. Read the current README.md to find the insertion point
2. Ask the user for:
   - Skill name (display name)
   - One-line description
   - Key features (3-5 bullet points)

3. Add the skill entry after the existing skills, following this format:

```markdown
### 🎯 Skill Display Name

**Status**: ✅ Available
**Directory**: `skills/skill-name/`
**Purpose**: One-line description of the skill

**Features**:
- Feature 1
- Feature 2
- Feature 3

[**View Documentation →**](skills/skill-name/README.md)

**Quick Install**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/WomenDefiningAI/claude-code-skills.git
cp -r claude-code-skills/skills/skill-name ~/.claude/skills/
```

---
```

4. Insert in the "## Available Skills" section (after existing skills)

### Step 5: Create README.md for the Skill

If the skill doesn't have a README.md, create one:

1. Ask user for:
   - What the skill does
   - Installation instructions (already standardized)
   - Usage examples
   - Requirements/dependencies

2. Create README.md based on skills/skill-builder/README.md template

### Step 6: Git Operations

Create a new branch and commit the changes:

```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b add-skill-name

# Add the new skill
git add skills/skill-name/

# Add updated README
git add README.md

# Create commit
git commit -m "Add [skill-name] skill

- Adds new skill: [brief description]
- Includes validation
- Updates README.md with skill documentation

```

gh pr create --title "Add [skill-name] skill" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Validation Fails

**Error**: "Invalid YAML frontmatter"
- **Fix**: Check SKILL.md starts with `---` and has valid YAML

**Error**: "name contains invalid characters"
- **Fix**: Name must be lowercase, alphanumeric, hyphens only

**Error**: "Referenced file does not exist"
- **Fix**: Ensure all files mentioned in SKILL.md exist

### Issue: User Hasn't Forked

**Solution**:
1. Direct to https://github.com/WomenDefiningAI/claude-code-skills
2. Click "Fork" button
3. Clone their fork
4. Restart contribution workflow

### Issue: Skill Not Created Yet

**Solution**:
- Use the skill-builder skill to create the skill first
- Come back to skill-contributor after skill is built
