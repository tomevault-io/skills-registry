# Code Review

## Process

1. **Determine scope** — identify what to review:
   - PR number given → `gh pr diff <number>`
   - "my changes" / no target specified → `git diff HEAD` (unstaged + staged)
   - Specific files mentioned → read those files directly
2. **Read each changed file fully** before reviewing
3. **Load [references/checklist.md](references/checklist.md)** and apply sections matching the changed file paths:
   | Path pattern | Checklist sections |
   |---|---|
   | `server/api/**` | API Route, Security, Error Handling |
   | `app/components/**`, `app/pages/**` | Vue Component, Security |
   | `server/database/schema/**` | Database & Schema |
   | `shared/schemas/**`, `shared/constants.ts` | Validation & Types |
   | `app/composables/**` | Vue Component (data fetching), Performance |
   | `server/utils/**`, `server/middleware/**` | API Route (auth), Security, Error Handling |
4. **Always apply Security Review** regardless of file type
5. **Report findings** using the output format below

## Instant Red Flags

Flag these on sight — the most frequent mistakes in this codebase:

- `server/api/projects/[projectId]/**` route missing `getAccessibleProject()` call
- Raw string where a shared constant exists (`'Open'` instead of `IssueStatus.Open`)
- `v-html` with user-controlled content

## Output Format

```
## Code Review: [brief description]

### Summary
[1-2 sentence overview and assessment]

### Findings

#### 🔴 Critical
- **[file:line]**: [description and fix]

#### 🟡 Suggestions
- **[file:line]**: [description and suggestion]

#### 🟢 Good Patterns
- [positive patterns worth noting]

### Verdict
[APPROVE / REQUEST_CHANGES / COMMENT — with brief rationale]
```

Omit empty severity sections. If no issues found, state the code looks good with brief justification.
