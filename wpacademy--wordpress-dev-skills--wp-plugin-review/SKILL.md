# WordPress Plugin Review Skill

Review WordPress plugins for security, coding standards, repository guidelines, unit tests, and accessibility.
Produces a comprehensive Markdown report with findings, severity levels, and fix recommendations.

## Overview

This skill performs a **two-phase review**:

1. **Automated Analysis** — Install and run PHPCS (with WPCS rules), PHPStan, and PHPUnit
2. **Manual Code Review** — Deep inspection of security patterns, repo compliance, accessibility, and architecture

The final output is a structured Markdown report saved to `/mnt/user-data/outputs/`.

---

## Workflow

### Phase 0: Setup Environment

Run the setup script to install required tools:

```bash
bash scripts/setup_tools.sh
```

This installs PHPCS, WordPress Coding Standards, PHPStan, and PHPUnit if not already present.

### Phase 1: Locate the Plugin

1. Check `/mnt/user-data/uploads/` for uploaded plugin files (zip or folder)
2. If a zip file is found, extract it to `/home/claude/plugin-under-review/`
3. If a folder is found, copy it to `/home/claude/plugin-under-review/`
4. Identify the main plugin file (the one with the `Plugin Name:` header)

### Phase 2: Automated Analysis

Run the following tools and capture output:

#### PHPCS with WordPress Coding Standards
```bash
phpcs --standard=WordPress --extensions=php --report=json \
  /home/claude/plugin-under-review/ > /home/claude/phpcs-report.json 2>&1
```

Also run with security-focused sniffs:
```bash
phpcs --standard=WordPress-Extra --extensions=php \
  /home/claude/plugin-under-review/ 2>&1 | head -200
```

#### PHPStan (Static Analysis)
```bash
phpstan analyse --level=5 --no-progress \
  /home/claude/plugin-under-review/ 2>&1 | head -200
```

#### PHPUnit (if tests exist)
Check for `tests/` directory or `phpunit.xml`. If found:
```bash
cd /home/claude/plugin-under-review && phpunit 2>&1 | head -100
```

If no tests exist, note this as a finding in the report.

### Phase 3: Manual Code Review

Read `references/security-checklist.md` and `references/repo-guidelines-checklist.md` BEFORE starting the manual review.

For each PHP file in the plugin, review against ALL categories:

#### A. Security Review
Consult `references/security-checklist.md` for the full checklist. Key areas:

1. **Input Sanitization** — Every `$_GET`, `$_POST`, `$_REQUEST`, `$_SERVER`, `$_FILES` must be sanitized
2. **Output Escaping** — Every `echo`/`print` of dynamic data must use appropriate `esc_*()` functions
3. **SQL Injection** — All database queries must use `$wpdb->prepare()`
4. **Nonce Verification** — All form submissions and AJAX handlers must verify nonces
5. **Capability Checks** — All privileged actions must check `current_user_can()`
6. **File Operations** — File uploads must validate type/size and use WP filesystem API
7. **CSRF Protection** — State-changing requests must have nonce + referer checks
8. **Data Validation** — All data must be validated before processing
9. **Direct File Access** — All PHP files must prevent direct access (`defined('ABSPATH') || exit`)
10. **Secure API Calls** — External HTTP requests must use `wp_remote_get/post()`

#### B. WordPress Coding Standards
1. **Naming Conventions** — Functions, classes, hooks follow WP naming patterns
2. **File Organization** — Proper directory structure and file naming
3. **Hook Usage** — Correct use of actions and filters
4. **Enqueue Scripts/Styles** — Must use `wp_enqueue_script/style()` with proper deps
5. **Internationalization** — All user-facing strings must use translation functions
6. **PHP Compatibility** — Must work with PHP 7.4+
7. **WordPress API Usage** — Use WP functions instead of raw PHP where available
8. **No Bundled Core Libraries** — Must not include jQuery, PHPMailer, etc.

#### C. Repository Guidelines
Consult `references/repo-guidelines-checklist.md` for full details. Key areas:

1. **readme.txt** — Proper format, required headers, changelog, FAQ
2. **Plugin Headers** — All required headers present and accurate
3. **License** — GPL-2.0-or-later compatible
4. **No Tracking/Phoning Home** — No unauthorized external calls
5. **No Obfuscated Code** — All code must be human-readable
6. **Stable Tag** — Must match the latest tagged version
7. **Tested Up To** — Must reference a current WordPress version

#### D. Unit Test Coverage
1. **Test Existence** — Does a `tests/` directory exist?
2. **Test Quality** — Do tests assert meaningful behavior?
3. **Coverage Areas** — Are critical functions tested?
4. **WP Test Framework** — Uses WP_UnitTestCase or equivalent?
5. **CI/CD Ready** — Is there a phpunit.xml or phpunit.xml.dist?

#### E. Accessibility
1. **ARIA Attributes** — Admin UI elements have proper ARIA labels
2. **Keyboard Navigation** — Interactive elements are keyboard accessible
3. **Color Contrast** — UI meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards
4. **Screen Reader Support** — Dynamic content announces changes
5. **Form Labels** — All inputs have associated labels
6. **Focus Management** — Focus is managed in modals/dialogs
7. **Semantic HTML** — Proper use of headings, landmarks, roles

### Phase 4: Generate Report

Use severity levels:

| Severity | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| 🔴 CRITICAL | Security vulnerability or blocking issue — must fix |
| 🟠 HIGH | Significant issue — may cause repository rejection |
| 🟡 MEDIUM | Best practice violation — recommended fix |
| 🟢 LOW | Minor improvement — nice to have |
| ✅ PASS | Area passes review |

Use the report template in `references/report-template.md` for structure.

Save the final report to: `/mnt/user-data/outputs/[plugin-name]-review-report.md`

## Important Notes

- Always read BOTH reference checklist files before starting manual review
- Provide actual code fixes with before/after snippets, not just descriptions
- Reference specific file names and line numbers for every finding
- If the plugin has no unit tests, provide a sample test file as a bonus deliverable
- Be thorough but fair — acknowledge good practices alongside issues
- The report should be fully actionable: a developer should fix all issues from reading it
- Score each category and provide an overall score out of 100
