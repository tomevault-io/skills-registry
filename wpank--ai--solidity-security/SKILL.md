# Solidity Security

Smart contract security patterns, vulnerability prevention, and secure development practices for Solidity.

## When to Use

- Writing or reviewing smart contracts
- Auditing contracts for vulnerabilities
- Implementing DeFi protocols
- Preventing reentrancy, overflow, and access control issues
- Optimizing gas while maintaining security
- Preparing contracts for professional audits


## Installation

### OpenClaw / Moltbot / Clawbot

```bash
npx clawhub@latest install solidity-security
```

## Critical Vulnerabilities

### 1. Reentrancy

Attacker calls back into your contract before state is updated.

| Variant | Description | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| Single-function | Re-enters the same function mid-execution | CEI pattern + `ReentrancyGuard` |
| Cross-function | Re-enters a different function sharing state | `nonReentrant` on all state-mutating functions |
| Cross-contract | Re-enters through an intermediary contract | Treat every external call as re-entry vector |
| Read-only | View functions return stale state mid-operation | Guard on externally-consumed view functions |

**Vulnerable:**

```solidity
function withdraw() public {
    uint256 amount = balances[msg.sender];
    (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
    require(success);
    balances[msg.sender] = 0;  // Too late!
}
```

**Secure (Checks-Effects-Interactions + Guard):**

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol";

contract SecureBank is ReentrancyGuard {
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;

    function withdraw() public nonReentrant {
        uint256 amount = balances[msg.sender];
        require(amount > 0, "Insufficient balance");

        balances[msg.sender] = 0;  // EFFECT before INTERACTION

        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
        require(success, "Transfer failed");
    }
}
```

### 2. Integer Overflow/Underflow

**Pre-0.8.0 vulnerability** — arithmetic silently wraps around.

```solidity
// Solidity 0.8+ has built-in overflow/underflow checks
contract SecureToken {
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;

    function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) public {
        // Automatically reverts on overflow/underflow
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        balances[to] += amount;
    }
}
```

> For Solidity < 0.8.0, use `SafeMath` from OpenZeppelin. Be especially cautious with multiplication before comparison — the BEC Token exploit used `cnt * _value` overflow to mint infinite tokens.

### 3. Access Control

| Pattern | Use Case |
|---------|----------|
| `Ownable` / `Ownable2Step` | Single-admin contracts |
| `AccessControl` with roles | Multi-role systems |
| Multisig + `TimelockController` | DeFi protocol admin |

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";

contract SecureContract is Ownable {
    function withdraw(uint256 amount) public onlyOwner {
        payable(owner()).transfer(amount);
    }
}
```

**Critical rules:**
- Every `external`/`public` state-changing function needs access control
- Never use `tx.origin` for authentication — use `msg.sender`
- Use two-step ownership transfer (`Ownable2Step`) to prevent accidental transfers
- No single key should control enough power to drain the protocol

### 4. Front-Running

Attackers observe pending transactions in the mempool and submit their own first.

**Mitigation — Commit-Reveal:**

```solidity
contract SecureDEX {
    mapping(bytes32 => bool) public usedCommitments;

    function commitTrade(bytes32 commitment) public {
        usedCommitments[commitment] = true;
    }

    function revealTrade(
        uint256 amount, uint256 minOutput, bytes32 secret
    ) public {
        bytes32 commitment = keccak256(
            abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, amount, minOutput, secret)
        );
        require(usedCommitments[commitment], "Invalid commitment");
        // Perform swap
    }
}
```

### 5. Oracle Manipulation

| Bad | Good |
|-----|------|
| AMM spot price (flash-loan manipulable) | Chainlink or TWAP oracle |
| No freshness check on oracle data | Validate `updatedAt`, `answeredInRound`, price > 0 |
| Single oracle with no fallback | Primary + fallback oracle with circuit breaker |

```solidity
(uint80 roundId, int256 price, , uint256 updatedAt, uint80 answeredInRound) =
    priceFeed.latestRoundData();
require(price > 0, "Invalid price");
require(updatedAt > 0, "Round not complete");
require(answeredInRound >= roundId, "Stale round");
require(block.timestamp - updatedAt <= MAX_STALENESS, "Price too old");
```

### 6. Signature Replay

Signatures without nonce, chain ID, or contract binding can be replayed.

**Use EIP-712 typed data:**

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/cryptography/EIP712.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/cryptography/ECDSA.sol";

contract SecureRelay is EIP712 {
    mapping(address => uint256) public nonces;

    bytes32 private constant ACTION_TYPEHASH = keccak256(
        "ExecuteAction(address to,uint256 amount,uint256 nonce,uint256 deadline)"
    );

    constructor() EIP712("SecureRelay", "1") {}

    function executeAction(
        address to, uint256 amount, uint256 deadline,
        bytes calldata signature
    ) external {
        require(block.timestamp <= deadline, "Signature expired");
        uint256 currentNonce = nonces[msg.sender]++;
        bytes32 structHash = keccak256(
            abi.encode(ACTION_TYPEHASH, to, amount, currentNonce, deadline)
        );
        bytes32 hash = _hashTypedDataV4(structHash);
        require(ECDSA.recover(hash, signature) == msg.sender, "Invalid sig");
        payable(to).transfer(amount);
    }
}
```

## Security Patterns

### Checks-Effects-Interactions (CEI)

The foundational pattern — validate, update state, then interact externally.

```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 amount) public {
    require(amount <= balances[msg.sender], "Insufficient");  // CHECK
    balances[msg.sender] -= amount;                           // EFFECT
    (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");    // INTERACTION
    require(success, "Transfer failed");
}
```

### Pull Over Push

Let users withdraw funds instead of pushing payments to them. Prevents one failed transfer from blocking all others.

```solidity
contract SecurePayment {
    mapping(address => uint256) public pendingWithdrawals;

    function recordPayment(address recipient, uint256 amount) internal {
        pendingWithdrawals[recipient] += amount;
    }

    function withdraw() public {
        uint256 amount = pendingWithdrawals[msg.sender];
        require(amount > 0, "Nothing to withdraw");
        pendingWithdrawals[msg.sender] = 0;
        payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);
    }
}
```

### Emergency Stop (Circuit Breaker)

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/security/Pausable.sol";

contract EmergencyStop is Pausable, Ownable {
    function criticalFunction() public whenNotPaused { /* ... */ }
    function emergencyStop() public onlyOwner { _pause(); }
    function resume() public onlyOwner { _unpause(); }
}
```

## Gas Optimization

| Technique | Why |
|-----------|-----|
| Use `uint256` over smaller types | Smaller types still use 256-bit slot + extra conversion gas |
| Pack storage variables | Multiple small vars in one 32-byte slot |
| Use `calldata` over `memory` for args | Avoids copying data to memory |
| Emit events instead of storing | Events are cheaper than storage for read-only data |

**Storage packing example:**

```solidity
// 3 variables in 1 slot (gas efficient)
contract PackedStorage {
    uint128 public a;  // Slot 0
    uint64 public b;   // Slot 0
    uint64 public c;   // Slot 0
    uint256 public d;  // Slot 1
}
```

## Proxy & Upgrade Safety

| Rule | Why |
|------|-----|
| Use EIP-1967 storage slots | Prevents storage collision between proxy and implementation |
| Call `_disableInitializers()` in constructor | Prevents attacker from initializing the implementation contract |
| Use `uint256[50] __gap` in base contracts | Reserves storage slots for future upgrades |
| Test upgrades on fork before mainnet | Catches storage layout incompatibilities |

---

## Audit Preparation Checklist

| Category | Critical Items |
|----------|---------------|
| Reentrancy | CEI pattern followed, `ReentrancyGuard` on external-calling functions |
| Access Control | All privileged functions protected, no `tx.origin`, initializers guarded |
| External Calls | Return values checked, no `delegatecall` to untrusted addresses |
| Token Handling | `SafeERC20` used, fee-on-transfer handled, ERC-777 hooks considered |
| Math | Solidity 0.8+, `unchecked` blocks audited, multiply-before-divide |
| Oracles | No spot price, freshness validated, fallback configured |
| Upgrades | EIP-1967 slots, storage gaps, no re-initialization |
| Gas/DoS | Bounded loops, pull payments, no single-user blocking |
| Documentation | NatSpec on public/external functions, events for state changes |
| Testing | 95%+ coverage on critical paths, fuzz testing, invariant testing |

---

## NEVER Do

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Kills |
|-------------|-------------|
| External call before state update | Reentrancy — The DAO lost $60M this way |
| `tx.origin` for auth | Phishing through intermediary contracts |
| AMM spot price as oracle | Flash loans make single-block manipulation trivial |
| Unchecked `delegatecall` to user address | Attacker overwrites your contract storage |
| Floating pragma (`^0.8.0`) | Pin exact version for reproducible builds |
| Unbounded loops over storage arrays | Block gas limit DoS — contract becomes unusable |
| `selfdestruct` in shared libraries | Parity froze $150M permanently this way |
| Signatures without nonce + chain ID | Replay attacks across chains and transactions |
| Push payments in loops | One failed transfer blocks all subsequent ones |
| `unchecked` blocks without proof of safety | Re-enables the overflow bugs Solidity 0.8 fixed |
