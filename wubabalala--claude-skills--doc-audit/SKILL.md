# Doc Garden — Documentation Drift Audit & Normalization

Audit project documentation against codebase reality. Detect drift, report it, optionally fix.

## NEVER

- Never update a doc based on what the code *should* look like — only sync to what it *actually* is now
- Never fix docs for a section you didn't audit — partial fixes create false confidence
- Never auto-fix non-deterministic issues without user confirmation
- Never modify code based on documentation — docs follow code, not the other way

## Modes

```
/doc-audit                → Report only, no file changes
/doc-audit fix            → Report + auto-fix deterministic issues (ghost refs, path redirects)
/doc-audit normalize      → Report + suggest structural fixes, user confirms each
```

## Two-Layer Architecture

### Layer 1: Universal Audit Core (this file)
Always executed. Project-agnostic drift detection.

### Layer 2: Project-Specific Config (`.claude/doc-garden.json`)
Generated on first run. Records doc hierarchy, environment domains, staleness threshold.

### Config Loading Flow

```
On audit trigger:
1. Call has_config(cwd) to check .claude/doc-garden.json
   - Exists → load_config(cwd), proceed to audit
   - Missing → enter Config Generation Workflow (see below)
2. User says "update config" or "重新生成配置" → re-enter generation workflow
```

`load_config()` `deep_merge`s the user's file on top of `DEFAULT_CONFIG`, so a
stale config missing newer fields (e.g. `doc_patterns`, `path_resolvers`)
inherits sensible defaults automatically. User values always win; lists are
replaced wholesale (not concatenated); an explicit empty `doc_hierarchy: {}`
is respected as opt-out of declared hierarchy (pattern discovery still
applies).

### Config Generation Workflow (first run or explicit update)

This is a **guided interactive flow**, not an auto-generate-and-save.

**Step 1: Scan** — call `generate_draft_config(cwd)` which returns:
- Detected project type (heuristic, may be wrong)
- Discovered CLAUDE.md files → proposed layer2 list
- IPs extracted from root CLAUDE.md → attempted env domain grouping
- Discovery metadata (`_discovery` key)

**Step 2: Present** — show the user:
```
I scanned your project and detected:
- Type: {detected_type} ({claude_md_count} CLAUDE.md files found)
- Modules: {layer2 list}
- IPs found: {discovered_ips}
- Environment domains: {auto-parsed or "needs your input"}
- Memory directory: {exists/not found}

Here's the proposed config:
{draft JSON}

Please review:
1. Is the project type correct?
2. Are all modules listed? Any missing or extra?
3. Are the environment domains correctly grouped?
   (If IPs are under "_unorganized", please tell me which
    environment each IP belongs to: test/prod/local)
4. Is 14 days a good staleness threshold for this project?
```

**Step 3: Confirm** — user reviews and provides corrections:
- "Type is wrong, it's a monorepo" → update
- "Add module X" / "Remove module Y" → update layer2
- "8.129.22.14 is test, 47.112.120.194 is prod" → organize domains
- "Threshold should be 30 days" → update

**Step 4: Save** — after explicit user confirmation:
- Remove `_discovery` metadata (internal only, not persisted)
- Remove `_unorganized` / `_note` fields (should be resolved by now)
- Call `save_config(cwd, config)`
- Confirm: "Config saved to .claude/doc-garden.json"

> **If `_discovery.warning` is present** (typically "no CLAUDE.md or AGENTS.md
> found at root — layer1 defaulted to 'CLAUDE.md' but the file does not
> exist"), the warning is **stripped by `save_config` at persist time and
> does not survive to disk**. Do not ignore it on the way past: prompt the
> user to create a root doc (CLAUDE.md or AGENTS.md) before saving, or
> acknowledge that downstream checks (structure/staleness) will report the
> missing root as long as it stays absent.

**Step 5: Proceed** — run audit with the confirmed config

**Key principles**:
- **Never save without explicit confirmation** — draft is a proposal, not a decision
- **Never auto-organize IPs** — user knows which IP belongs to which environment
- **Show what was detected and what was guessed** — transparency over magic
- **If table parsing succeeds, still confirm** — parser might misread
- **If table parsing fails, don't block** — fall back to listing IPs for manual grouping

## Audit Workflow

### Phase 1: Scan & Index

**Step 1 (MANDATORY): Invoke the engine first.** Before any manual Glob /
Read exploration, call `run_audit()` and parse the structured findings. This
catches the classes of drift the engine is designed for (path rot, memory
index, schema errors, custom CONTENT_DRIFT) deterministically and fast.

```python
from pathlib import Path
from core.doc_garden_core import run_audit, format_report, load_config
cfg = load_config(cwd)
findings = run_audit(cwd, cfg)
print(format_report(findings, project_name=Path(cwd).name))
```

Only after digesting the report do manual follow-up for engine blind spots:
semantic audit (below), overlap review, or anything content-specific the
custom hook hasn't modelled. The 2026-04-20 incident that motivated this
rule: skill was invoked but the operator did manual Grep instead of running
`run_audit`, produced 5 false-positive PATH_ROT readings from reading the
docs by hand, and missed the actual CONTENT_DRIFT that the engine would
have surfaced with the custom hook in place.

Supporting context reads (after Step 1):
- Memory directory: `resolve_memory_dir(cwd)` resolves the per-project
  location; existence is not guaranteed.
- `.claude/doc-garden.json`: `has_config(cwd)` tells whether user has
  committed to a config. If missing, enter Config Generation Workflow.
- Doc files actually scanned: `collect_doc_files(cwd, cfg)` returns the
  exact list the engine will audit — union of `doc_hierarchy.layer1/layer2/docs`
  and pattern discovery via `doc_patterns`.

### Phase 2: Deep Audit

Run applicable checks from `references/drift-taxonomy.md`:

**Always run** (any project):

1. **Memory Index Drift** — MEMORY.md vs actual files
   - SUNKEN: `.md` exists in memory dir but not referenced in MEMORY.md
   - GHOST: MEMORY.md references a file that doesn't exist
   - For each sunken file: read frontmatter `type` field, guess target section

2. **Path Rot** — file paths in doc files that don't exist on disk
   - Scans every doc returned by `collect_doc_files(cwd, config)` (union of
     `doc_hierarchy` entries and `doc_patterns` walk discovery)
   - Extracts paths from backtick blocks and markdown links (skips URLs and
     fenced code blocks)
   - Delegates to `resolve_reference(path_str, doc_abs, cwd, config)` which:
     - Matches configured `path_resolvers` by prefix (default: `memory/` →
       `$CLAUDE_MEMORY_DIR`, `optional`). `plans/` is NOT a default resolver —
       too many projects use `plans/` for their own `docs/plans/` layout and
       the resolver would hijack those refs. Users who rely on claude-code
       global plans can add it explicitly.
     - `optional: true` resolver whose root doesn't exist → status `skip`
       (no finding; intentional for cross-environment authoring)
     - Matched resolver whose root exists → builds candidate and checks
     - No prefix match → falls back to generic resolution (doc location,
       project root, module glob)
   - Emits PATH_ROT only when status is `missing`; `exists` and `skip`
     produce nothing
   - Skip paths matching `ignore_paths` from config

**Microservice/monorepo only** (when `layer2` + `environment_domains` defined):

3. **Cross-Layer Contradiction** — module CLAUDE.md contains IPs not in any configured environment domain and not in root CLAUDE.md
4. **Config Value Drift** — config files (bootstrap.yml, .env, docker-compose.yml) contain IPs not in any environment domain

**All projects**:

5. **Structure Drift** — module in docs but directory missing (ghost), or directory with code but not documented (undocumented)
6. **Staleness** — CLAUDE.md's last git commit is older than code directory's by more than threshold

### Phase 3: Report

Output format:

```markdown
## Documentation Audit Report

**Project**: {name}
**Scanned**: {N} CLAUDE.md files, {M} memory files
**Drift found**: {count} issues

### MEMORY_INDEX_SUNKEN (N)
| Severity | File | Issue | Fix |
|----------|------|-------|-----|

### PATH_ROT (N)
| Severity | File | Issue | Fix |
|----------|------|-------|-----|
```

### Fix Mode

**Auto-fix** (`/doc-audit fix`):
- Delete ghost references from MEMORY.md (indexed file doesn't exist → remove reference)

### Normalize Mode

**`/doc-audit normalize`** — structural normalization with user confirmation.

**Workflow**:
1. **Skeleton check**: Compare CLAUDE.md files against target skeleton for project type
   - Microservice root: must have 模块速查/分支策略/部署流程/环境信息
   - Standalone root: must have 技术栈/常用命令
   - Module: must have 技术栈/常用命令
   - Missing sections → suggest adding
   - Missing CLAUDE.md → suggest generating skeleton

   **Convention check** (`check_doc_convention()`, added alongside the skeleton check) additionally verifies:
   - Root triplet exists: `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` / `README.md`
   - `docs/OVERVIEW.md` + `docs/architecture-traps.md` exist
   - `docs/{plans,ops,references,archive}/` directories exist (empty with `.gitkeep` counts)
   - For `microservice`: each `layer2` module directory has the four-piece entry kit (CLAUDE.md + AGENTS.md + README.md + docs/)

   Full naming / placement / layering rules: see [`../project-onboarding/references/doc-convention.md`](../project-onboarding/references/doc-convention.md). The convention is the source of truth; this check is its mechanical enforcement.

2. **Frontmatter check**: Scan all memory files for YAML frontmatter
   - Files without `---` frontmatter → suggest adding name/description/type
   - User confirms each before writing

3. **Sunken index fix**: Insert unindexed memory files into MEMORY.md
   - Guess target section by filename prefix and frontmatter type
   - Present suggested position → user confirms before insert

**Output**:

```markdown
## Normalize Report

**Project**: {name}
**Issues**: {count}

### Missing Required Sections (N)
| File | Issue | Suggestion | Level |
|------|-------|------------|-------|

### Missing Frontmatter (N)
| File | Issue | Suggestion | Level |
|------|-------|------------|-------|

### Unindexed Memory Files (N)
| File | Issue | Suggestion | Level |
|------|-------|------------|-------|
```

**Levels**: `auto` (no confirmation), `semi-auto` (confirm each), `suggest` (user decides)

**Idempotency**: All checks verify current state before acting. Running twice produces no additional changes.

### Target Skeletons

See `references/config-spec.md` for full skeleton definitions per project type. For the directory skeleton corresponding to each `project_type` (standalone / monorepo / microservice), see [`../project-onboarding/references/doc-convention.md` §3](../project-onboarding/references/doc-convention.md). Key principle:

| Dimension | Enforced | Recommended | Free |
|-----------|----------|-------------|------|
| Root CLAUDE.md exists | Yes | | |
| Module CLAUDE.md exists (microservice) | Yes | | |
| MEMORY.md indexes all files | Yes | | |
| Memory files have frontmatter | Yes | | |
| Section ordering | | Yes | |
| docs/ structure | | | Yes |

### Authoring Tips: Avoiding Path Rot False Positives

Path Rot assumes paths in backticks or markdown links point to **local repository files**. When you need to reference something that isn't — an external repo, a cross-repo filename, a conceptual path — use one of these forms so the check skips it cleanly.

| You want to reference | Anti-pattern (triggers PATH_ROT) | Clean form | Why it works |
|---|---|---|---|
| External GitHub repo | `` `duanyytop/agents-radar` `` | Already handled — 2-segment slash paths with no extension in the final segment are skipped as org/repo refs | regex excludes |
| File inside an external repo | `` `highlights.json` `` | `` `agents-radar:highlights.json` `` or markdown link `[highlights.json](https://github.com/.../highlights.json)` | `:` is not in the path character class; `http(s)://` is filtered upstream |
| File in shell docs / example output | `` `/var/log/app.log` `` | Already handled — `/var/`, `/opt/`, `/etc/` etc. are recognized as server absolute paths | regex excludes |
| Glob or pattern, not a real file | `` `src/**/*.py` `` | Already handled — `/**/` is filtered | regex excludes |
| Git branch / remote | `` `origin/main` `` | Already handled — `origin/`, `devlop/`, `main`, `master` are filtered | regex excludes |

**Rule of thumb**: if the token **is** a real file living in this repo, leave it. Otherwise, wrap it in a URL or add a scheme-like prefix (`repo:file` / `upstream:file` / `external:file`). The checker keeps working as a strict file-existence guard and you keep authoring flexibility.

Extending the filter: if a whole class of paths legitimately appears in your docs but shouldn't be checked (e.g. a deployment path prefix specific to your infra), add it to `ignore_paths` in `.claude/doc-garden.json` — that's the per-project escape hatch.

---

## Custom Project Checks (`.claude/doc-garden-checks.py`)

Mechanical audit catches generic drift (broken paths, missing memory index,
bad config schema). Some drift is **project-specific content divergence**
the engine cannot know about — e.g. "CLAUDE.md declares primary target
LlamaIndex but `memory/project_plan.md` still says Dubbo". Wire these into
the audit via a custom hook at `<project>/.claude/doc-garden-checks.py`.

### Contract

```python
# <project>/.claude/doc-garden-checks.py
from core.doc_garden_core import Finding, DriftType, Severity

def run_custom_checks(cwd: str, config: dict) -> list[Finding]:
    """Return a list of Finding instances. Empty list is fine."""
    findings = []
    # ... your cross-file / content drift logic ...
    # findings.append(Finding(drift_type=DriftType.CONTENT_DRIFT, ...))
    return findings
```

**The import line is non-negotiable.** `isinstance(item, Finding)` in the
runner is module-identity-sensitive: if a custom check imports `Finding`
via a `sys.path` hack or a different module path, Python treats it as a
different class object and the runner rejects every finding it returns.
`from core.doc_garden_core import Finding` — verbatim — is the only form
that works.

### Failure isolation

The runner wraps the entire load + invocation in defensive layers. If the
custom file:

- Doesn't exist → silently skipped.
- Raises on import or execution → one `CUSTOM_CHECK_ERROR` finding, audit
  continues.
- Returns a non-list → one `CUSTOM_CHECK_ERROR` finding.
- Returns a list with non-Finding items → one `CUSTOM_CHECK_ERROR` per
  bad item; valid Finding items are still kept.

You do not need defensive `try/except` inside check functions. If you want
to distinguish "check ran, found nothing" from "check crashed", catch your
own errors and return `[]`.

### What belongs in a custom check

Project-specific content drift the engine can't generically model:

- CLAUDE.md declares a fact (version, port, primary target, schedule
  budget) that a sibling doc also claims differently.
- A module doc's tech stack pin differs from the root index.
- A README's copy-pasted quickstart no longer matches the actual script.

**Do not** reimplement checks the engine already provides:

- Path existence → use `path_resolvers` in config, not a custom check.
- Memory index sunken/ghost → built-in.
- Staleness against git → built-in.

See `examples/doc-garden-checks.example.py` for a template with detailed
inline notes.

## Semantic Audit (human-in-the-loop)

Triggered by: `/doc-audit-semantic`, or when user says "semantic drift", "语义漂移", "语义审计".

Complements the mechanical checks above. Mechanical checks catch broken paths and missing indices — cheap, deterministic, should run first. Semantic audit catches **doc claims that contradict actual code behaviour** — things only a human or LLM reader can judge.

### Motivating examples (real findings from dogfooding this skill)

- SKILL.md promised `save_config` strips `_discovery` metadata before writing; the function actually `json.dump`ed the full dict. No path was broken, so `path_rot_check` saw nothing.
- SKILL.md described Path Rot as checking "doc location and project root" (2 candidates); the implementation actually walks 5+ candidates including `memory/` runtime prefix. Behaviour vs description drift.

Neither is catchable by regex-based detection.

### When to use

- Before a milestone commit or release (spot-check docs still describe reality)
- After a refactor touched code that docs talk about
- Periodic (e.g. monthly) sanity pass on long-lived CLAUDE.md / memory
- Not every run — semantic audit is expensive; keep it deliberate

### Workflow (Claude executes, user reviews)

1. **Select scope** — ask user which docs to audit. Default: root CLAUDE.md + memory/*.md + `docs/*` relevant to recent changes. Bound at ~20 assertions per run (a human-reviewable budget).
2. **Extract assertions** — read each doc, list verifiable claims. Each claim is:
   ```
   { source: "<file>:<line>", claim: "<verbatim quote>", verify_path: "grep symbol | read function | check file" }
   ```
   Skip aspirational / subjective claims; only keep ones where code can refute.
3. **Verify each claim** — read the referenced code location. Compare quote against code reality.
4. **Classify** into three buckets:
   - **ALIGNED**: doc claim matches code behaviour
   - **DRIFTED**: concrete divergence — cite both sides verbatim with line numbers
   - **UNVERIFIABLE / AMBIGUOUS**: requires human judgement (design intent, external behaviour, runtime-only)
5. **Report** — show user only DRIFTED and UNVERIFIABLE (ALIGNED is noise). For each DRIFTED, propose a fix direction (update doc / fix code / change design) — do NOT auto-apply.

### Rules

- **Never edit doc or code based on semantic audit alone** — always present findings to user first. Semantic drift often has multiple valid resolutions.
- **Quote both sides verbatim** — doc claim vs code snippet. Paraphrase hides drift.
- **Budget ~20 assertions per run**. Scaling beyond is noise; prefer targeted re-runs over exhaustive scans.
- **Honesty about limits**: if a claim can't be verified without running code, touching network, or external context, mark UNVERIFIABLE — don't guess.

### What this does NOT do

- Does not replace mechanical checks (cheap; run them first)
- Does not auto-fix anything (drift resolution is a human call)
- Does not cross-check doc-vs-doc consistency (e.g. SKILL.md vs README.md disagreeing) — separate workflow

---

## Memory Directory Resolution

Memory directory is **never stored in config**. Resolved at runtime using the same algorithm as existing `memory_health_check.sh`:

```
cwd.replace(":", "-").replace("/", "-").replace("\\", "-")
→ ~/.claude/projects/{project_name}/memory/
```

---

## Detection Engine

All detection logic lives in `core/doc_garden_core.py`. This skill and hooks are thin consumers.

Key functions:
- `memory_index_check(cwd)` → sunken/ghost findings
- `path_rot_check(cwd, config)` → dead path findings (uses `resolve_reference`)
- `check_skeleton(cwd, config)` → missing sections/docs
- `check_frontmatter(cwd)` → missing YAML frontmatter
- `run_normalize(cwd, config)` → all normalize checks
- `generate_root_skeleton(type)` → CLAUDE.md template
- `detect_project_type(cwd, config=None)` → heuristic type + doc files list (uses `doc_patterns`; `config=None` falls back to `DEFAULT_CONFIG`)
- `resolve_memory_dir(cwd)` → runtime memory path
- `resolve_reference(path_str, doc_abs, cwd, config)` → `ResolveResult(status, candidates, reason)` — the pluggable path resolver honoring `path_resolvers`
- `collect_doc_files(cwd, config)` → union of `doc_hierarchy` + `doc_patterns` walk, deduped and stably sorted
- `deep_merge(default, user)` → config layering (lists replace, dicts recurse, `doc_hierarchy: {}` respected as opt-out)
- `load_config(cwd)` → deep-merged config from `.claude/doc-garden.json` over `DEFAULT_CONFIG`
- `validate_config(config)` → list of error strings (schema + field presence)
- `run_audit(cwd, config=None)` → all applicable drift checks; auto-loads config if omitted; runs `validate_config` + schema findings + built-in checks + custom hook (see Custom Project Checks section)
- `format_report(findings, project_name="")` → audit markdown table
- `format_normalize_report(items)` → normalize markdown table

Data types:
- `Severity` — `CRITICAL` / `WARNING` / `INFO`
- `DriftType` — `MEMORY_INDEX_SUNKEN` / `MEMORY_INDEX_GHOST` / `PATH_ROT` / `CONFIG_VALUE_DRIFT` / `CROSS_LAYER_CONTRADICTION` / `STRUCTURE_DRIFT` / `STALENESS` / `CONTENT_DRIFT` / `CUSTOM_CHECK_ERROR` / `CONFIG_SCHEMA_WARNING`
- `Finding(drift_type, severity, file, detail, fix_suggestion="", auto_fixable=False, section_hint="")`
- `ResolveResult(status: "exists" | "missing" | "skip", candidates: list[str], reason: str)`
