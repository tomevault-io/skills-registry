# Pitch Guide — Drawing Specification & Zone Reference

## 1. Pitch Coordinate System

Standard **105 x 68 m** pitch. All coordinates in real-world metres.

### Axes

| Axis | Range | Direction |
|------|-------|-----------|
| **x** | 0 -> 105 | Left goal line -> Right goal line (length) |
| **y** | 0 -> 68 | Bottom touchline -> Top touchline (width) |

### Origin & Orientation

- **(0, 0)** = bottom-left corner (left goal line, bottom touchline)
- **(105, 68)** = top-right corner (right goal line, top touchline)
- Attacking direction: left to right (increasing x)

### Coordinate Conversion from Opta

Opta raw data uses a 0-100 scale. Silver layer converts during ingestion:

```
x_metres = (opta_x / 100) * 105
y_metres = (opta_y / 100) * 68
```

## 2. Pitch Markings — Key Dimensions

All values derived from FIFA Laws of the Game for a 105x68m pitch.

| Landmark | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Pitch length | 105 m |
| Pitch width | 68 m |
| Centre spot | (52.5, 34.0) |
| Centre circle radius | 9.15 m |
| Halfway line | x = 52.5 |
| Goal width | 7.32 m |
| Goal depth | 2.0 m |
| Goal post y-positions | 30.34 and 37.66 |
| Penalty area depth | 16.5 m |
| Penalty area width | 40.32 m |
| Penalty area y-range | 13.84 -> 54.16 |
| Six-yard box depth | 5.5 m |
| Six-yard box width | 18.32 m |
| Six-yard box y-range | 24.84 -> 43.16 |
| Penalty spot distance | 11.0 m from goal line |
| Corner arc radius | 1.0 m |
| Penalty arc radius | 9.15 m (same as centre circle) |

### How Dimensions Relate

```
Goal width = 7.32 m, centred at y = 34.0
  -> goal posts at y = 30.34 and y = 37.66

Penalty area = 16.5 m either side of goal posts
  -> y: 30.34 - 16.5 = 13.84  to  37.66 + 16.5 = 54.16
  -> total width: 40.32 m

Six-yard box = 5.5 m either side of goal posts
  -> y: 30.34 - 5.5 = 24.84  to  37.66 + 5.5 = 43.16
  -> total width: 18.32 m
```

| Goal colour | white or light grey |
| Spot radius | 0.3 m (visual; actual is ~0.12 m) |

### 3.2 Boundary Lines

| Element | Type | Coordinates |
|---------|------|-------------|
| **Pitch outline** | Rectangle | (0, 0) to (105, 68) |

### 3.8 Penalty Arcs

The penalty arc is the portion of a circle (r = 9.15 m, centred on the penalty spot) that falls **outside** the penalty area.

**Left penalty arc:**
- Centre: (11.0, 34.0), radius: 9.15
- Intersection with x = 16.5: cos(theta) = 5.5 / 9.15 = 0.6011 -> theta = 53.05 deg
- **Arc: from -53.05 deg to +53.05 deg** (the right-facing bulge outside the penalty area)

**Right penalty arc:**
- Centre: (94.0, 34.0), radius: 9.15
- Intersection with x = 88.5: cos(theta) = -5.5 / 9.15 = -0.6011 -> theta = 126.95 deg
- **Arc: from +126.95 deg to +233.05 deg** (the left-facing bulge outside the penalty area)

| Element | Centre | Radius | Start Angle | End Angle |
|---------|--------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **Left penalty arc** | (11.0, 34.0) | 9.15 | -53.05 deg | +53.05 deg |
| **Right penalty arc** | (94.0, 34.0) | 9.15 | +126.95 deg | +233.05 deg |

### 3.9 Corner Arcs

Quarter circles at each corner, radius = 1.0 m.

| Corner | Centre | Radius | Start Angle | End Angle |
|--------|--------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **Bottom-left** | (0, 0) | 1.0 | 0 deg | 90 deg |
| **Bottom-right** | (105, 0) | 1.0 | 90 deg | 180 deg |
| **Top-right** | (105, 68) | 1.0 | 180 deg | 270 deg |
| **Top-left** | (0, 68) | 1.0 | 270 deg | 360 deg |

### 3.10 Drawing Order (back to front)

1. Pitch fill (green rectangle)
2. Pitch outline
3. Halfway line
4. Centre circle
5. Penalty areas (left, right)
6. Six-yard boxes (left, right)
7. Penalty arcs (left, right)
8. Corner arcs (4x)
9. Centre spot
10. Penalty spots (left, right)
11. Goals (optional, behind goal lines)

---

## 4. Framework Translation Notes

### Canvas / JS (HTML5 Canvas)

```
arc(centreX, centreY, radius, startAngle, endAngle, anticlockwise)
```

Canvas `arc()` uses **radians** and measures clockwise from the positive x-axis (y-axis points down). If your canvas has y-axis flipped (0 at bottom), negate the angles or flip with a transform.

### SVG

SVG arcs use the endpoint parameterisation (`A rx ry x-rotation large-arc-flag sweep-flag x y`). Convert from centre+angles:

```
startX = cx + r * cos(startAngle)
startY = cy + r * sin(startAngle)
endX   = cx + r * cos(endAngle)
endY   = cy + r * sin(endAngle)
```

### matplotlib / mplsoccer

The project already uses `mplsoccer` with `pitch_type='custom', pitch_length=105, pitch_width=68`. When drawing custom overlays on top of the mplsoccer pitch, use these same coordinates directly.

### Coordinate Transform

If your rendering system uses a different origin or scale:

```
render_x = (pitch_x / 105) * canvas_width  + offset_x
render_y = (pitch_y / 68)  * canvas_height + offset_y
```

For y-axis-down systems (Canvas, SVG default), flip y:

```
render_y = canvas_height - (pitch_y / 68) * canvas_height + offset_y
```

---

## 5. Zone Division System

The pitch is divided into **30 zones**: 6 longitudinal strips (x-axis) x 5 lateral channels (y-axis). All boundaries align with actual pitch markings.

### 5.1 Longitudinal Strips (x-axis) — 6 Strips

The pitch is split into three thirds (each 35 m), then each third is subdivided into two strips aligned with pitch markings.

| Strip | x range | Width (m) | Name | Tactical meaning |
|-------|---------|-----------|------|------------------|
| **X1** | 0.00 -> 16.50 | 16.50 | Defensive box | Own penalty area depth |
| **X2** | 16.50 -> 35.00 | 18.50 | Defensive build-up | Rest of defensive third |
| **X3** | 35.00 -> 52.50 | 17.50 | Middle defensive | First half of middle third |
| **X4** | 52.50 -> 70.00 | 17.50 | Middle attacking | Second half of middle third |
| **X5** | 70.00 -> 88.50 | 18.50 | Attacking approach | Attacking third before the box |
| **X6** | 88.50 -> 105.00 | 16.50 | Attacking box | Opponent penalty area depth |

**Design rationale:** The subdivision boundaries at 16.5 m and 88.5 m align exactly with the penalty area lines, the most tactically significant longitudinal markings on the pitch. The halfway line (52.5 m) splits the middle third symmetrically.

```
|--- Defensive Third ---|--- Middle Third ---|--- Attacking Third ---|
|   X1    |     X2      |   X3    |    X4    |     X5      |   X6    |
0       16.5          35.0      52.5       70.0          88.5      105
          ^                      ^                        ^
     Penalty area           Halfway line            Penalty area
```

### 5.2 Lateral Channels (y-axis) — 5 Channels

The channels are defined by the penalty area edges (y = 13.84 and y = 54.16) and the six-yard box edges (y = 24.84 and y = 43.16). Two wide flanks, two half-spaces, one central corridor.

| Channel | y range | Width (m) | ID | Name |
|---------|---------|-----------|-----|------|
| **Y1** | 0.00 -> 13.84 | 13.84 | `wide_left` | Wide channel (left touchline) |
| **Y2** | 13.84 -> 24.84 | 11.00 | `half_space_left` | Left half-space |
| **Y3** | 24.84 -> 43.16 | 18.32 | `center` | Central corridor (six-yard box width) |
| **Y4** | 43.16 -> 54.16 | 11.00 | `half_space_right` | Right half-space |
| **Y5** | 54.16 -> 68.00 | 13.84 | `wide_right` | Wide channel (right touchline) |

**Design rationale:** The central corridor (Y3) spans the full width of the six-yard box (18.32 m), capturing the most dangerous scoring zone. The half-spaces (Y2, Y4) correspond to the areas between the six-yard box and the penalty area edges. The wide channels (Y1, Y5) cover everything outside the penalty area width.

```
y=0                                                           y=68
|     Y1      |    Y2     |       Y3        |    Y4     |     Y5      |
|  wide_left  | hs_left   |     center      | hs_right  | wide_right  |
0           13.84       24.84             43.16       54.16          68
               ^           ^               ^           ^
          Pen. area    Six-yard box    Six-yard box   Pen. area
           edge          edge            edge          edge
```

## 6. Zone Naming Convention

Each zone is identified by a composite key: `X{strip}_{channel_name}`.

### Full Zone Grid (30 zones)

|  | Y1: wide_left | Y2: half_space_left | Y3: center | Y4: half_space_right | Y5: wide_right |
|--|---------------|---------------------|------------|----------------------|----------------|
| **X1** (0-16.5) | X1_wide_left | X1_half_space_left | X1_center | X1_half_space_right | X1_wide_right |
| **X2** (16.5-35) | X2_wide_left | X2_half_space_left | X2_center | X2_half_space_right | X2_wide_right |
| **X3** (35-52.5) | X3_wide_left | X3_half_space_left | X3_center | X3_half_space_right | X3_wide_right |
| **X4** (52.5-70) | X4_wide_left | X4_half_space_left | X4_center | X4_half_space_right | X4_wide_right |
| **X5** (70-88.5) | X5_wide_left | X5_half_space_left | X5_center | X5_half_space_right | X5_wide_right |
| **X6** (88.5-105) | X6_wide_left | X6_half_space_left | X6_center | X6_half_space_right | X6_wide_right |

### Compact Numeric Notation

For database columns, CSV exports, or ML feature vectors, use `zone_XY` where X = strip (1-6) and Y = channel (1-5):

```
zone_11  zone_12  zone_13  zone_14  zone_15
zone_21  zone_22  zone_23  zone_24  zone_25
zone_31  zone_32  zone_33  zone_34  zone_35
zone_41  zone_42  zone_43  zone_44  zone_45
zone_51  zone_52  zone_53  zone_54  zone_55
zone_61  zone_62  zone_63  zone_64  zone_65
```

## 7. Zone Assignment Logic

### Python Reference Implementation

```python
X_BOUNDARIES = [0, 16.5, 35.0, 52.5, 70.0, 88.5, 105.0]
Y_BOUNDARIES = [0, 13.84, 24.84, 43.16, 54.16, 68.0]

CHANNEL_NAMES = ['wide_left', 'half_space_left', 'center', 'half_space_right', 'wide_right']
STRIP_NAMES  = ['X1', 'X2', 'X3', 'X4', 'X5', 'X6']


def assign_zone(x: float, y: float) -> str:
    x_strip = None
    for i in range(len(X_BOUNDARIES) - 1):
        if X_BOUNDARIES[i] <= x <= X_BOUNDARIES[i + 1]:
            x_strip = i + 1
            break

    y_channel = None
    for j in range(len(Y_BOUNDARIES) - 1):
        if Y_BOUNDARIES[j] <= y <= Y_BOUNDARIES[j + 1]:
            y_channel = j + 1
            break

    if x_strip is None or y_channel is None:
        return 'off_pitch'

    return f"{STRIP_NAMES[x_strip - 1]}_{CHANNEL_NAMES[y_channel - 1]}"
```

### SQL Reference (for gold-layer views)

```sql
CASE
    WHEN x BETWEEN 0    AND 16.5  THEN 1
    WHEN x BETWEEN 16.5 AND 35.0  THEN 2
    WHEN x BETWEEN 35.0 AND 52.5  THEN 3
    WHEN x BETWEEN 52.5 AND 70.0  THEN 4
    WHEN x BETWEEN 70.0 AND 88.5  THEN 5
    WHEN x BETWEEN 88.5 AND 105.0 THEN 6
END AS x_strip,

CASE
    WHEN y BETWEEN 0     AND 13.84 THEN 1  -- wide_left
    WHEN y BETWEEN 13.84 AND 24.84 THEN 2  -- half_space_left
    WHEN y BETWEEN 24.84 AND 43.16 THEN 3  -- center
    WHEN y BETWEEN 43.16 AND 54.16 THEN 4  -- half_space_right
    WHEN y BETWEEN 54.16 AND 68.0  THEN 5  -- wide_right
END AS y_channel
```

### JavaScript Reference

```javascript
const X_BOUNDARIES = [0, 16.5, 35.0, 52.5, 70.0, 88.5, 105.0];
const Y_BOUNDARIES = [0, 13.84, 24.84, 43.16, 54.16, 68.0];
const CHANNEL_NAMES = ['wide_left', 'half_space_left', 'center', 'half_space_right', 'wide_right'];
const STRIP_NAMES = ['X1', 'X2', 'X3', 'X4', 'X5', 'X6'];

function assignZone(x, y) {
    let xStrip = null;
    for (let i = 0; i < X_BOUNDARIES.length - 1; i++) {
        if (x >= X_BOUNDARIES[i] && x <= X_BOUNDARIES[i + 1]) {
            xStrip = i;
            break;
        }
    }
    let yChannel = null;
    for (let j = 0; j < Y_BOUNDARIES.length - 1; j++) {
        if (y >= Y_BOUNDARIES[j] && y <= Y_BOUNDARIES[j + 1]) {
            yChannel = j;
            break;
        }
    }
    if (xStrip === null || yChannel === null) return 'off_pitch';
    return `${STRIP_NAMES[xStrip]}_${CHANNEL_NAMES[yChannel]}`;
}
```

### Edge Cases

- **Exact boundary values** (e.g. x = 16.5, y = 13.84): assigned to the **lower-index** zone by the `<=` on both sides. SQL `CASE` evaluates top-to-bottom and stops at the first match, so boundary values fall into the earlier strip/channel.
- **Coordinates outside 0-105 / 0-68**: return `'off_pitch'` in Python/JS; evaluate to `NULL` in SQL. Should not exist in clean silver data.

## 8. Tactical Context by Zone Group

### Longitudinal Groups

| Group | Strips | Usage in sequence analysis |
|-------|--------|---------------------------|
| **Own box** | X1 | Goal kicks, defensive clearances, GK distribution |
| **Build-up** | X2, X3 | Possession build-up, press resistance, progressive passing origin |
| **Transition** | X3, X4 | Central duels, midfield turnovers, counter-attack triggers |
| **Chance creation** | X5 | Final-third entries, crosses, through-ball origins |
| **Box entries** | X6 | Shots, key passes, penalty area actions |

### Lateral Groups

| Group | Channels | Usage in sequence analysis |
|-------|----------|---------------------------|
| **Wide** | Y1, Y5 | Wing play, crosses, overlapping runs |
| **Half-spaces** | Y2, Y4 | Positional play, diagonal runs, creative passing |
| **Central** | Y3 | Direct attacks, through balls, shots, defensive spine |

---

## 9. Zone Visualisation — Drawing Zones on the Pitch

To overlay the 30-zone grid on a pitch rendering, draw these dividing lines:

### Longitudinal Division Lines (vertical lines)

| Line | x | From | To |
|------|---|------|----|
| Penalty area (left) | 16.5 | (16.5, 0) | (16.5, 68) |
| Defensive/middle third | 35.0 | (35.0, 0) | (35.0, 68) |
| Halfway line | 52.5 | already drawn as pitch marking |
| Middle/attacking third | 70.0 | (70.0, 0) | (70.0, 68) |
| Penalty area (right) | 88.5 | (88.5, 0) | (88.5, 68) |

### Lateral Division Lines (horizontal lines)

| Line | y | From | To |
|------|---|------|----|
| Penalty area bottom | 13.84 | (0, 13.84) | (105, 13.84) |
| Six-yard box bottom | 24.84 | (0, 24.84) | (105, 24.84) |
| Six-yard box top | 43.16 | (0, 43.16) | (105, 43.16) |
| Penalty area top | 54.16 | (0, 54.16) | (105, 54.16) |

### Zone Label Positions (centre of each zone)

For placing text labels, use the midpoint of each zone's bounding box. Example for X3_center:

```
label_x = (35.0 + 52.5) / 2 = 43.75
label_y = (24.84 + 43.16) / 2 = 34.0
```

---

## 10. Usage in Gold-Layer Tables

### `gold.sequences` — Possession Sequences

Each sequence row should include:

- `start_zone` — zone of the first event in the sequence
- `end_zone` — zone of the last event in the sequence
- `start_x_strip`, `start_y_channel` — numeric components for easy filtering
- `end_x_strip`, `end_y_channel` — numeric components for easy filtering

### Zone Transition Matrix

For phase-of-play analysis, build a 30x30 transition matrix counting how often sequences move from one zone to another. This powers questions like: "How often do sequences starting in X2_half_space_left end in X6_center?"

### Per-Zone Aggregations

Zone-level stats (pass completion %, xT generated, defensive actions per zone) should use `x_strip` and `y_channel` as GROUP BY dimensions, allowing flexible roll-ups by third, channel, or individual zone.

---

## 11. Relationship to Previous Zone System

The old zone system used 20 zones with slightly different boundaries (y = 13.54, 24.54, 43.35, 54.35) that did not align with the actual pitch markings. The new system:

- **Aligns exactly** with penalty_area_bottom (13.84), six_yard_bottom (24.84), six_yard_top (43.16), and penalty_area_top (54.16).
- Increases granularity from 20 to 30 zones by using a consistent 6x5 grid.
- Introduces half-spaces as first-class channels, essential for modern positional-play analysis.
- Uses a regular naming convention (`X{strip}_{channel}`) that is sortable, groupable, and self-documenting.
