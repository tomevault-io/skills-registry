# Analyze GitHub Repo

Evaluate a GitHub repository for potential inclusion as a tool spotlight in the news digest.

## When to Use

- Evaluating trending repos for digest tool spotlight section
- Assessing quality and usefulness of new AI tools
- Creating tool recommendation summaries
- Keywords: github, repository, tool, library, spotlight, analysis

## Prerequisites

- Repository metadata available (from fetch-github-trending)
- Network access to GitHub for README fetch (optional)

## Input Schema

```json
{
  "repo": {
    "full_name": "owner/repo-name",
    "name": "repo-name",
    "description": "Repository description",
    "url": "https://github.com/owner/repo-name",
    "stars": 5000,
    "forks": 300,
    "language": "Python",
    "topics": ["llm", "machine-learning"],
    "created_at": "2025-06-15",
    "pushed_at": "2026-01-26",
    "open_issues": 42
  },
  "include_readme": true
}
```

## Actions

### Step 1: Assess Project Category

Classify the repository:
- **Framework**: Full framework for building applications (e.g., LangChain)
- **Library**: Focused library for specific task (e.g., sentence-transformers)
- **Tool**: Standalone tool or CLI (e.g., ollama)
- **Model**: Model weights or implementation (e.g., Llama)
- **Dataset**: Dataset or data processing
- **Application**: Complete application (e.g., chat UI)
- **Tutorial/Demo**: Educational content

### Step 2: Evaluate Quality Signals

Assess quality based on:
1. **Documentation**: Is there a README? Is it comprehensive?
2. **Activity**: Recent commits? Active maintenance?
3. **Community**: Issues being addressed? PRs reviewed?
4. **Code Quality**: Based on language, structure visible from description
5. **Dependencies**: Are dependencies reasonable and maintained?

### Step 3: Analyze Popularity Trajectory

Calculate growth indicators:
- **Star velocity**: Stars gained recently (estimate from trending status)
- **Fork ratio**: Forks/Stars indicates adoption
- **Issue health**: Open issues vs total activity
- **Maturity**: Age vs popularity

### Step 4: Determine Use Cases

Identify who would benefit:
- **Researchers**: Academic use cases
- **Practitioners**: Production deployment
- **Hobbyists**: Personal projects
- **Enterprise**: Business applications

### Step 5: Identify Differentiators

What makes this repo special:
- **Novel approach**: Does something new
- **Better performance**: Faster/cheaper than alternatives
- **Ease of use**: Lower barrier than alternatives
- **Integration**: Works well with popular tools
- **Active community**: Good support and updates

### Step 6: Fetch and Analyze README (if enabled)

If `include_readme` is true:
1. Fetch README.md from GitHub
2. Extract:
   - Installation instructions
   - Quick start example
   - Feature list
   - Comparison with alternatives (if mentioned)

### Step 7: Generate Spotlight Summary

If spotlight-worthy, create a 2-3 sentence summary:
1. What the tool does
2. Why it's noteworthy now
3. Who should check it out

### Step 8: Determine Spotlight Worthiness

A repo is spotlight-worthy if:
- Stars >= 1000 OR growing rapidly (>500 in last week)
- Active maintenance (pushed within 7 days)
- Clear, useful purpose for AI practitioners
- Good documentation
- NOT primarily educational/tutorial content

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Category correctly identified
- [ ] Quality assessment reasonable
- [ ] Spotlight decision justified by metrics
- [ ] Summary is concise and informative
- [ ] Target audience identified

## Failure Handling

| Error Type | Handling Strategy |
|------------|-------------------|
| README fetch fails | Continue without README analysis |
| Minimal description | Use topics and repo name for analysis |
| Private/deleted repo | Return error with explanation |
