```

Clears a stopped background process from the list.

## Arguments Schema
The schema below describes the `arguments` object in the request payload.
```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "processId": {
      "type": "string",
      "format": "uuid"
    }
  },
  "required": [
    "processId"
  ],
  "additionalProperties": false,
