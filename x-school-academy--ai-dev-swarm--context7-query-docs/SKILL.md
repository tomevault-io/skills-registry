## Usage
Use the MCP tool `dev-swarm.request` to send the payload as a JSON string:

```json
{"server_id":"context7","tool_name":"query-docs","arguments":{}}
```

## Tool Description
Retrieves and queries up-to-date documentation and code examples from Context7 for any programming library or framework.  You must call 'resolve-library-id' first to obtain the exact Context7-compatible library ID required to use this tool, UNLESS the user explicitly provides a library ID in the format '/org/project' or '/org/project/version' in their query.  IMPORTANT: Do not call this tool more than 3 times per question. If you cannot find what you need after 3 calls, use the best information you have.

## Arguments Schema
The schema below describes the `arguments` object in the request payload.
```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "libraryId": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Exact Context7-compatible library ID (e.g., '/mongodb/docs', '/vercel/next.js', '/supabase/supabase', '/vercel/next.js/v14.3.0-canary.87') retrieved from 'resolve-library-id' or directly from user query in the format '/org/project' or '/org/project/version'."
    },
    "query": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "The question or task you need help with. Be specific and include relevant details. Good: 'How to set up authentication with JWT in Express.js' or 'React useEffect cleanup function examples'. Bad: 'auth' or 'hooks'. IMPORTANT: Do not include any sensitive or confidential information such as API keys, passwords, credentials, or personal data in your query."
    }
  },
  "required": [
    "libraryId",
    "query"
  ],
  "additionalProperties": false,
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"
}
```

## Background Tasks
If the tool returns a task id, poll the task status via the MCP request tool:

```json
{"server_id":"context7","method":"tasks/status","params":{"task_id":"<task_id>"}}
```
