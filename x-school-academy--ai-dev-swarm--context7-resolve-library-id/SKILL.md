## Usage
Use the MCP tool `dev-swarm.request` to send the payload as a JSON string:

```json
{"server_id":"context7","tool_name":"resolve-library-id","arguments":{}}
```

## Tool Description
Resolves a package/product name to a Context7-compatible library ID and returns matching libraries.  You MUST call this function before 'query-docs' to obtain a valid Context7-compatible library ID UNLESS the user explicitly provides a library ID in the format '/org/project' or '/org/project/version' in their query.  Selection Process: 1. Analyze the query to understand what library/package the user is looking for 2. Return the most relevant match based on: - Name similarity to the query (exact matches prioritized) - Description relevance to the query's intent - Documentation coverage (prioritize libraries with higher Code Snippet counts) - Source reputation (consider libraries with High or Medium reputation more authoritative) - Benchmark Score: Quality indicator (100 is the highest score)  Response Format: - Return the selected library ID in a clearly marked section - Provide a brief explanation for why this library was chosen - If multiple good matches exist, acknowledge this but proceed with the most relevant one - If no good matches exist, clearly state this and suggest query refinements  For ambiguous queries, request clarification before proceeding with a best-guess match.  IMPORTANT: Do not call this tool more than 3 times per question. If you cannot find what you need after 3 calls, use the best result you have.

## Arguments Schema
The schema below describes the `arguments` object in the request payload.
```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "query": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "The user's original question or task. This is used to rank library results by relevance to what the user is trying to accomplish. IMPORTANT: Do not include any sensitive or confidential information such as API keys, passwords, credentials, or personal data in your query."
    },
    "libraryName": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Library name to search for and retrieve a Context7-compatible library ID."
    }
  },
  "required": [
    "query",
    "libraryName"
  ],
  "additionalProperties": false,
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"
}
```

## Background Tasks
If the tool returns a task id, poll the task status via the MCP request tool:

```json
{"server_id":"context7","method":"tasks/status","params":{"task_id":"<task_id>"}}
```
