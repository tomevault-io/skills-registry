# AI Builder - Code Development

This skill implements backlogs through a structured feature-driven approach. As a Software Engineer expert, you'll read backlog requirements, reference existing features, design implementation approach, write code, and create comprehensive documentation for the features knowledge base.

## When to Use This Skill

- User asks to implement a backlog
- User requests to complete a feature, change, bug fix, or improvement
- User says "develop backlog X"
- User wants to implement work from sprint
- User asks to code a specific backlog item

## Prerequisites

This skill requires:
- `04-prd/` - Product Requirements Document (business requirements and acceptance criteria)
- `07-tech-specs/` - Engineering standards and constraints
- `10-sprints/` folder with active sprint and backlogs
- `features/` folder with features-index.md (existing features knowledge base)
- Understanding of the backlog type: FEATURE, CHANGE, BUG, or IMPROVE

## Feature-Driven Development Workflow

**CRITICAL:** This skill follows a strict feature-driven approach where `feature-name` is the index for the entire project:

**For Each Backlog:**
1. Read `backlog` from `10-sprints/SPRINT-XX-descriptive-name/[BACKLOG_TYPE]-XX-[feature-name]-<sub-feature>.md`
2. Extract the `feature-name` from the backlog file name
3. Read `features/features-index.md` to find the feature file
4. Read feature documentation in this order:
   - `features/[feature-name].md` - Feature definition (WHAT/WHY/SCOPE)
   - `features/flows/[feature-name].md` - User flows and process flows (if exists)
   - `features/contracts/[feature-name].md` - API/data contracts (if exists)
   - `features/impl/[feature-name].md` - Implementation notes (if exists)
5. Locate source code at `{SRC}/` using `features/impl/[feature-name].md`
6. Implement the code following `07-tech-specs/`
7. Update `backlog` with development notes

This approach ensures AI developers can work on large projects without reading all code at once.

## Instructions

Follow these steps in order for coding development:

### Step 0: Verify Prerequisites and Gather Context

**IMPORTANT:** Follow this exact order to efficiently locate all relevant context:

1. **Identify the backlog:**
   - User specifies which backlog to work on
   - Or you select next backlog from `10-sprints/` in order

   ```
   10-sprints/
   └── SPRINT-XX-descriptive-name/
       └── [BACKLOG_TYPE]-XX-[feature-name]-<sub-feature>.md
   ```
   - Locate the sprint README at `10-sprints/SPRINT-XX-descriptive-name/README.md` for required progress log updates

2. **Read the backlog file:**
   - Understand task description and requirements
   - Note backlog type (FEATURE/CHANGE/BUG/IMPROVE)
   - **Extract the `feature-name`** from the file name (CRITICAL)
   - Verify `Feature Name` in backlog metadata matches the file name
   - If they do not match, stop and ask the user to confirm the correct feature name
   - Review test plan requirements
   - Identify acceptance criteria

3. **Read source code structure standards:**
   - Read `dev-swarm/docs/source-code-structure.md` for general guidelines
   - Note file naming conventions and directory structure

4. **Read PRD and tech specs:**
   - Read `04-prd/` (all markdown files) - Product requirements and acceptance criteria for the feature
   - Read `07-tech-specs/` (all markdown files) - Technical specifications and engineering standards
   - Understand the business context and technical constraints

5. **Read feature documentation (using feature-name as index):**
   - Read `features/features-index.md` to confirm feature exists
   - Read `features/[feature-name].md` - Feature definition (WHAT/WHY/SCOPE)
   - Read `features/flows/[feature-name].md` - User flows (if exists)
   - Read `features/contracts/[feature-name].md` - API contracts (if exists)
   - Read `features/impl/[feature-name].md` - Implementation notes (if exists)

6. **Locate existing source code:**
   - Use `features/impl/[feature-name].md` to find code locations
   - Navigate to `{SRC}/` directory
   - Review existing code structure and patterns
   - Identify files to modify (CHANGE/BUG/IMPROVE) or create (FEATURE)

7. **Understand codebase patterns:**
   - Review existing code in `{SRC}/` using locations from `features/impl/[feature-name].md`
   - Note architectural patterns and integration points

**DO NOT** read the entire codebase. Use `features/impl/[feature-name].md` to find only relevant files in `{SRC}/`.

### Step 1: Design the Implementation

Before writing code, create the feature design document:

1. Create/Update file `features/{feature-name}.md`
   - If backlog type is `feature` and the related feature file is not exist, create new feature file
   - If backlog type is `change/bug/improve` or the feature file is exist, update existing feature file
   - Use the provided templates for consistency
2. Create/update `flow` and `contract` files if it is needed

   - `features/flows/{feature-name}.md` - User flows and process flows (when needed)
   - `features/contracts/{feature-name}.md` - API contracts and interfaces (when needed)

3. Present design to user for approval
   - Show the feature design document
   - Explain approach and rationale
   - Highlight any assumptions or decisions
   - Wait for user confirmation before proceeding

### Step 2: Implement the Code (After User Confirms)

Once user approves the design:

1. **Organize code in {SRC}/:**
   - Follow `dev-swarm/docs/source-code-structure.md` for file organization guidelines
   - Place code in appropriate locations within `{SRC}/`
   - Use file naming conventions defined in source-code-structure.md

2. **Write the code:**
   - Implement according to the approved design
   - Follow coding standards
   - Write clean, modular, maintainable code
   - Include appropriate error handling
   - Avoid over-engineering (keep it simple)

3. **Code quality guidelines:**
   - **Modular**: Break code into small, focused functions/components
   - **Readable**: Clear variable names, self-documenting code
   - **Simple**: Don't add features not in requirements
   - **Consistent**: Match style of existing codebase
   - **Secure**: No XSS, SQL injection, command injection, or OWASP vulnerabilities
   - **Tested**: Code should be testable per backlog test plan

3. **What NOT to do:**
   - Don't add extra features beyond requirements
   - Don't over-abstract or create unnecessary helpers
   - Don't add comments to code you didn't change
   - Don't refactor code outside scope of backlog
   - Don't add hypothetical error handling
   - Don't create backwards-compatibility hacks

4. **For different backlog types:**

   **Feature (new functionality):**
   - Create new files/components
   - Integrate with existing system
   - Follow established patterns

   **Change (modify existing feature):**
   - Update existing code
   - Maintain compatibility where needed
   - Update related code if necessary

   **Bug (fix defect):**
   - Fix the specific issue
   - Avoid changing unrelated code
   - Verify fix matches test plan

   **Improve (optimize existing code):**
   - Refactor/optimize as specified
   - Maintain same functionality
   - Document performance improvements

### Step 3: Create Implementation Documentation

After code is complete, create implementation documentation:

1. Create `features/impl/{feature-name}.md`

   **Files Changed:**
   - List all files created or modified
   - For each file, note key changes
   - Use file paths, function names as keywords (NOT line numbers)

   **Implementation Details:**
   - Describe how the feature was implemented
   - Key functions/components created
   - Integration points with other features
   - Any important implementation decisions

   **Code Structure:**
   - Directory organization
   - Module/component breakdown
   - Dependencies added

   **Key Functions/APIs:**
   - List important functions with descriptions
   - Document key API endpoints
   - Note important classes/components

   **Reference for Developers:**
   - Quick keywords for code search
   - How to find relevant code
   - Common use patterns

2. Update `features/{feature-name}.md` if needed
   - Add any insights discovered during implementation
   - Note if actual implementation differs from design (explain why)
   - Keep it synchronized with current code

3. Update `features/features-index.md` if needed

4. **Update or create `{SRC}/README.md` (Project Documentation):**
   - **IMPORTANT**: Developers should maintain project documentation in `{SRC}/README.md`, NOT in the root README.md
   - Add or update feature documentation:
     - Feature overview and purpose
     - Installation and setup instructions
     - Usage examples and API documentation
     - Configuration options
     - Troubleshooting tips
   - Keep `{SRC}/README.md` as the primary technical reference for developers
   - Include links to `features/` documentation for detailed specs

### Step 4: Verify Against Test Plan

Before marking complete:

1. **Review backlog test plan:**
   - Ensure code meets all test requirements
   - Verify acceptance criteria are met

2. **Self-test (if possible):**
   - Run the code
   - Test key functionality
   - Verify no obvious errors

3. **Document test status:**
   - Note if manual testing was done
   - List any test results
   - Flag anything needing QA attention

### Step 5: Finalize and Commit

**CRITICAL:** Follow this process to safely commit changes and update tracking:

1. **Update Tracking Files:**
   - Update `backlog.md`:
     - Change status from "Not Started" to "In Code Review"
     - Add "Development Notes" section:
       - **Files Created/Modified:** List changes
       - **Implementation Approach:** Summary of work
       - **Key Decisions:** Technical choices
       - **Links:** To feature docs and impl docs
   - Update `10-sprints/.../README.md`:
     - Update status in table
     - Add progress log entry

2. **Request Human Review:**
   - Present the work and the plan to commit
   - Ask user: "Please review the changes. If approved, I will commit the code and update the backlog."
   - **Wait for approval.**

3. **Commit the Code (Content):**
   - Run `git add .` to stage all changes
   - **Unstage** the backlog file and sprint README (`git reset HEAD <path-to-backlog> <path-to-sprint-readme>`) to keep metadata separate
   - Check if there are staged changes:
     - **If yes:**
       - Draft conventional commit message (e.g., "feat: implement [feature-name]")
       - Commit: `git commit -m "feat: ..."`
       - Get Commit ID: `git rev-parse --short HEAD`
     - **If no** (only docs/metadata changed):
       - Skip to next step

4. **Update Backlog with Commit ID:**
   - If a code commit was made, append "**Implementation Commit:** `[commit-id]`" to the "Development Notes" in `backlog.md`

5. **Commit the Backlog (Metadata):**
   - Stage `backlog.md` and sprint `README.md`
   - Commit: `git commit -m "docs([feature-name]): update backlog status to In Code Review"`

6. **Notify user:**
   - Confirm completion
   - Suggest next step: "Ready for code review"

**This two-step commit process ensures code history is preserved before the backlog is updated with the commit reference.**
