# AI Builder - Code Review

This skill performs comprehensive code review and quality audits. As a Senior Code Reviewer expert, you'll examine implementations against design specifications, identify issues, suggest improvements, and create backlogs for necessary changes, bug fixes, or optimizations.

## When to Use This Skill

- User asks to review code for a backlog
- User requests code audit or quality check
- Developer completes implementation and needs review
- User wants to verify code meets design specifications
- User asks to review feature implementation
- After code development phase, before testing

## Prerequisites

This skill requires:
- Completed code implementation
- `04-prd/` - Product Requirements Document (business requirements and acceptance criteria)
- `07-tech-specs/` - Engineering standards and constraints
- `features/` folder with feature design and implementation docs
- `10-sprints/` folder with backlog that was implemented
- `{SRC}/` folder (organized as defined in source-code-structure.md)
- Access to source code files

## Feature-Driven Code Review Workflow

**CRITICAL:** This skill follows a strict feature-driven approach where `feature-name` is the index for the entire project:

**For Each Backlog:**
1. Read backlog.md from `10-sprints/SPRINT-XX-descriptive-name/[BACKLOG_TYPE]-XX-[feature-name]-<sub-feature>.md`
2. Extract the `feature-name` from the backlog file name
3. Read `features/features-index.md` to find the feature file
4. Read feature documentation in this order:
   - `features/[feature-name].md` - Feature definition (WHAT/WHY/SCOPE)
   - `features/flows/[feature-name].md` - User flows and process flows (if exists)
   - `features/contracts/[feature-name].md` - API/data contracts (if exists)
   - `features/impl/[feature-name].md` - Implementation notes (if exists)
5. Locate source code in `{SRC}/` using `features/impl/[feature-name].md`
6. Review code against design specs and coding standards
7. Update `backlog.md` with review findings

This approach ensures AI reviewers can review large projects without reading all code at once.

## Your Roles in This Skill

See `dev-swarm/docs/general-dev-stage-rule.md` for role selection guidance.

## Role Communication

See `dev-swarm/docs/general-dev-stage-rule.md` for the required role announcement format.

## Review Workflow Overview

The code review process:

1. Read backlog requirements and feature design
2. Read implementation documentation
3. Review actual source code files
4. Verify code meets design and requirements
5. Identify issues and improvements
6. Create new backlogs (change/bug/improve) as needed
7. Provide review feedback to developer

## Instructions

Follow these steps in order:

**Checklist formatting rule:** Any checklist, acceptance criteria, or test plan must use Markdown task lists (e.g., `- [ ] item`) so QA can mark verification status.

### Step 0: Verify Prerequisites and Gather Context (Feature-Driven Approach)

**IMPORTANT:** Follow this exact order to efficiently locate all relevant context:

1. **Identify the backlog to review:**
   - User specifies which backlog to review
   - Or review latest completed backlog from sprint

   ```
   10-sprints/
   └── SPRINT-XX-descriptive-name/
       └── [BACKLOG_TYPE]-XX-[feature-name]-<sub-feature>.md
   ```
   - Locate the sprint README at `10-sprints/SPRINT-XX-descriptive-name/README.md` for required progress log updates

2. **Read the backlog file:**
   - Understand original task requirements
   - Note acceptance criteria
   - **Extract the `feature-name`** from the file name (CRITICAL)
   - Verify `Feature Name` in backlog metadata matches the file name
   - If they do not match, stop and ask the user to confirm the correct feature name
   - Review test plan expectations
   - Identify backlog type (FEATURE/CHANGE/BUG/IMPROVE)

3. **Read coding standards:**
   - Understand code style requirements and conventions
   - Read `dev-swarm/docs/source-code-structure.md` for general guidelines
   - Understand expected code organization

4. **Read PRD and tech specs:**
   - Read `04-prd/` (all markdown files) - Product requirements and acceptance criteria for the feature
   - Read `07-tech-specs/` (all markdown files) - Technical specifications and engineering standards
   - Understand the business context and technical constraints

5. **Read feature documentation (using feature-name as index):**
   - Read `features/features-index.md` to confirm feature exists
   - Read `features/[feature-name].md` - Feature definition (intended behavior)
   - Read `features/flows/[feature-name].md` - User flows (review against these)
   - Read `features/contracts/[feature-name].md` - API contracts (verify implementation)
   - Read `features/impl/[feature-name].md` - Implementation notes (what was built)

6. **Locate source code:**
   - Use `features/impl/[feature-name].md` to find code locations
   - Navigate to `{SRC}/[feature-name]/` directory
   - List all files mentioned in implementation docs
   - Identify files to review

7. **Prepare for deep dive:**
   - Note areas requiring special attention (security, performance)
   - Consider dependencies and integration points
   - Review development notes from backlog.md

**DO NOT** read the entire codebase. Use `feature-name` to find only relevant files.

### Step 1: Review Code Implementation

Systematically review the code:

1. **Read all modified/created files:**
   - Read complete files, not just snippets
   - Understand full context of changes
   - Note dependencies and integrations

2. **Verify against design:**
   - Does code match the feature design?
   - Are all design decisions implemented correctly?
   - Any deviations from approved approach?

3. **Check against requirements:**
   - Does code meet backlog acceptance criteria?
   - Are all requirements addressed?
   - Is test plan implementable with this code?

### Step 2: Code Quality Assessment

Evaluate code across multiple dimensions:

#### 1. Correctness
- Does code do what it's supposed to do?
- Are there any logic errors?
- Edge cases handled properly?
- Null/undefined checks where needed?

#### 2. Security
Review for OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities:
- **Injection**: SQL injection, command injection, XSS
- **Authentication**: Proper auth/session management
- **Data Exposure**: Sensitive data protection
- **Access Control**: Proper authorization checks
- **Security Misconfiguration**: Secure defaults
- **XSS**: Cross-site scripting prevention
- **Insecure Deserialization**: Safe data handling
- **Known Vulnerabilities**: Outdated dependencies
- **Logging**: No secrets in logs
- **CSRF**: Cross-site request forgery protection

#### 3. Code Quality
- **Readability**: Clear variable names, self-documenting
- **Modularity**: Functions/components focused and small
- **DRY**: No unnecessary duplication
- **Consistency**: Matches existing code style
- **Simplicity**: Not over-engineered
- **Error Handling**: Appropriate for context

#### 4. Architecture
- Follows established patterns?
- Proper separation of concerns?
- Appropriate abstractions?
- Integration with existing system?
- Scalability considerations?

#### 5. Performance
- Inefficient algorithms or queries?
- N+1 query problems?
- Memory leaks potential?
- Unnecessary computations?
- Caching opportunities?

#### 6. Maintainability
- Code is understandable?
- Future changes will be easy?
- Appropriate comments (where needed)?
- No magic numbers or hardcoded values?
- Clear function/component responsibilities?

#### 7. Testing
- Code is testable?
- Test plan can be executed?
- Edge cases considered?
- Error scenarios handled?

### Step 3: Identify Issues and Improvements

Categorize findings into three types:

#### 1. Changes (Code doesn't meet design)
Issues where implementation doesn't match design or requirements:
- Missing functionality from design
- Incorrect interpretation of requirements
- Design decisions not followed
- Acceptance criteria not met

**Action**: Create `change` type backlog

#### 2. Bugs (Defects in code)
Errors that will cause problems:
- Logic errors
- Security vulnerabilities (critical)
- Null pointer exceptions
- Race conditions
- Memory leaks
- Data corruption risks
- Breaking changes

**Action**: Create `bug` type backlog

#### 3. Improvements (Optimization opportunities)
Non-critical enhancements:
- Performance optimizations
- Code readability improvements
- Better error messages
- Refactoring opportunities
- Documentation additions
- Test coverage improvements
- Technical debt reduction

**Action**: Create `improve` type backlog

### Step 4: Create Backlogs for Issues

For each issue found, create a backlog:

1. **Determine severity:**
   - Critical: Security issues, data loss, system crashes
   - High: Missing requirements, major bugs
   - Medium: Performance issues, code quality
   - Low: Minor improvements, refactoring

2. **Create backlog file in `10-sprints/`:**

   **Backlog Template:**
   ```markdown
   # Backlog: [Type] - [Brief Description]

   ## Type
   [change | bug | improve]

   ## Severity
   [critical | high | medium | low]

   ## Original Feature/Backlog
   Reference to original backlog that was reviewed

   ## Issue Description
   Clear description of what's wrong or needs improvement

   ## Current Behavior
   What the code currently does

   ## Expected Behavior
   What the code should do

   ## Affected Files
   - List of files with issues
   - Include file paths and function names

   ## Suggested Fix
   How to address this issue

   ## Reference Features
   Related features to consult

   ## Test Plan
   How to verify the fix works
   ```

3. **Notify Project Management:**
   - New backlogs need to be prioritized
   - Critical bugs should be addressed immediately
   - Changes should be scheduled based on impact
   - Improvements can be batched

### Step 5: Provide Review Feedback

1. **Summary of findings:**
   - Total issues found
   - Breakdown by type (change/bug/improve)
   - Critical items highlighted

2. **Positive feedback:**
   - What was done well
   - Good practices observed
   - Strengths in implementation

3. **Areas for improvement:**
   - General patterns to watch
   - Suggestions for developer
   - Learning opportunities

4. **Review decision:**
   - **Approved**: Code is good, ready for testing
   - **Approved with minor comments**: Non-critical improvements noted
   - **Changes required**: Critical issues must be fixed
   - **Rejected**: Major redesign needed

### Step 6: Finalize and Commit

**CRITICAL:** Follow this process to safely commit changes and update tracking:

1. **Update Tracking Files:**
   - Update `backlog.md`:
     - Change status from "In Code Review" to "In Testing" (if approved) or "In Development"
     - Add "Code Review Notes" section:
       - **Review Summary:** Overall assessment
       - **Issues Found:** Count of issues
       - **Decision:** Approved/Rejected
       - **Links:** To created backlogs (CHANGE/BUG)
   - Update feature documentation if needed
   - Update `10-sprints/.../README.md`:
     - Update status in table
     - Add progress log entry

2. **Request Human Review:**
   - Present the review findings and plan to commit
   - Ask user: "Please review the findings. If approved, I will commit and update the backlog."
   - **Wait for approval.**

3. **Commit the Code/Fixes (Content):**
   - Run `git add .` to stage all changes
   - **Unstage** the backlog file and sprint README (`git reset HEAD <path-to-backlog> <path-to-sprint-readme>`)
   - Check if there are staged changes (e.g., new bug backlogs or minor fixes):
     - **If yes:**
       - Draft conventional commit message (e.g., "docs: code review findings for [feature-name]")
       - Commit: `git commit -m "docs: ..."`
       - Get Commit ID: `git rev-parse --short HEAD`
     - **If no** (only current backlog updated):
       - Skip to next step

4. **Update Backlog with Commit ID:**
   - If a commit was made, append "**Review Commit:** `[commit-id]`" to the "Code Review Notes" in `backlog.md`

5. **Commit the Backlog (Metadata):**
   - Stage `backlog.md` and sprint `README.md`
   - Commit: `git commit -m "docs([feature-name]): update backlog status to In Testing"`

6. **Notify user:**
   - Confirm completion
   - Suggest next step: "Ready for testing" or "Back to development"

**This two-step commit process ensures history is preserved before the backlog is updated with the commit reference.**

2. Read features/profile-upload.md: Understand design
3. Read features/impl/profile-upload.md: Find changed files
4. Review {SRC}/api/upload.ts: Check implementation
5. Find issue: No file size validation (security risk)
6. Create bug backlog: "Add file size validation to upload"
7. Find improvement: Could use image compression
8. Create improve backlog: "Add image compression to upload"
9. Provide feedback: "Approved with changes required (bug fix needed)"
```

### Scenario 2: Bug Fix Review
```
