# Stage 10 - Sprints

Plan and execute agile development sprints, breaking down the product requirements into manageable backlogs with clear acceptance criteria, developer test plans, and QA verification points to deliver incremental, demo-able product milestones.

## When to Use This Skill

- User asks to start stage 10 (sprints)
- User wants to plan sprints or create backlogs
- User asks about feature development or sprint execution

## Your Roles in This Skill

See `dev-swarm/docs/general-dev-stage-rule.md` for role selection guidance.

## Role Communication

See `dev-swarm/docs/general-dev-stage-rule.md` for the required role announcement format.

## Pre-Stage Check

Before starting, verify previous stages:

1. Check if `00-init-ideas/` through `09-devops/` folders have content (not just `.gitkeep`)
2. If any previous stage is empty and has no `SKIP.md`:
   - Ask user: "Stage {XX} is not complete. Would you like to skip it or start from that stage first?"

## AI-Driven Development Sprint and Backlog Guidelines

See `dev-swarm/docs/sprint-backlog-guidelines.md` & `dev-swarm/docs/what-is-a-feature.md`

## Instructions

**Checklist formatting rule:** Any checklist, acceptance criteria, or test plan must use Markdown task lists (e.g., `- [ ] item`) so QA can mark verification status.

### Step 1: Context Review

Read all files to understand the project:

- `ideas.md`
- `00-init-ideas/*.md` through `09-devops/*.md` - All markdown files

### Step 2: Create Stage Proposal

**General Rules:** See `dev-swarm/docs/general-dev-stage-rule.md` → "Create Stage Proposal Rules" section.

If this stage is skipped (has SKIP.md), execute the next non-skipped stage's agent skill. Otherwise, create the file `10-sprints/README.md` with the following content:

#### 2.1 Stage Goal

Brief the goal in 2-3 paragraphs:
- What this stage aims to achieve (sprint planning, backlog creation, development execution)
- Why agile sprint development is critical for iterative delivery
- How this transforms technical specifications into working software
- What deliverables will be produced

#### 2.2 Sprint Overview

Provide a high-level sprint breakdown:
- **Total number of sprints** planned for MVP delivery
- **Sprint naming convention**: `SPRINT-XX-descriptive-name/` (e.g., `SPRINT-01-user-auth/`)
- **Brief description** of what each sprint will deliver

#### 2.3 Backlog Naming Convention

Explain the backlog file naming convention:
- Format: `[BACKLOG_TYPE]-XX-[feature-name]-<sub-feature>.md`
- BACKLOG_TYPE: `FEATURE`, `CHANGE`, `BUG`, or `IMPROVE`
- XX: Two-digit sequence number (01, 02, etc.)
- feature-name: The feature this backlog relates to
- sub-feature: Optional sub-feature specifier
- Example: `FEATURE-01-user-auth-login.md`, `BUG-02-user-auth-session.md`

#### 2.4 Request User Approval

Ask user: "Please check the Stage Proposal in `10-sprints/README.md`. Update it directly or tell me how to update it."

### Step 3: Create Development Plan

Once user approves README.md, create `10-sprints/development-plan.md`:

**Sprint Breakdown:**
For each sprint, document:
- Sprint number and name
- Sprint goal (one sentence)
- Features/backlogs included
- Dependencies on previous sprints
- Demo criteria
- QA test plan (checkbox list)

**Backlog Details:**
For each backlog item, document:
- Backlog ID and unique keywords
- User story format
- Acceptance criteria (checkbox list)
- Developer test plan (checkbox list)
- Related files from previous stages
- Estimated complexity (S/M/L)

### Step 4: Create Sprint Folders and Backlogs

Once user approves the development plan:

#### 4.1 Create Sprint Folders

For each sprint, create:
```
10-sprints/SPRINT-XX-descriptive-name/
├─ README.md                                          # Sprint overview
└─ [BACKLOG_TYPE]-XX-[feature-name]-<sub-feature>.md  # Individual backlogs
```

Example:
```
10-sprints/SPRINT-01-user-auth/
├─ README.md
├─ FEATURE-01-user-auth-login.md
├─ FEATURE-02-user-auth-register.md
└─ FEATURE-03-user-auth-session.md
```

#### 4.2 Sprint README.md Structure

Each sprint's README.md should contain:
- Sprint status (pending/in_progress/completed/blocked)
- Sprint goal
- Dependencies
- Backlogs with status and complexity
- Sprint test plan (checkbox list)
- Demo script
- Success criteria (checkbox list)

#### 4.3 Backlog File Structure

Each backlog file should contain:
- Keywords (unique across project)
- User story
- Related documentation references
- Acceptance criteria (checkbox list)
- Technical implementation notes
- Developer test plan (checkbox list)
- Dependencies
- Complexity estimate
- Status checklist (checkbox list)

### Step 5: Finalize Sprint Documentation

Once user approves all sprint and backlog files:

#### 5.1 Documentation Finalization
- Sync `10-sprints/README.md` to remove any deleted files
- Ensure all backlog keywords are unique across the project
- Verify all backlogs trace back to PRD requirements
- Confirm all test plans are complete

#### 5.2 Announce Documentation Complete

Inform user:
- "Sprint planning documentation is complete and ready for development"
- Summary of sprints and backlogs created
- Total estimated complexity
- Recommended sprint order

## Stage Completion Rules

See `dev-swarm/docs/general-dev-stage-rule.md` for stage completion, commit, and skip rules.

## Key Principles

- Each backlog must be independently testable
- Each sprint must be demo-able
- Document all dependencies clearly
- Trace all backlogs to PRD requirements
- Support smooth transition to deployment
