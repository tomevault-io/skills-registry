# Stage 06 - UX Design

Design the user experience including visual design system, wireframes, user flows, responsive guidelines, and accessibility requirements to create a cohesive and user-centered product interface.

## When to Use This Skill

- User asks to start stage 06 (ux)
- User wants to create wireframes or design system
- User asks about UI design, accessibility, or responsive design

## Your Roles in This Skill

See `dev-swarm/docs/general-dev-stage-rule.md` for role selection guidance.

## Role Communication

See `dev-swarm/docs/general-dev-stage-rule.md` for the required role announcement format.

## Pre-Stage Check

Before starting, verify previous stages:

1. Check if `00-init-ideas/` through `05-prd/` folders have content (not just `.gitkeep`)
2. If any previous stage is empty and has no `SKIP.md`:
   - Ask user: "Stage {XX} is not complete. Would you like to skip it or start from that stage first?"

## Instructions

### Step 1: Context Review

Read all files to understand the project:

- `ideas.md`
- `00-init-ideas/*.md` through `05-prd/*.md` - All markdown files

### Step 2: Create Stage Proposal

**General Rules:** See `dev-swarm/docs/general-dev-stage-rule.md` → "Create Stage Proposal Rules" section.

If this stage is skipped (has SKIP.md), execute the next non-skipped stage's agent skill. Otherwise, create the file `06-ux/README.md` with the following content:

#### 2.1 Stage Goal

Brief the goal in 2-3 paragraphs:
- What this stage aims to achieve
- Why UX design is critical for product success and user adoption
- How this builds upon previous stages (personas, MVP scope, PRD)
- What deliverables will be produced

#### 2.2 File Selection

Select files from these options based on project needs:

**Design System:**
- `design-system-guide.md` - Color palette, typography, spacing, and button styles
- `design-ui-preview.html` - Sample HTML/CSS/JS page demonstrating the design system

**Wireframes & Layouts:**
- `wireframe_descriptions.md` - Textual descriptions of UI layout for each key screen

**User Flows & Navigation:**
- `user-flows/` - User navigation flow diagrams

**Responsive & Accessibility:**
- `responsive-design.md` - Guidelines for how UI adapts across screen sizes
- `accessibility.md` - Accessibility requirements following WCAG guidelines

**UI Mockups (for GUI projects):**
- `design-ui-mockup/README.md` - Mockup proposal listing all pages/screens to be created (include in this approval step; mockup files created after design system approval). Required for any web, mobile, or desktop app with a graphic user interface when HTML mockups can express workflow.

For each selected file, provide:
- Short description
- Why it's essential for this project
- Key information it should include

**Note:** If `design-ui-mockup/` is selected, include `design-ui-mockup/README.md` (mockup proposal) in this stage proposal for approval together with other files. The actual mockup HTML/CSS/JS files will be created in Step 4 after design system files are approved.

#### 2.3 Request User Approval

Ask user: "Please check the Stage Proposal in `06-ux/README.md`. Update it directly or tell me how to update it."

### Step 3: Execute Stage Plan

Once user approves `06-ux/README.md`:

#### 3.1 Create All Planned Files

Create each file listed in the approved README:

- **For `.md` files:** Write comprehensive content based on personas, MVP requirements, and PRD
- **For diagram folders:** Follow `dev-swarm/docs/mermaid-diagram-guide.md` to create related diagrams files
- **For `.html` files:** Create functional preview pages demonstrating the design system with css/js as needed
- **For `design-ui-mockup/README.md`:** Create the mockup proposal (see format below)

**Mockup Proposal Format (for `design-ui-mockup/README.md`):**

**Purpose Statement:**
- These mockups are NOT the final design implementation
- They serve as visual references for user review of the final layout, navigation flow, and overall user experience before actual development begins

**Page/Screen List:**
Based on wireframes and user flows, list all pages/screens to be created:
- Page name
- Brief description
- Key components/sections on this page
- Navigation links to other pages

**Shared Assets:**
- `styles.css` - Design system styles (colors, typography, spacing, buttons)
- `navigation.js` - Inter-page navigation simulation

**Proposed Structure:**
```
design-ui-mockup/
├── README.md           # This proposal (will become review instructions after approval)
├── index.html          # Entry point / landing page
├── home.html           # Home/dashboard
├── login.html          # Authentication screens
├── [feature].html      # Feature-specific pages
├── styles.css          # Shared design system styles
└── navigation.js       # Inter-page navigation
```

**Quality Guidelines:**
- Base design decisions on user personas and their needs
- Align UX with MVP features defined in stage 03
- Ensure all user flows support functional requirements from stage 05
- Accessibility must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards at minimum

#### 3.2 Request User Approval for Files

After creating all files (including `design-ui-mockup/README.md` if applicable):
- Provide a summary of what was created
- Highlight key design decisions and rationale
- Ask: "Please review the UX design files. You can update or delete files, or let me know how to modify them."

### Step 4: Create UI Mockups (For GUI Projects)

**Trigger Condition:** Execute this step if:
- The project has a GUI component (web app, mobile app, desktop app)
- `design-ui-mockup/README.md` was created and approved by user in Step 3

UI mockups are required for GUI projects where HTML pages can represent the workflow, including this project.

#### 4.1 Create Mockup Files

Create all mockup files based on the approved `design-ui-mockup/README.md`:

**For each page/screen listed in the approved proposal, create:**
- **Individual HTML files:** One file per page/screen (e.g., `home.html`, `login.html`, `dashboard.html`, `settings.html`)
- **Shared CSS:** `styles.css` - Apply design system (colors, typography, spacing, buttons)
- **Navigation JS:** `navigation.js` - Enable clicking between pages to simulate user flow

**Content Guidelines:**
- Use **fake/placeholder data** for all text content (lorem ipsum, sample names, mock statistics)
- Use **placeholder images** (solid color boxes with dimensions, or placeholder.com URLs)
- Use **placeholder videos** (colored rectangles with play button overlay)
- Include **all interactive states** (hover, active, disabled) where applicable
- Show **responsive breakpoints** if responsive design is required

#### 4.2 Update Mockup README

After creating all mockup files, update `06-ux/design-ui-mockup/README.md` to include:
- How to open and navigate the mockups (open index.html in browser)
- Complete list of all pages/screens created
- Navigation flow instructions (which pages link to which)
- Notes on placeholder content

#### 4.3 Request User Approval for Mockups

After creating all mockups:
- Provide a summary of pages/screens created
- Explain how to navigate through the mockup flow
- Ask: "Please review the UI mockups by opening `design-ui-mockup/index.html` in your browser. These mockups show the final layout and navigation flow. Let me know if any changes are needed before we proceed."

### Step 5: Finalize Stage

Once user approves all files (and mockups if applicable):

#### 5.1 Documentation Finalization
- Sync `06-ux/README.md` to remove any deleted files
- Ensure all files are complete and well-formatted
- Check that all diagrams render correctly
- Validate HTML preview and mockups display correctly

#### 5.2 Prepare for Next Stage
- Summarize key design decisions for reference in architecture stage
- Note any technical constraints discovered during UX design
- Reference mockups as the visual baseline for implementation

#### 5.3 Announce Completion

Inform user:
- "Stage 06 (UX Design) is complete"
- Summary of deliverables created
- Key design decisions made
- "Ready to proceed to Stage 07 (Architecture) when you are"

## Stage Completion Rules

See `dev-swarm/docs/general-dev-stage-rule.md` for stage completion, commit, and skip rules.

## Key Principles

- Base design on user personas and needs
- Ensure accessibility compliance
- Keep design consistent across all screens
- Support smooth transition to architecture design
