description: Enforces Conventional Commits 1.0.0 for all git commit messages. Use this skill whenever the user asks to commit changes, create a commit, or save progress to git. Ensures commit messages follow the conventional format with proper type, scope, and description. Use when this capability is needed.

> **IMPORTANT**: All `\！` (backslash + full-width exclamation mark) in this document MUST be interpreted as a half-width exclamation mark in actual commit messages. This workaround is required because Claude Code has a bug where half-width exclamation marks in markdown files cause errors.

# Conventional Commits (commit)

This skill enforces the [Conventional Commits 1.0.0](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification for all git commit messages. Using this skill ensures that commit history is readable, automated tools (like semantic versioning) can function correctly, and the intent of changes is clear.

## Commit Message Format

The commit message should be structured as follows:

```text
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### 1. Type

The type is mandatory and must be one of the following:

- **feat**: A new feature for the user, not a new feature for build script.
- **fix**: A bug fix for the user, not a fix to a build script.
- **docs**: Changes to the documentation.
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc).
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance.
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests.
- **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm).
- **ci**: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs).
- **chore**: Other changes which don't modify src or test files.
- **revert**: Reverts a previous commit.

### 2. Scope (Optional)

A scope may be provided to a type, to provide additional contextual information and is contained within parenthesis, e.g., `feat(parser): add ability to parse arrays`.

### 3. Description

The description is a short summary of the code changes.

- Use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".
- Don't capitalize the first letter.
- No dot (.) at the end.

### 4. Body (Optional)

Used to explain the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.

- Use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".

### 5. Footer (Optional)

Used to reference GitHub issues, or for BREAKING CHANGE notes.

- **BREAKING CHANGE**: A commit that has a footer `BREAKING CHANGE:` or appends a `\！` after the type/scope, introduces a breaking API change (correlating with MAJOR in Semantic Versioning). A BREAKING CHANGE can be part of a commit of any type.

## Examples

### Feature with Scope

```text
feat(lang): add polish language support
```

### Bug Fix

```text
fix: solve memory leak in buffer allocation
```

### Breaking Change with `\！`

```text
feat\！: send an email to the customer when a product is shipped
```

### Breaking Change with Footer

```text
fix: correct typo in api response

BREAKING CHANGE: the 'id' field is now a string instead of an integer.
```

### Multi-line with Body and Footer

```text
fix: prevent racing condition in session handler

The previous implementation relied on a global lock which caused performance
degradation under high load. This change introduces per-session locking.

Closes #123
```

## Best Practices

### Atomic Commits

Each commit should represent a single logical change. Avoid combining unrelated features, bug fixes, or refactoring into one commit.

- **Easier Troubleshooting**: Pinpoint exactly which change introduced a bug using `git bisect`.
- **Simpler Reverts**: Revert specific changes without affecting other work.
- **Clearer Reviews**: Reviewers can process changes one logical step at a time.

#### Atomic Commit Examples

❌ Bad (Mixed Concerns)

```text
feat: add login page, fix typo in footer, and refactor auth logic
```

✅ Good (Atomic)

```text
feat: add login page
fix: correct typo in footer
refactor(auth): simplify session handling
```

## Scope Inference

When creating a commit, infer the scope from `git diff --cached --name-only` (staged files) using these path-based rules:

| Path Pattern                               | Inferred Scope                   |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| `flake.lock`                               | `deps`                           |
| `flake.nix`                                | `flake`                          |
| `.github/renovate*`                        | `renovate`                       |
| `configs/<name>/`                          | `<name>` (e.g., `claude`, `k9s`) |
| `modules/home-manager/programs/<name>.nix` | `<name>` (e.g., `fish`, `kitty`) |
| `modules/home-manager/programs/<name>/`    | `<name>` (e.g., `nixcats`)       |
| `modules/home-manager/home/`               | `home`                           |
| `modules/darwin/`                          | `darwin`                         |
| `modules/nixos/`                           | `nixos`                          |
| `overlays/`                                | `overlays`                       |

### Multi-Scope Resolution

- If all changed files map to a **single scope**, use that scope
- If one scope covers the **majority** (>70%) of changed files, use that scope
- If files map to **multiple unrelated scopes**, omit the scope and recommend splitting into atomic commits
- If the user explicitly provides a scope, use that regardless of inference

## How to Use

When asked to commit changes, the agent MUST:

1. Run `git diff --cached --name-only` to see staged files
2. Infer the scope using the rules above
3. Determine the commit type from the nature of the changes
4. Compose the commit message following Conventional Commits format
5. If the user provides a message, reformat it to follow these rules
