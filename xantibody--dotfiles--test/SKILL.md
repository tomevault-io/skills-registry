# Test

Run the test suite to verify functionality.

## Workflow

### 1. Discover Test Command

Investigate available commands by checking project files:

- `flake.nix` / `flake.lock`: Use `nix flake check` or project-specific test commands
- `Makefile` / `justfile`: Look for `test` target
- `package.json`: Check `scripts.test` (use `npm test`, `vitest`, `jest`)
- `go.mod`: Use `go test ./...`
- `Cargo.toml`: Use `cargo test`
- `pyproject.toml` / `setup.py`: Use `pytest` or `python -m unittest`

Prefer project-configured commands over language defaults. If multiple options exist, use the one defined in the project's build configuration.

### 2. Run Tests

- Run the discovered test command
- If the command fails due to missing dependencies, recommend the appropriate setup (e.g., `nix develop`, `npm install`, `go mod download`)
- If no test framework is configured, propose adding one appropriate for the project

### 3. Report and Fix

- Report test results clearly: total, passed, failed, skipped
- Fix any failing tests before proceeding
