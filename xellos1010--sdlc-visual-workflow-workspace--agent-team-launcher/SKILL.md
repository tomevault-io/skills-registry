# Agent Team Launcher

Select and launch or resume a configured agent team initiative from `.foundry/staging/`.

Agent teams require `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1`. Each teammate is a fully independent Claude Code session. This skill generates the exact invocation — you run the command, not this skill.

Supports two initiative types:
- **Single-team**: one `team-config.json` at the initiative root
- **Pipeline**: a `pipeline.json` at the initiative root with multiple stage team-configs under `pipeline/NN-<stage>/`

---

## Step 1 — Discover Initiatives

Scan `.foundry/staging/` for subdirectories. For each subdirectory:
- If it contains `pipeline.json` → **pipeline initiative** (read pipeline.json for stages)
- If it contains `team-config.json` → **single-team initiative**

For pipeline initiatives, read `pipeline.json` and show stage-level status. For each stage, check the stage's `team-config.json` for:
- `initiative.name` — human-readable title
- `initiative.slug` — path identifier
- `initiative.startingPhase` — SDLC phase
- `initiative.status` — `ready | active | paused | complete`
- `initiative.createdAt` — creation timestamp
- `team.teammates` — count and names
- `continuityPath` — path to `.foundry/projects/<slug>/current-task.json`

Also check `continuityPath` for each initiative. If the file exists, read:
- `currentPhase.status` — to detect active/blocked/done state
- `currentPhase.id` — current phase slug
- `sdlcPhase` — current lifecycle stage
- `blockedBy` — any blocking issues

If `.foundry/staging/` is empty or no `team-config.json` files exist, tell the user to run `/agent-team-builder` first.

---

## Step 2 — Present the Initiative List

**For single-team initiatives**, display:
```
Available Agent Team Initiatives
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  #  Initiative                   Phase        Status      Teammates
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  1  Flagship Foundry UI Revamp   visualize    ready       3 (architect, builder, reviewer)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

**For pipeline initiatives**, display the pipeline view:
```
Pipeline Initiative: TypeScript → Rust Migration (6 stages)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Stage  Name                      Teammates  Status     Next Action
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    1    Source Analysis            7          ✅ done    —
    2    Port TUI Layer             4          ▶ ready    LAUNCH NOW
    3    Port CLI Layer             2          ▶ ready    can launch concurrent with 2
    4    Port Core Runtime          4          ▶ ready    can launch concurrent with 2-3
    5    Port Extension Layer       3          ▶ ready    can launch concurrent with 2-4
    6    Behavioral Verification    6          ⏸ pending  requires stages 2-5 complete
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Active stage: 1 complete → stages 2-5 can now launch concurrently
```

Status icons: `✅ done` | `▶ ready` | `🔄 active` | `⏸ pending` | `🚫 blocked`

If only one initiative exists, skip the selection prompt and confirm it directly. For pipelines, ask which stage(s) to launch.

---

## Step 3 — User Selects

Ask: "Which initiative? (#)" or let them type the name. Accept number, slug, or partial name match.

Once selected, load the full `team-config.json` and read the `leadPromptPath` file.

---

## Step 4 — Determine Mode: Start vs Resume

**Starting fresh** when:
- `initiative.status` is `ready`
- No `current-task.json` exists at `continuityPath`
- User says "start fresh" or "reset"

**Resuming** when:
- `initiative.status` is `active` or `paused`
- `current-task.json` exists and `currentPhase.status` is not `done`
- User says "resume" or "continue"

For a **resume**, prepend to the lead prompt:
```
RESUMING initiative: <name>
Current phase: <currentPhase.id> (<sdlcPhase>)
Branch: <activeBranch>
Last status: <currentPhase.status>
Blockers: <blockedBy or "none">

Read .foundry/projects/<slug>/current-task.json for full continuity state before spawning teammates.
Run nextCommandSet verification commands before assigning new work.
```

---

## Step 5 — Check Environment

Check if `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS` is enabled by reading `~/.claude.json` or the local `settings.json`. If it is not set, show the user how to enable it.

**Three options** to enable:

**Option A — Per-session (terminal):**
```bash
CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1 claude
```

**Option B — Persistent (global settings):**
Add to `~/.claude.json`:
```json
{
  "env": {
    "CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS": "1"
  }
}
```

**Option C — Project settings:**
Add to `monorepo/.claude/settings.json` under `env`.

Ask: "Would you like me to enable it in settings.json so you don't have to set it each time?" If yes, invoke the `/update-config` skill to add it.

---

## Step 6 — Choose Display Mode

Ask: "Do you want teammates in split panes (requires tmux or iTerm2) or in-process (any terminal)?"

Default: in-process unless already in a tmux session.

For split-pane mode, verify tmux is available:
```bash
which tmux
```

If tmux is not found, offer in-process or guide them to install tmux. For iTerm2 mode, the `it2` CLI must be installed.

Show the flag to pass if overriding: `--teammate-mode in-process` or `--teammate-mode tmux`.

---

## Step 7 — Generate Launch Output

Produce a clean, copy-pasteable launch block:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  LAUNCH: <Initiative Name>
  Phase: <phase> | Teammates: <count> | Mode: <mode>
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. Open a new Claude Code session in monorepo/:

   CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1 claude [--teammate-mode <mode>]

2. Paste this prompt to the lead:

───────── COPY FROM HERE ─────────
<full contents of lead-prompt.md, with resume prefix if resuming>
───────── COPY TO HERE ─────────

3. Interact with teammates:
   - In-process: Shift+Down to cycle, type to message, Ctrl+T for task list
   - Split pane: click into a pane to message that teammate

4. When done: tell the lead "Clean up the team" to release team resources.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

---

## Step 8 — Update Initiative Status

After generating the launch output, update `team-config.json`:
- Set `initiative.status` to `"active"`
- Set `initiative.lastLaunchedAt` to current ISO timestamp

If the `current-task.json` continuity file doesn't exist yet (fresh start), create it now using the initial state from `agent-team-builder` or initialize it with:
- `sdlcPhase`: `startingPhase` from team config
- `currentPhase.status`: `"in_progress"`
- `activeBranch`: current git branch (`git branch --show-current`)

---

## Troubleshooting

**Teammates not appearing after launch:** Press Shift+Down. If still missing, the task may need to be more complex — check that the lead prompt clearly asks for a team.

**Permission prompts slowing things down:** Pre-approve common operations. Consider running with `--dangerously-skip-permissions` for trusted migration work (all teammates inherit this).

**Team stuck / teammate stopped on error:** Use Shift+Down to reach the stuck teammate and give it recovery instructions directly. Or tell the lead to spawn a replacement.

**Resume failing / lead messaging non-existent teammates:** After a session crash, lead may try to message dead teammates. Tell the lead: "The previous session crashed. Please spawn fresh teammates based on the work-orders.md and resume from where we left off."

**Task status lagging:** If a task appears stuck, tell the lead to manually mark it complete and move on.
