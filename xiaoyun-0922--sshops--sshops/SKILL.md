# SSH Server Ops

This skill is the agent wrapper for the bundled SSH toolkit in the plugin root `scripts/` directory. The toolkit is the product surface; the skill defines the safe workflow and which entrypoint to use.

## Entrypoints

Choose the local OS entrypoint:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ..\..\scripts\sshops.ps1 <subcommand> ...
```

```bash
python3 ../../scripts/sshops.py <subcommand> ...
```

Use the PowerShell entrypoint on Windows when you need Windows OpenSSH ACL repair. Use the Python entrypoint on macOS/Linux, or on Windows when cross-platform parity is more important than ACL repair.

Current subcommands:

- `doctor`: read-only SSH diagnosis and environment inspection
- `configure`: create or repair a host block in `~/.ssh/config`
- `bootstrap-key`: install a public key over one password-backed session, then verify non-interactive SSH
- `transfer`: password-backed Paramiko upload/download fallback
- `run`: standardize remote command execution through `ssh`

## When to Use

Use this skill when:

- a local Windows, macOS, or Linux machine needs to reach a Linux, POSIX, gateway, bastion, or HPC target over SSH
- SSH partially works and Codex needs to determine which layer is broken
- Codex needs to repair `~/.ssh/config`, key auth, identity selection, or local OpenSSH assumptions
- file transfer is failing and Codex needs a safe fallback path
- the task lives on a login node or behind a bastion, managed gateway, or Slurm scheduler

Do not use this skill for Windows remoting, RDP, or cases where the user explicitly wants to avoid SSH automation.

## Security Rules

- Never ask the user to paste passwords, tokens, private keys, or MFA codes into chat.
- If password bootstrap is required, the password must stay in the local terminal session only, usually in `SSH_SERVER_PASSWORD`.
- Never store passwords in `~/.ssh/config`, `SKILL.md`, prompt templates, repo files, or logs.
- Treat destructive remote actions the same way as destructive local actions: explicit user intent first.
- `doctor` is the preferred first step because it is read-only.

## Workflow

### 1. Gather facts

Collect:

- alias, host or IP, port, username
- local OS: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- whether the target is a normal Linux host, jump host, managed gateway, or HPC login node
- whether key auth, interactive password auth, or both are available today
- whether the task is diagnose, configure, bootstrap, transfer, run, sync, or HPC job control

### 2. Run read-only diagnosis first

Prefer `doctor` before changing anything.

Windows:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ..\..\scripts\sshops.ps1 doctor -Alias <alias>
```

macOS/Linux:

```bash
python3 ../../scripts/sshops.py doctor --alias <alias>
```

If the alias is not configured yet, use direct mode.

Windows:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ..\..\scripts\sshops.ps1 doctor `
  -HostName <host> `
  -Port <port> `
  -User <user>
```

macOS/Linux:

```bash
python3 ../../scripts/sshops.py doctor \
  --host-name <host> \
  --port <port> \
  --user <user>
```

Read the structured output, especially `local_tools`, `network`, `auth`, `transfer`, `remote_shell`, `likely_root_cause`, and `recommended_next_step`.

### 3. Configure the host entry only when needed

If the host is not saved or the alias is wrong, write a focused `~/.ssh/config` block.

Windows:

```powershell
$keyPath = Join-Path $HOME ".ssh\id_ed25519_<alias>"
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ..\..\scripts\sshops.ps1 configure `
  -Alias <alias> `
  -HostName <host> `
  -Port <port> `
  -User <user> `
  -IdentityFile $keyPath `
  -PreferredAuthentications publickey
```

macOS/Linux:

```bash
python3 ../../scripts/sshops.py configure \
  --alias <alias> \
  --host-name <host> \
  --port <port> \
  --user <user> \
  --identity-file ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_<alias> \
  --preferred-authentications publickey
```

Report what changed because this modifies local SSH state.

### 4. Bootstrap key auth only when password auth exists locally

If non-interactive SSH is still broken but the user has a valid password locally, bootstrap once.

Windows:

```powershell
$env:SSH_SERVER_PASSWORD = "<set-locally-in-terminal>"
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ..\..\scripts\sshops.ps1 bootstrap-key `
  -HostName <host> `
  -Port <port> `
  -User <user> `
  -PublicKey <path-to-public-key> `
  -PrivateKey <path-to-private-key>
Remove-Item Env:SSH_SERVER_PASSWORD
```

macOS/Linux:

```bash
export SSH_SERVER_PASSWORD="<set-locally-in-terminal>"
python3 ../../scripts/sshops.py bootstrap-key \
  --host-name <host> \
  --port <port> \
  --user <user> \
  --public-key <path-to-public-key> \
  --private-key <path-to-private-key>
unset SSH_SERVER_PASSWORD
```

Do not ask the user to put the password in chat. If the password is not already available in the local terminal, tell the user what variable to set and wait.

### 5. Use the toolkit for execution and transfer

Remote command execution:

```bash
python3 ../../scripts/sshops.py run \
  --alias <alias> \
  --remote-dir ~/repo \
  --command "git status --short" \
  --bash \
  --batch-mode
```

Password-backed file transfer fallback:

```bash
export SSH_SERVER_PASSWORD="<set-locally-in-terminal>"
python3 ../../scripts/sshops.py transfer \
  --host-name <host> \
  --port <port> \
  --user <user> \
  --direction download \
  --remote-path <remote-path> \
  --local-path <local-path>
unset SSH_SERVER_PASSWORD
```

Prefer direct OpenSSH operations when they are already healthy. Use Paramiko fallback when diagnosis shows OpenSSH auth or transfer is the weak link.

### 6. Treat HPC as a first-class workflow

On HPC or Slurm-backed systems:

- distinguish login nodes from compute nodes
- inspect scheduler state before launching work
- use `squeue`, `sinfo`, `sbatch`, `srun`, and log collection deliberately
- avoid treating a compute node shell like a durable host unless the scheduler says it is

See `..\..\references\hpc-slurm-playbook.md`.

## Risk Levels

- `doctor`: read-only
- `configure`, `bootstrap-key`: low-risk local or account configuration changes
- `run`, `transfer`: medium risk, because they can affect remote state depending on command or target path
- delete, reset, overwrite, restart, package install, or service-impacting actions: high risk and require explicit user approval

## Output Expectations

Report:

- the target and how it was addressed, alias or direct
- the diagnosis result, including `likely_root_cause` and `recommended_next_step`
- which toolkit subcommands were used
- any local or remote state changes
- exact verification commands and observed results
- residual risks, especially on shared or HPC systems
