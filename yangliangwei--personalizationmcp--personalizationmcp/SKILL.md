Guide setup with one orchestration flow, then hand off to platform-specific skills.

## Workflow

1. Ask which platforms to configure (single or multi-select).
2. For each selected platform, invoke its platform skill flow (no nested skill execution required in one response; follow its checklist directly).
3. After each platform write/update, run:

```bash
personalhub <platform> credentials
```

4. End with 3 blocks:
- `Configured`
- `Needs input`
- `Next step`

## Rules

- Ask only minimum required fields first.
- Validate immediately after each platform is configured.
- Keep output short and actionable.
