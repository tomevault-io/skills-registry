# Project Workflow

Sprint-based workflow using GitHub Projects to manage tickets from creation through completion.

## Sprint Lifecycle

Create Tickets --> Refine --> Work --> Review --> Milestone Demo --> Done

## Ticket Types

**Epics** -- High-level features. Require a PRDS (PRD + Solution Design) drafted via `/create-prds` before being added as a ticket. Epics are later broken down into smaller Tasks.

**Tasks** -- Scoped work items. Drafted via `/create-task`. These are what developers actually work on.

Both types are added to the board via `/add-ticket`, which handles GitHub issue creation and project field setup.

## PRDS (PRD + Solution Design)

A combined document covering product requirements (problem, goals, scope, acceptance criteria) and the technical solution design (architecture, data model, API, testing). Created with `/create-prds` using the template at `.cursor/references/prd-solution-design-template.md`. Every Epic should have a PRDS.

## Board Columns

| Column      | Description                                    |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Backlog     | Newly created tickets land here                |
| Ready       | Refined and prioritized, ready for development |
| In Progress | Currently being worked on                      |
| Review      | PR created, awaiting code review               |
| Done        | Merged and complete                            |

## Sprint Phases

### 1. Planning

Draft PRDS for epics (`/create-prds`) and task descriptions (`/create-task`), then add them to the board with `/add-ticket`. New tickets land in Backlog.

### 2. Refinement

Prioritize backlog tickets and move the highest priority ones to Ready with `/refinement`.

### 3. Epic Breakdown

When an Epic is refined and ready, break it down into smaller Task tickets (each added via `/add-ticket`) before development begins.

### 4. Development

Pick up the highest priority Ready ticket and create a PR with `/work-on-ticket`.

### 5. Review

Review PRs in the Review column with `/review-pr`.

### 6. Milestone Demo

Before marking a milestone (Epic) as Done, create a demo in `./demos` named `<milestone>_demo` (e.g., `m3_demo`). The demo should:

- Showcase all major features delivered in that milestone
- Include comments explaining each section
- Works as expected

### 7. Done

Merged PRs move to Done.
