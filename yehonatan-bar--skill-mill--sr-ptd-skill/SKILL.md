# SR-PTD Documentation Skill

## Purpose

Capture exactly what happened during a task **in a structure that maps directly to Claude Skill architecture**. Over time, these documents become raw material for building Skills - patterns emerge, reusable components accumulate, and workflows crystallize.

**Key Principle:** Every task you complete is a potential Skill waiting to be extracted. Document it accordingly.

---

## How SR-PTD Maps to Skills

| Document Section | Skill Component | Extraction Value |
|------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Task Trigger Profile** | YAML `description` | What requests should activate this skill? |
| **Workflow Executed** | SKILL.md body | Step-by-step process to replicate |
| **Knowledge Accessed** | `references/` | Schemas, APIs, docs Claude needed |
| **Code Written/Used** | `scripts/` | Reusable scripts for future tasks |
| **Outputs Produced** | `assets/` | Templates, formats to standardize |

---

## Process

### Step 1: Determine Document Type

Choose based on task complexity:

**Full SR-PTD** (Sections A-J): For complex tasks, multi-step implementations, tasks likely to become skills
**Quick Capture**: For simpler tasks, quick fixes, routine work

### Step 2: Create Documentation File

**Filename Format:** `SR-PTD_[YYYY-MM-DD]_[task-id]_[brief-description].md`

**Save Location:** `C:\projects\Skills\Dev_doc_for_skills\`

### Step 3: Fill All Applicable Sections

Follow the template structure below. Be thorough - this documentation serves as the foundation for future Skills.

### Step 4: Assess Skill Potential

Score the task's reusability. High scores (20+) indicate strong skill candidates.

### Step 5: If Conversation Continues

Update the existing document instead of creating a new one. One document per session.

## Quick Capture Template (Minimal Version)

For simpler tasks, use this abbreviated format:

```markdown
# SR-PTD - [Brief Description]

**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD | **Type**: | **Domain**: | **Complexity**: 

## Trigger
> [What request/problem initiated this?]

## Workflow (numbered steps)
1. 
2. 
3. 

## Key Decisions
- [Decision] -> [Choice] -> [Why]

## Knowledge Used
- **DB**: 
- **API**: 
- **Code patterns**: 

## Code Written (if reusable)
```python
```

## Output Format (if templatable)
```
```

## Issues -> Fixes
- [Issue] -> [Fix]

## Skill Potential: Low | Medium | High
**Notes**: 

## Tags
Languages: | Domain: | Services: 
```

---

## Aggregation: From SR-PTDs to Skills

After accumulating 3-5 SR-PTDs for similar tasks:

### 1. Cluster Related Documents
Group SR-PTDs by:
- Same domain/module
- Similar trigger patterns
- Overlapping workflows
- Shared code/scripts

### 2. Extract Common Patterns
- **Workflow**: What steps appear in ALL instances?
- **Variations**: What steps differ and why?
- **Scripts**: What code was reused or rewritten each time?
- **References**: What knowledge was needed every time?

### 3. Build the Skill
1. Populate SKILL.md from common workflow
2. Add scripts from SR-PTDs marked "reusable"
3. Create reference files from aggregated knowledge
4. Add templates from recurring output formats

---

## Example: Mapping SR-PTD to Skill Components

**Task**: Generated executive summary from meeting transcript

| SR-PTD Section | Content | Skill Component |
|----------------|---------|-----------------|
| Trigger Profile | "Create summary from transcript, Hebrew, action items" | YAML description: "Generate executive summaries from meeting transcripts with action items extraction. Supports Hebrew and English output." |
| Workflow Step 1 | "Parsed transcript with regex for speakers" | SKILL.md: "Step 1: Parse transcript to identify speakers" |
| Workflow Step 2 | "Called Claude API with specific prompt" | scripts/generate_summary.py |
| DB Knowledge | "meetings table schema with transcript_id FK" | references/schema.md |
| API Knowledge | "POST /summaries endpoint format" | references/api.md |
| Output Format | "Executive summary with sections: Overview, Key Points, Action Items" | assets/summary_template.md |
| Issue Fixed | "Hebrew RTL formatting broke in HTML output" | SKILL.md: "Note: Use dir='rtl' for Hebrew output" |

---

## Skill Update Protocol

When a skill already exists and you complete a task using it, evaluate if updates are needed.

**Core Principle:** Every update must pass validation. Default to NOT updating unless criteria are met.

---

### Update Types

**Type A: Fix (Something Broke)**

| Severity | Trigger | Action |
|----------|---------|--------|
| **Critical** | Script crashed/hung, manual intervention required, documented method failed | Must fix immediately |
| **High** | Undocumented edge case, non-obvious workaround discovered | Update recommended |
| **Medium** | Confusing output, ambiguous docs | Consider update |

**Type B: Expand (Capability Growth)**

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| New workflow variation discovered | Add conditional path to SKILL.md |
| Reusable code written during task | Extract to scripts/ |
| New schema/API knowledge acquired | Add to references/ |
| Output template created | Add to assets/ |
| Trigger scope should widen | Update YAML description |

**Type C: Skip (No Update Needed)**
- Skill worked as documented
- Environment-specific issue (one-off config)
- User preference (style, not function)
- Information already exists in skill
- Temporary issue (network, load)
- Rare edge case not worth documenting

---

### Decision Tree

```
Task completed using skill
|
+-> Did the skill's approach work?
    |
    +-> YES -> Any new capabilities discovered?
    |   |
    |   +-> YES -> Type B: Expand
    |   |   +-> Run Expansion Checklist
    |   |
    |   +-> NO -> Don't update
    |
    +-> NO -> Was manual intervention needed?
        |
        +-> YES -> Type A: Fix (Critical)
        |   +-> Must update
        |
        +-> NO -> Undocumented edge case?
            |
            +-> YES -> Type A: Fix (High)
            |   +-> Run Fix Checklist
            |
            +-> NO -> Just confusion?
                |
                +-> YES -> Type A: Fix (Medium)
                |   +-> Run Fix Checklist
                |
                +-> NO -> Don't update
```

---

### Pre-Update Validation

**All boxes must be checked. If any fails, STOP.**

#### For Type A (Fix)

- [ ] Gap is **absent**, not just "could be clearer"
- [ ] Verified info doesn't exist in SKILL.md, references/, or examples
- [ ] Issue is **reproducible**, not one-time environmental
- [ ] Solution is **generalizable** to other users/scenarios
- [ ] Benefit **outweighs** added complexity

#### For Type B (Expand)

- [ ] New capability is **reusable** (not one-time)
- [ ] Pattern appeared in **2+ similar tasks** (or clearly will)
- [ ] Doesn't **over-specialize** skill for rare cases
- [ ] Fits within skill's **domain scope**
- [ ] SKILL.md stays **under 500 lines** after addition

---

### Update Mapping: What Goes Where

| What You Learned | Skill Component | Update Action |
|------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| New trigger scenarios | YAML description | Expand trigger phrases |
| Workflow step missing/wrong | SKILL.md body | Fix/add step |
| New workflow branch | SKILL.md body | Add conditional path |
| Error pattern + solution | SKILL.md "Common Issues" | Add issue entry |
| DB schema knowledge | references/schema.md | Add/update tables |
| API endpoint details | references/api.md | Add/update endpoints |
| Code conventions | references/conventions.md | Document patterns |
| Detailed troubleshooting | references/troubleshooting.md | Add scenario |
| Reusable script | scripts/[name].py | Extract and test |
| Script bug fix | scripts/[name].py | Fix and test |
| Output format/template | assets/[template] | Add template file |

### Progressive Disclosure Rules

**SKILL.md body** (loaded when skill triggers):
- Core workflow steps
- Common issues (brief)
- References to detail files

**references/** (loaded on demand):
- Detailed schemas, APIs
- Extended troubleshooting
- Technical deep-dives
- Comprehensive examples

**Rule:** If adding >50 lines to SKILL.md, create a reference file instead.

---

### Update Process

#### Step 1: Classify
- Type A (Fix) or Type B (Expand)?
- Severity level?
- If Type C (Skip) -> Stop

#### Step 2: Validate
- Run appropriate checklist
- All boxes checked? -> Continue
- Any unchecked? -> Stop

#### Step 3: Map
- Identify which skill components need updates
- Use mapping table above

#### Step 4: Update

For each component:

**YAML Frontmatter:**
```yaml
# If trigger scope changed:
description: [Expanded description covering new scenarios]
```

**SKILL.md Body:**
```markdown
# Add to Common Issues (Type A Fix):
### Issue N: [Problem Name]
**Symptom:** [What user sees]
**Cause:** [Why it happens]
**Solution:** [How to fix]

# Add workflow branch (Type B Expand):
## Step N: [Step Name]
- IF [condition] -> [Action A]
- ELSE -> [Action B]
```

**references/[file].md:**
```markdown
# Add detailed knowledge
## [Topic]
[Detailed content that would bloat SKILL.md]
```

**scripts/[name].py:**
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Script: [name].py
Purpose: [One line]
Usage: python scripts/[name].py [args]
Returns: 0=success, 1=failure
"""
[Tested, working code]
```

**assets/[template]:**
```
[Reusable template or file]
```

#### Step 5: Verify
- [ ] YAML frontmatter valid
- [ ] SKILL.md < 500 lines
- [ ] New scripts tested
- [ ] No broken references
- [ ] No duplicate information across files

#### Step 6: Document
Brief summary (2-4 sentences):
- What was updated
- Why (trigger event)
- Which files changed
- Expected improvement

### Integration with SR-PTD

When completing a task with an SR-PTD document, extract updates:

| SR-PTD Section | Check For | Skill Update |
|----------------|-----------|--------------|
| Trigger Profile | New trigger phrases | -> YAML description |
| Workflow Executed | Missing/wrong steps | -> SKILL.md body |
| Decision Points | Undocumented branches | -> SKILL.md conditionals |
| Knowledge Accessed (DB) | Schema not in skill | -> references/schema.md |
| Knowledge Accessed (API) | Endpoints not in skill | -> references/api.md |
| Code Written | Marked "reusable" | -> scripts/ |
| Outputs Produced | Marked "template potential" | -> assets/ |
| Issues & Fixes | Novel error patterns | -> SKILL.md Common Issues |
| Skill Extraction Score | 20+ points | -> Consider new skill |

### SR-PTD Reusability Flags -> Updates

If SR-PTD contains:
- `[x] Should become skill script` -> Extract to scripts/
- `[x] Could be template` -> Extract to assets/
- `[x] Include in Skill (error)` -> Add to Common Issues

### Update Examples

#### Example 1: Type A Fix (Critical)
**Situation:** Script hung with garbled output, had to kill and use manual commands
**Update:** 
- Fix script PowerShell parsing (scripts/kill-port.sh)
- Add Issue 6 to SKILL.md with manual fallback
- Add error pattern to references/troubleshooting.md

#### Example 2: Type A Fix (High)
**Situation:** Port showed LISTEN after killing process (zombie connection)
**Update:**
- Add Issue 5 to SKILL.md explaining zombie connections
- Add process-name-based cleanup to workflow

#### Example 3: Type B Expand
**Situation:** Wrote reusable validation script during task, SR-PTD marked it "definitely reusable"
**Update:**
- Extract script to scripts/validate_input.py
- Add usage reference to SKILL.md
- Test script independently

#### Example 4: Don't Update
**Situation:** Skill worked perfectly, user asked to change output colors
**Why:** Preference, not function. Skill worked as documented.

## Maintenance

This skill improves based on usage. Updates occur when:
- Documentation structure proves insufficient
- New patterns emerge from aggregated SR-PTDs
- Skill extraction workflow is refined

Updates follow the Skill Update Protocol and require validation.
