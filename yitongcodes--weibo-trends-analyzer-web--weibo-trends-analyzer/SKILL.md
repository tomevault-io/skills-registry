# Weibo Trends Analyzer - 微博热搜创意产品分析

## Overview

This skill helps you identify creative product opportunities from Weibo trending topics. It fetches real-time hot search data, researches comprehensive background information, evaluates product development potential, and presents findings in an interactive dashboard.

**Keywords**: Weibo, 微博, trending topics, hot search, 热搜, product ideas, creative products, market analysis, social media trends, Chinese market

## Workflow

### 1. Fetch Weibo Trending Topics

**Default API**: https://apis.tianapi.com/weibohot/index?key=4dfdf794141101d7bb8ece0294dbbc02

When the user requests Weibo trending analysis, fetch the current hot search list:

```bash
curl -s "https://apis.tianapi.com/weibohot/index?key=4dfdf794141101d7bb8ece0294dbbc02"
```

**API Response Processing**:

The API returns data in this format:
```json
{
  "code": 200,
  "msg": "success",
  "result": {
    "list": [
      {
        "hotword": "trending keyword",
        "hotwordnum": "1234567",
        "hottag": "新/热/荐"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Field Mapping**:
- `hotword` → Trending keyword (热搜关键词)
- `hotwordnum` → Heat value (热度值), may contain category prefix like "综艺 587870"
- `hottag` → Tag (标签): "新"(new), "热"(hot), "荐"(recommended), or empty
- Ranking position → Inferred from array index (1-based)

**Parsing Instructions**:
1. Check if `code == 200` to confirm success
2. Extract the `result.list` array
3. For each item in the list:
   - Rank = array index + 1
   - Keyword = `hotword`
   - Heat value = extract numeric value from `hotwordnum` (remove category prefix if present)
   - Tag = `hottag`
   - Category = extract from `hotwordnum` prefix if exists (e.g., "综艺", "剧集", "盛典", "演出")
4. Limit analysis to top 10-15 items to manage processing time

**Error Handling**:

If API fetch fails, follow this fallback strategy:

1. **API Returns Error Code (code ≠ 200)**:
   - Log the error message from API response
   - Inform user: "API returned error: {msg}. Would you like to use mock data instead?"
   - Suggest checking API key or quota limits
   - If user agrees, use `.claude/skills/weibo-trends-analyzer/weibo-mock-data.json`

2. **Network/Connection Failure**:
   - Inform user: "Unable to connect to API. Possible network issue."
   - Offer to use mock data: `.claude/skills/weibo-trends-analyzer/weibo-mock-data.json`
   - Suggest verifying internet connection

3. **Invalid JSON Response**:
   - Log the response received
   - Inform user: "API returned invalid data format"
   - Recommend checking if API endpoint has changed
   - Fall back to mock data if available

4. **Empty or Malformed Data**:
   - If `result.list` is empty or missing
   - Inform user: "No trending topics found in API response"
   - Use mock data as fallback

### 2. Deep Research Each Trending Topic

For EACH trending topic, perform **2 focused web searches** to gather essential background:

**Search Strategy (2 searches per topic)**:

**Search 1: Context & Background**
Combine social media discussions and news background in one search:
- Search query examples:
  - "{keyword} 微博 新闻背景"
  - "{keyword} 热搜原因 讨论"
  - "{keyword} latest news 用户看法"

Goal: Understand WHAT the trend is about and WHY it's trending

**Search 2: User Insights & Market Potential**
Focus on consumer perspective and product opportunities:
- Search query examples:
  - "{keyword} 用户需求 产品"
  - "{keyword} 消费者痛点"
  - "{keyword} 产品创意 市场"

Goal: Identify user needs, pain points, and product development opportunities

**Information to Extract**:
From the 2 searches, gather:
- ✅ Social media sentiment and discussion volume (社交媒体讨论)
- ✅ News background and event context (新闻背景)
- ✅ Target demographics and audience size (目标人群)
- ✅ User pain points and unmet needs (用户痛点)
- ✅ Existing products or market gaps (市场机会)
- ✅ Cultural/social significance (文化意义)

**Error Handling for Web Searches**:

1. **Search Returns No Results**:
   - Log: "No search results for: {keyword}"
   - Mark research as "Limited data available"
   - Proceed with analysis using keyword itself and general market knowledge
   - Note in dashboard: "⚠️ 背景研究受限"

2. **Search Timeout or Failure**:
   - Retry once with simplified query (just keyword without additional terms)
   - If retry fails, mark as "Search unavailable"
   - Continue analysis with available data
   - Note limitation in product analysis

3. **Irrelevant Search Results**:
   - If results don't match trending topic context:
   - Try alternative search query with different keywords
   - Use general industry knowledge for analysis
   - Document: "Based on general market analysis"

4. **Partial Search Success (1 of 2 succeeds)**:
   - Proceed with available search data
   - Note which aspect is missing (context vs. user insights)
   - Make conservative estimates for missing information
   - Mark in dashboard with: "⚠️ 部分数据"

### 3. AI-Powered Product Ideation & Scoring

For each trending topic, analyze and generate creative product ideas using this scoring framework:

**Scoring System (Total: 100 Points)**

1. **Product Development Potential (可发展度)**: 40 points
   - Market size and scalability (15 points)
   - Technical feasibility (10 points)
   - Trend longevity vs. fleeting fad (10 points)
   - Competitive landscape (5 points)

2. **Interest Level (有趣度)**: 20 points
   - Creative uniqueness (10 points)
   - Emotional appeal (5 points)
   - Share-ability/viral potential (5 points)

3. **Practical Life Utility (生活有用度)**: 20 points
   - Daily life integration (10 points)
   - Problem-solving capability (5 points)
   - Target audience size (5 points)

4. **Small-Scale Production Ease (小规模生产容易程度)**: 20 points
   - Manufacturing complexity (10 points)
   - Material accessibility (5 points)
   - Cost efficiency for small batches (5 points)

**Product Concept Requirements**:

For each trend, generate 1-3 creative product concepts including:

- **Market Category (市场赛道)**: Which product category (e.g., home decor, fashion accessories, stationery, tech gadgets, lifestyle products, toys, etc.)
- **Product Name (产品名称)**: Catchy, memorable name
- **Target Audience (销售对象人群)**: Specific demographic (age, interests, income level, lifestyle)
- **Manufacturing Characteristics (工厂批量生产特点)**:
  - Production method (e.g., 3D printing, injection molding, screen printing, laser cutting)
  - Material requirements
  - Minimum order quantity (MOQ) feasibility
  - Lead time estimates
  - Cost structure (per unit at different volumes)
- **Detailed Description (详细描述)**: How the product relates to the trending topic
- **Total Score (总分)**: Sum of all four scoring dimensions
- **Score Breakdown (评分分析)**: Brief justification for each score component

**Scoring Guidelines**:
- Be objective and realistic
- Consider Chinese market context
- Factor in current manufacturing capabilities
- Account for trend cycle timing

   - If still fails, inform user: "Unable to write files. Please check directory permissions."
   - Suggest user-provided output path

2. **HTML Generation Error**:
   - If template rendering fails, create simplified HTML version with basic table layout
   - Ensure at minimum: product names, scores, and basic descriptions are included
   - Log error details for troubleshooting

3. **Data Validation Before Output**:
   - Verify at least 1 product concept was generated
   - Check all scores are within valid ranges (0-40, 0-20, etc.)
   - Ensure required fields are present (product name, score, description)
   - If validation fails, inform user which topics had issues

4. **Large File Handling**:
   - If analyzing >20 topics, warn user about large file size
   - Consider generating paginated HTML or summary + detailed sections
   - Ensure browser compatibility for large datasets

## Best Practices

**Research Quality**:
- Perform 2 focused web searches per trending topic (optimized for efficiency)
- Synthesize information from multiple sources within each search
- Verify factual accuracy
- Note information freshness
- Prioritize quality over quantity in search results

**Product Ideation**:
- Think beyond obvious connections
- Consider cultural context and Chinese consumer behavior
- Evaluate both short-term trend exploitation and long-term product viability
- Be creative but realistic

**Scoring Objectivity**:
- Use consistent criteria across all products
- Justify scores with specific evidence
- Avoid bias toward certain product categories
- Consider manufacturing realities in China

**Dashboard Quality**:
- Ensure all Chinese characters display correctly (UTF-8 encoding)
- Test responsiveness on different screen sizes
- Validate HTML/CSS/JS syntax
- Include fallback fonts for Chinese text
- Make data visualizations clear and intuitive
