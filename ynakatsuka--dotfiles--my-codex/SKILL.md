# Codex Runner

Delegate tasks to OpenAI Codex CLI from within Claude Code.

## Model Selection

- **Default**: Do NOT specify `--model`. The model configured in `~/.codex/config.toml` is used automatically.
- **User-specified model**: Only add `--model <MODEL>` when the user explicitly requests a specific model (e.g., "o3で実行して", "use gpt-5.3-codex").

## Invocation

Run Codex in non-interactive exec mode:

```bash
# Default (uses model from config.toml)
codex exec "<PROMPT>"

# With explicit model override (only when user specifies)
codex exec --model <MODEL> "<PROMPT>"
```

### With image input

```bash
codex exec -i path/to/image.png "<PROMPT>"
```

### Resume previous session

```bash
codex resume --last
```

## Prompt Construction

1. Convert the user's request into a clear, self-contained prompt for Codex
2. Include relevant file paths and context in the prompt
3. If the user provides a specific prompt, pass it through directly

### Examples

**Simple task:**
```bash
codex exec "Fix the type error in src/utils.ts"
```

**With context:**
```bash
codex exec "Add input validation to the login handler in src/auth/handler.py. Validate email format and password length (min 8 chars)."
```

**Code review:**
```bash
codex exec "Review the changes in the current branch compared to main. Focus on security issues and performance."
```

**With explicit model:**
```bash
codex exec --model o3 "Analyze the architecture of this project"
```

## Configuration

User's Codex config (`~/.codex/config.toml`) controls defaults:
- `model` - Default model (updated by user as new models release)
- `approval_policy = "never"` (fully autonomous)
- `sandbox_mode = "danger-full-access"`
- `network_access = true`

These settings mean Codex runs without approval prompts and uses the configured default model.

## Execution

- Always use the Bash tool with `timeout: 600000` (10 minutes) when running `codex exec`, as tasks may take significant time.

## Notes

- Always use `exec` mode (non-interactive) since Claude cannot interact with Codex's TUI
- Do NOT hardcode model names — let config.toml handle the default so it stays up to date
- Output streams to stdout; capture or display results directly
- For long-running tasks, warn the user that Codex may take time
- If Codex fails, report the error and suggest the user run it interactively with `codex`
