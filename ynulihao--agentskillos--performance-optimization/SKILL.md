# Performance Optimization Skill

Apply these principles when optimizing code for performance. Focus on the critical 3% where performance truly matters - a 12% improvement is never marginal in engineering.

## Core Philosophy

1. **Measure First**: Never optimize without profiling data
2. **Estimate Costs**: Back-of-envelope calculations before implementation
3. **Avoid Work**: The fastest code is code that doesn't run
4. **Reduce Allocations**: Memory allocation is often the hidden bottleneck
5. **Cache Locality**: Memory access patterns dominate modern performance

## Reference Latency Numbers

Use these for back-of-envelope calculations:

| Operation | Latency |
|-----------|---------|
| L1 cache reference | 0.5 ns |
| Branch mispredict | 5 ns |
| L2 cache reference | 7 ns |
| Mutex lock/unlock | 25 ns |
| Main memory reference | 100 ns |
| Compress 1KB (Snappy) | 3 us |
| SSD random read (4KB) | 20 us |
| Round trip in datacenter | 50 us |
| Disk seek | 5 ms |

## Optimization Techniques (Priority Order)

### 1. Algorithmic Improvements (Highest Impact)

**Always check algorithm complexity first:**

```
O(N^2) → O(N log N)  = 1000x faster for N=1M
O(N)   → O(1)        = unbounded improvement
```

**Common patterns:**
- Replace nested loops with hash lookups
- Use sorted-list intersection → hash table lookups
- Process in reverse post-order to eliminate per-element checks
- Replace interval trees (O(log N)) with hash maps (O(1)) when ranges aren't needed

### 2. Reduce Memory Allocations

**Allocation is expensive (~25-100ns + GC pressure)**

```python
# BAD: Allocates on every call
def process(items):
    result = []  # New allocation
    for item in items:
        result.append(transform(item))
    return result

# GOOD: Pre-allocate or reuse
def process(items, out=None):
    if out is None:
        out = [None] * len(items)
    for i, item in enumerate(items):
        out[i] = transform(item)
    return out
```

**Techniques:**
- Pre-size containers with `reserve()` or known capacity
- Hoist temporary containers outside loops
- Reuse buffers across iterations (clear instead of recreate)
- Move instead of copy large structures
- Use stack allocation for bounded-lifetime objects

### 3. Compact Data Structures

**Minimize memory footprint and cache lines touched:**

```rust
// BAD: 24 bytes due to padding
struct Item {
    flag: bool,      // 1 byte + 7 padding
    value: i64,      // 8 bytes
    count: i32,      // 4 bytes + 4 padding
}

// GOOD: 16 bytes with reordering
struct Item {
    value: i64,      // 8 bytes
    count: i32,      // 4 bytes
    flag: bool,      // 1 byte + 3 padding
}
```

**Techniques:**
- Reorder struct fields by size (largest first)
- Use smaller numeric types when range permits (u8 vs i32)
- Replace 64-bit pointers with 32-bit indices
- Keep hot fields together, move cold fields to separate struct
- Use bit vectors for small-domain sets
- Flatten nested maps: `Map<A, Map<B, C>>` → `Map<(A,B), C>`

### 4. Fast Paths for Common Cases

**Optimize the common case without hurting rare cases:**

```python
# BAD: Always takes slow path
def parse_varint(data):
    return generic_varint_parser(data)

# GOOD: Fast path for common 1-byte case
def parse_varint(data):
    if data[0] < 128:  # Single byte - 90% of cases
        return data[0], 1
    return generic_varint_parser(data)  # Rare multi-byte
```

**Techniques:**
- Handle common dimensions inline (1-D, 2-D tensors)
- Check for empty/trivial inputs early
- Specialize for common sizes (small strings, few elements)
- Process trailing elements separately to avoid slow generic code

### 5. Precompute Expensive Information

**Trade memory for compute when beneficial:**

```python
# BAD: Recomputes on every access
def is_vowel(char):
    return char.lower() in 'aeiou'

# GOOD: Lookup table
VOWEL_TABLE = [c.lower() in 'aeiou' for c in (chr(i) for i in range(256))]
def is_vowel(char):
    return VOWEL_TABLE[ord(char)]
```

**Techniques:**
- Precompute flags/properties at construction time
- Build lookup tables for character classification
- Cache expensive computed properties
- Validate at boundaries once, not repeatedly inside

### 6. Bulk/Batch APIs

**Amortize fixed costs across multiple operations:**

```python
# BAD: N round trips
for item in items:
    result = db.lookup(item)

# GOOD: 1 round trip
results = db.lookup_many(items)
```

**Design APIs that support:**
- Batch lookups instead of individual fetches
- Vectorized operations over loops
- Streaming interfaces for large datasets

### 7. Avoid Unnecessary Work

```python
# BAD: Always computes expensive value
def process(data, config):
    expensive = compute_expensive(data)  # Always runs
    if config.needs_expensive:
        use(expensive)

# GOOD: Defer until needed
def process(data, config):
    if config.needs_expensive:
        expensive = compute_expensive(data)  # Only when needed
        use(expensive)
```

**Techniques:**
- Lazy evaluation for expensive operations
- Short-circuit evaluation in conditions
- Move loop-invariant code outside loops
- Specialize instead of using general-purpose libraries in hot paths

### 8. Help the Compiler/Runtime

**Lower-level optimizations when profiling shows need:**

```rust
// Avoid function call overhead in hot loops
#[inline(always)]
fn hot_function(x: i32) -> i32 { x * 2 }

// Copy to local variable for better alias analysis
fn process(data: &mut [i32], factor: &i32) {
    let f = *factor;  // Compiler knows this won't change
    for x in data {
        *x *= f;
    }
}
```

**Techniques:**
- Use raw pointers/indices instead of iterators in critical loops
- Hand-unroll very hot loops (4+ iterations)
- Move slow-path code to separate non-inlined functions
- Avoid abstractions that hide costs in hot paths

### 9. Reduce Synchronization

**Minimize lock contention and atomic operations:**

- Default to thread-compatible (external sync) not thread-safe
- Sample statistics (1-in-32) instead of tracking everything
- Batch updates to shared state
- Use thread-local storage for per-thread data

## Profiling Workflow

1. **Identify hotspots**: Use profiler (pprof, perf, py-spy)
2. **Measure baseline**: Write benchmark before optimizing
3. **Estimate improvement**: Calculate expected gain
4. **Implement change**: Focus on one optimization at a time
5. **Verify improvement**: Run benchmark, confirm gain
6. **Check for regressions**: Ensure no other code paths slowed down

## When Profile is Flat (No Clear Hotspots)

- Pursue multiple small 1-2% improvements collectively
- Look for restructuring opportunities higher in call stack
- Profile allocations specifically (often hidden cost)
- Gather hardware performance counters (cache misses, branch mispredicts)
- Consider if the code is already well-optimized

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Premature optimization** in non-critical code
2. **Optimizing without measurement** - changes based on intuition
3. **Micro-optimizing** while ignoring algorithmic complexity
4. **Copying** when moving would suffice
5. **Growing containers** one element at a time (quadratic)
6. **Allocating in loops** when reuse is possible
7. **String formatting** in hot paths (use pre-built templates)
8. **Regex** when simple string matching suffices

## Estimation Template

Before optimizing, estimate:

```
Operation cost: ___ ns/us/ms
Frequency: ___ times per second/request
Total time: cost × frequency = ___
Improvement target: ___% reduction
Expected new time: ___
Is this worth it? [ ] Yes [ ] No
```
