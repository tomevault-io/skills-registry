# Orchestration Skill

Coordinate multi-step workflows with planning, execution, and rollback.

## Allowed Operations

- Create execution plans
- Execute plans step-by-step
- Coordinate between skills
- Track execution state
- Handle rollbacks

## Forbidden Operations

- Execute without plan approval
- Skip plan validation
- Ignore step failures
- Parallel execution without explicit flag
- Modify plan during execution

## Execution Phases

### 1. Plan Phase
- Output all steps
- Identify tools and risks
- NO side effects
- Requires approval

### 2. Validation Phase
- Validate all inputs
- Check permissions
- Dry-run each step

### 3. Execution Phase
- Execute step-by-step
- Abort on error
- Track state for rollback

### 4. Rollback Phase (if needed)
- Execute in reverse order
- Log all actions
- Report final state

## Quick Plan Structure

```yaml
plan:
  id: "plan-001"
  name: "Implement Feature"
  steps:
    - id: "step-1"
      skill: "git-operations"
      action: "create-branch"
      params:
        name: "feature/PROJ-123"
      rollback:
        action: "delete-branch"

    - id: "step-2"
      skill: "jira-write"
      action: "transition"
      params:
        issue: "PROJ-123"
        status: "In Progress"
      dependsOn: ["step-1"]
```

For complete plan examples, see [PLAN-EXAMPLES.md](references/PLAN-EXAMPLES.md).

For rollback patterns, see [ROLLBACK-STRATEGIES.md](references/ROLLBACK-STRATEGIES.md).

## Error Handling

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Single step failure | Pause and report |
| Multiple failures | Abort and rollback |
| Rollback failure | Alert for manual intervention |

## Example Usage

```
Create a plan to implement feature PROJ-123
Execute the approved plan step by step
Resume plan execution from step 3
Rollback the last failed plan
```
