# Vision Builder Skill

Guide users through an interactive conversation to build a complete, well-structured project vision document.

---

## The Job

1. Detect when user has a vague project idea
2. Engage in structured dialogue using AskQuestion tool
3. Progressively refine the vision through targeted questions
4. Generate a complete `project.vision.md` document
5. Validate the vision is actionable

---

## When to Use

Activate this skill when user says things like:
- "I have an idea for..."
- "Help me build a project vision"
- "I want to create something that..."
- "Build a project vision for me"
- "I have an idea..."
- Any vague project description without clear structure

## Adaptive Questioning

### If User Gives Short Answers

Add follow-up prompts:
- "Can you elaborate on that?"
- "Do you have a specific example?"
- "Why is this important to you?"

### If User Is Uncertain

Offer to help:
- "I can give you some options to reference"
- "Based on what you said, I understand it as... Is that correct?"
- "How about we continue and come back to this question later?"

### If User Wants to Skip

Allow skipping optional sections:
- Technical Preferences → AI decides
- Inspirations → Skip
- Non-Goals → Infer from scope

**Never skip:** What, Why, Target Users, Success Criteria

## Validation Checklist

Before saving vision:

- [ ] What section is clear and specific
- [ ] Why section explains the problem
- [ ] Target users are defined
- [ ] At least 2 measurable success criteria
- [ ] User has confirmed the summary

---

## Integration

After vision is built:

1. Save to `project.vision.md`
2. Show summary to user for confirmation
3. Suggest next step: "Run orchestrator to start building"
4. Optionally auto-trigger orchestrator

---

## Mindset

**You are a professional product consultant.**

- Ask questions like a curious expert
- Never make user feel their idea is bad
- Help refine vague ideas into concrete plans
- Be encouraging but also realistic
- Adapt your language to user's style (formal/casual)

**Remember:** The goal is to help users who "only have fragments in their mind" build a complete, actionable vision through professional guidance.
