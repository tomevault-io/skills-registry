description: Implement code for a single feature using orchestrator pattern. Generates AAA test scenarios from specification, routes to language-specific tool skills via semantic matching, and validates results. Delegates to x-ipe-meta-skill-creator for skill files and mcp-builder for MCP servers. Triggers on requests like "implement feature", "write code", "develop feature". Use when this capability is needed.

# Task-Based Skill: Code Implementation

## Purpose

Implement code for a single feature by:
1. Querying feature board for full Feature Data Model
2. Learning technical design document thoroughly
3. Reading architecture designs (if referenced in technical design)
4. **Generating AAA test scenarios** from specification + technical design
5. **Routing to language-specific tool skills** via semantic matching
6. **Validating all Assert clauses** pass across tool skill outputs

---

## Important Notes

BLOCKING: Learn `x-ipe-workflow-task-execution` skill before executing this skill.

**Note:** If Agent does not have skill capability, go to `.github/skills/` folder to learn skills. SKILL.md is the entry point.

**BLOCKING: Single Feature Only.** This skill operates on exactly ONE feature at a time. Do NOT batch or combine multiple features in a single execution. If multiple features need processing, run this skill separately for each feature.

**Workflow Mode:** When `execution_mode == "workflow-mode"`, the completion step MUST run the workflow update script via bash: `python3 .github/skills/x-ipe-tool-x-ipe-app-interactor/scripts/workflow_update_action.py` with `workflow_name` from `workflow.name` input, `action` from `workflow.action` input, `status: "done"`, and a `deliverables` keyed dict using ONLY the extract tags defined in `workflow-template.json` for this action (format: `{"tag-name": "path/to/file"}`). Do NOT pass a flat list of file paths. Verify the script exits with code 0 before marking the task complete.

**Phase 1 Coexistence:** AAA scenario generation coexists with `x-ipe-tool-test-generation`. If AAA generation fails (ambiguous spec, insufficient detail), fall back to `x-ipe-tool-test-generation` as a safety net. This fallback will be removed in Phase 3 after all tool skills are proven stable.

### Implementation Principles

| Principle | Rule |
|-----------|------|
| KISS | Keep code simple and readable; prefer clarity over cleverness |
| YAGNI | Implement ONLY what is in technical design; no extras |
| AAA-Driven | Arrange/Act/Assert scenarios drive implementation and validation |
| Coverage | Target 80%+; NEVER add complexity just for coverage |
| Standards | Use linters, formatters, meaningful names |
| Mockups | For frontend work, reference mockups from specification.md and match layout, components, and visual states |

See [references/implementation-guidelines.md](.github/skills/x-ipe-task-based-code-implementation/references/implementation-guidelines.md) for detailed principles, coding standards, AAA format specification, and error handling patterns.

IMPORTANT: When `process_preference.interaction_mode == "dao-represent-human-to-interact"`, NEVER stop to ask the human. Instead, call `x-ipe-dao-end-user-representative` to get the answer. The DAO skill acts as the human representative and will provide the guidance needed to continue.

## Execution Flow

| Phase | Steps | Action | Gate |
|-------|-------|--------|------|
| 1. 博学之 — Study Broadly | 1.1 Query Board, 1.2 Learn Design, 1.3 Read Architecture | Load feature data, study technical design, read architecture | Design fully understood |
| 2. 审问之 — Inquire Thoroughly | 2.1 Generate AAA Scenarios | Create tagged test scenarios from spec + design | Scenarios with coverage |
| 3. 慎思之 — Think Carefully | 3.1 Route & Invoke Tool Skills | Semantic-match and invoke tool skills sequentially | All tool skills complete |
| 4. 明辨之 — Discern Clearly | 4.1 Validate Results, 4.2 Apply Tracing | Verify Assert clauses, run integration, add tracing | All checks pass |
| 5. 笃行之 — Practice Earnestly | 5.1 Update Workflow Status | Update workflow, verify DoD, output summary | Task complete |
| 继续执行 | 6.1 Decide Next Action | DAO-assisted next task decision | Next action decided |
| 继续执行 | 6.2 Execute Next Action | Load skill, generate plan, execute | Execution started |

BLOCKING: Phase 2 → 3 is BLOCKED until AAA scenarios are generated with coverage validated.
BLOCKING: Phase 3: If design needs changes → UPDATE technical design BEFORE implementing.
BLOCKING: Step 3.1 special-case delegations run BEFORE semantic routing.

## Patterns & Anti-Patterns

| Pattern | When | Then |
|---------|------|------|
| Orchestrator Flow | Code feature (backend/frontend/fullstack) | Generate AAA → route tool skills → validate → trace |
| Special-Case Delegation | program_type "skills" or MCP server | Bypass AAA, delegate to skill-creator/mcp-builder, verify DoD |
| Design Reference | Technical design references architecture | Read architecture docs, follow existing patterns, reuse utilities |

| Anti-Pattern | Why Bad | Do Instead |
|--------------|---------|------------|
| Skip reading design | Wrong implementation | Learn technical design first |
| Ignore architecture docs | Inconsistent patterns | Read referenced architecture |
| Skip AAA generation | No validation contract | Always generate scenarios first |
| Parallel tool skills | Context conflicts | Sequential invocation only |
| Add "nice to have" features | YAGNI violation | Only implement what's in design |
| Complex code for coverage | Maintenance nightmare | Keep simple, accept 80% |
| Ignore mockups | UI drifts from design | Use current mockups as visual spec |
| Copy-paste code | DRY violation | Extract reusable functions |

## Examples

See [references/examples.md](.github/skills/x-ipe-task-based-code-implementation/references/examples.md) for detailed execution examples including:
- Standard backend+frontend feature with AAA orchestration
- Skills-type feature delegated to skill-creator
- AAA generation fallback to test-generation (Phase 1)
- Tool skill retry on failure
