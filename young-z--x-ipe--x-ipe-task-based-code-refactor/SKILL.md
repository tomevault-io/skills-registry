name: x-ipe-task-based-code-refactor
description: Execute code refactoring end-to-end — analyze scope, sync docs, plan, execute, and validate. Single entry point for all refactoring work. Invokes x-ipe-tool-refactoring-analysis and x-ipe-tool-code-quality-sync as tool steps. Triggers on requests like "refactor code", "execute refactoring", "analyze for refactoring", "code quality assessment". Use when this capability is needed.

# Task-Based Skill: Code Refactor

## Purpose

Execute safe, end-to-end code refactoring with full traceability by:
1. **Analyze** scope and evaluate quality gaps (via `x-ipe-tool-refactoring-analysis`)
2. **Sync** documentation and tests with current code (via `x-ipe-tool-code-quality-sync`)
3. **Plan** refactoring following suggestions and principles
4. **Execute** refactoring incrementally with test validation
5. **Validate** quality improvement and update references

---

## Important Notes

BLOCKING: Learn `x-ipe-workflow-task-execution` skill before executing this skill.

**Note:** If Agent does not have skill capability, go to `.github/skills/` folder to learn skills. SKILL.md is the entry point.

This skill is the **single entry point** for all refactoring work. It orchestrates:
- `x-ipe-tool-refactoring-analysis` — scope expansion + quality evaluation
- `x-ipe-tool-code-quality-sync` — doc sync + test baseline

BLOCKING: If user requests "refactor", "analyze for refactoring", or "assess code quality" — this skill handles it. Do NOT redirect to separate analysis skills.

IMPORTANT: When `process_preference.interaction_mode == "dao-represent-human-to-interact"`, NEVER stop to ask the human. Instead, call `x-ipe-dao-end-user-representative` to get the answer. The DAO skill acts as the human representative and will provide the guidance needed to continue.

## Execution Flow

| Phase | Steps | Action | Gate |
|-------|-------|--------|------|
| 1. 博学之 — Study Broadly | 1.1 Analyze Scope & Quality | Invoke `x-ipe-tool-refactoring-analysis`, self-validate findings | Analysis complete |
| 2. 审问之 — Inquire Thoroughly | 2.1 Sync Docs & Tests | Invoke `x-ipe-tool-code-quality-sync` | All aligned, coverage ≥ 80% |
| 3. 慎思之 — Think Carefully | 3.1 Generate Refactoring Plan | Design target structure, AI self-validates plan | Plan validated |
| 4. 明辨之 — Discern Clearly | 4.1 Execute Refactoring | Apply changes incrementally with tests | All tests pass |
| 5. 笃行之 — Practice Earnestly | 5.1 Validate & Complete | Verify improvement, update refs, apply tracing | DoD verified |
| 继续执行 | 6.1 Decide Next Action | DAO-assisted next task decision | Next action decided |
| 继续执行 | 6.2 Execute Next Action | Load skill, generate plan, execute | Execution started |

BLOCKING: Phase 1 → 2 requires verification that analysis identified all issues.
BLOCKING: Phase 3 → 4 requires confirmation that refactoring plan addresses identified issues (manual/stop_for_question: human confirms; auto: DAO confirms).
BLOCKING: Phase 4 halts if any test fails (must fix or revert).

        Call `x-ipe-tool-task-board-manager` → `task_create.py`:

           refactoring_suggestion, refactoring_principle, report_path
        3. AI self-critique — validate analysis against objective criteria:
           a. Every item in refactoring_scope maps to a measurable quality gap
           b. No suggestions contradict each other (e.g., "extract class" + "inline class" on same target)
           c. Suggestions stay within the requested scope — no scope creep
           d. Quality scores are consistent (e.g., high complexity score but low smell count = investigate)
        4. Collect unresolved_questions[] — ONLY genuine ambiguities:
           - Scope conflicts: "You asked to refactor module X, but the analysis shows module Y is the root cause — include Y?"
           - Priority conflicts: "Both DRY and performance improvements are needed but they conflict — which to prioritize?"
        5. IF unresolved_questions is EMPTY → analysis validated, proceed
        6. IF unresolved_questions is NON-EMPTY:
           IF process_preference.interaction_mode == "dao-represent-human-to-interact":

           - DRY: Plan abstractions
           - KISS: Simplifications
           - YAGNI: Remove unused code
        3. CREATE refactoring_plan with phases ordered by goal priority
        4. AI self-critique — validate plan against objective criteria:
           a. Every identified issue from Step 1 has a corresponding plan item
           b. No plan item exceeds the approved refactoring_scope
           c. Plan respects refactoring_principle constraints (no new dependencies, etc.)
           d. Phases are ordered so earlier phases don't break later ones
           e. Each phase is independently testable — can verify before moving on
        5. Collect unresolved_questions[] — ONLY genuine trade-offs:
           - "Extracting this module improves DRY but adds a new dependency — acceptable?"

  </checkpoint>

```

MANDATORY: After completing this skill, return to `x-ipe-workflow-task-execution` to continue the task execution flow.

## Patterns & Anti-Patterns

| Pattern | When | Then |
|---------|------|------|
| Full Flow | "refactor this code" | Analysis → sync → plan → execute incrementally → validate → commit |
| Rollback | Tests fail after change | STOP, analyze, REVERT if behavior changed, fix if import issue |
| Tracing | Moving/renaming functions | Keep @x_ipe_tracing decorators, preserve redact=[], add to new public functions |

| Anti-Pattern | Why Bad | Do Instead |
|--------------|---------|------------|
| Big bang refactor | High risk, hard to debug | Small incremental changes |
| Skip analysis/sync | Missing baseline | Always run analysis + sync first |
| Skip test runs | Silent regressions | Test after EVERY change |
| Change behavior | Refactoring preserves semantics | Structure only, same behavior |
