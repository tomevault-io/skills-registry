# Task-Based Skill: Feature Closing

## Purpose

Close a completed feature and ship it by:
1. Verifying all acceptance criteria are met
2. Reviewing code to sync documentation artifacts (specification, technical design, tests)
3. Updating project files (e.g., README) if needed
4. Running refactoring analysis scoped to the feature
5. Creating a pull request with proper description
6. Outputting completion summary with refactoring recommendations

---

## Important Notes

BLOCKING: Learn `x-ipe-workflow-task-execution` skill before executing this skill.

**Note:** If Agent does not have skill capability, go to `.github/skills/` folder to learn skills. SKILL.md is the entry point.

**BLOCKING: Single Feature Only.** This skill operates on exactly ONE feature at a time. Do NOT batch or combine multiple features in a single execution. If multiple features need processing, run this skill separately for each feature.

IMPORTANT: When `process_preference.interaction_mode == "dao-represent-human-to-interact"`, NEVER stop to ask the human. Instead, call `x-ipe-dao-end-user-representative` to get the answer. The DAO skill acts as the human representative and will provide the guidance needed to continue.

## Patterns & Anti-Patterns

| Pattern | When | Then |
|---------|------|------|
| All Criteria Met | Every AC passes | Review docs → update files → refactoring analysis → create PR → summary |
| Criteria Not Met | One or more AC fail | STOP → report to human with options (address/modify/defer) → wait for guidance |
| Minor Issues Found | Criteria met with minor fixable issues | Fix inline → re-verify → review docs → continue to PR (flag refactoring) |

| Anti-Pattern | Why Bad | Do Instead |
|--------------|---------|------------|
| PR without testing | Broken code merged | Ensure all tests pass first |
| Empty PR description | Reviewer cannot understand changes | Use PR template from references/ |
| Skipping criteria check | Incomplete feature shipped | Verify each criterion with evidence |
| Giant multi-feature PR | Hard to review and revert | Keep PR scoped to single feature |
| Creating feature branches in main-branch-only mode | Unnecessary complexity, violates strategy | BLOCKING: Check git_strategy BEFORE any branch operations; if main-branch-only, stay on main |
| Using agent nickname for dev branch name | Branch not tied to git identity | Use `git config user.name` (sanitized) for dev branch name, NOT agent nickname |
