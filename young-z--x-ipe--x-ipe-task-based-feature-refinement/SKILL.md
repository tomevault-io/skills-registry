# Task-Based Skill: Feature Refinement

## Purpose

Refine feature requirements for a single feature by:
1. Querying feature board for full Feature Data Model
2. Creating/updating detailed feature specification
3. Documenting user stories, acceptance criteria, and requirements
4. NO board status update (handled by category skill)

---

## Important Notes

BLOCKING: Learn `x-ipe-workflow-task-execution` skill before executing this skill.

**Note:** If Agent does not have skill capability, go to `.github/skills/` folder to learn skills. SKILL.md is the entry point.

**BLOCKING: Single Feature Only.** This skill operates on exactly ONE feature at a time. Do NOT batch or combine multiple features in a single execution. If multiple features need processing, run this skill separately for each feature.

MANDATORY: Every feature MUST have a feature ID in the format `FEATURE-{nnn}` (e.g., FEATURE-001, FEATURE-027). This applies regardless of the output language used.

IMPORTANT: When `process_preference.interaction_mode == "dao-represent-human-to-interact"`, NEVER stop to ask the human. Instead, call `x-ipe-dao-end-user-representative` to get the answer. The DAO skill acts as the human representative and will provide the guidance needed to continue.

```

### Input Initialization

```xml
<input_init>
  <field name="task_id" source="x-ipe-tool-task-board-manager (auto-generated)" />
  <field name="execution_mode" source="x-ipe-workflow-task-execution (from --workflow-mode@{name})" />
  <field name="workflow.name" source="x-ipe-workflow-task-execution (from --workflow-mode@{name})" />
  <field name="process_preference.interaction_mode" source="from caller (x-ipe-workflow-task-execution) or default 'interact-with-human'" />
  <field name="feature_id" source="previous task (Feature Breakdown) output OR task board OR human input">
    <steps>
      1. IF previous task was "Feature Breakdown" → use previous task output's feature_ids field (iterate: one refinement task per feature_id)
      2. ELIF task board has feature_id in task data → use it
      3. ELSE → IF interaction_mode == "dao-represent-human-to-interact": derive from workflow context or x-ipe-dao-end-user-representative; ELSE: ask human for feature_id
    </steps>
  </field>
  <field name="extra_context_reference" source="workflow context OR auto-detect">
    <steps>
      1. IF workflow-mode → use workflow.extra_context_reference values
      2. FOR EACH ref in [requirement-doc, features-list]:
         IF ref is a file path → use it
         ELIF "auto-detect" → use existing discovery logic
         ELIF "N/A" → skip
      3. ELSE (free-mode) → use existing behavior
    </steps>
  </field>
  <field name="mockup_list" source="see Mockup List Resolution section below">
    <steps>
      1. IF previous task was "Idea Mockup" → use previous task output's mockup_list field
      2. ELIF previous task was "Feature Breakdown" → inherit from its mockup_list output (or derive from linked_mockups)
      3. ELIF human provides explicit path → use human-provided value
      4. ELIF idea-summary-vN.md exists → extract from "Mockups &amp; Prototypes" section
      5. ELSE → set to "N/A"
    </steps>
  </field>
</input_init>
```

### Mockup List Resolution

The `mockup_list` is resolved: (1) previous Idea Mockup task output, (2) human-provided path, (3) idea-summary-vN.md "Mockups & Prototypes" section, (4) N/A.

Step 1.3 performs additional discovery: idea folder → EPIC-level `mockups/` folder → scope-aware filtering.

MANDATORY: When mockups are linked, spec content — especially ACs and UI/UX Requirements — MUST reference the mockup.

## Execution Flow

| Phase | Steps | Action | Gate |
|-------|-------|--------|------|
| 1. 博学之 — Study Broadly | 1.1 Query Feature Board, 1.2 Gather Context, 1.3 Process Mockups | Load feature data, read requirements, analyze mockups | Full context gathered |
| 2. 审问之 — Inquire Thoroughly | 2.1 Specification Review Questions | Challenge spec completeness, probe gaps and assumptions | Questions resolved |
| 3. 慎思之 — Think Carefully | 3.1 AC Quality Reflection | Assess testability, measurability, completeness of ACs | AC quality validated |
| 4. 明辨之 — Discern Clearly | 4.1 Specification Scope Decision | Finalize in/out scope, resolve edge cases | Scope decided |
| 5. 笃行之 — Practice Earnestly | 5.1 Create/Update Specification, 5.2 Complete & Verify | Write specification document, verify DoD | Specification created |
| 继续执行 | 6.1 | Decide Next Action | DAO-assisted next task decision | Next action decided |
| 继续执行 | 6.2 | Execute Next Action | Load skill, generate plan, execute | Execution started |

BLOCKING: Phase 1 fails if feature not on board or status not "Planned".
BLOCKING: Step 1.3 MUST scan for mockups (feature folder → idea folder → EPIC folder) if feature folder has no `mockups/` directory.
BLOCKING: Step 1.3 MUST apply scope-aware filtering — only link mockups relevant to this feature.
BLOCKING (manual/stop_for_question): Human MUST confirm specification is complete before Technical Design.
BLOCKING (auto): Proceed automatically after DoD verification.

           c. Update paths in mockup_list
        5. IF linked mockups exist (pre-existing or just copied):
           a. Analyze each mockup: extract UI/UX elements, layouts, interactions
           b. Record findings for use in Steps 3.1 and 5.1

           - Is it specific (not vague)?
           - Is it measurable (can be tested programmatically)?

        4. Consider testability: can each AC be verified with an automated test?
        5. Classify each AC with a Test Type indicating the best validation method:
           - **UI** — validated via browser/DOM interaction (e.g., click, render, layout checks)
           - **API** — validated via HTTP request/response (e.g., endpoint returns correct status/body)
           - **Unit** — validated via isolated function/module test (e.g., parsing logic, calculations)
           - **Integration** — validated via multi-component interaction (e.g., service + DB)
           Assign the MOST SPECIFIC type. If an AC could be tested multiple ways, pick the primary method.
           All ACs MUST be automatable — do not use "Manual" as a test type.
        6. MOCKUP CROSS-CHECK (if linked mockups exist and marked "current"):
           a. For each UI element/interaction in the mockup, verify a corresponding AC exists
           b. Flag mockup elements that have NO matching AC — these are gaps
           c. Ensure ACs reference specific mockup elements (e.g., "grid layout per mockup Scene 1")

## Patterns & Anti-Patterns

| Pattern | When | Then |
|---------|------|------|
| Mockup-Driven | Mockup list provided | Assess freshness, extract UI elements, add mockup-comparison ACs for current mockups |
| Well-Defined Feature | Clear scope from breakdown | Query board → read requirements → create specification |
| Feature with Dependencies | Depends on other features | Read dependent specs, identify integration points, document assumptions |
| Complex Domain | Unfamiliar domain rules | Web research, document compliance, include domain glossary |

| Anti-Pattern | Why Bad | Do Instead |
|--------------|---------|------------|
| Skip board query | Missing context | Always query feature board first |
| Vague acceptance criteria | Untestable | Make criteria specific and measurable using Given/When/Then format |
| AC without GWT format | Not standardized, harder to automate | Every AC criterion MUST use GIVEN/WHEN/THEN syntax |
| Technical implementation details | Wrong focus | Focus on WHAT, not HOW |
| Ignore dependencies | Integration failures | Document all dependencies |
| Ignore mockup when provided | Missing UI requirements | Always analyze mockup_list |
| Compare against outdated mockup | Wrong ACs | Check freshness; only add ACs for current mockups |
