description: Create interactive examples for human validation. Human-initiated only — invoke ONLY when user explicitly requests a playground. Triggers on requests like \"create playground\", \"human testing\", \"interactive demo\", \"I want to test this\". Do NOT auto-suggest after feature_closing. Use when this capability is needed.

# Task-Based Skill: Human Playground

## Purpose

Execute **Human Playground** tasks by:
1. Creating runnable examples
2. Documenting usage instructions
3. Setting up and running test scenarios
4. Enabling human interaction

---

## Important Notes

⚠️ **HUMAN-INITIATED ONLY:** This skill should ONLY be invoked when the human explicitly requests a playground (e.g., "create playground", "I want to test this interactively", "set up a demo"). It is NOT part of the standard engineering pipeline. The standard pipeline ends at `feature_closing`. Agents MUST NOT auto-suggest this skill as the next step after any pipeline stage.

BLOCKING: Learn `x-ipe-workflow-task-execution` skill before executing this skill.

**Note:** If Agent does not have skill capability, go to `.github/skills/` folder to learn skills. SKILL.md is the entry point.

IMPORTANT: When `process_preference.interaction_mode == "dao-represent-human-to-interact"`, NEVER stop to ask the human. Instead, call `x-ipe-dao-end-user-representative` to get the answer. The DAO skill acts as the human representative and will provide the guidance needed to continue.

## Execution Flow

| Step | Name | Action | Gate |
|------|------|--------|------|
| 1 | Create Examples | Build runnable playground files in `playground/` | Playground file created |
| 2 | Document Usage | Add entry to `playground/README.md` | README updated |
| 3 | Create Tests | Write human simulation tests in `playground/tests/` | Test files created |
| 4 | Validate | Run playground command and verify exit code 0 | Command succeeds |
| 5 | Run Tests | Execute human simulation tests | All tests pass |
| 6 | Complete | Verify DoD, output summary, inform human playground is ready | Playground delivered |
| 7.1 | Decide Next Action | DAO-assisted next task decision | Next action decided |
| 7.2 | Execute Next Action | Load skill, generate plan, execute | Execution started |

BLOCKING: Step 4 is blocked until playground command runs without error.
BLOCKING: Step 5 is blocked until human simulation tests pass.
BLOCKING: Step 6 requires validation before Feature Closing (manual/stop_for_question: human validation; auto: skipped).

    <step_0_1>
      <name>Create Task on Board</name>
      <action>
        Call `x-ipe-tool-task-board-manager` → `task_create.py`:
        - task_type: "Human Playground"
        - description: summarize work from input context
        - status: "in_progress"
        - role: from input context

  </phase_0>

  <step_1>
    <name>Create Runnable Examples</name>
    <action>
      1. DETECT tech_stack from feature implementation files and project config
      2. TOOL SKILL ROUTING (config-filtered):
         a. DISCOVER: Scan .github/skills/x-ipe-tool-implementation-*/
         b. READ CONFIG: Read x-ipe-docs/config/tools.json → stages.feedback.human_playground
            - IF section missing/empty → config_active = false (all tools enabled)
            - ELSE → config_active = true (opt-in); force-enable general
         c. FILTER: IF config_active → only ENABLED tools participate
         d. SEMANTIC MATCH: Match tech_stack to enabled tool skill
         e. IF no match → fall back to Python defaults (.py, uv run python)
      3. DETERMINE file extension and run command from matched tool:
         - Python: ext=.py, cmd="uv run python"
         - TypeScript: ext=.ts, cmd="npx tsx"
         - JavaScript: ext=.js, cmd="node"
         - Java: ext=.java, cmd="java"
         - General: ext determined by context, cmd determined by context
      4. Create `playground/` directory if it does not exist
      5. Place playground files directly in `playground/` (no subfolders per feature)
      6. Name files as `playground_{feature_name}.{ext}` (dynamic extension)
      7. Identify key functionality to demonstrate
      8. Create minimal, self-contained runnable examples (happy path + edge cases)

      3. Keep documentation minimal - explain how to run each playground
    </action>
    <constraints>
      - CRITICAL: README must include exact run command for each playground
    </constraints>
    <output>Updated `playground/README.md`</output>
  </step_2>

  <step_3>
    <name>Create and Validate Tests</name>
    <action>
      1. Create `playground/tests/` directory for test scripts
      2. Name test files as `test_playground_{feature_name}.{ext}` (same ext as Step 1)
      3. Write tests that simulate human interaction scenarios (NOT unit tests)
      4. Tests must validate expected behavior from a human perspective
    </action>
    <constraints>
      - CRITICAL: These are human simulation tests, not unit tests
      - BLOCKING: Test file naming must follow `test_playground_{feature_name}.{ext}`

    <output>Test files in `playground/tests/`</output>
  </step_3>

  <step_4>
    <name>Validate Playground</name>
    <action>
      1. Execute playground using the run command determined in Step 1 (e.g., `uv run python`, `npx tsx`, `node`)
      2. Verify it runs without error (exit code 0)
      3. If it fails, fix the playground script or surrounding code
    </action>
    <success_criteria>
      - Playground command exits with code 0
      - No runtime errors or unhandled exceptions
    </success_criteria>
    <output>Verified working playground</output>
  </step_4>

  <step_5>
    <name>Run Tests</name>
    <action>
      1. Execute human simulation tests
      2. Verify all tests pass
      3. If tests fail, fix the playground or test scripts

         b. Log: "Workflow action status updated to done"
      2. Provide start/stop commands
      3. Include sample data
      4. Add reset capability
      5. Log outputs for debugging
      6. Inform that playground is ready for testing

        Completion gate (based on interaction_mode):
        IF process_preference.interaction_mode == "dao-represent-human-to-interact":
          → Auto-proceed after DoD verification

```xml
<definition_of_done>
  <checkpoint required="true">
    <name>Runnable examples created</name>
    <verification>Verify playground/playground_{feature_name}.{ext} exists (ext from Step 1)</verification>
  </checkpoint>
  <checkpoint required="true">
    <name>README entry added</name>
    <verification>Verify playground/README.md contains run command for this feature</verification>
  </checkpoint>
  <checkpoint required="true">
    <name>Human simulation tests created</name>
    <verification>Verify playground/tests/test_playground_{feature_name}.{ext} exists</verification>
  </checkpoint>
  <checkpoint required="true">
    <name>Playground command verified</name>
    <verification>Agent has run playground command and confirmed exit code 0</verification>
  </checkpoint>
  <checkpoint required="true">
    <name>Human simulation tests pass</name>
    <verification>Agent has executed tests and confirmed all pass</verification>
  </checkpoint>
  <checkpoint required="true">
    <name>Human can interact with feature</name>
    <verification>Start/stop commands documented and sample data included</verification>
  </checkpoint>
</definition_of_done>
```

MANDATORY: After completing this skill, return to `x-ipe-workflow-task-execution` to continue the task execution flow.

## Patterns & Anti-Patterns

### Pattern: Standard Playground Structure

**When:** Creating any playground
**Then:**
```
playground/
  README.md                               # How to run all playgrounds
  playground_{feature1}.{ext}             # Interactive playground (ext from tool skill)
  playground_{feature2}.{ext}             # Interactive playground
  tests/
    test_playground_{feature1}.{ext}      # Human simulation tests
    test_playground_{feature2}.{ext}      # Human simulation tests
```

### Pattern: API/CLI Playground

**When:** Feature exposes an API or CLI
**Then:** Same structure, include sample-data.json if needed for test data.

### Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why Bad | Do Instead |
|--------------|---------|------------|
| No instructions | Human cannot start | Write clear README |
| Hard-coded config | Does not work elsewhere | Use environment variables |
| No sample data | Nothing to test with | Provide seed data |
| Complex setup | Human gives up | Keep setup to 1-2 commands |
| No expected outputs | Human cannot tell if it works | Document what to expect |
