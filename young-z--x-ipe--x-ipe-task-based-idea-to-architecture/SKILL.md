description: Create architecture diagrams for refined ideas. Use after ideation when idea needs system architecture visualization. Generates architecture diagrams using tools from x-ipe-docs/config/tools.json (mermaid, excalidraw). Triggers on requests like "create architecture", "design system", "architecture diagram", "system design". Use when this capability is needed.

# Task-Based Skill: Idea to Architecture

## Purpose

Create architecture diagrams and system design visualizations for refined ideas by:
1. Reading the idea summary from ideation task
2. Loading architecture tools from `x-ipe-docs/config/tools.json` config
3. Creating architecture diagrams (system architecture, component diagrams, data flow)
4. Saving artifacts to the idea folder
5. Preparing for Requirement Gathering

---

## Important Notes

BLOCKING: Learn `x-ipe-workflow-task-execution` and `x-ipe-tool-task-board-manager` skills before executing this skill.

**Note:** If Agent does not have skill capability, go to `.github/skills/` folder to learn skills. SKILL.md is the entry point.

### High-Level Architecture Focus

CRITICAL: Architecture diagrams must focus on system-level design, not implementation specifics. Detailed design comes later during Technical Design.

| Focus On | Ignore |
|----------|--------|
| System components and their relationships | Implementation details (code structure) |
| Data flow between components | UI/UX design elements |
| Integration points and APIs | Visual styling and colors |
| Technology stack overview | Database schema details |
| Scalability considerations | Specific library choices |
| Security boundaries | Deployment scripts |

IMPORTANT: When `process_preference.interaction_mode == "dao-represent-human-to-interact"`, NEVER stop to ask the human. Instead, call `x-ipe-dao-end-user-representative` to get the answer. The DAO skill acts as the human representative and will provide the guidance needed to continue.

| 2. 审问之 (Inquire Thoroughly) | 2.1 | Identify Architecture Needs | Extract system components, analyze diagram requirements | Needs identified |
| 3. 慎思之 (Think Carefully) | — | SKIP | Architecture decisions are at idea level, not implementation | — |
| 4. 明辨之 (Discern Clearly) | 4.1 | Select Diagram Types | Choose diagram types and prioritize | Types selected |
| 5. 笃行之 (Practice Earnestly) | 5.1 | Create Diagrams | Generate diagrams using enabled tools | Diagrams created |
| | 5.2 | Save Artifacts | Store in `{current_idea_folder}/architecture/` | Artifacts saved |
| | 5.3 | Update Summary | Create new idea-summary version with diagram links | Summary updated |
| | 5.4 | Complete | Verify DoD, output summary | Task complete |
| 继续执行 | 6.1 | Decide Next Action | DAO-assisted next task decision | Next action decided |

BLOCKING: Step 1.1 halts if current_idea_folder is null -- ask human for folder path.
BLOCKING: Step 5.1 halts if no tools available AND human declines manual mode.
BLOCKING (manual/stop_for_question): Step 5.4 - present diagrams, ask if architecture captures the right components.

## Patterns & Anti-Patterns

### Pattern: Tool-Based Diagram Generation

**When:** Architecture tools are enabled in config
**Then:**
```
1. Use enabled tools (mermaid/excalidraw) for diagram creation
2. Generate multiple diagram types based on idea complexity
3. Save all artifacts with versioned naming
```

### Pattern: Manual Architecture Description

**When:** No tools enabled and human accepts manual mode
**Then:**
```
1. Create architecture-description.md with component listing
2. Document relationships and data flow as text
3. Save to {current_idea_folder}/architecture/
```

See [references/architecture-patterns.md](.github/skills/x-ipe-task-based-idea-to-architecture/references/architecture-patterns.md#architecture-patterns) for additional patterns (microservices, simple web app, data pipeline, no technical details).

### Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why Bad | Do Instead |
|--------------|---------|------------|
| Creating diagrams before reading idea | May miss requirements | Always analyze idea first |
| Ignoring tools.json config | Inconsistent tool usage | Always check config |
| Too much detail in initial diagrams | Overwhelms review | Start high-level, add detail if requested |
| Skipping DoD verification | May create wrong architecture | Always verify DoD checkpoints; ask specific questions in manual mode |
| Using disabled tools | Violates config rules | Only use enabled tools |
| Including implementation details | Architecture is high-level | Focus on components and relationships |
| Creating only one diagram type | May miss important views | Consider multiple perspectives |

---

## Examples

See [references/examples.md](.github/skills/x-ipe-task-based-idea-to-architecture/references/examples.md) for concrete execution examples:
- Architecture with mermaid tool enabled
- Architecture without tools (manual mode)
- Missing idea folder (blocked scenario)
- No idea summary (blocked scenario)
- Microservices architecture (complex system)
