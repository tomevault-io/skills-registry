# Task-Based Skill: Technical Design

## Purpose

Create technical design for a single feature by:
1. Querying feature board for full Feature Data Model
2. Reading feature specification document
3. Researching best practices and existing patterns
4. Creating two-part technical design document
5. NO board status update (handled by category skill)

---

## Important Notes

BLOCKING: Learn `x-ipe-workflow-task-execution` skill before executing this skill.

**Note:** If Agent does not have skill capability, go to `.github/skills/` folder to learn skills. SKILL.md is the entry point.

**BLOCKING: Single Feature Only.** This skill operates on exactly ONE feature at a time. Do NOT batch or combine multiple features in a single execution. If multiple features need processing, run this skill separately for each feature.

**Workflow Mode:** When `execution_mode == "workflow-mode"`, the completion step MUST run the workflow update script via bash: `python3 .github/skills/x-ipe-tool-x-ipe-app-interactor/scripts/workflow_update_action.py` with `workflow_name` from `workflow.name` input, `action` from `workflow.action` input, `status: "done"`, and a `deliverables` keyed dict using ONLY the extract tags defined in `workflow-template.json` for this action (format: `{"tag-name": "path/to/file"}`). Do NOT pass a flat list of file paths. Verify the script exits with code 0 before marking the task complete.

### Key Rules

- **Two-Part Document:** All technical designs use Part 1 (Agent-Facing Summary) + Part 2 (Implementation Guide). See [references/design-principles.md](.github/skills/x-ipe-task-based-technical-design/references/design-principles.md) for structure details.
- **Single File:** Maintain ONE `technical-design.md` per feature. Do NOT create versioned files. Use Version History table inside the document.
- **Design Principles:** Follow KISS, YAGNI, DRY, and 800-line module threshold. See [references/design-principles.md](.github/skills/x-ipe-task-based-technical-design/references/design-principles.md) for details.
- **Document Location:** Feature-specific at `x-ipe-docs/requirements/FEATURE-XXX/technical-design.md`; cross-feature at `x-ipe-docs/architecture/technical-designs/{component}.md`.
- **Templates:** See [references/design-templates.md](.github/skills/x-ipe-task-based-technical-design/references/design-templates.md) for full document template, Part 1/Part 2 guidelines, dependency table format, mockup reference guidelines, and diagram examples.

### Mockup List Loading

When `mockup_list` input is needed, resolve in this order:
1. Previous Idea Mockup task's `task_output_links`
2. Human-provided explicit path
3. Feature specification's "Linked Mockups" section
4. Idea summary's "Mockups & Prototypes" section
5. Default: N/A

MANDATORY: When mockup_list is provided AND scope includes [Frontend] or [Full Stack], the agent MUST open, analyze, extract UI requirements, and reference mockups in Part 2.

IMPORTANT: When `process_preference.interaction_mode == "dao-represent-human-to-interact"`, NEVER stop to ask the human. Instead, call `x-ipe-dao-end-user-representative` to get the answer. The DAO skill acts as the human representative and will provide the guidance needed to continue.

```

### Input Initialization

```xml
<input_init>
  <field name="task_id" source="x-ipe-tool-task-board-manager (auto-generated)" />
  <field name="execution_mode" source="x-ipe-workflow-task-execution (from --workflow-mode@{name})" />
  <field name="workflow.name" source="x-ipe-workflow-task-execution (from --workflow-mode@{name})" />
  <field name="process_preference.interaction_mode" source="from caller (x-ipe-workflow-task-execution) or default 'interact-with-human'" />
  <field name="feature_id" source="previous task | task board | human input">
    <steps>
      1. Check previous task (Feature Refinement) output for feature_id
      2. If not available, query task board for current feature context
      3. If still unresolved, ask human for feature_id
    </steps>
  </field>
  <field name="extra_context_reference.specification" source="workflow context | auto-detect">
    <steps>
      1. If workflow-mode: read from workflow context extra_context_reference.specification
      2. If free-mode or auto-detect: resolve from x-ipe-docs/requirements/{feature_id}/specification.md
      3. Default: N/A
    </steps>
  </field>
  <field name="mockup_list" source="previous task | human input | N/A">
    <steps>
      1. IF previous task was "Feature Refinement" → use previous task output's mockup_list field (or derive from linked_mockups)
      2. ELIF human provides explicit mockup links → use human-provided value
      3. ELSE → set to N/A
    </steps>
  </field>
</input_init>
```

> **Note on `program_type` and `tech_stack`:** These fields are **determined during Step 5** (not provided as input). The agent identifies them from the design decisions and includes them in the Output Result for downstream skills.

## Execution Flow

| Phase | Steps | Action | Gate |
|-------|-------|--------|------|
| 1. 博学之 — Study Broadly | 1.1 Query Feature Board, 1.2 Read Specification | Load feature data, read specification | Full context gathered |
| 2. 审问之 — Inquire Thoroughly | 2.1 Reference Architecture, 2.2 Research Best Practices | Check existing patterns, research libraries and best practices | Research complete |
| 3. 慎思之 — Think Carefully | 3.1 Create Technical Design Document | Write two-part technical design document | Design written |
| 4. 明辨之 — Discern Clearly | 4.1 Self-Critique Design | AI validates design against spec; escalates ONLY specific unresolvable conflicts | Design validated |
| 5. 笃行之 — Practice Earnestly | 5.1 Complete | Verify DoD, update workflow, output summary | Task complete |
| 继续执行 | 6.1 | Decide Next Action | Next action decided |
| 继续执行 | 6.2 | Execute Next Action | Execution started |

BLOCKING: Phase 1 fails if feature not on board or status not "Done Feature Refinement".
BLOCKING (manual/stop_for_question): Phase 4 - present design, ask if architecture decisions are correct before Code Implementation.
BLOCKING (auto): Proceed automatically after DoD verification.

## Patterns & Anti-Patterns

| Pattern | When | Key Actions |
|---------|------|-------------|
| API-Based | REST/GraphQL endpoints | Focus Part 2 on API spec, request/response schemas, auth, sequence diagrams |
| Background Service | Background process | Fault tolerance, retry/backoff, monitoring points, state diagrams |
| UI-Heavy | Primarily frontend | Component architecture, state management, mockup references (mockup = source of truth) |

| Anti-Pattern | Why Bad | Do Instead |
|--------------|---------|------------|
| Over-engineering | Wasted effort | Apply KISS principle |
| Future-proofing | YAGNI violation | Design for current needs |
| No research | Reinventing wheels | Research existing solutions |
| Monolithic design | Hard to change | Design modular components |
| Missing workflows | Hard to understand | Always include Mermaid diagrams |
| No tags | Hard for AI to find | Always add searchable tags |
