# X-IPE Brand Theme Creator

## Purpose

Transform brand colors, typography preferences, and style guidelines into a complete theme package by:
1. Extracting brand identity from web links, images, or text descriptions
2. Deriving a full color palette from minimal input (one accent color minimum)
3. Extracting basic UI component patterns (buttons, cards, inputs, links, badges, navigation) when visible in source material
4. Generating `design-system.md` with structured token definitions for AI agents
5. Generating `component-visualization.html` with visual preview and JSON-LD

---

## About

This meta skill produces theme packages consumed by the X-IPE theme system. Each theme lives in its own directory and contains two files: a markdown design system for agent consumption and an HTML visualization for human review.

### Key Concepts

- **Design System** - Structured token definitions (colors, typography, spacing, shadows, component specs) in markdown
- **Component Visualization** - Self-contained HTML file with CSS variables, visual previews, and JSON-LD structured data
- **Color Derivation** - Algorithmic expansion of a single accent color into a full palette using Tailwind CSS scales
- **Component Extraction** - Identification and extraction of UI component patterns (button styles, card layouts, input treatments, link behaviors) from source materials, with sensible defaults as fallback

### Scope

```yaml
operates_on:
  - "Theme packages in x-ipe-docs/themes/theme-{name}/"
  - "Design tokens (colors, typography, spacing, radius, shadows)"
  - "UI component patterns (buttons, cards, inputs, links, badges, navigation)"

does_not_handle:
  - "Application-level CSS or component library code"
  - "Runtime theme switching logic"
  - "Complex component interactions or JavaScript behavior"
```

## Important Notes

BLOCKING: Output location is `x-ipe-docs/themes/theme-{name}/`. The folder name MUST start with `theme-` prefix (e.g., `theme-bilibili`, `theme-ocean`). The `ThemesService` only discovers folders with this prefix — folders without it will NOT appear in the Toolbox.

CRITICAL: Both `design-system.md` and `component-visualization.html` must be generated. Never produce only one file.

CRITICAL: Minimum input is one accent/brand color. All other tokens can be derived. See [references/color-derivation.md](.github/skills/x-ipe-tool-brand-theme-creator/references/color-derivation.md).

CRITICAL: If the user provides a theme name without the `theme-` prefix, prepend it automatically (e.g., user says "bilibili-brand" → folder is `theme-bilibili-brand`).

CRITICAL: Component extraction is best-effort. If the source material has no visible UI components, fall back to derived defaults from [references/component-extraction.md](.github/skills/x-ipe-tool-brand-theme-creator/references/component-extraction.md). Never block theme generation because components couldn't be extracted.

**Note:** If Agent does not have skill capability, go to `.github/skills/` folder to learn skills. SKILL.md is the entry point.

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why Bad | Do Instead |
|--------------|---------|------------|
| Blocking theme generation on failed component extraction | Theme can still be fully usable with derived defaults | Fall back to defaults, note in output metadata |
| Generating only one file (design-system.md without visualization, or vice versa) | Consumers expect both files; partial output breaks theme discovery | Always generate both files together |
| Using RGB/HSL color values in tokens | Inconsistent format breaks downstream parsing | Convert all colors to hex format |
| Leaving `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` strings in generated output | Broken rendering and JSON-LD parsing failures | Verify all placeholders replaced before writing files |
| Skipping user confirmation step | Users may reject extracted colors, causing rework | Always present palette and get confirmation first |
| Omitting `theme-` prefix from folder name | `ThemesService` won't discover the theme | Auto-prepend prefix if missing |

## Input Parameters

<input_init>
  1. Read `theme_name` and `accent_color` from user request (required).
  2. Determine `source_type` from context: if URL → `web_link`, if image path → `image`, if descriptive text → `text_description`, if hex only → `direct`.
  3. Set `extract_components` to `true` unless user explicitly opts out.
  4. Apply defaults for all optional parameters not provided by user.
</input_init>

```yaml
input:
  # Primary inputs
  theme_name: "kebab-case name without 'theme-' prefix (e.g., ocean, corporate)"
  accent_color: "hex color value (e.g., #3b82f6) OR derived from source"

  # Input source (one of)
  source_type: "web_link | image | text_description | direct"
  source_value: "URL, image path, or text description"

  # Optional overrides (with defaults)
  primary_color: "derived: darken accent by 40%"
  secondary_color: "derived: desaturate + darken by 20%"
  neutral_color: "derived: very light tint of accent"
  heading_font: "Inter"
  body_font: "system-ui"
  code_font: "JetBrains Mono"
  border_radius_md: "8px"
  extract_components: "true (default) — whether to extract UI component patterns from source"
```

For detailed extraction procedures per source type, see [references/input-sources.md](.github/skills/x-ipe-tool-brand-theme-creator/references/input-sources.md).

## Execution Procedure

```xml
<procedure name="brand-theme-creator">
  <execute_dor_checks_before_starting/>
  <schedule_dod_checks_with_sub_agent_before_starting/>

  <step_1>
    <name>Extract Brand Identity</name>
    <action>
      1. Determine input source type (web link, image, text, or direct hex)
      2. Extract colors based on source type:
         IF source_type = web_link: use web_fetch to retrieve page, extract from CSS variables, meta tags, header/nav/CTA colors
         ELSE IF source_type = image: use vision capabilities to identify dominant + accent colors by area coverage
         ELSE IF source_type = text_description: parse brand adjectives, map to color direction and typography per interpretation guide
         ELSE: use provided hex values directly
      3. Map extracted values to theme tokens (primary, secondary, accent, neutral)
      4. IF extract_components == true AND source provides visible UI patterns:
         Extract component patterns per source type (see references/component-extraction.md):
         - Buttons: background, border-radius, padding, font-weight, hover style
         - Cards: border, shadow, padding, border-radius
         - Form inputs: border, border-radius, padding, focus ring style
         - Links: color, hover color, underline behavior, transition
         - Badges: background, padding, border-radius, font-size
         - Navigation: height, background, padding, item spacing
      5. Record which components were extracted vs which need defaults
    </action>
    <constraints>
      - BLOCKING: For web links, always use web_fetch — never guess colors
      - CRITICAL: Extract hex values only; no RGB or HSL in theme tokens
      - Component extraction is best-effort; missing components use defaults from Step 3
    </constraints>
    <output>Extracted color values and component patterns mapped to theme token roles</output>
  </step_1>

  <step_2>
    <name>Confirm with User</name>
    <action>
      1. Present extracted/interpreted colors to user
      2. IF components were extracted: present component findings summary (e.g., "Found: rounded buttons with 12px radius, elevated cards with large shadow")
      3. Ask for theme name if not already provided
      4. Validate theme name: IF name does not start with "theme-", prepend "theme-" prefix
      5. Offer customization options (typography, border radius, component overrides)
    </action>
    <constraints>
      - BLOCKING: Do not proceed to generation without user confirmation
      - BLOCKING: Final folder name MUST start with "theme-" prefix. Auto-prepend if missing.
    </constraints>
    <output>Confirmed color palette, component patterns, and configuration</output>
  </step_2>

  <step_3>
    <name>Derive Full Palette + Components</name>
    <action>
      1. Apply color derivation rules for any unspecified tokens
      2. Select appropriate Tailwind neutral scale (slate, gray, zinc, stone, etc.)
      3. Resolve semantic colors (success=#22c55e, warning=#f59e0b, error=#ef4444, info=#3b82f6)
      4. Compute accent variants (light bg at 10% opacity, focus ring at 15% opacity)
      5. Verify contrast ratios: primary/secondary on white >= 4.5:1, accent on white >= 3:1
      6. For each component type NOT extracted in Step 1, apply defaults from references/component-extraction.md:
         - Buttons: use accent color, border-radius from radius_md, standard padding
         - Cards: use neutral scale borders, standard shadow, 24px padding
         - Inputs: use neutral scale borders, radius_md, standard padding
         - Links: use accent color, darken on hover
         - Badges: use accent light bg, small radius, compact padding
         - Navigation: derive from primary color and heading font
      7. Merge extracted components with derived defaults (extracted values take precedence)
    </action>
    <output>Complete token set with all colors, typography, spacing, radius, shadows, and component specs</output>
  </step_3>

  <step_4>
    <name>Generate design-system.md</name>
    <action>
      1. Load template from templates/design-system-template.md
      2. Fill all token sections: colors, typography, spacing, radius, shadows
      3. Fill component specs section with extracted or derived values for:
         buttons, cards, form inputs, links, badges, navigation
      4. Add CSS variables block including component-level variables
    </action>
    <output>Completed design-system.md content</output>
  </step_4>

  <step_5>
    <name>Generate component-visualization.html</name>
    <action>
      1. Load template from templates/component-visualization-template.html
      2. Replace all {{PLACEHOLDERS}} with resolved token values
      3. Include JSON-LD structured data block with all tokens (including component specs)
      4. Verify no unreplaced placeholder strings remain
    </action>
    <constraints>
      - BLOCKING: All placeholders must be replaced; see references/template-placeholders.md
      - CRITICAL: JSON-LD block must be present for AI parsing
    </constraints>
    <output>Completed component-visualization.html content</output>
  </step_5>

  <step_6>
    <name>Create Theme Folder</name>
    <action>
      1. Verify theme name starts with "theme-" prefix. If not, prepend it.
      2. Create directory x-ipe-docs/themes/theme-{name}/
      3. Write design-system.md
      4. Write component-visualization.html
    </action>
    <constraints>
      - BLOCKING: Folder name MUST match pattern "theme-{name}". ThemesService rejects folders without this prefix.
    </constraints>
    <output>Theme directory with both files on disk</output>
  </step_6>

  <step_7>
    <name>Validate</name>
    <action>
      1. Confirm theme directory exists with both files
      2. Verify no {{PLACEHOLDER}} strings remain in generated files
      3. Verify JSON-LD block is present in HTML file
      4. Check that theme appears in /api/themes response
      5. Test that 4 color swatches display correctly
      6. Verify component specs section has at least buttons, cards, and inputs
    </action>
    <success_criteria>
      - Both files exist at correct path
      - No unreplaced placeholders
      - Theme discoverable by API
      - Component specs present with at least 3 component types
    </success_criteria>
    <output>Validated theme package</output>
  </step_7>
