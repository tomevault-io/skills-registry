# Frontend Design

## Purpose

AI Agents follow this skill to create frontend interfaces that:
1. Deliver production-grade, functional UI with distinctive aesthetics
2. Integrate with the X-IPE theme system for brand consistency
3. Avoid generic "AI slop" patterns (overused fonts, cliched color schemes, predictable layouts)

---

## Important Notes

BLOCKING: Load the selected theme from `x-ipe-docs/config/tools.json` BEFORE any design work.
CRITICAL: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work -- the key is intentionality, not intensity.
CRITICAL: NEVER use generic AI aesthetics: Inter/Roboto/Arial fonts, purple gradients on white, cookie-cutter layouts. Every design must be unique and context-specific.

## About

This tool creates self-contained HTML/CSS/JS frontends with exceptional aesthetic quality. It reads the X-IPE theme system for design tokens (colors, typography, spacing) and applies them creatively to produce memorable, polished interfaces.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Design Tokens** - CSS variables sourced from the theme's `design-system.md` (colors, fonts, spacing, radii, shadows)
- **Aesthetic Direction** - A deliberate visual tone (brutalist, art deco, editorial, organic, etc.) chosen per-project to avoid sameness
- **Theme Integration** - Reading the selected theme config and mapping its tokens to CSS custom properties

---

## When to Use

```yaml
triggers:
  - "build landing page"
  - "create dashboard UI"
  - "design web component"
  - "create mockup"
  - "style this page"
  - "beautify the UI"
  - "create HTML artifact"
  - "build a poster"

not_for:
  - "generate architecture diagram (use tool-architecture-draw)"
  - "create presentation slides (use pptx skill)"
```

## Input Parameters

```yaml
input:
  operation: "design"
  context:

```

## Operations

### Operation: Load Theme

**When:** Always -- before any design work begins.

```xml
<operation name="load_theme">
  <action>
    1. Read theme name: `cat x-ipe-docs/config/tools.json | jq '.["selected-theme"]["theme-name"]'`
    2. Read theme path: `cat x-ipe-docs/config/tools.json | jq -r '.["selected-theme"]["theme-folder-path"]'`
    3. Load design system: `cat "${theme_path}/design-system.md"`
    4. Extract tokens into this mapping:
       - Color Palette (Primary, Secondary, Accent, Neutral) --> --color-{name}
       - Typography (Font Families) --> --font-heading, --font-body
       - Spacing section --> --space-{size}
       - Border Radius section --> --radius-{size}
       - Shadows section --> --shadow-{size}
  </action>
  <constraints>
    - BLOCKING: Theme must be loaded before any design decisions
    - The theme provides the palette; the agent uses it CREATIVELY
  </constraints>
  <output>Design tokens ready for CSS custom properties</output>
</operation>
```

### Operation: Design Thinking

**When:** After theme is loaded, before writing any code.

```xml
<operation name="design_thinking">
  <action>
    1. Identify PURPOSE: What problem does the interface solve? Who uses it?
    2. Choose TONE: Pick a deliberate aesthetic direction -- brutally minimal, maximalist chaos,
       retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine,
       brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, or another direction.
    3. Note CONSTRAINTS: Framework, performance, accessibility requirements.
    4. Define DIFFERENTIATION: The one memorable element someone will recall.
  </action>
  <constraints>
    - BLOCKING: Must commit to a clear direction before coding
    - Never converge on common choices (Space Grotesk, etc.) across generations
    - Vary between light/dark themes, fonts, and aesthetics across projects
  </constraints>
  <output>Aesthetic direction document (mental model for implementation)</output>
</operation>
```

### Operation: Implement Frontend

**When:** After design direction is established.

```xml
<operation name="implement_frontend">
  <action>
    1. Create self-contained HTML with theme tokens as CSS custom properties in :root
    2. Apply aesthetic guidelines:
       - TYPOGRAPHY: Distinctive, characterful font choices. Pair a display font with a refined body font.
         Use theme fonts as base; add complementary display fonts for creative impact.
       - COLOR: Commit to a cohesive palette via CSS variables. Dominant colors with sharp accents
         outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes. Use theme colors boldly.
       - MOTION: CSS-only animations for HTML; Motion library for React. Focus on high-impact moments:
         orchestrated page load with staggered reveals, scroll-triggering, surprising hover states.
       - SPATIAL COMPOSITION: Unexpected layouts, asymmetry, overlap, diagonal flow, grid-breaking
         elements, generous negative space OR controlled density.
       - BACKGROUNDS: Create atmosphere and depth -- gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns,
         layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, grain overlays.
    3. Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision:
       - Maximalist designs need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects
       - Minimalist designs need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing and typography
    4. Write to the appropriate output location
  </action>
  <constraints>
    - BLOCKING: Code must be production-grade and functional
    - CRITICAL: Every output must be visually striking, cohesive, and meticulously refined
  </constraints>
  <output>Self-contained HTML file with embedded CSS/JS</output>
</operation>
```

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Resolution |
|-------|-------|------------|
| `THEME_CONFIG_MISSING` | `x-ipe-docs/config/tools.json` not found | Create config with default theme or prompt user to run project init |
| `DESIGN_SYSTEM_MISSING` | `design-system.md` not found at theme path | Fall back to `x-ipe-docs/themes/theme-default/design-system.md` |
| `THEME_TOKENS_INCOMPLETE` | Design system missing required token sections | Use sensible defaults for missing tokens; log warning |
