# Task Execution Guideline

## Purpose

Orchestrate a multi-skill workflow for development tasks by:

1. **Plan** - Match requests to task-based skills and create tasks on board
2. **Verify** - Check prerequisites via Global DoR gate
3. **Execute** - Load and run task-based skills for core work
4. **Close** - Update boards via category-based skill loading
5. **Validate** - Confirm completion via Global DoD checks
6. **Route** - Chain to next task if auto-proceed enabled

---

## Important Notes

BLOCKING: Tasks MUST be created via x-ipe-tool-task-board-manager BEFORE any work begins. Step 2 will reject tasks not found on the board.

CRITICAL: This skill does NOT implement task logic itself — it coordinates task-based skills and category skills.

MANDATORY: NEVER use `manage_todo_list` (VS Code internal) as substitute for the JSON task board (project tracking).

**Note:** If Agent does not have skill capability, go to `.github/skills/` folder to learn skills. SKILL.md is the entry point for each skill.

IMPORTANT: When `process_preference.interaction_mode == "dao-represent-human-to-interact"`, NEVER stop to ask the human. Instead, call `x-ipe-dao-end-user-representative` to get the answer. The DAO skill acts as the human representative and will provide the guidance needed to continue. When `manual` or `stop_for_question`, always wait for human feedback before proceeding to the next task.

  <field name="closing.category_level_change_summary" source="From category skill output (or null if skipped)" />
</input_init>
```

### Git Strategy

BLOCKING: At the start of every workflow execution, read `.x-ipe.yaml` from project root to determine `git.strategy` and `git.main-branch`. If `.x-ipe.yaml` does not exist or `git.strategy` is not specified, default to `main-branch-only`. If `git.main-branch` is not specified, auto-detect the main branch from git (see Step 2 procedure). Pass these values to all task-based skills that interact with git.

| Strategy | Branch Model | PR Required? | Description |
|----------|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| `main-branch-only` | Work directly on main branch | No | All commits go to main. No feature branches created. |
| `dev-session-based` | `dev/{git_user_name}` branch per developer | Yes, on feature close | Each developer works on their own persistent branch. PR to main when a feature is closed. |

See [references/examples.md](.github/skills/x-ipe-workflow-task-execution/references/examples.md) for detailed strategy rules and git identity validation.

### Category Derivation

BLOCKING: Category is read from the skill's own Output Result section (`category` field). Do NOT hardcode category mappings.

**Auto-discovery rule:** Load `.github/skills/x-ipe-task-based-{name}/SKILL.md` → read `category` from Output Result YAML block.

### Category to Closing Skill Mapping

| Category | Closing Skill | Required? |
|----------|--------------|-----------|
| feature-stage | x-ipe-tool-task-board-manager | Yes |
| ideation-stage | (none) | N/A |
| requirement-stage | (none) | N/A |
| code-refactoring-stage | x-ipe+feature+quality-board-management | No (optional) |
| Standalone | (none) | N/A |

### Task States

| State | Terminal? | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| `pending` | No | Created, waiting to start |
| `in_progress` | No | Currently being worked on |
| `blocked` | No | Waiting for dependency |
| `deferred` | No | Human paused |
| `completed` | Yes | Successfully done |
| `cancelled` | Yes | Stopped |

### Valid State Transitions

```
pending → in_progress
in_progress → completed | blocked | deferred | cancelled
blocked → in_progress
deferred → in_progress
```

## Execution Flow Summary

| Step | Name | Action | Mandatory Output | Next Step |
|------|------|--------|------------------|-----------|
| 1 | Planning | Match request, create task(s) on board | Tasks visible via task board query | → Step 2 |
| 2 | Global DoR | Verify prerequisites | All checks pass | → Step 3 (pass) or STOP (fail) |
| 3 | Execute | Load task-based skill, do work | Skill output collected | → Step 4 |
| 4 | Closing | Load category skills, update boards | Boards updated | → Step 5 |
| 5 | Global DoD | Validate, output summary | Summary displayed | → Step 6 (pass) or STOP (manual) |
| 6 | 继续执行（Continue Execute） | Resolve process_preference mode, route next | Next action decided | → Step 1 (auto) or WAIT for human (manual/stop_for_question) |

BLOCKING: Step 1 → Step 2: task must be created via x-ipe-tool-task-board-manager.
BLOCKING: Step 3 → Step 4: x-ipe-tool-task-board-manager skill must be loaded.
BLOCKING: Step 4 → Step 5: task board must be updated via x-ipe-tool-task-board-manager.

## Execution Procedure

```xml
<procedure name="x-ipe-workflow-task-execution">
  <execute_dor_checks_before_starting/>
  <schedule_dod_checks_with_sub_agent_before_starting/>

  <step_1>
    <name>Task Planning</name>
    <trigger>Receive work request from human or system</trigger>
    <actions>
      1. Resolve execution_mode and workflow.name from instruction prefix (see Input Initialization)
      2. Match request to task-based skill using auto-discovery (scan `.github/skills/x-ipe-task-based-*/SKILL.md` descriptions)
         See references/examples.md for request matching patterns.
      3. Derive category from skill's Output Result `category` field
      4. Check task:
         - IF task not exists → Create with status: pending
         - ELSE IF exists AND assigned to you → Continue
         - ELSE → STOP
      5. MANDATORY: Load x-ipe-tool-task-board-manager skill to create/update tasks on board
         → This step CANNOT be skipped
         → Tasks MUST appear on board BEFORE proceeding to Step 2
      6. IF task-based skill defines next_task_based_skill → Create ALL chained tasks upfront
      7. VERIFICATION: Confirm all tasks are visible on task board before proceeding
    </actions>
    <output>Task Data Model with core fields populated AND tasks created on board</output>
    <gate>All tasks visible via task board query</gate>
  </step_1>

  <step_2>
    <name>Check Global DoR</name>
    <actions>
      GATE CHECK: This step validates that Step 1 was completed correctly.

      1. Query task board via x-ipe-tool-task-board-manager (task_query.py)
      2. Search for {task_id} in Active Tasks section
      3. IF task NOT found:
         → STOP execution
         → Log: "Task {task_id} not found on board. Returning to Step 1."
         → Return to Step 1 and create task on board
      4. IF task found but status is not pending/blocked:
         → STOP execution
         → Log: "Task {task_id} has invalid status for starting: {status}"
      5. Verify git repository:
         IF not a git repository:
           CALL x-ipe-tool-git-version-control skill: operation=init
           CALL x-ipe-tool-git-version-control skill: operation=create_gitignore

      6. Resolve git.strategy and git.main_branch (see Input Initialization)

      7. Apply git strategy:
         IF git.strategy == "main-branch-only":
           → Ensure on main branch: git checkout {main_branch}
           → Do NOT create any other branches
         ELSE IF git.strategy == "dev-session-based":
           → BLOCKING: Validate git identity first:
             Run: git config user.name AND git config user.email
             KNOWN_PLACEHOLDERS = ["Your Name", "your name", "you@example.com", ""]
             IF user.name IN KNOWN_PLACEHOLDERS OR user.email IN KNOWN_PLACEHOLDERS OR user.name is empty:
               → STOP: Ask user "Your git user.name is '{user.name}' which appears to be a placeholder. Please provide your actual name for the dev branch."
               → Do NOT proceed until user provides valid identity
               → After user provides name: run git config user.name "{provided_name}" (and git config user.email if needed)
           → Resolve dev branch name from git identity:
             Run: git config user.name (or git config user.email if empty)
             Sanitize: lowercase, spaces→hyphens, remove special chars
             Branch name: dev/{sanitized_git_user_name}
           → Check if branch dev/{git_user_name} exists
           → IF not exists: git checkout -b dev/{git_user_name} (from main)
           → IF exists: git checkout dev/{git_user_name}
           → Pull latest: git pull origin dev/{git_user_name} (ignore if remote doesn't exist yet)
    </actions>
    <on_failure>STOP and report missing prerequisites</on_failure>
    <on_success>Transition task status: pending → in_progress</on_success>

  <step_3>
    <name>Task Work Execution</name>
    <actions>
      1. Load task-based skill: x-ipe-task-based-{task_based_skill}
      2. Pass Task Data Model to skill, including execution_mode and workflow.name
      3. Check task-based skill DoR (defined in skill)
      4. Execute core work (defined in skill)
      5. Check task-based skill DoD (defined in skill)
      6. Collect skill output into Task Data Model
    </actions>
    <skill_output_contract>
      Each task-based skill MUST return:

      2. IF category != "Standalone":
         TRY:

           → Continue without error (category_level_change_summary = null)
    </actions>
    <category_skill_mapping>
      Refer to "Category to Closing Skill Mapping" in the Category Derivation section above.
    </category_skill_mapping>
    <note>If category skill not found, execution continues without error. Category-level change summary will be null if skipped.</note>

    <gate>task board updated via x-ipe-tool-task-board-manager</gate>
  </step_4>

  <step_5>
    <name>Check Global DoD</name>
    <actions>
      1. Validate:
         - Task status updated on task board
         - Category-level changes committed (if applicable)
         - All task-based skill DoD met
         - Changes committed to git (if files were created/modified)

      2. Git Commit Check:
         IF task_output_links is NOT empty AND files were created/modified:
           CALL x-ipe-tool-git-version-control skill: operation=add, files=null (stage all)
           CALL x-ipe-tool-git-version-control skill: operation=commit, task_data={task_id, task_description, feature_id}
         OPTIONAL: IF auto_push = true:
           CALL x-ipe-tool-git-version-control skill: operation=push

      3. Workflow Status Verification:
         IF execution_mode == "workflow-mode" AND completed skill's task_completion_output contains workflow_action field:
           a. Extract workflow_name and workflow_action from output
           b. READ instance/workflows/wf-{nnn}-{workflow_name}.json
           c. CHECK that actions.{workflow_action}.status is NOT "pending"
           d. IF status is "pending" → FLAG task as incomplete: "Workflow action '{workflow_action}' status not updated. Run `python3 .github/skills/x-ipe-tool-x-ipe-app-interactor/scripts/workflow_update_action.py` before completing."
           e. CHECK that actions.{workflow_action}.deliverables is a keyed dict (not a list). Keys must match extract tags from workflow-template.json for this action.
           f. IF workflow JSON file not found → WARN and skip (non-blocking)
         ELSE IF execution_mode == "free-mode":
           → Skip workflow status verification

      4. Auto-Proceed Freshness Check:
         Re-read the current process_preference.interaction_mode value from its source:
           - workflow-mode: from workflow-{name}.json global.process_preference
           - free-mode: from CLI flag or user message
         IF the value has changed since Step 2 → update process_preference.interaction_mode for Step 6 routing.

      5. Human Review Check (mode-aware):
         IF process_preference.interaction_mode == "dao-represent-human-to-interact":
           → Skip human review, proceed directly
         ELIF process_preference.interaction_mode == "dao-represent-human-to-interact-for-questions-in-skill" OR "manual":
           → Output summary and STOP for human review

    <name>继续执行（Continue Execute）</name>
    <actions>
      NOTE: Each task-based skill now includes its own &lt;routing&gt; phase at the end.
      The task-based skill's routing phase passes the full task_completion_output to
      x-ipe-dao-end-user-representative for context-rich routing decisions.

      This step acts as a fallback/coordinator:

      IF task-based skill already executed its &lt;routing&gt; phase:
        → Routing decision was already made with full skill output context
        → Follow the routing decision (next task or stop)
        → If routing to next task → Start from Step 1 (Planning)

      ELSE IF routing was not handled by the task-based skill:
        IF next_task_based_skill EXISTS:
          IF process_preference.interaction_mode == "dao-represent-human-to-interact":
            → Invoke x-ipe-dao-end-user-representative with:
              type: "routing"
              completed_skill_output: {full task_completion_output YAML}
              next_task_based_skill: "{from output}"
              context: "Skill completed. Study the full output to decide best next action."
            → IF multiple next_actions_suggested (workflow-mode):
                invoke x-ipe-dao-end-user-representative (type: routing) to choose
            → Start execution from Step 1 (Planning — to create/verify task on board)
          ELIF process_preference.interaction_mode == "dao-represent-human-to-interact-for-questions-in-skill":
            → Invoke x-ipe-dao-end-user-representative with same context
            → Present DAO's recommendation to human and wait for confirmation
          ELSE (interact-with-human):
            → Present next task suggestion to human using the skill-specific hint template
              (each skill defines its own contextual hint in its routing phase)
            → For feature-stage skills: always name the specific feature ID and the next pipeline step
            → After feature-closing: suggest the next unstarted feature from backlog, or celebrate completion if all done
            → Wait for human instruction
        ELSE:
          → STOP (no next task defined)
    </actions>
    <constraints>
      - BLOCKING (manual/stop_for_question): Human MUST confirm or redirect before routing to next task
      - BLOCKING (auto): Proceed automatically; resolve routing ambiguity via x-ipe-dao-end-user-representative
      - DAO receives full task_completion_output for context-aware routing decisions

## Task-Based Skills Auto-Discovery

BLOCKING: Do NOT maintain a hardcoded registry. Skills are auto-discovered.

**Discovery rule:**
1. Scan `.github/skills/x-ipe-task-based-*/SKILL.md`
2. Each skill's Output Result YAML declares: `category`, `next_task_based_skill`, `process_preference.interaction_mode`
3. Each skill's `description` in frontmatter contains trigger keywords for request matching

**Request matching:**
1. Read the `description` field from each `x-ipe-task-based-*/SKILL.md` frontmatter
2. Match user request against trigger keywords (e.g., "fix bug" matches `x-ipe-task-based-bug-fix`)
3. See [references/examples.md](.github/skills/x-ipe-workflow-task-execution/references/examples.md) for common request-to-skill patterns

> **Note:** When `process_preference.interaction_mode` is `dao-represent-human-to-interact` or `dao-represent-human-to-interact-for-questions-in-skill`, human review at skill completion is handled by the mode-aware gate in Step 5. In `dao-represent-human-to-interact` mode, review is skipped entirely. In `dao-represent-human-to-interact-for-questions-in-skill` mode, review still stops for human approval.
