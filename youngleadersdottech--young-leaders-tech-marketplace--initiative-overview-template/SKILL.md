# Initiative Overview Template

## Purpose
This template guides the creation of initiative overview skills - strategic information about cross-functional initiatives that span multiple products, teams, or projects. These skills ensure coordinated work and shared understanding across organizational boundaries. Replace all `[PLACEHOLDER]` values with actual initiative information.

## SKILL.md Frontmatter Template

```yaml

name: [initiative-slug]-overview
description: Initiative overview for [INITIATIVE_NAME] including goals, timeline, and cross-team coordination when discussing [WORK_STREAM_1], [WORK_STREAM_2], or [DELIVERABLE]. Auto-invoke when user mentions [INITIATIVE_NAME], [KEY_MILESTONE], or [INVOLVED_TEAM]. Do NOT load for general [DOMAIN] discussions unrelated to this initiative.

**Description Engineering Guidance**:

✅ **DO** include:
- Initiative name and key work streams
- Specific deliverables or milestones
- Teams or products involved
- Trigger terms people use when discussing this initiative

❌ **DON'T** use:
- Generic descriptions ("Cross-team project...")
- No scope boundaries (will load for unrelated work)
- Missing team or product context

**Example Good Description**:
```
Initiative overview for Pricing Innovation including flexible leasing, custom rate cards, and dynamic pricing when discussing payment options, merchant pricing, or revenue optimization. Auto-invoke when user mentions Pricing Innovation, flexible leasing, or custom rates. Do NOT load for general pricing discussions outside this initiative.
```

## Usage Examples

**Creating New Initiative Overview Skill**:
```
User: "Create an initiative overview skill for the Pricing Innovation initiative"

Claude: [Loads this template skill, uses structure to create Pricing Innovation-specific overview]
```

**Coordination Check**:
```
User: "Are we coordinating with the payments team on flexible leasing?"

Claude: [Loads initiative overview skill, checks cross-team coordination section]
Response: "Yes, payments team is involved in Work Stream 2 (Technical Integration) with responsibility for payment processing hooks. Their contact point is #pricing-innovation-eng channel."
```

**Dependency Tracking**:
```
User: "What's blocking the custom rate cards feature?"

Claude: [Loads initiative overview skill, checks dependencies and blockers]
Response: "Custom rate cards has external dependency on billing system API update (owned by Platform team, status: In Progress). If delayed, impact is Q2 launch at risk. Mitigation: parallel development with mock API."
```

**Do NOT Use This Template For**:
- Single-team projects (use project skills instead)
- Product-specific work (use product context template)
- Technical specifications (use ground truth template)
- Completed initiatives (archive or mark as historical reference)

## Maintenance & Freshness

**Update Triggers**:
- Weekly during active initiative (status updates)
- After major milestones
- When decisions made by steering committee
- When risks or blockers change
- Phase transitions

**Review Cadence**:
- **Status/Blockers**: Weekly
- **Risks/Dependencies**: Bi-weekly
- **Goals/Timeline**: Monthly
- **Scope/Charter**: Only on major changes

**Archival Process**:
When initiative completes:
1. Update `initiative-status` to `COMPLETED`
2. Add final retrospective section
3. Document final metrics vs. targets
4. Move to historical reference location
5. Link to any ongoing work that continues

**Version Control**:
- Update `last-updated` date frequently during active phase
- Track major decisions in git commits
- Reference milestone completions in commit messages
