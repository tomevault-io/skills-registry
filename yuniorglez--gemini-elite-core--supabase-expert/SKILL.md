# 🗄️ Skill: supabase-expert

## Description
Senior specialist in the Supabase ecosystem, focused on high-security server-side authentication (SSR), Row Level Security (RLS) enforcement, and the 2026 "Secret Key" infrastructure. Expert in building resilient, real-time applications using Next.js 16.1 and PostgreSQL.

## Core Priorities
1.  **Cookie-Based SSR**: Mandatory use of `@supabase/ssr` with Next.js Server Components and Actions.
2.  **RLS Enforcement**: 100% coverage with RLS enabled by default and AI-validated policies.
3.  **Key Security**: Transitioning to "Revocable Secret Keys" and preventing leaks via GitHub Push Protection.
4.  **Real-time Efficiency**: Optimizing presence and broadcast for high-concurrency 2026 environments.

## 🏆 Top 5 Gains in Supabase 2026

1.  **Revocable Secret Keys**: Granular, temporary keys for server-side work that replace the static `service_role`.
2.  **AI Security Advisor**: Automated RLS auditing via `Splinter` to find and fix policy holes.
3.  **Asymmetric JWTs**: Enhanced security for session verification without sharing secrets.
4.  **PPR Support**: Seamless integration with Next.js Partial Pre-rendering for instant authenticated shells.
5.  **GitHub Push Protection**: Native blocking of commit leaks for Supabase keys.

- AI-Assisted RLS optimization
- Column-Level Security (CLS)

### 3. [Real-time & Sync Strategy](./references/3-realtime.md) — **HIGH**
- Postgres Changes, Broadcast, and Presence
- Throttling and payload optimization
- Handling massive presence events per second

### 4. [Database Optimization](./references/4-db-optimization.md) — **MEDIUM**
- Postgres Indexes and Performance

- Edge Function best practices

## Quick Reference: The "Do's" and "Don'ts"

| **Don't** | **Do** |
| :--- | :--- |
| `supabase-js` in Server Components | `@supabase/ssr` (createServerClient) |
| `getSession()` on server | `getUser()` (Required for security) |
| `auth-helpers-nextjs` | Use `@supabase/ssr` (Latest standard) |
| Service Role Key in `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` | Revocable Secret Keys (Server-only) |
| Disable RLS for "simple" tables | RLS enabled by default + Policies |
| Manual session refresh in actions | Middleware-based auto-refresh |
