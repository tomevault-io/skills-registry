# Neon Serverless Postgres

Neon is a serverless Postgres platform. We use it as a standard PostgreSQL database — connect with `pg` or any Postgres driver. No Neon-specific SDKs to avoid vendor lock-in.

## Neon Documentation

```bash
# Get list of all Neon docs
curl https://neon.com/llms.txt

# Fetch any doc page as markdown
curl -H "Accept: text/markdown" https://neon.com/docs/<path>
```

Don't guess docs pages. Use the `llms.txt` index to find the relevant URL or follow the links in the resources below.
