# Architecture Review Skill

## Core Principle

**Architecture serves the future. Review for change, not just current needs.**

Software architecture is about making decisions that enable the system to evolve over time while meeting functional and non-functional requirements. A good architecture review doesn't just validate today's implementation—it evaluates how well the system will adapt to tomorrow's needs, scale with growth, and remain maintainable as requirements change.

**Effective architecture reviews are:**
- Multi-dimensional (technical, business, and team considerations)
- Trade-off aware (no perfect solutions, only informed choices)
- Context-driven (right architecture depends on constraints)
- Future-focused (optimizing for change and evolution)

---

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- Designing new systems or major features
- Evaluating technical approaches before implementation
- Conducting design reviews or architecture board meetings
- Assessing technical debt and planning refactoring
- Making technology or pattern selection decisions
- Reviewing third-party integrations or vendor solutions
- Preparing for significant scaling events
- Investigating production issues with architectural root causes
- Onboarding to understand an existing system's design

## Architecture Review Dimensions

**Evaluate architecture across six critical dimensions:**

### 1. Scalability

**Definition:** The system's ability to handle increased load by adding resources.

**Key Questions:**
- Can the system scale horizontally (add more instances)?
- Can it scale vertically (increase instance size)?
- What are the bottlenecks at 10x, 100x, 1000x current load?
- How does the system handle traffic spikes?
- Are there single points of failure preventing scaling?

**Scalability Patterns:**

**Horizontal Scaling (Scale Out):**
- Stateless services that can be replicated
- Load balancing across multiple instances
- Database read replicas for read-heavy workloads
- Partitioning/sharding for write-heavy workloads

**Vertical Scaling (Scale Up):**
- Increasing CPU, memory, or storage on existing instances
- Simpler but has physical limits
- Often used for databases or memory-intensive workloads

**Auto-Scaling:**
- Dynamic resource allocation based on metrics
- CPU, memory, request rate, or custom metrics
- Scale-in policies to reduce costs during low traffic

**Review Checklist:**
- [ ] Services are stateless or state is externalized
- [ ] Database can scale (read replicas, sharding strategy)
- [ ] Caching layer for frequently accessed data
- [ ] Asynchronous processing for long-running tasks
- [ ] Rate limiting to protect against overload
- [ ] Connection pooling for database and external services
- [ ] No hardcoded capacity limits
- [ ] Performance testing validates scaling assumptions

**Red Flags:**
- Shared mutable state across instances
- Synchronous processing of batch operations

## Architecture Patterns

**Common architecture patterns and when to use them:**

### Monolithic Architecture

**Description:** Single, unified application where all components run in the same process.

**When to Use:**
- Small to medium applications
- Early-stage products (MVP, prototyping)
- Team size < 10 developers
- Simple deployment requirements
- Low operational complexity tolerance

**Advantages:**

## Architecture Review Process

**Step-by-step approach to conducting an architecture review:**

### Step 1: Understand Context and Requirements

**Gather Information:**
- Business requirements and goals
- Functional requirements (what the system does)
- Non-functional requirements (scalability, performance, security)
- Constraints (budget, timeline, team skills, regulatory)
- Existing systems and integration points

**Key Questions:**
- What problem is this system solving?
- Who are the users and what are their needs?
- What are the success metrics?
- What are the hard constraints?
- What can be changed later vs must be right now?

### Step 2: Document Current Architecture

**Create Architecture Diagrams:**
- System context diagram (external systems, users)
- Container diagram (applications, databases, services)
- Component diagram (major modules and their interactions)
- Deployment diagram (infrastructure, networking)

**Document Key Decisions:**
- Technology choices (languages, frameworks, databases)
- Architecture patterns used
- Integration patterns
- Data flow and storage strategy

### Step 3: Evaluate Against Review Dimensions

**For each dimension (scalability, maintainability, security, performance, reliability, cost):**
1. Review current implementation
2. Identify strengths
3. Identify weaknesses and risks
4. Assess alignment with requirements
5. Document findings with severity (critical, major, minor)

**Use the checklists provided in each dimension section above.**

### Step 4: Identify Trade-offs

**Every architectural decision involves trade-offs:**

**Example Trade-offs:**
- **Consistency vs Availability:** Strong consistency reduces availability (CAP theorem)
- **Performance vs Cost:** Caching improves performance but increases infrastructure costs
- **Flexibility vs Simplicity:** Microservices offer flexibility but add operational complexity
- **Security vs Usability:** Stricter security can impact user experience
- **Time to Market vs Technical Debt:** Quick implementation may incur debt

**Document:**
- Trade-offs made in current design
- Whether trade-offs align with priorities
- Alternative approaches and their trade-offs

### Step 5: Assess Technical Debt

**Identify Technical Debt:**
- Quick fixes or workarounds
- Outdated dependencies or technology
- Missing tests or documentation
- Known performance issues
- Security vulnerabilities
- Scalability bottlenecks

**Prioritize Debt:**
- **Critical:** Blocks future work or significant risk
- **High:** Slows development or moderate risk
- **Medium:** Manageable but should be addressed
- **Low:** Nice to fix but not urgent

### Step 6: Document Findings and Recommendations

**Structure:**

## Common Anti-Patterns

**Architecture smells to watch for:**

### The Big Ball of Mud
**Symptom:** No discernible architecture, everything tightly coupled, spaghetti code.
**Impact:** Difficult to maintain, test, or extend. High risk of breaking changes.
**Remedy:** Identify bounded contexts, refactor into modules with clear interfaces.

### Premature Optimization
**Symptom:** Complex performance optimizations before understanding actual bottlenecks.
**Impact:** Increased complexity without proven benefit. Wastes development time.
**Remedy:** Measure first, optimize second. Focus on architectural scalability.

### Analysis Paralysis
**Symptom:** Over-engineering for hypothetical future requirements.
**Impact:** Delayed delivery, unnecessary complexity, wasted effort.
**Remedy:** Build for current requirements plus one level of known future growth. Use evolutionary architecture.

### Resume-Driven Development
**Symptom:** Technology choices based on trends rather than requirements.
**Impact:** Poor fit for problem, team unfamiliarity, unnecessary complexity.
**Remedy:** Choose technology based on requirements, team skills, and ecosystem maturity.

### Distributed Monolith
**Symptom:** Microservices that are tightly coupled and must be deployed together.
**Impact:** Complexity of microservices without the benefits. Worst of both worlds.
**Remedy:** Define proper service boundaries (bounded contexts), ensure independent deployability.

### God Service/Module
**Symptom:** Single service or module with too many responsibilities.
**Impact:** Difficult to understand, test, maintain. Becomes a bottleneck.
**Remedy:** Apply Single Responsibility Principle, split into cohesive components.

### Chatty Interfaces
**Symptom:** Excessive fine-grained communication between services or layers.
**Impact:** Poor performance, high latency, network congestion.
**Remedy:** Coarser-grained APIs, batch operations, caching, event-driven communication.

### Leaky Abstractions
**Symptom:** Implementation details exposed through interfaces, tight coupling to underlying technology.
**Impact:** Changes cascade across system, difficult to swap implementations.
**Remedy:** Design interfaces that hide implementation details, depend on abstractions not concretions.

### Not Invented Here (NIH) Syndrome
**Symptom:** Building everything from scratch instead of using proven libraries/services.
**Impact:** Wasted effort, more bugs, maintenance burden.
**Remedy:** Evaluate build vs buy, leverage ecosystem, focus on core business value.

### Golden Hammer
**Symptom:** Using the same solution for every problem regardless of fit.
**Impact:** Suboptimal solutions, forced fit leading to workarounds.
**Remedy:** Evaluate multiple approaches, choose technology based on problem characteristics.
