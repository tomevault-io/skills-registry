# Evaluation Skill

## Core Principle

**Evaluate with criteria, decide with data. Document the trade-offs.**

Good evaluation:
- **Starts with clear criteria** — Define what matters before evaluating
- **Uses consistent scoring** — Apply the same standards to all options
- **Weighs criteria by importance** — Not all factors are equal
- **Documents trade-offs** — Every choice has costs and benefits
- **Leads to defensible decisions** — Data-driven, not opinion-driven

---

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- **Choosing between multiple technologies** — React vs Vue vs Angular
- **Vendor/tool selection** — Cloud providers, monitoring tools, CI/CD platforms
- **Framework comparison** — Express vs Fastify, Django vs Flask
- **Library selection** — State management, testing frameworks, HTTP clients
- **Architecture pattern selection** — Microservices vs Monolith, REST vs GraphQL

## Step 2: Assign Weights

Not all criteria are equally important. Weight them based on your context.

### Weighting Scale

| Weight | Priority | Meaning |
|--------|----------|---------|
| HIGH | Critical | Deal-breaker if inadequate |
| MEDIUM | Important | Significant impact on decision |
| LOW | Nice-to-have | Minor impact on decision |

### Example: Choosing a Database

| Criterion | Weight | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| ACID guarantees | HIGH | Financial data requires consistency |
| Query performance | HIGH | Core to user experience |
| Horizontal scaling | MEDIUM | Will need in 12-18 months |
| Document flexibility | MEDIUM | Schema will evolve |
| Managed service available | MEDIUM | Small ops team |
| SQL compatibility | LOW | Team can learn new query language |
| Graph query support | LOW | Not a current requirement |

---

## Step 3: Create Scoring Matrix

### Scoring Matrix Template

| Criterion | Weight | Option A | Option B | Option C |
|-----------|--------|----------|----------|----------|
| **Category 1** |
| Criterion 1.1 | HIGH | 8 | 6 | 9 |
| Criterion 1.2 | MEDIUM | 7 | 9 | 5 |
| **Category 2** |
| Criterion 2.1 | HIGH | 9 | 7 | 8 |
| Criterion 2.2 | LOW | 6 | 8 | 7 |
| **Weighted Score** | | **X.X** | **X.X** | **X.X** |

### Scoring Scale

**0-10 Scoring:**
- **9-10** — Excellent, exceeds requirements
- **7-8** — Good, meets requirements well
- **5-6** — Acceptable, meets minimum requirements
- **3-4** — Poor, below requirements
- **0-2** — Inadequate, deal-breaker

**Visual Indicators:**
- ✅ Excellent (8-10)
- ⚠️ Acceptable (5-7)
- ❌ Poor (0-4)

---

## Step 4: Research Each Option

### Research Sources

**Trusted:**
- ✅ Official documentation
- ✅ GitHub repository (code, issues, PRs)
- ✅ Release notes and changelog
- ✅ Production case studies
- ✅ Performance benchmarks (reputable sources)
- ✅ Security advisories and CVE database
- ✅ Team experience and feedback

**Skeptical:**
- ⚠️ Vendor marketing materials
- ⚠️ Paid comparison sites
- ⚠️ Outdated blog posts (>2 years old)
- ⚠️ Hype-driven articles
- ⚠️ Benchmarks by vendors

---

**PoC Scope:**
- Time-boxed (1-3 days per option)
- Tests critical features only
- Validates key assumptions
- Measures actual performance
- Assesses developer experience

**What to Test:**
- Integration with critical systems
- Performance with realistic data
- Learning curve (time to hello world)
- Key features that matter most
- Migration complexity (if replacing existing tool)

**PoC Documentation:**
```markdown
# PoC: [Option Name]

## Objective
[What we're validating]

## Setup Time
[How long to get running]

## Key Features Tested
- [ ] Feature 1: [Result]
- [ ] Feature 2: [Result]
- [ ] Feature 3: [Result]

## Performance Results
- Throughput: [X requests/sec]
- Latency p95: [X ms]
- Resource usage: [CPU/Memory]

## Developer Experience

```

See the [proof-of-concept](../proof-of-concept) skill for detailed PoC guidance.

---

## Step 6: Document Trade-offs

Every choice involves trade-offs. Document them explicitly.

### Trade-off Template

**Option A vs Option B:**

| Dimension | Option A | Option B | Winner |
|-----------|----------|----------|--------|
| Performance | 100k req/sec | 50k req/sec | A |
| Learning curve | 2 weeks | 2 days | B |
| Community size | 10k stars | 100k stars | B |
| Flexibility | High | Low | A |
| Maintenance burden | High | Low | B |

**Analysis:**
- Option A is **2x faster** but requires **10x more learning time**
- Option B has **10x larger community** but **less flexibility**
- Trade-off: Do we optimize for performance or team velocity?

- React: Mature ecosystem, team knowledge, proven at scale
- **Winner: React** (maturity and team velocity critical for 6-month timeline)

---

### Recommendation

**Recommended: React with Next.js**

**Rationale:**
1. **Zero learning curve** — Team already knows React
2. **Best ecosystem** — Largest selection of components and tools

## Evaluation Anti-Patterns

### 1. Resume-Driven Evaluation

❌ **Anti-pattern:** Choosing technology because it's trendy or looks good on resume

**Signs:**
- "Everyone's talking about [new tech]"
- Ignoring that current solution works well
- Chasing hype cycles
- Complexity for complexity's sake

**Fix:** Evaluate based on actual needs, not trends

---

### 2. Analysis Paralysis

❌ **Anti-pattern:** Evaluating forever, never deciding

**Signs:**
- Evaluating 10+ options
- Adding criteria endlessly
- "Let's research more" when data is sufficient
- Perfectionism blocking decision

**Fix:** Set decision deadline, limit options to 3-5, accept "good enough"

---

### 3. Confirmation Bias

❌ **Anti-pattern:** Deciding first, evaluating to confirm

**Signs:**
- Only researching preferred option deeply
- Ignoring negative evidence
- Scoring subjectively to favor preference
- Cherry-picking benchmarks

**Fix:** Score all options before forming opinion, blind evaluation where possible

---

### 4. Sunk Cost Fallacy

❌ **Anti-pattern:** Continuing with poor choice due to past investment

**Signs:**
- "We've already invested 6 months"
- Ignoring better alternatives
- Escalating commitment despite evidence
- Defending past decision

**Fix:** Evaluate current state objectively, past investment is sunk

---

### 5. Feature Checklist Evaluation

❌ **Anti-pattern:** Choosing option with most features

**Signs:**
- Counting features without weighting importance
- Ignoring that 80% of features won't be used
- Missing quality vs quantity distinction
- Complexity without benefit

**Fix:** Weight features by actual need, value simplicity

---

### Evaluation Criteria Quick List

**Technical:** Features, performance, scalability, security
**Operational:** Reliability, monitoring, maintenance
**Team:** Learning curve, documentation, community
**Business:** Cost, licensing, vendor lock-in, support
**Strategic:** Ecosystem, roadmap, adoption trends

---

### Scoring Guidelines

- **9-10:** Excellent, exceeds requirements
- **7-8:** Good, meets requirements well
- **5-6:** Acceptable, meets minimum
- **3-4:** Poor, below requirements
- **0-2:** Inadequate, deal-breaker

---

### When to Re-evaluate

- New major version released
- Significant change in requirements
- Team size or expertise changes
- Better alternatives emerge
- Performance degrades
- Security issues discovered
- Vendor acquired or direction changes
- Every 1-2 years for critical dependencies

---

**Remember:** Good evaluation leads to good decisions. Define criteria before scoring, weight by importance, validate with hands-on testing. Document trade-offs transparently so future you (and your team) understands why the decision was made. Every choice has costs—make them explicit.
