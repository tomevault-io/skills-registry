# Remediation Library

This skill is an index to modular remediation guides. Use the specialized skills below for focused remediation guidance.

## When to Use This Skill

- **Finding the right remediation skill** - Use this index to route to the appropriate specialized skill
- **Overview of available fixes** - Quick reference of what's available

## When NOT to Use This Skill

- **Detecting vulnerabilities** - Use vulnerability-patterns skill
- **Specific remediation** - Use the specialized skills directly (faster)
