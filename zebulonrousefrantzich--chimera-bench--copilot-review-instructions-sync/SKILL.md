description: Update and validate GitHub Copilot review instruction files from Agent OS standards and repository conventions. Use when this capability is needed.

Use this workflow when standards change and Copilot review instructions need to stay in sync.

## Standards to read first

- `agent-os/standards/index.yml`
- Any changed standards under `agent-os/standards/**`
- `AGENTS.md`

## Procedure

1. Inspect current Copilot instruction files:
   - `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
   - `.github/instructions/**/*.instructions.md`
2. Map standards to instruction scopes:
   - Repository-wide policy goes in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.
   - Domain-specific policy goes in path-specific files with `applyTo` frontmatter.
3. Keep guidance concise and review-oriented:
   - Prioritize security, correctness, reliability, and performance.
   - Avoid style-only directives that create noisy reviews.
4. Ensure path-specific files have valid `applyTo` globs and no conflicting directives.
5. Validate practical review context is included:
   - CI parity commands (`bun run lint`, `bun run openapi:check`, `bun test`).
   - Contract-sync expectations for OpenAPI and SDK artifacts.
6. Enforce Copilot code review constraints:
   - Keep each custom instruction file under 4000 characters.
7. Report changes:
   - Which standards were reflected.
   - Which instruction files changed.
   - Any remaining standards not yet represented.

## Guardrails

- Keep instructions declarative and broadly applicable.
- Do not include secrets or environment-specific credentials.
- Prefer standards as source of truth; only encode procedural guidance in skills.
