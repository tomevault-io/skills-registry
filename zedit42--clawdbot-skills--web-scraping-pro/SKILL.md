# Web Scraping Pro

Advanced scraping that handles modern anti-bot protections.

## When to Use

- Regular `web_fetch` returns 403/Cloudflare
- Need to scrape JavaScript-rendered content
- Want structured data extraction (not just HTML)
- Dealing with bot protection (Cloudflare, Akamai)

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Jina Reader (Easiest, Free)

```bash
# Just prepend r.jina.ai to any URL
curl "https://r.jina.ai/https://example.com"

# Or use the script
node skills/web-scraping-pro/scripts/jina-fetch.js "https://example.com"
```

### Option 2: Crawl4AI (Most Powerful, Free)

```bash
# Install
pip install crawl4ai
playwright install

# Use via script
python skills/web-scraping-pro/scripts/crawl4ai-fetch.py "https://example.com"
```

### Option 3: Firecrawl (API, has free tier)

```bash
# Set API key
export FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=your_key

# Fetch
node skills/web-scraping-pro/scripts/firecrawl-fetch.js "https://example.com"
```

## Available Scripts

### `scripts/jina-fetch.js`
Fetch via Jina Reader API. Free, no setup, handles most sites.
- ✅ Free unlimited
- ✅ Returns clean markdown
- ❌ Some sites block

### `scripts/crawl4ai-fetch.py`
Full browser scraping with Crawl4AI. Most capable option.
- ✅ Free, local
- ✅ Handles JS rendering
- ✅ Built-in extraction
- ❌ Slower, needs setup

### `scripts/firecrawl-fetch.js`
Firecrawl API for reliable scraping.
- ✅ Very reliable
- ✅ Clean output
- ❌ Paid after free tier

### `scripts/multi-fetch.js`
Try multiple methods in fallback order.

### `scripts/extract-structured.py`
Extract structured data (tables, lists, specific elements).

## Jina Reader Features

```bash
# Basic fetch (returns markdown)
curl "https://r.jina.ai/https://example.com"

# Search (returns search results)
curl "https://s.jina.ai/your+search+query"

# With options
curl "https://r.jina.ai/https://example.com" \
  -H "X-Return-Format: text" \
  -H "X-Target-Selector: main"
```

## Crawl4AI Features

```python
from crawl4ai import WebCrawler

crawler = WebCrawler()
crawler.warmup()

result = crawler.run(
    url="https://example.com",
    word_count_threshold=10,
    extraction_strategy="LLMExtractionStrategy",  # AI extraction
    chunking_strategy="RegexChunking"
)

print(result.markdown)  # Clean markdown
print(result.extracted_content)  # Structured data
```

## Comparison

| Tool | Cloudflare | JS Render | Speed | Cost |
|------|------------|-----------|-------|------|
| Jina Reader | ⭕ Some | ✅ Yes | Fast | Free |
| Crawl4AI | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Slow | Free |
| Firecrawl | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Fast | Freemium |
| Browser skill | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Slow | Free |

## Tips

1. **Start with Jina** - It's free and works for most sites
2. **Fallback to Crawl4AI** - When Jina fails
3. **Use selectors** - Target specific elements for cleaner output
4. **Rate limit** - Add delays between requests
5. **Cache results** - Don't re-scrape unchanged content

## Handling Common Issues

### Cloudflare Challenge
```bash
# Use Crawl4AI with stealth
python skills/web-scraping-pro/scripts/crawl4ai-fetch.py "https://site.com" --stealth
```

### JavaScript Content
```bash
# Jina handles most JS
# For complex SPAs, use Crawl4AI with wait
python skills/web-scraping-pro/scripts/crawl4ai-fetch.py "https://spa.com" --wait 5000
```

### Rate Limiting
```bash
# Use batch script with delays
node skills/web-scraping-pro/scripts/batch-scrape.js urls.txt --delay 3000
```
