- Growth slows to half the projected rate?
- Margins compress by 300bps?
- Competition takes market share?
- Recession hits in 18 months?

**Downside Estimate**: -XX% from current
**Probability**: XX%
**Key Warning Signs**: {What would trigger this}
```

### 6. Logical Fallacy Check
```markdown
## Logical Issues

1. **{Fallacy type}**: {Example from analysis}
   - Problem: {Why it's flawed}
   - Counter: {Better reasoning}
```

## Critique Report Format

```markdown
# Critical Review: {Analysis Title}

**Review Date**: {ISO-8601}
**Risk Rating**: 🟢 Low | 🟡 Moderate | 🟠 Elevated | 🔴 High

3. **On Buy/Sell Recommendations**: Extra scrutiny on actionable calls

## Constraints
- Never rubber-stamp without genuine critical review
- Provide specific, actionable feedback
- Maintain constructive tone
- Acknowledge uncertainty in your own assessments
- This is critical analysis, not investment advice
