# Agentic AI Architecture Designer

## Overview

This skill designs complete agentic AI architectures from user ideas. It analyzes requirements and generates comprehensive architecture documentation with file outputs including valid Mermaid diagrams, MCP configurations, and implementation guides. The skill creates four key deliverables: architecture.md, workflow.mermaid, mcp-config.json, and implementation-notes.md files.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Gather Requirements

Before designing, ask these questions if not provided:

**Core Requirements:**
1. **What problem does this agent system solve?** (specific use case)
2. **What's the scale?** (small tool, team platform, or enterprise system)
3. **What's the expected volume?** (requests per day/hour, concurrent users)
4. **What LLM/model will be used?** (Claude, GPT-4, local models, mix)

**Technical Context:**
5. **Deployment target?** (cloud, on-prem, edge, hybrid)
6. **Existing systems to integrate?** (databases, APIs, tools)
7. **Budget constraints?** (API costs per month, infrastructure limits)
8. **Complexity tolerance?** (simple MVP, production-ready, enterprise-grade)

**Operational:**
9. **Human-in-the-loop required?** (fully autonomous, approval needed, oversight)
10. **Response time requirements?** (real-time, near-real-time, batch processing)

### Step 2: Analyze and Design

1. **Analyze the requirements**:
   - Identify core objectives and success criteria
   - Determine agent types needed (coordinator, specialist, memory, validator)
   - Map data flows and agent interactions
   - Assess scalability and performance needs
   - Estimate costs (LLM calls per workflow × expected volume)

2. **Design architecture** considering:

   - Agent roles and responsibilities (avoid overlap)
   - Communication patterns (sync vs async, message bus vs direct)
   - Memory and state management (short-term, long-term, shared)
   - Error handling and recovery (retry logic, fallbacks, circuit breakers)
   - Security considerations (auth, data privacy, rate limiting)
   - Monitoring and observability (logging, metrics, tracing)
   - Cost optimization (minimize LLM calls, caching strategies)

### Step 3: Create Output Directory Structure

Create organized architecture documentation:

```
./architecture/[project-name]/
├── architecture.md           # Main architecture document
├── diagrams/
│   ├── workflow.mermaid     # Agent workflow diagram
│   ├── sequence.mermaid     # Interaction sequences (optional)
│   └── components.mermaid   # System components (optional)
├── config/
│   └── mcp-config.json      # MCP configuration
└── implementation-notes.md   # Implementation guide
```

If project root already has `/docs` or `/architecture`, use that location.

### Step 4: Generate architecture.md

Use this template structure:

```markdown

- Monthly cost estimate: $[amount]
- Optimization opportunities

## 13. Implementation Phases

- Phase 2: Enhancements
- Phase 3: Scale and optimize
```

### Step 5: Create workflow.mermaid

Generate valid Mermaid diagram(s). Choose appropriate type:

**1. Agent Flow Diagram** (use `graph TD` for top-down):
```mermaid
graph TD
    Start([User Request]) --> Router{Request Router}
    Router -->|Simple Query| Simple[Simple Response Agent]
    Router -->|Complex Query| Complex[Complex Analysis Agent]
    Router -->|Unknown| Fallback[Fallback Handler]
    
    Simple --> Response[Generate Response]
    Complex --> Research[Research Agent]
    Research --> Synthesis[Synthesis Agent]
    Synthesis --> Response
    Fallback --> Human[Human Escalation]
    
    Response --> End([Return to User])
    Human --> End
    
    style Start fill:#90EE90,stroke:#2F4F2F,stroke-width:2px,color:#000
    style End fill:#90EE90,stroke:#2F4F2F,stroke-width:2px,color:#000
    style Router fill:#FFD700,stroke:#8B4513,stroke-width:2px,color:#000
    style Human fill:#FFB6C1,stroke:#8B0000,stroke-width:2px,color:#000
```

**2. Sequence Diagram** (for temporal interactions):
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant C as Coordinator
    participant S1 as Specialist Agent 1
    participant S2 as Specialist Agent 2
    participant M as Memory Agent
    
    U->>C: Submit Request
    C->>M: Load Context
    M-->>C: Context Data
    C->>S1: Delegate Task A
    C->>S2: Delegate Task B
    
    par Parallel Processing
        S1->>S1: Process Task A
    and
        S2->>S2: Process Task B
    end
    
    S1-->>C: Result A
    S2-->>C: Result B
    C->>C: Aggregate Results
    C->>M: Save Context
    C-->>U: Final Response
```

**3. State Diagram** (for agent lifecycle):
```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Idle
    Idle --> Processing: Request Received
    Processing --> Analyzing: Data Loaded
    Analyzing --> Executing: Plan Created
    Executing --> Validating: Action Completed
    Validating --> Success: Valid Output
    Validating --> Retry: Invalid Output
    Retry --> Executing: Attempt < 3
    Retry --> Failed: Max Retries
    Success --> Idle: Response Sent
    Failed --> Idle: Error Logged
```

**Mermaid Best Practices:**
- Use descriptive node labels
- Add colors for different node types (start/end, decision, error)
- Include error paths and edge cases
- Keep diagrams focused (if too complex, create multiple diagrams)
- Test syntax at https://mermaid.live before finalizing

### Step 6: Generate mcp-config.json

Create MCP (Model Context Protocol) configuration for Claude integration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "[agent-system-name]": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["path/to/server.js"],
      "env": {
        "API_KEY": "${API_KEY}",
        "DATABASE_URL": "${DATABASE_URL}"
      },
      "disabled": false,
      "alwaysAllow": []
    }
  },
  "tools": [
    {
      "name": "agent_coordinator",
      "description": "Coordinates multiple specialist agents",
      "inputSchema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "task": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Task to coordinate"
          },
          "agents": {
            "type": "array",
            "items": {"type": "string"},
            "description": "Agent IDs to involve"
          },
          "priority": {
            "type": "string",
            "enum": ["low", "normal", "high"],
            "default": "normal"
          }
        },
        "required": ["task", "agents"]
      }
    }
  ],
  "resources": {
    "maxConcurrentRequests": 10,
    "timeoutMs": 30000,
    "retryAttempts": 3,
    "rateLimiting": {
      "requestsPerMinute": 60,
      "burstSize": 10
    }
  },
  "monitoring": {
    "loggingLevel": "info",
    "metricsEnabled": true,
    "tracingEnabled": true
  },
  "security": {
    "requireAuth": true,
    "allowedOrigins": ["https://your-domain.com"],
    "rateLimit": true
  }
}
```

**Note**: Adapt configuration based on actual MCP server implementation and requirements.

### Step 7: Create implementation-notes.md

Provide practical implementation guidance:

```markdown
# Implementation Guide

## Phase 1: Setup (Week 1)

### 1. Choose Agent Framework

**Option A: LangChain/LangGraph** (Python)
- ✅ Mature ecosystem, extensive integrations
- ✅ Great for complex agent workflows
- ⚠️ Can be heavy for simple use cases
```bash
pip install langchain langgraph langchain-anthropic
```

**Option B: AutoGen** (Python)
- ✅ Microsoft-backed, multi-agent conversations
- ✅ Good for collaborative agents
- ⚠️ Less flexible for custom patterns
```bash
pip install pyautogen
```

**Option C: CrewAI** (Python)
- ✅ Role-based agent teams
- ✅ Simpler API than LangChain
- ⚠️ Newer, smaller ecosystem
```bash
pip install crewai
```

**Option D: Custom Implementation**
- ✅ Full control, minimal dependencies
- ✅ Optimized for specific use case
- ⚠️ More development time

**Recommendation**: [Based on requirements analysis]

### 2. Set Up Development Environment
[Environment setup steps]

### 3. Implement Core Components
[Implementation steps]

## Phase 2: Build Agents (Week 2-3)
[Detailed implementation steps]

## Phase 3: Integration & Testing (Week 4)
[Testing and integration steps]

## Potential Challenges

1. **Challenge**: Agent coordination complexity
   - **Mitigation**: Start with simple sequential flows, add parallelism later
   - **Pattern**: Use coordinator agent to manage complexity

2. **Challenge**: LLM API costs
   - **Mitigation**: Implement caching, use smaller models for simple tasks
   - **Pattern**: Tier agents by complexity/cost

3. **Challenge**: Latency issues
   - **Mitigation**: Use async processing, implement streaming responses
   - **Pattern**: Process non-critical tasks in background

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test each agent in isolation
- Mock LLM responses for consistent testing
- Validate input/output schemas

### Integration Tests
- Test agent interactions
- Verify message passing
- Check error handling flows

### End-to-End Tests
- Test complete workflows
- Measure performance and costs
- Validate against success criteria

## Performance Benchmarks

- Response time: [target] ms (p95)
- Throughput: [target] requests/second
- Cost per request: $[amount]
- Success rate: [target]%

## Deployment Considerations

[Deployment steps and infrastructure requirements]

## Cost Optimization Tips

1. Cache frequent queries
2. Use prompt compression
3. Implement smart routing (cheap models for simple tasks)
4. Batch requests when possible
5. Monitor and optimize token usage
```

### Step 8: Validate All Generated Files

Run comprehensive validation:

**Mermaid Validation:**
- [ ] Test all Mermaid diagrams at https://mermaid.live
- [ ] Verify all node IDs are unique
- [ ] Check all connections have valid endpoints
- [ ] Ensure no syntax errors (proper brackets, quotes)
- [ ] Confirm diagram renders clearly and is readable

**JSON Validation:**
- [ ] Parse mcp-config.json to verify valid JSON
- [ ] Check all required fields are present
- [ ] Verify data types match schema
- [ ] Ensure no trailing commas or syntax errors

**Architecture Coherence:**
- [ ] All agents mentioned in architecture.md appear in workflow.mermaid
- [ ] All tools in mcp-config.json are referenced in architecture
- [ ] Technology stack in architecture matches implementation notes
- [ ] Cost estimates are consistent across documents
- [ ] No placeholder text ([TODO], [TBD], etc.) remains

**Completeness Check:**
- [ ] architecture.md has all 13 sections filled out
- [ ] workflow.mermaid includes error paths
- [ ] mcp-config.json has security settings
- [ ] implementation-notes.md has concrete next steps
- [ ] All file paths are correct and consistent

### Step 9: Generate Summary Report

Provide user with:
```

📋 Next Steps:
1. Review architecture.md for alignment with requirements
2. View workflow.mermaid at https://mermaid.live
3. Set up development environment per implementation-notes.md
4. Begin Phase 1 implementation

💡 Quick Start:
cd architecture/[project-name]
cat implementation-notes.md
```

## Best Practices

**Architecture Design:**
- Start simple, add complexity only when needed
- Design for failure: retry logic, fallbacks, circuit breakers
- Estimate costs early (LLM calls × volume = monthly cost)
- Consider monitoring and observability from day one
- Use consistent terminology across all documents

**Agent Patterns:**
- Avoid agent overlap: each agent should have clear, distinct responsibilities
- Use coordinator agents for complex workflows
- Implement memory agents for context that spans multiple interactions
- Add validation agents for quality control
- Include human-in-the-loop for critical decisions

**Performance:**
- Cache frequent queries and responses
- Use async processing for non-blocking operations
- Implement streaming for long-running tasks
- Tier agents by complexity (simple tasks → cheap models)
- Monitor token usage and optimize prompts

**Security:**
- Validate all inputs before agent processing
- Implement rate limiting per user/API key
- Encrypt sensitive data in memory and transit
- Use principle of least privilege for tool access
- Audit all agent actions and decisions

## Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Too many agents**: Creates coordination overhead  
✅ Use fewer, more capable agents

❌ **Synchronous workflows**: Causes latency cascades  
✅ Use async processing and parallel execution

❌ **No error handling**: System fails on first error  
✅ Implement retry logic, fallbacks, graceful degradation

❌ **Ignoring costs**: LLM bills surprise you  
✅ Estimate costs upfront, monitor continuously

❌ **No validation**: Bad outputs propagate  
✅ Add validation agents or output schemas

## Examples

For detailed examples with actual generated outputs, see [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md).

**Quick Example**: When user says *"Design an AI agent system for customer support"*, this skill will:
1. Ask about scale, volume, budget, integration requirements
2. Design 3-5 specialized agents (router, responder, escalation, memory)
3. Generate complete architecture documentation with Mermaid diagrams
4. Provide MCP configuration and implementation guide
5. Estimate costs and provide optimization recommendations
