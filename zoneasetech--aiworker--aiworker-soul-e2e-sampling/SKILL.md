# AIWorker Soul E2E Sampling

Use this skill to operate the AIWorker official Soul output-quality sampling loop. This is an execution workflow for real sampling evidence, not a generic AIWorker development guide and not a skill-authoring template.

## Trigger Gate

Before using this skill, confirm all three gates:

1. **AIWorker repo identity:** Locate the git root from the current working directory. Confirm root `AGENTS.md` contains `AIWorker Agent Bootstrap`, the five canonical docs exist, `scripts/e2e-soul-sampling.ts` exists, and official Soul packages exist under `souls/*`.
2. **Sampling operation intent:** The user asks to run, continue, triage, retest, or tune the official Soul output-quality sampling loop.
3. **Official Soul or evidence target:** The request targets existing official Soul `AGENTS.md`, projected skills, or evidence under `tmp/e2e-soul-sampling/`.

If any gate fails, do not use this skill. For ambiguous prompts such as "跑 e2e" or "改 product-manager skill", ask one clarifying question to separate the Soul sampling loop from ordinary project development.

Do not use this skill for ordinary AIWorker feature work, generic E2E/contract/smoke tests, normal Soul authoring, new skill creation, sampling harness development, docs-only architecture work, or AGENTS/SKILL edits not driven by sampling evidence.

## Zero-Trust Start

After the trigger gate passes, re-read current repo truth before choosing work:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `docs/architecture.md`
- `docs/protocol.md`
- `docs/runtime.md`
- `docs/soul-authoring.md`
- `docs/testing.md`
- `scripts/e2e-soul-sampling.ts`
- `scripts/e2e-soul-sampling.test.ts`
- `git status --short`
- relevant recent commits

For execution tasks, run early:

```bash
bun run docs:check
bun run test:contracts
```

If `test:contracts` fails because a local dependency is missing, such as `Cannot find package 'zod'`, try `bun install` and rerun the gate before declaring architecture drift.

## Real Engine Rule

Unit or static tests for `scripts/e2e-soul-sampling.ts` may mock CLI behavior. E2E sampling must use real Worker CLI and real Codex invocations. Do not replace LLM-engine behavior with fake outputs, golden text, dry-run evidence, or mock-only validation.

Canonical real-run commands:

```bash
AIWORKER_E2E_RUN_ID=full-freeform AIWORKER_E2E_REASONING=high bun scripts/e2e-soul-sampling.ts run --soul aiworker-freeform
AIWORKER_E2E_RUN_ID=full-google-ads AIWORKER_E2E_REASONING=high bun scripts/e2e-soul-sampling.ts run --soul google-ads
AIWORKER_E2E_RUN_ID=full-hr-manager AIWORKER_E2E_REASONING=high bun scripts/e2e-soul-sampling.ts run --soul hr-manager
AIWORKER_E2E_RUN_ID=full-product-manager AIWORKER_E2E_REASONING=high bun scripts/e2e-soul-sampling.ts run --soul product-manager
AIWORKER_E2E_RUN_ID=full-software-support AIWORKER_E2E_REASONING=high bun scripts/e2e-soul-sampling.ts run --soul software-support
```

Use unique run IDs for retests, for example `full-product-manager-agentsfix`. Prefer serial runs unless the user explicitly wants parallel sampling and the machine can support it.

## Evidence Review

Evidence lives under:

```text
tmp/e2e-soul-sampling/<runId>/
  manifest.json
  scorecards/*.json
  events/*.json
```

`scorecard.status=pass` means the invocation completed; it does not prove output quality. Always read assistant event text before judging quality:

```bash
jq -r '[.events[] | (.payloadJson.data.text // empty)] | join("")' \
  tmp/e2e-soul-sampling/<runId>/events/<caseId>.json
```

Write ignored working summaries such as `tmp/e2e-soul-sampling/<runId>/findings.md` when reviewing multiple cases. Do not commit `tmp/` evidence.

## Finding Routing

Classify before editing:

| Finding | Default owner |
| --- | --- |
| AGENTS chooses the wrong workflow, leaks temp paths, misses domain boundaries, or fails to direct asset use | `souls/*/engine/workspace/AGENTS.md` |
| One workflow invents inputs, misses clarification, lacks self-check, or has weak delivery rules | `souls/*/engine/skills/*/SKILL.md` |
| Multiple skills repeat the same missing method, benchmark, integration, or domain rule | `souls/*/engine/workspace/knowledge/*` |
| Multiple outputs miss the same delivery structure | `souls/*/engine/workspace/templates/*` |
| CLI, session, projection, timeout, or engine bridge blocks real sampling before quality can be judged | platform code, smallest blocking slice only |

Edit the smallest asset that explains the failure. Shared knowledge or template changes require repeated evidence across multiple cases.

## Fix And Retest Loop

For each verified finding:

1. Classify the failure from assistant event text.
2. Edit the smallest responsible Soul asset.
3. Build or validate the affected Soul package.
4. Confirm tracked `dist/engine-assets` output is synchronized when the package generates it.
5. Retest with real Codex using the affected Soul or the narrowest supported case.
6. Re-read assistant event text and update findings.
7. Commit the verified slice without `tmp/` evidence.

Example validation commands:

```bash
bun run --filter '@zonease/aiworker-product-manager' validate
bun run --filter '@zonease/aiworker-software-support' validate
```

## Completion Gate

Before claiming completion, run the smallest fresh verification set that proves the touched surface. Common commands:

```bash
bun run docs:check
bun run test:contracts
bun test scripts/e2e-soul-sampling.test.ts --timeout=30000
bun test packages/worker-runtime/src/worker/executor.test.ts --timeout=30000
```

For code changes, run code-review-graph unless the change is docs-only, instruction-only, or pure formatting.
