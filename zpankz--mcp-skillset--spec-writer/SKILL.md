# Specification Writer

This skill provides guidance for writing high-quality technical specifications that communicate complex systems, design decisions, and implementation strategies effectively.

## Core Capabilities

This skill supports:

1. **System Architecture Specs** - Document system design, component interactions, data flow
2. **Feature Specifications** - Define requirements, user stories, acceptance criteria
3. **Technical Proposals** - Present solutions, trade-offs, implementation strategies
4. **Design Documents** - Capture design decisions, rationale, alternatives considered
5. **Process Documentation** - Describe workflows, procedures, automation pipelines
6. **Mapping Specifications** - Document conversion strategies between systems

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Writing architectural decision records (ADRs)
- Creating system design documents
- Proposing new features or enhancements
- Documenting complex integrations or migrations
- Explaining technical trade-offs to stakeholders
- Creating implementation roadmaps
- Mapping between different systems or frameworks

## Specification Structure Template

### Frontmatter (YAML/Metadata)

Every specification should begin with structured metadata:

```yaml
---
title: Descriptive Title
version: 1.0.0
date: YYYY-MM-DD
status: draft | review | approved | deprecated
authors:
  - Name/Entity
categories:
  - category1
  - category2
related:
  - path/to/related/doc1
  - path/to/related/doc2
---
```

**Purpose**: Makes specs discoverable, trackable, and navigable.

### Document Sections

#### 1. Executive Summary

**Length**: 2-4 paragraphs
**Purpose**: High-level overview for decision-makers

Include:
- What is being proposed/documented
- Why it matters (business/technical value)
- Key outcomes or decisions
- Critical success factors

#### 2. Problem Statement / Context

**Length**: 1-3 sections
**Purpose**: Establish shared understanding of the problem

Include:
- Current state analysis
- Pain points or limitations
- User impact or business drivers
- Constraints or requirements

#### 3. Proposed Solution / Design

**Length**: Variable (main body of spec)
**Purpose**: Detailed technical approach

Include:
- High-level architecture diagram (mermaid/ASCII)
- Component breakdown with responsibilities

- Technology choices (with alternatives considered)

#### 4. Implementation Plan

**Length**: 1-2 sections
**Purpose**: Actionable roadmap

Include:
- Phased approach (Phase 1, 2, 3...)
- Dependencies and prerequisites
- Timeline estimates
- Risk mitigation strategies
- Success metrics

#### 5. Trade-offs and Limitations

**Length**: 1 section
**Purpose**: Honest assessment of constraints

Include:
- What this solution doesn't address
- Known limitations or caveats
- Performance/scalability considerations
- Security implications
- Cost analysis (time, resources, complexity)

#### 6. Alternatives Considered

**Length**: 1 section
**Purpose**: Show due diligence

Include:
- Alternative approaches (2-3)
- Why each was rejected
- Comparative analysis when relevant

#### 7. Open Questions / Future Work

**Length**: Short list
**Purpose**: Surface unknowns and next steps

Include:
- Unresolved technical questions
- Areas requiring more research
- Future enhancements out of scope
- Follow-up specifications needed

#### 8. References

**Length**: List
**Purpose**: Citations and further reading

Include:
- Related documentation
- External resources
- API documentation
- Research papers or blog posts

## Writing Style Guidelines

### Use Imperative/Infinitive Form

**Good**: "To accomplish X, configure Y"
**Bad**: "You should configure Y to accomplish X"

**Good**: "Process files in batches"
**Bad**: "The system will process files in batches"

Rationale: Direct, action-oriented language is clearer for both humans and AI agents.

### Be Specific and Concrete

**Vague**: "The system should be fast"
**Specific**: "Process 1000 requests/sec with <100ms p99 latency"

**Vague**: "Use appropriate error handling"
**Specific**: "Retry with exponential backoff (3 attempts, 2x multiplier)"

### Show, Don't Just Tell

Include:
- Code examples for key interfaces
- Diagram for complex flows
- Sample input/output for transformations
- Before/after comparisons for changes

### Layer Information Progressively

Structure from high-level to low-level:
1. Abstract overview
2. Component-level design
3. Implementation details
4. Edge cases and optimizations

Readers can stop at appropriate depth for their needs.

## Diagrams and Visualizations

### Mermaid Diagrams

Use mermaid for:
- Flowcharts (`graph TB`)
- Sequence diagrams (`sequenceDiagram`)
- State machines (`stateDiagram-v2`)
- Entity relationships (`erDiagram`)

Example:
```mermaid
graph TB
    A[Input] --> B{Validate?}
    B -->|Valid| C[Process]
    B -->|Invalid| D[Error]
    C --> E[Output]
```

### ASCII Diagrams

Use for simple structures:
```
Input → [Validator] → [Processor] → [Storage]
            ↓              ↓
        [Logger]      [Metrics]
```

### Architecture Patterns

Use standard patterns when applicable:
- Pipes and Filters (Unix philosophy)
- Event-Driven Architecture
- Layered Architecture
- Microservices
- MVC/MVP/MVVM

## Specification Types and Templates

### 1. System Architecture Spec

Focus on:
- Component boundaries
- Data flow and state management
- API contracts
- Scalability and performance
- Failure modes and recovery

### 2. Feature Specification

Focus on:
- User stories and use cases
- Acceptance criteria
- UI/UX considerations
- API changes
- Testing strategy

### 3. Migration/Mapping Spec

Focus on:
- Current state → Target state
- Conversion strategy (1:1, hybrid, workaround)
- Fidelity assessment (what's preserved, what's lost)
- Validation and testing
- Rollback plan

### 4. Integration Spec

Focus on:
- External systems and protocols
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting and quotas
- Error handling and retries
- Monitoring and alerting

### 5. Process/Workflow Spec

Focus on:
- Step-by-step procedures
- Input/output for each step
- Automation opportunities
- Error recovery
- Metrics and success criteria

## Best Practices

### 1. Start with "Why"

Always explain the motivation before diving into "how". Readers need context to evaluate solutions.

### 2. Use Consistent Terminology

Define terms once, use consistently throughout. Create a glossary for complex domains.

### 3. Be Honest About Trade-offs

Every design has limitations. Acknowledging them builds credibility and helps stakeholders make informed decisions.

### 4. Include Success Metrics

Define measurable criteria for success:
- Performance targets
- Quality metrics
- User satisfaction indicators
- Business outcomes

### 5. Version and Date Specs

Technical decisions evolve. Timestamps and versions help readers understand when decisions were made and which is canonical.

### 6. Make Specs Searchable

Use:
- Clear headings (H1, H2, H3)
- Keywords in frontmatter
- Descriptive filenames
- Internal links for cross-references

### 7. Keep Specs Living Documents

Update specs when:
- Implementation reveals new insights
- Requirements change
- Alternatives are discovered
- Lessons are learned post-launch

Mark deprecated sections clearly.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ❌ Vague Requirements

**Bad**: "The system should be secure and fast"
**Good**: "Encrypt data at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.3). Support 10k req/s with <200ms p95 latency."

### ❌ Implementation Without Rationale

**Bad**: "Use Redis for caching"
**Good**: "Use Redis for caching because it provides atomic operations, pub/sub, and persistence options. Considered Memcached (faster but lacks persistence) and Hazelcast (better for distributed scenarios but adds complexity)."

### ❌ Assuming Knowledge

**Bad**: "Configure the usual K8s setup"
**Good**: "Deploy as StatefulSet with 3 replicas, PersistentVolumeClaim per pod, headless service for DNS-based discovery."

### ❌ No Examples

Provide concrete examples for:
- API requests/responses
- Configuration files
- Command-line usage
- File formats

### ❌ Ignoring the Reader

Consider your audience:
- **Engineers**: Need implementation details
- **Architects**: Need system-level view
- **Product**: Need feature/benefit explanation
- **Executives**: Need ROI and timeline

Write sections for each or use progressive disclosure.
