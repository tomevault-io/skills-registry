## How It Works

### Core Workflow

```
Input Detection → Template Matching → Prompt Building →
3 Variations → Copy-Paste Ready Output
```

**Time to First Output**: <15 seconds (simple inputs)

---

## STEP 1: INPUT DETECTION & PROCESSING

### 1.1 YouTube URL Processing

When user provides a YouTube URL (music video, audio, tutorial):

**Process**:

1. **Validate URL** and check yt-dlp availability:
   ```bash
   # Check installation
   which yt-dlp || command -v yt-dlp

   # If not installed (macOS):
   brew install yt-dlp

   # If not installed (Linux):
   pip3 install yt-dlp
   ```

2. **Extract transcript**:
   ```bash
   # Get video title for file naming
   VIDEO_TITLE=$(yt-dlp --print "%(title)s" "$URL" | tr '/' '_' | tr ':' '-' | tr '?' '' | tr '"' '')

   # Download auto-generated subtitles
   yt-dlp --write-auto-sub --skip-download --sub-langs en --output "temp_transcript" "$URL"

   # Clean VTT format (remove duplicates, timestamps, metadata)
   python3 -c "
   import re
   seen = set()
   with open('temp_transcript.en.vtt', 'r') as f:
       for line in f:
           line = line.strip()
           if line and not line.startswith('WEBVTT') and not line.startswith('Kind:') and not line.startswith('Language:') and '-->' not in line:
               clean = re.sub('<[^>]*>', '', line)
               clean = clean.replace('&amp;', '&').replace('&gt;', '>').replace('&lt;', '<')
               if clean and clean not in seen:
                   print(clean)
                   seen.add(clean)
   " > transcript_clean.txt

   rm -f temp_transcript.en.vtt
   ```

3. **Detect intent**:
   - **If transcript contains song lyrics** (repeated patterns, verse/chorus structure):
     - Proceed to lyrics formatting
   - **If transcript is conversational/tutorial** (no obvious song structure):
     - Extract themes and concepts
     - Ask user: "This appears to be [type of content]. Should I use these themes to create song lyrics, or treat it differently?"

4. **Handle long transcripts** (>1250 chars):
   - Apply smart compression (see Section 2)
   - Notify user: "Transcript is X characters, compressed to Y characters for Suno limits"

### 1.2 Audio File Processing (Optional)

When user provides audio file (.mp3, .wav, .m4a, etc.):

**Tiered Approach**:

**Tier 1 - Metadata Only** (no extra dependencies):
```bash
# Extract basic info using ffprobe
ffprobe -v quiet -print_format json -show_format "$AUDIO_FILE"
# Gets: duration, bitrate, format
```

**Tier 2 - Simple Analysis** (optional, requires pydub):
```python
# Only if user wants energy/tempo estimates
from pydub import AudioSegment
import numpy as np

audio = AudioSegment.from_file(audio_path)
rms_energy = audio.rms  # Loudness

# Rough energy classification
if rms_energy > threshold_high:
    energy = "High Energy"
elif rms_energy > threshold_medium:
    energy = "Medium Energy"
else:
    energy = "Low Energy"
```

**Tier 3 - Advanced** (opt-in only, requires librosa):
- Only offer if user explicitly wants genre detection
- Show warning: "This requires installing librosa (~200MB). Continue? (y/n)"
- If analysis fails, fall back to asking user

**Fallback Strategy**:
```
If any analysis fails → Ask user directly:
"What genre/mood/style is this audio?"
```

### 1.3 Text/Lyrics Input

When user provides raw lyrics or text:

**Detection Steps**:

1. **Check for existing metatags**:
   - If `[Intro]`, `[Verse]`, `[Chorus]` etc. present → parse structure
   - Validate metatag syntax and placement

2. **Detect structure from patterns**:
   ```python
   # Look for repeated sections (likely chorus)
   # Count line patterns
   # Identify verse-like sections (unique, longer)
   ```

3. **If unstructured**:
   - Treat as concepts/themes
   - Match to appropriate genre template
   - Show user: "I'm treating this as [genre] based on the themes. Adjust?"

### 1.4 Conversational Input

When user provides vague idea ("create a sad piano song"):

**Process**:

1. **Immediate template matching**:
   - Analyze keywords (sad, piano, slow, etc.)
   - Select closest matching template
   - Show template selection: "I'm using our 'Piano Ballad Melancholic' template"

2. **Generate immediately** (don't ask many questions):
   - Create 3 variations from template
   - Show previews within 10 seconds

3. **Refine after seeing results**:
   - User can then say "make it slower" or "add strings"
   - Adjust and regenerate

**Question Limits**:
- Maximum 3 questions before first generation
- Only ask if absolutely necessary:
  - Genre (if not obvious)
  - Mood (if ambiguous for genre)
  - Vocals vs. Instrumental (if unclear)
- Never ask about specific instruments, structures, parameters before first output

---

## STEP 2: CHARACTER LIMIT COMPLIANCE

### V5 Character Limits

```yaml
v5_maximums:
  lyrics: 5000 characters (generous limit)
  style: 1000 characters (generous limit)
  title: 100 characters

v5_recommended_optimal:
  lyrics: 2000-3500 characters (best audio quality)
  style: 100-300 characters (concise is better)
  title: 30-60 characters

principle: "Brevity produces better results despite generous limits"
```

**Quality-Focused Targets**:
- Lyrics optimal: 2500 characters (balance of detail and clarity)
- Style optimal: 150 characters (clear without over-specification)
- Safety margins: 100 chars buffer for lyrics, 50 for style

### Smart Compression Algorithm (V5)

**When to Compress**:
- **Mandatory**: Input > 5000 chars (hard limit violation)
- **Recommended**: Input > 3500 chars (quality optimization)
- **Optional**: Input 2500-3500 chars (offer to user)
- **Unnecessary**: Input < 2500 chars (already optimal)

**Priority Order** (what to keep):
1. **All Choruses** (most important - repetition, catchiness)
2. **Verses 1 & 2** (narrative, essential storytelling)
3. **Bridges** (can compress while keeping essence)
4. **Additional Verses** (3+) - compress or remove
5. **Intro/Outro** (simplify or remove descriptions)

**Compression Techniques**:

```yaml
verbose_metatags:
  before: "[Short Instrumental Intro with ambient pads and soft piano]"
  after: "[Intro]"
  savings: ~45 characters

redundant_content:
  before: "5 verses saying similar things"
  after: "2-3 strongest verses"
  savings: ~500-1000 characters

wordy_lyrics:
  before: "I am currently feeling so incredibly sad about the situation"
  after: "This situation breaks my heart"
  savings: ~25 chars, better impact

instrumental_descriptions:
  before: "[Melodic Instrumental section featuring guitar and strings with emotional depth]"
  after: "[melodic interlude]"
  savings: ~60 characters
```

**Example Compression**:
```
Input: 4200 characters (over optimal range)
Target: 2800 characters (optimal quality range)
After compression: 2800 characters
Method: 3 verses → 2 verses, simplified metatags, condensed bridge
Quality impact: Improved (tighter, more focused, cleaner audio)
```

---

---

## STEP 3: V5-ENHANCED FEATURES

### V5 Improvements to Leverage

```yaml
prompt_adherence: 90% success rate (up from ~75% in V4.5)

metatag_reliability: 10-15% improvement across all tags

emotion_parsing: NEW tags work excellently
  - haunting (85% reliability)
  - joyful (85%)
  - somber (85%)
  - ethereal (80%)
  - bittersweet (75%)
  - triumphant (85%)

vocal_quality: Near-human
  - Natural breaths and pauses
  - Better pronunciation
  - Authentic phrasing
  - Tighter mix integration

genre_fusion: Stable 2-genre combinations
  - Pop + EDM (95% success)
  - Gospel + Trap (90%)
  - Jazz + Hip Hop (90%)

studio_features:
  - Replace Section (fix parts without full regeneration)
  - Extend (less drift than V4.5)
  - Remaster (subtle/normal/high)
  - Stem export (2-12 stems)
  - MIDI export
```

### Optimal Lyric Structure for V5

```yaml
syllables_per_line: 6-12 (V5 vocal engine optimized for this)

example_good:
  "Walking down the memory lane" (8 syllables)
  "Sunshine fades to gentle rain" (8 syllables)
  "Every moment feels so far away" (10 syllables)

example_avoid:
  "Lost" (1 syllable - too short)
  "I am currently in the process of contemplating" (14 syllables - too long)

consistency_matters: Match syllable counts within sections for natural flow
```

---

## STEP 4: TEMPLATE MATCHING

### Template-Based Generation

**Core Templates** (25+ available in assets/templates/):

```yaml
acoustic:
  - indie_folk_melancholic
  - folk_ballad_storytelling
  - acoustic_pop_uplifting

electronic:
  - edm_energetic_drop
  - synthwave_retro_nostalgic
  - ambient_atmospheric_calm

hip_hop:
  - hip_hop_storytelling
  - trap_aggressive_energy
  - lo_fi_hip_hop_chill

rock:
  - indie_rock_anthemic
  - alternative_rock_emotional
  - soft_rock_ballad

pop:
  - pop_uplifting_catchy
  - synth_pop_80s
  - pop_ballad_emotional

jazz_soul:
  - jazz_smooth_sophisticated
  - neo_soul_groovy
  - jazz_hop_fusion

orchestral:
  - orchestral_epic_cinematic
  - classical_piano_peaceful
  - chamber_music_intimate

fusion:
  - gospel_trap_triumphant
  - jazz_electronic_fusion
  - rock_orchestral_hybrid
```

**Template Selection**:
1. Analyze input keywords, themes, mood
2. Match to closest template (cosine similarity or keyword matching)
3. Show user: "Using [Template Name] as foundation"
4. Allow user to change template if desired

**Template Structure**:
- Optimized style field (≤115 chars)
- Proven metatag sequence (Tier 1 reliability)
- Character budget breakdown
- Common pitfalls to avoid

---

## STEP 5: METATAG RELIABILITY SYSTEM (V5 ENHANCED)

### 3-Tier Reliability Matrix for V5

**V5 Improvement**: 10-15% better metatag reliability vs V4.5

#### Tier 1 - RELIABLE (Use Confidently)

```yaml
proven_structure_tags:
  - [Verse] (90% reliability, +10% vs V4.5)
  - [Chorus] (95% reliability, +10% vs V4.5)
  - [Bridge] (85% reliability, +10% vs V4.5)

proven_alternatives:
  - [Short Instrumental Intro] (90% reliability)
  - [Catchy Hook] (90% reliability)
  - [melodic interlude] (85% reliability, lowercase works)
  - [Big Finish] (85% reliability, better than [Outro])
```

#### Tier 2 - MODERATE (Use with Caution)

```yaml
improved_in_v5:
  - [Pre-Chorus] (70% reliability, +5% vs V4.5)
  - [Post-Chorus] (65% reliability, +5%)
  - [Instrumental] (75% reliability, +5%)
  - [Mood: Uplifting] (75% reliability, +15%)
  - [Energy: High] (70% reliability, +10%)

v5_new_emotion_tags (HIGH effectiveness):
  - [Mood: haunting] (85% reliability)
  - [Mood: joyful] (85%)
  - [Mood: somber] (85%)
  - [Mood: ethereal] (80%)
  - [Mood: bittersweet] (75%)
  - [Mood: triumphant] (85%)
```

#### Tier 3 - UNRELIABLE (Warn User)

```yaml
still_problematic_in_v5:
  - [Intro] (40% reliability - slight improvement, still use [Short Instrumental Intro])
  - [Fade Out] (40% reliability)
  - [Outro] (45% reliability - use [Big Finish] instead)

v5_note: "Even with improvements, these tags remain unreliable"
```

**V5 Warning Message**:
```
⚠️ V5 has improved metatag reliability to ~90% for core tags, but AI
may still interpret structure creatively. If not followed:
1. Use Studio's Replace Section feature (V5 advantage!)
2. Regenerate with simpler Tier 1 tags only
3. Simplify structure (fewer sections)
4. Accept and work with AI's interpretation
```

---

## STEP 6: STYLE FIELD OPTIMIZATION (V5)

### Rules for V5's 1000-Character Limit

**V5 Reality**: 1000 chars allowed, but **100-300 chars produces best results**

**Optimal Format**:
```
[Primary Genre], [Secondary Genre/Mood], [Tempo/Energy], [Instrument 1-3], [Vocal Style], [Optional: BPM]
```

**Examples by Length**:

```yaml
minimal (50-80 chars): Works great for simple songs
  - "Pop, Uplifting, Female Vocals, Guitar"  (43 chars)
  - "Indie Folk, Melancholic, Acoustic, Male"  (44 chars)

optimal (80-150 chars): RECOMMENDED for most songs
  - "Indie Pop, Electronic, Uplifting, Bittersweet, Female Vocals, Synth Pads, Acoustic Guitar, 115 BPM"  (100 chars)
  - "Jazz Hip Hop, Smooth, Introspective, Saxophone, 808 Bass, Spoken Word Male"  (77 chars)

detailed (150-300 chars): For complex fusions
  - "Gospel Trap, Triumphant, High Energy, Choir Harmonies, 808 Bass, Violin Strings, Female Lead with Choir Background, 115 BPM, Clear Mix, Vocal Focus"  (154 chars)

excessive (300+ chars): AVOID - causes artifacts
  - Problem: Too many specifications confuse AI
  - Result: Muddy mix, conflicting elements
  - V5 improvement: Better than V4.5 but still problematic
```

**V5 Optimization Rules**:
- **3-5 tags optimal** (despite 1000 char limit, more ≠ better)
- **Most important tag first** (V5 weighs first tag 60% influence)
- **2-genre fusion max** (V5 handles well, 3+ dilutes)
- **No filler words**: Remove "and", "with", "featuring"
- **Comma-separated**: Clean format
- **Avoid conflicts**: Check incompatible combinations

**Tag Conflicts to Avoid**:
```yaml
incompatible_pairs:
  - "Very Slow" + "High Energy"
  - "Minimal" + "Orchestral"
  - "Acoustic" + "Heavy Electronic"
  - "Calm" + "Aggressive"
  - "Lo-fi" + "Crystal Clear Production"
```

---

## STEP 7: VARIATION GENERATION (V5 OPTIMIZED)

### 3 Differentiated Variations

Generate simultaneously to leverage V5's improved reliability:

#### Variation 1: Conservative (Safe, Proven)

```yaml
goal: "Maximum predictability, V5's highest success rate"
style_tags: 3-4 core genre tags only
style_length: 50-80 characters
metatags: ONLY Tier 1 reliable tags
structure: Standard template (no deviations)
lyrics_length: 1500-2500 chars (optimal quality range)
v5_success_rate: ~98% (V5's reliability boost)
user_type: "I want something that definitely works first time"
```

**Example**:
```
Style: "Piano Ballad, Melancholic, Male Vocal"  (42 chars)
Lyrics: ~2000 chars with simple structure
Structure: [Short Instrumental Intro] → [Verse] → [Chorus] → [Verse] → [Chorus] → [Big Finish]
```

#### Variation 2: Balanced (Recommended)

```yaml
goal: "Optimal quality-creativity balance, leverages V5 improvements"
style_tags: 4-5 tags + 1 fusion element + V5 emotion tag
style_length: 100-200 characters
metatags: Tier 1 + V5-enhanced emotion tags + selective Tier 2
structure: Standard + 1-2 unique elements
lyrics_length: 2000-3500 chars (V5 sweet spot)
v5_success_rate: ~92% (improved from 85% in V4.5)
user_type: "I want professional quality with personality"
```

**Example**:
```
Style: "Indie Pop, Electronic, Uplifting, Bittersweet, Female Vocals, Synth Pads, Acoustic Guitar, 115 BPM, Clear Mix"  (118 chars)
Lyrics: ~2500 chars with nuanced structure
Structure: [Short Intro] → [Verse] → [Pre-Chorus] → [Chorus] [triumphant] → [Verse] → [Bridge] [ethereal] → [Chorus] → [Big Finish]
V5 Feature: Inline mood tags ([Chorus] [triumphant]) work 70% of time
```

#### Variation 3: Experimental (Creative, V5 Fusion Power)

```yaml
goal: "Creative exploration, leverages V5 fusion stability"
style_tags: 5-7 tags + unexpected 2-genre fusion + V5 emotion tags
style_length: 150-300 characters
metatags: Tier 1 + Tier 2 + V5 inline style hints
structure: Non-standard, progressive arrangement
lyrics_length: 3000-4500 chars (V5 handles complexity better)
v5_success_rate: ~80% (up from 60% in V4.5)
user_type: "I want something unique that pushes boundaries"
```

**Example**:
```
Style: "Gospel Trap, Triumphant, Bittersweet, 808 Bass, Choir Harmonies, Violin Strings, Female Lead, Chopped Vocals, 115 BPM, Vocal Focus, Ethereal Atmosphere"  (161 chars)
Lyrics: ~3500 chars with complex structure
Structure: [Atmospheric Intro] → [Verse] [intimate, minimal] → [Catchy Hook] → [Verse] [building energy] → [Bridge] [remove drums, choir only] → [Final Chorus] [maximum intensity] → [Big Finish]
V5 Features: Inline style hints, complex fusion, extended length
```

---

## STEP 8: OUTPUT GENERATION (V5 FORMAT)

### Copy-Paste Ready Format (V5)

**Standard V5 Output Template**:

```markdown
# Suno V5 Prompt - [Song Title]

## ✅ RECOMMENDED (Variation 2 - Balanced)

### Copy this into suno.com/create:

**Model:** V5 (chirp-crow)

**Title:**
[Song Title Here]  (X/100 chars)

**Style of Music:**
[Optimized style field, 100-200 chars optimal]  (X/1000 chars)

**Lyrics:**
[Formatted lyrics with V5-optimized metatags, 2000-3500 chars optimal]  (X/5000 chars)

**Custom Mode:** ✓ ON

---

### Quality Assessment (V5)

- **Quality Score:** 9.2/10
- **V5 Success Probability:** 92% (first generation)
- **Reliability:** HIGH (Tier 1 tags + V5 emotion tags)
- **Character Optimization:** Style: 118/1000 (optimal) | Lyrics: 2,347/5000 (optimal)
- **Expected Outcome:** Professional, natural vocals, balanced creativity

### What to Expect with V5

✓ Highly reliable metatag following (~90% core tags)
✓ Natural vocal delivery with proper breaths/phrasing
✓ Clean mix with clear instrument separation
✓ If structure varies slightly, use Studio's Replace Section
⚠️ V5 may interpret creatively - regenerate if needed

</details>

---

## V5 Studio Integration & Troubleshooting

**V5 Advantages - Use These Features:**

1. **Replace Section** (10 credits):
   - Fix specific section without regenerating whole song
   - Add prompt: "Make this section more energetic"
   - Smooth crossfades automatically

2. **Extend** (10 credits):
   - Song ended early? Extend with better consistency than V4.5
   - Less drift, maintains voice/style

3. **Remaster** (10 credits):
   - Subtle: Minor cleanup (recommended first try)
   - Normal: Balanced polish
   - High: Significant change (experimental)

**If Results Don't Match Vision:**

1. **Structure ignored?** → Use Studio's Replace Section (V5 advantage!) or Variation 1
2. **Vocals buried?** → Remaster (Normal), or add "Vocal Focus, Clear Mix"
3. **Song ends early?** → Use Extend feature (improved in V5)
4. **Section needs fixing?** → Replace Section instead of full regeneration
5. **Too weird?** → Try Variation 1 or reduce weirdness parameter
6. **Not creative enough?** → Try Variation 3 with higher weirdness (0.6-0.7)

**V5-Specific Issues & Fixes:**

- **Lyric hallucination** (rare in V5):
  - V5 improvement: Better lyric adherence
  - If occurs: Use Replace Section feature for that part

- **Vocals can't be heard** (less common in V5):
  - V5's better mix, but still possible with heavy instrumentation
  - Fix: Remaster (Normal) often solves this automatically

- **Generic auto-lyrics** (still an issue):
  - V5 auto-lyrics unchanged from V4.5
  - Solution: Always provide custom lyrics

- **Early cutoff** (occasional V5 issue):
  - Symptom: Song ends at 2:30 instead of expected 3:30
  - Fix: Use Extend feature (works much better in V5)

## ADVANCED FEATURES

### Refinement Loop

After user sees first output:

**Process**:
1. Show all 3 variations
2. User selects one and suggests changes
3. Adjust specific elements:
   - "Make it slower" → adjust tempo tags
   - "Add strings" → add to style field (check char limit)
   - "Remove bridge" → restructure lyrics
4. Regenerate updated variations
5. Repeat max 3 times (then suggest starting fresh)

**Exit Conditions**:
- User says "looks good" or "finalize"
- User explicitly requests to "start over"
- 3 refinement cycles completed

### Playlist/Album Mode (Future Enhancement)

If user requests multiple songs:

**Process**:
1. Define overarching theme and mood arc
2. Ensure consistency (same core style, voice)
3. Add variation for interest (different tempos, structures)
4. Generate all prompts at once

---

## DEPENDENCIES (V5 COMPATIBLE)

### Installation Tiers

**Tier 0 - Always Required** (lightweight, V5 text-based):
```bash
pip install pyyaml requests
# <30 seconds, works for text-based V5 prompt generation
# Sufficient for 80% of use cases
```

**Tier 1 - YouTube Features** (optional):
```bash
brew install yt-dlp  # macOS
# or
pip3 install yt-dlp  # Universal

## V5 BEST PRACTICES

### Suno V5-Specific Wisdom

**From V5 Community Testing & Official Guidance**:

1. **Brevity Wins (Despite Generous Limits)**:
   - Style 100-300 chars → cleanest audio (despite 1000 limit)
   - Lyrics 2000-3500 chars → optimal quality (despite 5000 limit)
   - "Very short prompts create cleanest audio quality" - Community consensus

2. **First Tag = 60% Influence**:
   - V5 weighs first tag most heavily in style field
   - Put most important genre/descriptor first
   - Position 2: 25% influence, Position 3: 10%, Position 4+: 5%

3. **V5 Metatag Improvements**:
   - `[Verse]`, `[Chorus]`, `[Bridge]` now 90-95% reliable
   - `[Short Instrumental Intro]` still more reliable than `[Intro]` (40%)
   - `[Big Finish]` still better than `[Outro]` (45%)
   - NEW: Inline style hints work 70%: `[Verse] [intimate, minimal]`

4. **Syllable Consistency** (V5 Vocal Engine):
   - 6-12 syllables per line optimal
   - Match counts within sections (all verses similar, all choruses similar)
   - Vary between verse/chorus for distinction

5. **V5 Studio Workflow**:
   - Generate → Review in Timeline → Replace Section (fix parts) → Extend (if short) → Remaster (polish)
   - Non-destructive: Original always preserved
   - Cost-effective: Fix sections (10 credits) vs full regeneration (10 credits)

6. **2-Genre Fusion Sweet Spot**:
   - V5 excels at 2-genre combinations (95% success for proven pairs)
   - 3+ genres dilute identity (~60% success)
   - Proven: Pop+EDM, Gospel+Trap, Jazz+Hip Hop, Rock+Orchestral

7. **V5 Emotion Tags**:
   - Use new V5-enhanced emotions: haunting, joyful, somber, ethereal, bittersweet, triumphant
   - 85% reliability (much better than generic mood tags)

8. **Regeneration Still Normal**:
   - V5 success rate: ~90% (up from ~75%)
   - 10% still need retry - this is expected
   - Use Studio features to fix instead of full regeneration

## SKILL PHILOSOPHY (V5)

**Core Principles**:

1. **Template-Based Reliability**: Start with V5-optimized proven patterns, customize from there
2. **Quality Over Quantity**: Use limits wisely (5000/1000), but stay concise (2500/150) for best audio
3. **Generate-First**: Show options immediately, refine iteratively (not question-heavy)
4. **Leverage V5 Strengths**: 90% prompt adherence, emotion tags, Studio features
5. **User Empowerment**: Provide 3 variations (conservative/balanced/experimental)
6. **Non-Destructive Refinement**: Use V5 Studio features (Replace Section, Extend, Remaster)

**V5 Success Metrics**:
- 90%+ prompts work first generation (V5 reliability)
- Character optimization (not just limits): 2500 lyrics, 150 style targets
- Studio-assisted perfection: 98%+ final satisfaction with Replace Section capability

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### Installation Issues

**yt-dlp not found**:
```bash
# macOS with Homebrew
brew install yt-dlp

# Linux apt
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y yt-dlp

# Universal pip
pip3 install yt-dlp
```

**Audio libraries fail**:
- Fallback to text-only mode (still fully functional)
- Prompt user with genre/style questions instead
- Skill works perfectly without audio analysis

### Usage Issues

**Character limit exceeded**:
- Should never happen (validation prevents this)
- If it does: Report as bug, compression algorithm needs adjustment

**Structure not followed by Suno**:
- Normal AI behavior
- Try Variation 1 (simpler tags)
- Regenerate 2-3 times
- Accept AI interpretation (sometimes it's better!)

**Can't hear vocals**:
- Common issue with dense instrumentals
- Add "Vocal Focus" or "Clear Mix" to style
- Remove heavy instruments from style field
- Regenerate
