description: Claude Code adapter for the shared agent-presence protocol (for Codex CLI use `.agent/skills/dispatch-watcher/SKILL.md`, for Gemini CLI use `.agent/skills/dispatch-watcher-gemini/SKILL.md`). Use on Claude session start to run pre-flight, claim Slack-dispatched issues (@claude #N), and emit lifecycle events. Triggers: Claude session start, /dispatch, /agent-presence, message addressed to @claude in the dispatch channel. Use when this capability is needed.

# Dispatch Watcher Skill — Claude Code Adapter

This is the **Claude Code-specific** adapter for the shared `agent-presence`
protocol. All shared logic (pre-flight, claim, lease, roster, takeover,
presence event format) lives in `.agent/skills/agent-presence/SKILL.md` and
`scripts/agent-presence-helpers.sh` — this file only contains Claude-specific
glue.

When this Claude Code session starts (or when explicitly triggered by
`@claude #<num>` in `<DISPATCH_CHANNEL>`), follow the workflow below.

## Contract

- **Input:** environment variables `AGENT_ID` (must start with `claude-`),
  `GH_TOKEN_CLAUDE_BOT`, `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`, `ROSTER_MESSAGE_TS`,
  `ROSTER_CHANNEL_ID`, `REPO`. Slack MCP (`mcp__claude_ai_Slack__*`)
  available.
- **Output:** if a `@claude` dispatch is pending, claim and execute it;
  otherwise return idle. `start` is emitted only AFTER pre-flight passes
  (NOT on session boot — pre-flight uses tool calls itself, so emitting
  `start` first would create a circular requirement). After the shared
  helpers are sourced, `end` is emitted on session close via trap, with
  reason set in the `EXIT_REASON` shell variable (e.g., `declined`,
  `idle`, `error`, `task-done`).
- **Side effects:** posts comments on GitHub issues, opens branches/PRs,
  posts presence events in `<DISPATCH_CHANNEL>`.
- **Scope:** handle `@claude <num>` / `@claude #<num>` for issue
  implementation only. Ad-hoc `@claude <free-form>` messages and
  `@claude review #<PR>` (review dispatch) are explicitly OUT of scope
  for this adapter — the implementation workflow below assumes a GitHub
  issue, not a PR.

## Preconditions

1. `AGENT_ID` is set AND starts with `claude-`:

   ```bash
   if [ -z "${AGENT_ID:-}" ]; then
     echo "Set AGENT_ID, e.g. claude-${HOSTNAME}-wsl-1" >&2
     exit 1
   fi

   case "$AGENT_ID" in
     claude-*) ;;
     *)
       echo "AGENT_ID '$AGENT_ID' is not a claude-* identity; this adapter is Claude-only" >&2
       echo "Use the matching adapter for your model or fix AGENT_ID." >&2
       exit 1
       ;;
   esac
   ```

   `AGENT_ID` is otherwise treated as an opaque registry key beyond the
   model prefix.

2. `GH_TOKEN_CLAUDE_BOT` is set and works:

   ```bash
   if [ -z "${GH_TOKEN_CLAUDE_BOT:-}" ]; then
     echo "Set GH_TOKEN_CLAUDE_BOT before running the Claude adapter." >&2
     exit 1
   fi

   GH_TOKEN="$GH_TOKEN_CLAUDE_BOT" gh auth status
   ```

3. Slack MCP is reachable. The required channel is `<DISPATCH_CHANNEL>`
   (channel ID in `ROSTER_CHANNEL_ID` env). The pinned roster message TS
   is in `ROSTER_MESSAGE_TS`.

4. The shared protocol skill and helpers script are present and sourceable.
   Helpers expect `GH_TOKEN_BOT` (model-agnostic name) and `REPO`; the
   Claude adapter resolves `GH_TOKEN_BOT` from `GH_TOKEN_CLAUDE_BOT` and
   exports both before sourcing (a one-shot prefix assignment like
   `GH_TOKEN_BOT=... source ...` would only set the var for the `source`
   builtin itself, not for later function calls):

   ```bash
   if [ ! -f .agent/skills/agent-presence/SKILL.md ] || [ ! -f scripts/agent-presence-helpers.sh ]; then
     echo "Missing shared agent-presence dependencies (.agent/skills/agent-presence/SKILL.md or scripts/agent-presence-helpers.sh)" >&2
     exit 1
   fi

   export GH_TOKEN_BOT="$GH_TOKEN_CLAUDE_BOT"
   export REPO="<OWNER>/<REPO>"
   source scripts/agent-presence-helpers.sh
   ```

## Workflow

### 0. Wire shutdown wrapper

After preconditions pass and `scripts/agent-presence-helpers.sh` is sourced,
wire the trap-based shutdown wrapper before pre-flight or dispatch work so
an `end` event is emitted on every clean runtime exit path. Use an
`EXIT_REASON` shell variable the workflow updates throughout, so the trap
message is meaningful:

```bash
EXIT_REASON="boot-incomplete"  # default — overwritten as workflow progresses

emit_presence_end_once() {
  local reason="${EXIT_REASON}"
  trap - EXIT INT TERM HUP
  emit_presence end "${reason}" || true
}

trap 'emit_presence_end_once' EXIT
trap 'EXIT_REASON="interrupted (${EXIT_REASON})"; emit_presence_end_once; exit 130' INT
trap 'EXIT_REASON="terminated (${EXIT_REASON})"; emit_presence_end_once; exit 143' TERM
trap 'EXIT_REASON="hangup (${EXIT_REASON})"; emit_presence_end_once; exit 129' HUP
```

(MUST NOT use `exec` for any subsequent command — that would replace the
shell and prevent the trap from firing.)

### 1. Pre-flight check (mandatory)

```bash
if ! pre_flight_check; then
    EXIT_REASON="declined (pre-flight conflict)"
    echo "Pre-flight detected conflicts; aborting before claiming." >&2
    # Pre-flight already wrote details to stderr. Operator decides next move.
    # Note: NO `start` event was emitted — pre-flight uses tool calls itself,
    # so emitting `start` first would create a circular requirement. The trap
    # below emits `end (declined ...)` so the operator still sees a lifecycle
    # event.
    exit 0  # NOT 1 — this is intentional refusal, not an error
fi
```

Pre-flight covers:
1. Local git state check (no uncommitted changes from peer agents)
2. Read pinned roster (cache layer)
3. Cross-ref GitHub SSOT (in-flight issues, open PRs, claim comments with `lease_until > now`)
4. Reconcile + flag conflicts (legacy Phase 1 markers also detected via synthetic lease = created_at + 4h)
5. Worktree ownership advisory (if uncommitted changes exist that look like another agent's work, warn — operator should `git worktree add` for parallel work)

### 2. Emit `start` presence event

`start` is emitted AFTER pre-flight passes (not on session boot). Top-level
message in dispatch channel:

```bash
emit_presence start
EXIT_REASON="post-start"  # workflow proceeded past start
```

### 3. Read dispatch channel for `@claude` mentions

Use Claude's Slack MCP (NOT the shell helpers' read functions) so the
session has direct access to message content:

```
Tool: mcp__claude_ai_Slack__slack_read_channel
  channel_id: ${ROSTER_CHANNEL_ID}
  limit: 50
```

Filter messages matching the POSIX ERE pattern
`(^|[[:space:]])@claude[[:space:],:]+#?([0-9]+)([[:space:]]|$)` (the leading
`(^|[[:space:]])` anchor stops substring matches like `some-agent@claude5`;
the separator class catches `@claude:`, `@claude,`, plus whitespace; the
trailing boundary stops the digit run from absorbing unrelated trailing text).
The issue number is capture group 2. Skip messages older than 1h to
avoid replaying stale dispatches. Scope is implementation only —
`@claude review #<PR>` patterns are NOT actionable in this adapter and
should be skipped silently.

### 4. For each actionable dispatch

Call the shared claim algorithm via helpers:

```bash
ISSUE_NUM=<extracted from regex>

# Default task type is 'quick' (30 min lease). For known long-running
# patterns (merge supervisor, content batch), declare 'standard' or 'long'
# upfront based on the issue body's "Acceptance Criteria" or "Estimate"
# section.
TASK_TYPE=quick  # or standard|long based on issue inspection

if claim_issue "$ISSUE_NUM" "$TASK_TYPE"; then
    # Won the race — proceed to execute
    # claim_issue already emitted `busy` and updated roster
    :
else
    # Lost the race or eventual-consistency failed — claim_issue handled cleanup
    continue  # try next dispatch in the loop
fi
```

### 5. Execute the task

Use the standard Claude Code task workflow per `CLAUDE.md`:

1. Read the issue body via `gh issue view`
2. Branch: `git checkout -b fix/issue-<num>-<slug>` or `feature/issue-<num>-<slug>`
3. Implement the change using Claude's Edit/Write tools
4. Verify locally per the project's `Verification After Changes` checklist
   (typecheck, lint, build, tests as applicable)
5. Commit on the feature branch with a descriptive message
6. Open PR with body `Closes #${ISSUE_NUM}` and capture the number:

   ```bash
   PR_URL=$(gh pr create --fill --body "Closes #${ISSUE_NUM}")
   PR_NUM=$(gh pr view "$PR_URL" --json number --jq '.number')
   ```

### 6. Renew lease during long execution

If the task is taking longer than `TTL/2` (15 min for `quick`, 1 h for
`standard`, 2 h for `long`), renew the lease BEFORE expiration:

```bash
renew_lease "$ISSUE_NUM"  # uses original TTL by default
```

Skip renewal once the PR is opened — the PR's commit activity itself
proves liveness, and the takeover gate's "no GH activity" condition will
fail safely for any peer agent.

### 7. Report completion

After the PR is opened (or task is blocked), update `EXIT_REASON` so the
trap-fired `end` event later carries useful context:

```bash
# Success path
emit_presence ready "PR #${PR_NUM} done"
update_roster_chat_update --event ready --clear-task
EXIT_REASON="task-done (PR #${PR_NUM})"

# Block path
emit_presence ready "blocked #${ISSUE_NUM}: <one-sentence reason>"
update_roster_chat_update --event ready --stale-reason "blocked #${ISSUE_NUM}"
# Also leave a :warning: thread reply on the original dispatch message
# (use mcp__claude_ai_Slack__slack_send_message with thread_ts)
```

`emit_presence` only posts the Slack presence message — it does **not**
touch the pinned roster. Call `update_roster_chat_update` explicitly (as
above) so the roster entry reflects the new state and the operator sees the
agent is back to idle.

### 8. Idle exit

When the dispatch loop has no more actionable items, set the exit reason
and exit cleanly. The trap fires the `end` event with the right context:

```bash
EXIT_REASON="idle (no actionable dispatches)"
exit 0
```

## Slack MCP wiring (Claude-specific)

For CHANNEL READ + THREAD POST use Claude's Slack MCP tools directly:

| Action | MCP tool |
|---|---|
| Read 50 dispatch messages | `mcp__claude_ai_Slack__slack_read_channel` |
| Read a thread for context | `mcp__claude_ai_Slack__slack_read_thread` |
| Post a thread reply (`:eyes:`, `:warning:`) | `mcp__claude_ai_Slack__slack_send_message` with `thread_ts` |
| Post a top-level message | helpers' `emit_presence` (uses curl + xoxb token) |
| Update pinned roster | helpers' `update_roster_chat_update` (uses curl + chat.update) |

Why split between MCP and curl? The MCP tools work great for content
reads/replies but are not available in the helpers shell library. The
helpers use raw Slack Web API via curl for atomic operations
(`emit_presence`, `chat.update`) so any CLI can call them. Claude can use
either path for top-level posts; preferring helpers keeps the codebase
DRY.

## Required env summary

```bash
# Identity (per-machine)
export AGENT_ID="claude-${HOSTNAME}-wsl-1"  # or your environment slug

# Bot tokens (per-machine .envrc / .env.local — never committed)
export GH_TOKEN_CLAUDE_BOT="ghp_..."
export SLACK_BOT_TOKEN="xoxb-..."

# Repository (matches .agent/context/project-ids.md)
export REPO="<OWNER>/<REPO>"

# Roster pinned message (set up once per project; see project-ids.md)
export ROSTER_MESSAGE_TS="<ROSTER_MESSAGE_TS>"
export ROSTER_CHANNEL_ID="<DISPATCH_CHANNEL_ID>"

# Helpers expect a model-agnostic name
export GH_TOKEN_BOT="$GH_TOKEN_CLAUDE_BOT"

# Source helpers (REPO must already be exported)
if [ ! -f .agent/skills/agent-presence/SKILL.md ] || [ ! -f scripts/agent-presence-helpers.sh ]; then
  echo "Missing shared agent-presence dependencies (.agent/skills/agent-presence/SKILL.md or scripts/agent-presence-helpers.sh)" >&2
  exit 1
fi
source scripts/agent-presence-helpers.sh
```

## Out of scope

- **Auto-dispatch by PM** — separate spec
- **Polling loop after first task done** — Claude session exits after one
  dispatch cycle for now; the operator restarts when needed
- **Cost optimization** (idle exit at 30 min, polling backoff)
- **Cross-project dispatch** (`@claude other-repo#123`)
- **Slack DM dispatch** — channel only

## Shared protocol references

- `.agent/skills/agent-presence/SKILL.md` — shared protocol contract
- `scripts/agent-presence-helpers.sh` — shared shell library
- `.agent/skills/dispatch-watcher/SKILL.md` — Codex adapter (parallel to
  this one, same shape)
- `.agent/skills/dispatch-watcher-gemini/SKILL.md` — Gemini adapter

## Stop conditions (per shared agent-presence skill)

Stop and ask the human or PM agent when:

- Two active agents are editing the same non-generated file set
- A lease is expired but there is fresh PR/branch/commit activity
- The task requires overwriting uncommitted changes you did not make
- The roster and GitHub disagree in a way that changes ownership
- Secrets, tokens, or private Slack/GitHub identities would need to be exposed

If pre-flight detects any of these, exit cleanly (trap emits `end`) and
let the operator decide.
